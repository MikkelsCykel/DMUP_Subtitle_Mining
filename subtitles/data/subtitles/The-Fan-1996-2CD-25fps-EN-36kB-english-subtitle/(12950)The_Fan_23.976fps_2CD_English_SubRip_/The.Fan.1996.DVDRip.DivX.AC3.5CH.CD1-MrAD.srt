1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,800
{y:i}Excited and anxious
{y:i}I await my dream

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,800
{y:i}To escape, applaud
{y:i}And embrace my team

3
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,700
{y:i}Opening day I always can trust

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
{y:i}It's just for this high
{y:i}That I crazily lust

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,000
{y:i}Return of our hero
{y:i}Does brighten the days

6
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,600
{y:i}Just briefly, my troubles
{y:i}Get lost in the haze

7
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,100
{y:i}The grace from the field
{y:i}Arouses the crowd

8
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,700
{y:i}Reflects on the days
{y:i}When I was quite proud

9
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,900
{y:i}I'm more entranced
{y:i}Than the average fan

10
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,900
{y:i}I used to play, you see
{y:i}And I know I still can

11
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,000
{y:i}That time I drove the ball
{y:i}With such loft

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,900
{y:i}My exit atop shoulders
{y:i}As they carried me off

13
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,600
{y:i}This pastime and I
{y:i}Just fade into one

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,600
{y:i}Expanded upon
{y:i}From father and son

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,400
{y:i}My boy is young
{y:i}And awkward for now

16
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,100
{y:i}I just need the time
{y:i}And can show him how

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,500
{y:i}I really am quite close
{y:i}Just a break away

18
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,200
{y:i}From straightening things out
{y:i}And being okay

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,700
{y:i}I can help my team
{y:i}To regain its glory

20
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,100
{y:i}With just a little twist
{y:i}To the same old story

21
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,100
{y:i}Players say now
{y:i}They play for themselves

22
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,500
{y:i}This causes a burning
{y:i}Within me that dwells

23
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,000
{y:i}The fan is the one
{y:i}Who pays for the game

24
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,300
{y:i}Which bestows all the riches
{y:i}And welcomed fame

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,800
{y:i}The players will listen
{y:i}But really don't hear

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,100
{y:i}All the while just hiding
{y:i}Behind an invisible tear

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
{y:i}I grow tired now of all this greed

28
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,600
{y:i}And chart a course to set things free

29
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,900
{y:i}We got our first caller.
{y:i}Is that Gil on the cellular?

30
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,900
Yes, sir, it sure is.

31
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,200
- What's that I hear in the background?
- That's my Giants watch.

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,900
- I'm late for work.
- Giants watch, great.

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,600
- What do you got for us, Gil?
- It's just I'm really psyched.

34
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,200
Opening day's tomorrow.
We're all psyched.

35
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,700
This is different. I've been waiting
a long time for this one.

36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,800
{y:i}- What are you waiting for?
- Bobby Rayburn. We got him.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,700
- We're going all the way this year.
- What would you bet on that?

38
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,500
- I'd bet everything I own, that's for sure.
- I like this guy. You think Rayburn's...

39
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,000
...worth the 40 mil, huh?
- .310 lifetime batting average.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,400
He's worth twice that,
three times that.

41
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,000
{y:i}I bet he'd love to hear you say that.
{y:i}Let's see if we can get him on the line.

42
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,800
- You're gonna get him on the line?
- "Yes. Hang on. Let's find Bobby."

43
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,100
When we come back, we will be
talking to Bobby Rayburn.

44
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,700
Great.

45
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
You got Bobby Rayburn
on the line yet?

46
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,400
Who the fuck does this
guy think he is?

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,200
- Three- time National League MVP?
- That allows him to fuck up my show?

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
- "Hello, I got Rayburn on the line."
- We got him!

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,000
{y:i}And go.

50
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,900
Welcome back, we're here with the
hopes and dreams of all Giants fans.

51
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,200
Ex-Brave centre fielder
and league RBI champ...

52
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,400
{y:i}... four of the last five years,
{y:i}local boy come home, Bobby Rayburn.

53
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,700
{y:i}- How you doing, Bobby?
- Hey, Jewel, how you doing?

54
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,300
Good to be talking to you.
I want to tell you, I love your show.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
- Thanks a lot.
- Bobby, this is Bernie...

56
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,000
A lot of fans are on the line
dying to talk to you.

57
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,300
But first, how does it feel
to be back in the Bay Area?

58
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm telling you, it's great. I grew up
here. The Giants are my homies.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,600
That's good to hear.
But let me ask you this:

60
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,700
{y:i}You're famous for your
{y:i}dedication to perfection.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
You're one of the
hardest-working players.

62
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,100
Don't forget "good-looking."

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,100
But come on, now. Bobby, baby...

64
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,700
...do you honestly think you are worth
40 million simoleons?

65
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,500
He's one of the best ballplayers
in the league.

66
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm glad you asked me. I don't like to
put a money value on a human being.

67
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,200
But I think I have given 100 percent
to every franchise I've played with.

68
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Attaway, Bobby!

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,900
Thank you for not answering.

70
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,900
- Better retreat.
- She's a riot.

71
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,500
What about the fans? Won't all
this money raise their expectations?

72
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,700
I hope so. I consider myself a
baseball fan first and a player second.

73
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,900
{y:i}And in the game of baseball,
{y:i}it's all about the fans.

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,700
- You tell them, Bob.
- And the Juan Primo controversy?

75
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Giants centre fielder since 1990.

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
{y:i}You come in, bump him to the left.
{y:i}Some people resent that.

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,100
- Bitch!
- I don't think Primo's one of them.

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
You know, he's a team player.

79
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
That makes him great.
I look forward to playing with him.

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,700
That's great, Bobby.
Let's get back to our callers. Gil?

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,400
- Yeah, am...? Am I on the air?
- Yes, you are, Gil.

82
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,700
Jewel, why do you
have to be so negative?

83
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,200
{y:i}Come on, I'm a sweetheart.

84
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,300
The guy's making a lot of money.
Would you turn it down?

85
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
You'd be nuts to turn them down.

86
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,700
Why be down on Rayburn
because he's not nuts?

87
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,500
You got a point. I apologize.

88
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,400
- "Hey, Bobby, are you listening to me?"
- I sure am!

89
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,900
- Thanks for backing me up, man.
- No problem. It's a pleasure.

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,200
Just remember
where you heard it first.

91
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,300
I played the game.
I know what I'm talking about.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Grew up on the Giants.

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,100
My dad moved the family here
when the Giants moved here.

94
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,100
I watched you ever since
you hit the grand slam...

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,000
...against South Bay
in the '82 city championship.

96
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,100
That's when I saw you were somebody
special, and you never let me down.

97
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,500
When the two of you come together,
Rayburn and the Giants...

98
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,500
...that's like a magical conjunction,
like the alignment of the planets.

99
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,700
You're gonna bring us all the way.
Who said it first?

100
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,300
You did, Gil! You did!

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,300
- Attaway, Bobby!
- We hope so.

102
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,400
- Bobby, let's talk about your divorce.
- Christ, look.

103
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,500
I just got to the ballpark.
I'm really sorry, but I gotta go.

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,700
- Really enjoyed talking to you.
- Anytime, Bobby. Good luckout there.

105
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,400
We will be right back.

106
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,100
- I am so surprised he hung up.
- Thank you.

107
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Giants haven't had a one- two punch
like this since Mays and McCovey.

108
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,300
Joining the list of bullshit excuses...

109
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,500
...we've had a lot of whining...

110
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,500
...about product quality from certain
members of our sales force.

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,700
Example: The lwo Jima line.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,300
Gil, do you see
any quality problems there?

113
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,000
Blade's too thin, pommel's too light,
and there's a half tang hidden in there.

114
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Maybe that's why you're not selling.

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
Sweet.

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,900
Somebody made a mistake, man.
I wear number 11.

117
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,000
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's cool. Manny, just handle it.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,500
Me? I think this knife's an asskicker.

119
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
This door, on the other hand,
comes off a foreign car.

120
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,100
Well, need I say more?

121
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,000
- Why are you guys still here?
- There's been a glitch, okay?

122
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
- I'm working on it.
- What's a "glitch"?

123
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
A detail that hasn't been worked out.
Permutation that happens in...

124
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,000
What? With my number?

125
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,500
- Yeah, with your number.
- No, no, no.

126
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,600
Manny, you know I wear number 11.

127
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,300
- Of course.
- So there shouldn't be any problem.

128
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,100
It is a problem. Primo wears 11.

129
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,100
Tickets in yet?

130
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,800
Tickets? What tickets?

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,900
- Opening day.
- You got other things to worry about.

132
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll let you in on a little secret, Gil. You
came this close to kissing pavement.

133
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,200
- How about that close?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,700
Management had you on the list.
I talked them out of it.

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,700
Don't make me regret it.

136
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,100
- Thanks, master.
- Okay, fuck it.

137
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,900
I'm not playing with number 33.
You understand?

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,500
I know. Just be cool.
Let me take care of it.

139
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
Three times 11 is 33.
You may play three- times better.

140
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,800
Thanks. I'll talk to you in a minute.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Jesus was 33 when he died.
People still talk about him.

142
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
- Give me my number.
- Think about it, seriously.

143
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,500
Should I fire him?

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,100
I should fire him, huh?
I should fire his butt.

145
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,900
Good form.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,700
Seriously. I promised those tickets
to my clients.

147
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,200
Don't make me look
like an asshole. Please.

148
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
- I do have a reputation to uphold.
- A reputa...

149
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,100
Jesus-fucking"..."

150
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Nobody cares. You're stuck in a
time warp with your head up your ass.

151
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,000
- Why, because I don't wanna sell crap?
- We are not dedicated to perfection!

152
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,100
People don't want quality.
They want cheap product.

153
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,600
When that fucks up, they want to
replace it, so that's what we give them.

154
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,100
You got till the end of the month, Gil.

155
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,100
Look...

156
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,200
...McKinley and Everest is our
biggest account. You better close on it.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,100
Bring in the fucking numbers.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
Asshole.

159
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,700
Sid, what was the missing link
on your ball club last season?

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,300
We'd have made the playoffs if Rayburn
hadn't hit that three- run shot in Atlanta.

161
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,300
Everybody said, "Why don't we
have a slugger like that?" Now we do.

162
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,800
- Bobby, a picture?
- Why don't we take one with Primo.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
- Sounds good.
- Keep smiling.

164
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Keep fucking smiling.

165
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,800
- I hope you like it in centre field.
- Yeah, I hope you like it in left.

166
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,500
No more questions.

167
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,500
2.5 million signing bonus.
Half this year and half the next. Yeah.

168
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,800
Well, well, if it isn't Jewel, my favourite
token female sports reporter.

169
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,300
- Blow me, Manny.
- I would, but you haven't had your shots.

170
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,400
There were also bonuses
based on winning the MVP...

171
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,800
I want an interview
with Rayburn, Manny.

172
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Are we talking about "the
overpaid, overrated SOB...

173
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
...with the pending divorce Rayburn?

174
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,500
- I call them as I see them.
- Well, you've been crossed off the list.

175
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,800
- I knew you'd understand.
- Deferred payments starting 2007.

176
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,500
Cut the crap. Are you saying there's
no way to get your boy to talk to me?

177
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,400
Is that what you're saying?
He's gotta talk to me.

178
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,400
I'm saying he'd rather nail his penis
to a burning building.

179
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,600
- I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her.
- Ouch.

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,600
Checkout this puppy.

181
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,800
The walk and the talk.

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,700
How's it walk? How's it talk?
This is the one.

183
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,500
Are you happy with your
current supplier?

184
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,400
Any more of these demonstrations,
I'll have to start shaving my legs.

185
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,600
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

186
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,700
The big motherfucker, the little
motherfucker. Which do you want?

187
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,100
Any more demos, I'll have to start
shaving the hairs on my ass.

188
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,400
As you can see, the performance
on this baby is really something.

189
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,900
"Knife doing business.

190
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
Come on, bring it, baby. Bring it.

191
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,900
- Jesus Christ.
- Poetry in motion, baby.

192
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,200
- Two behind home plate?
- I'm your man.

193
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,800
Two hundred dollars each.

194
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,000
- Two hundred apiece?
- Two hundred.

195
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,200
- That's a lot. How about 125?
- Fuck 125. This is opening day here.

196
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,300
- Two hundred, goddamn it. Jesus.
- Okay, okay, okay.

197
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,500
Now you want the tickets, huh?

198
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,000
Anytime I can do you more fucking
favours, you just let me know, all right?

199
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,700
You in a coma or what, buddy?
Get the fuckout of here.

200
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,200
- Know what bugs me about you guys?
- Like I care.

201
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,300
You don't even care about the game.

202
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,500
You ebony god, you prince of darkness,
you Othellian Moor, you black man!

203
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,200
You look good out there! You look
good. I bet we hit.400 this year.

204
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,200
- Come on, don't jinx me.
- I'm sorry, man. I get emotional, crazy.

205
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,400
All right, so tell me, what we got?

206
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Spalding wants you to sign their balls.
We got that Wish Upon a Star routine:

207
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,200
Sick kid wants to shake hands with
great ballplayer. You'll have to do.

208
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,900
What do you think? Maybe I should
bring a ball for the sick kid.

209
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,900
No, I think a bat would be much nicer.

210
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,900
All right, here. Give him a bat.

211
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,300
You know it's not a good time for this.

212
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,600
- What's the gentleman's name again?
- His name's Stanley. Stanley Jackson.

213
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,800
Thank you, Michelle.

214
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,600
Stanley, Gil Renard.
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
- How do you do?
- How you doing?

216
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
Here's my card.

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Are you happy
with your current supplier?

218
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,300
- I sure am.
- Well, then let me just...

219
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,200
If you could give me three minutes
of your time, I will prove to you...

220
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,900
- Can I demonstrate?
- Sure.

221
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,900
If I can just prove to you...

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,300
...we're superior in quality because
of our fit, hand-sharpening, polishing...

223
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,100
...and strength.

224
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,800
These features, combined with our
low prices, our superior terms...

225
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,200
...make us one of the most
sought-after competitors around.

226
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,700
- That's why I'd...
- We signed an exclusive with Gerber.

227
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
They got the whole chain sewed up.

228
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
We can't pass wind in a tent
without going through them.

229
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Sorry to hear that.

230
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,100
- Do you have the Little Pecker?
- Yes, I do.

231
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,100
- You really are on the cutting edge.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm sorry we can't do business.

233
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, you're sure I can't
interest you in this?

234
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,800
You got any kayaks?

235
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,100
You gotta be
out of your mind. Kayaks?

236
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
I could use kayaks.

237
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,400
Stanley, what the fuck do kayaks
have to do with knives?

238
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,300
Never mind.

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,000
You fucking asshole. Kayaks?
When I'm asking you about knives?

240
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
Yeah. I understand, sir.
Thank you for coming in.

241
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,100
How about you get some kayaks and
stick them up your fucking ass, moron.

242
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
Your stopwatch.

243
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,300
Hey, thanks a lot for coming.
Nice to meet you.

244
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Look. We got the same hairdo.

245
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,900
You sick too?

246
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,200
Hey, slugger, come on,
shake his hand.

247
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,700
How you doing, man? You hanging
in there? What's your name?

248
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000
Sean.

249
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,100
Sean?

250
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,500
Sean.

251
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,700
Wow, what a coincidence.
That's my son's name too.

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Look, I have a present for you.

253
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
There you go.

254
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,400
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

255
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Bobby Rayburn.

256
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,500
Tomorrow...

257
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,500
...hit a home run for me.

258
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,600
- Please?
- I'll try.

259
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,400
They said "sick," not "dying in front
of our eyes." How'd I know?

260
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,900
As if I don't have enough to worry
about. I get a poor kid on his deathbed.

261
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,900
- Oh, please.
- The kid was dying!

262
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,400
He has my son's name.
I mean, what kind of shit is that?

263
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,600
Lucky tie, lucky guy.

264
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,900
McKinley- Everest.

265
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,100
Okay, thank you.

266
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,900
Hi.

267
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,600
- Angie, you're looking as lovely as ever.
- He's gone.

268
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,900
- We had an appointment at 4.
- Yeah, it's 4: 11.

269
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,900
My watch is slow, I guess.
When will he be back?

270
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,300
He's gone for the day. But you
can see him tomorrow at 2:30.

271
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,200
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow"..."

272
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,400
Let's s"ee."

273
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,400
See if there's anything...

274
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I would prefer the morning.

275
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
But how about late in the day?

276
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,200
Tomorrow at 3, he's off
to Chicago for three weeks.

278
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,100
Well, that's a problem.

279
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,200
It's my son. I want to take him
to opening day.

280
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
You know, myself as a father,
I'm a real cutup.

281
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm gonna get to the point.

282
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm trying to be a hero to my son...

283
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,500
...so if he could make it any other time,
it would really, really help me.

284
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,900
Just an hour later...

285
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,700
...so I could fit the game in.

286
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,900
- Excuse me. McKinley- Everest.
- Any other time at all? Anything?

287
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,800
- Okay, thank you.
- It would be a big help to me.

288
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,400
Like, an hour later.

289
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm afraid I really can't help you.
He's got such a crazy schedule.

290
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,800
Okey- dokey.

291
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,200
Drop your cock and grab your socks.
Big day today. You excited?

292
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
Yeah, I'm up.

293
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,800
Manny, Manny, talk to me, man.
Make me happy.

294
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,600
Wish I could.
I just talked to Primo's people.

295
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,300
- They want 500 grand.
- Five hundred? For what?

296
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,400
Exactly. Exactly.
That's 250 G's a digit.

297
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,000
Man, come on!
What is this boy smoking?

298
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,100
I tried to haggle them down.
The kid says it's his lucky number.

299
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,300
Shit. Ain't that much luck in the world.
He's lucky to be in the country.

300
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,900
I hear you. Look, it's your call.

301
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,800
You want me to go back,
or are you happy with 33?

302
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,500
- Man, it's just a number, right?
- That's right.

303
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,500
I'll pick you up.
While you do her, thinkof me.

304
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
- That's a real short thought.
{y:i}- I love you too.

305
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,600
- No, you don't.
{y:i}- I'll catch you later.

306
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
Yeah.

307
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
Hey, Gil.

308
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,800
Hey, Ted.

309
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,600
Lose your job?

310
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,000
- It's my day off. And it's "Tim."
- Tim. Sorry.

311
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,700
- You remember Mike and Linda?
- Hey, Gil.

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
- Hi, Gil.
- Hi.

313
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,900
- You're late. What a surprise.
- Traffic. You know, traffic?

314
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,400
How original.

315
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,900
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing?

316
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,700
- Good.
- Ready for the game?

317
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,600
- What time will he be home?
- Depends on the game. Right, slugger?

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,100
6:05. He's not home, I call the cops.

319
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,700
I'm against this.
I wanna make that real clear to you.

320
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
- He's my kid too.
- Yeah?

321
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Give me kisses. I love you.

322
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,200
- Bye.
- For the record, so everybody knows...

323
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,900
...don't make him do things
he doesn't want to.

324
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,100
I don't. Do I make you do things
you don't want to do?

325
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,400
- No.
- Okay?

326
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,500
Six o'clock, Gil.

327
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,900
Hey, Ted.

328
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
See you.

329
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I remember when Mick recorded this,
February '78.

330
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,500
What?

331
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,600
I remember when Mick recorded this
in '78. We had a wild party afterwards.

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,500
Jason Pelligrini's dad
says Mick Jagger's gay.

333
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah? Well, Jason Pelligrini's dad
takes it up the ass.

334
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,200
- Tryouts are next week.
- Tryouts are next week?

335
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,500
Your mother didn't tell me.

336
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,500
Jason Pelligrini said his dad's
gonna pick me if I'm still available.

337
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,000
You'll make it. Positive things
happen to positive thinkers.

338
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,900
Tell me, what do you gotta do? What
are the three whats you gotta be?

339
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,300
- I don't want to do this, Dad.
- At bat, come on.

340
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,400
- Keep the bat low.
- No, keep it high, high.

341
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,200
- When you move your feet?
- Step on the eggshell...

342
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,200
...and squash the bug.
- Attaboy. That's perfect.

343
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,300
That's what Coop used to say.
I told you about what Coop said, right?

344
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,600
- Your old catcher, right?
- One of the finest athletes I ever knew.

345
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,300
Where'd you get that glove?

346
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,700
Tim gave it to me.

347
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,800
Piece of shit.

348
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,200
{y:i}Opening day at
{y:i}Candlestick Park, 1996.

349
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
What's not to love
about opening day?

350
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,600
Fathers sneaking away from work,
and kids playing hooky from school.

351
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,900
{y:i}For at least one day,
{y:i}everybody is in first place.

352
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,400
Opening day is what baseball's about.
How exciting is it...

353
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,100
...for Giants fans
with Rayburn coming hom"e..."

354
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,900
{y:i}... after leading the Braves
{y:i}to a championship?

355
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,100
Did you see that?
See the way he moved his legs?

356
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,300
- Can I have a hot dog?
- A what?

357
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,200
Can I have a hot dog?

358
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,500
You're in my seat.

359
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,700
If it isn't the ubiquitous
queen of AM radio herself.

360
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,300
Good morning, my sweet angel,
darling, baby.

361
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,900
Oh, yeah, whatever.

362
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,600
Manny, come on, don't dick me around.
It's an important piece, okay?

363
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,700
There's somebody there behind
that killer smile. I promis"e..."

364
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,600
...I will not hurt your boy.
I want Bobby Rayburn.

365
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,800
Bernie, correct me if I'm wrong...

366
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,000
...but isn't she the ball-buster
who had the temerity to ask my client...

367
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,400
...if he was honestly worth 40 million?

368
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,400
- Am I a ball-buster?
- Yeah.

369
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,500
Thank you.

370
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
- Whose is this?
- It's mine. I spit in it.

371
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,200
I thought your mother
confiscated that.

372
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,200
She did.

373
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,000
Play ball!

374
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
Yeah, attaway!

375
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
Strike.

376
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
What are you doing? You missed it.
Hawkins struck him out.

377
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,600
- Pay attention.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

378
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,900
{y:i}Blaze winds, and the pitch to Pryor...

379
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,400
...swung on and driven deep
towards the gap.

380
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,200
{y:i}He crushed it!

381
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,900
- Watch, watch, watch.
- What?

382
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,200
I got it!

383
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,000
I got it!

384
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,200
Primo and Rayburn giving chase.
They converge and"..."

385
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,400
{y:i}Lookout!

386
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,800
Centre field makes the calls.

387
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,200
Fundamental of baseball,
centre field makes the calls.

388
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,800
Pay attention.

389
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
{y:i}Well, a scary moment on day one.

390
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,900
I'll tell you, Rayburn's slow getting up.
And Primo's still slow getting up.

391
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,000
There's $40 million out there
in centre field, Steve.

392
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Hope the Giants have
collision coverage.

393
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,400
This will help relieve the pain.

394
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
- Doc, is the rib bruised or fractured?
- Neither.

395
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,800
Bobby, what are you doing?
We got 161 games to go out there.

396
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,000
Could you excuse me for a minute?

397
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,100
Thank you. You just signed
a $40 million contract.

398
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,100
Hurt yourself, you'll be batting
.100 by month's end.

399
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,800
The media'll turn on you
faster than the fans.

400
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,800
- Listen, you gotta come out.
- I can't.

401
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
I gotta be Babe- fucking-Ruth.

402
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,400
It's William-fucking-Bendix.
Get it right.

403
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,500
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

404
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm just gonna make some phone calls.
Okay? Just business calls. I'll be back.

405
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,200
- Go?
- Just downstairs for a minute.

406
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,200
Mom said we have to be home by 6,
or she'll be upset.

407
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,900
Forget about your mother.

408
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,700
I got it!

409
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,700
The wind took it. The wind took it.
Kid was lucky.

410
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,600
Kid was lucky.

411
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,700
Wind took it.

412
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,600
- You stepped on me.
- Don't worry. We'll get one next time.

413
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,600
Okay, I gotta go, all right?
I'll be back.

414
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,200
- You don't have to pee or anything?
- No.

415
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,900
What happened?

416
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Lanz hit one to right. Bases loaded.
Come on, grand slam!

417
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,300
Don't get greedy, son.
What we need now is a sacrifice.

418
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,200
A winning team knows how to
manufacture runs. Coop taught me that.

419
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,800
Know why he said the most
beautiful play is a sacrifice fly?

420
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,600
- You sacrifice for the team?
- And doesn't bring down your average.

421
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,500
That's why baseball's
better than life. It's fair.

422
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,200
Tell me what happens.

423
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,000
{y:i}Now batting, number 33...

424
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,500
{y:i}... Bobby Rayburn.

425
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,600
Come on, Bobby!

426
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,400
Attaway, Bobby!

427
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,600
Rayburn look a little stiff to you?

428
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,700
I can't believe they left him in
after that collision.

429
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,400
Right. That's all we need,
our $40 million man on the DL.

430
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,100
He's playing hurt. That's a
man showing his mettle.

431
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Putting the team first. Remember,
last year he hit.314 against lefties.

432
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,600
Yo, Bobby!

433
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,300
- Time!
- Oh, fuck.

434
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,200
Come on, let's play some
fucking baseball!

435
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
All right, Bobby, let's go!

436
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,400
Play!

437
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,100
All right, Bobby!

438
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,200
- Go for it, Bobby!
- Go, Bobby!

439
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,100
Bobby!

440
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,200
Hey!

441
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,200
Hey, buddy...

442
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,800
...you wanna sit down?
Trying to see here.

443
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,700
Go, Bobby!

444
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,200
Come on! Let's go with
the fucking game! Shit!

445
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,100
Strike!

446
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,400
Are you out of your mind, ump?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

447
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,000
- Hey, sit down.
- Take your hands off me.

448
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,800
- Stop pushing, man!
- Just ask.

449
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,200
- Why the fuck you pushing? I'm asking.
- Both of you, down in front!

450
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,200
- Fuck you!
- Down in front! Now!

451
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,800
Let's play some fucking ball!
You all right?

452
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,000
What's your fucking problem?

453
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,500
You old busybody!

454
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,200
I gotta go, okay? I'll be back.

455
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,400
Fuck you!

456
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
Oh, fuck.

457
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,500
Get out of here.

458
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,000
So could you just send me
over the stats? Yes.

459
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,200
Okay. Thank you very much.

460
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,100
I'm sorry I'm late.
Your hair looks nice.

461
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,900
- I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid he left.
- He left.

462
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,000
- For the ball game.
- What?

463
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,700
Yes, for the ball game.

464
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,800
- I thought he had a plane to catch.
- Plans changed.

465
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,200
But he did leave you this note.

466
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,200
- He didn't draw a smiley face, did he?
- What?

467
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,100
The previous assistant got him
in the habit of drawing a smiley fac"e..."

468
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,200
...instead of "sincerely," and I keep
telling him it's not always appropriate.

469
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,700
No, it's perfectly appropriate.

470
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,100
{y:i}Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

471
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,100
Hey, congratulations, fellas.

472
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,800
Hey, Babe- fucking-Ruth.

473
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,300
- William-fucking-Bendix.
- That's right.

474
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,700
So did the kid see his home run?

475
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,700
The kid didn't even see it.

476
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,200
He slipped into a coma,
and he never pulled out. I'm sorry.

477
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,500
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Like you take bad news well.

478
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,100
What am I supposed to say?
"Great news, the kid didn't make it."

479
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,200
That's all right, man.
Enough of these hospital gigs.

480
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,300
They're off the list.
You know what the bright side is?

481
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,100
You knocked the cover off the ball.
You're back.

482
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
The hell I did. It was a fluke.

483
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,600
I never even saw the pitch.

484
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,000
Let go, Tim.

485
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
- What do you want?
- How is he? He okay?

486
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,200
He's not. He's crying his eyes out.
What do you think?

487
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,800
- Come on, don't start.
- Don't you start.

488
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,400
You violated your agreement.
I called my lawyer.

489
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,500
I'm getting a restraining order.

490
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,100
- Don't start.
- No, don't you start. Go away.

491
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,700
- I've had it. I don't care what you want.
- Let me see him.

492
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,000
You had to bring him home?
What is wrong with you?

493
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,100
- I want you out. Tim, call the cops.
- I'm gonna explain to him.

494
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,300
- Come on, everything's okay.
- You bastard.

495
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,200
You motherfucker! You cocksuck...!

496
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
- Hey.
- Tim!

497
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,300
Tim, call the cops. He fucking hit me!

498
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Hey. Hey, slugger.

499
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Slugger, I'm sorry. You forgive me?

500
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,600
- Hey.
- You left me.

501
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,100
I know, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

502
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,300
- You forgive Dad?
- Mom's got a terrible headache.

503
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,100
Well, that's called a migraine.
She'll live.

504
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,600
Look what I got for you.
I got your favourite pizza.

505
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Gil, open the door!

506
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,300
- Gil, open the door.
- It's got pepperoni and mushroom.

507
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,600
- I don't like mushrooms.
- You can pick them off.

508
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,600
Is it true, if Mom marries Tim,
I'm not gonna be a Renard anymore?

509
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
- Gil, open the door.
- It's open!

510
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,300
- It's locked.
- It's open.

511
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,000
It's locked, Gil. Open the door now.
I'm calling the police.

512
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,600
You still worried about the tryouts?

513
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,600
I don't know.
Think I'll make the majors?

514
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,600
Of course you'll make it.
Remember what I said.

515
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,400
Positive things happen
to positive thinkers. Who said that?

516
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,500
- Coop.
- Damn straight.

517
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,800
He was the greatest player
I ever played with.

518
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Gil, unlock the door.

519
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,300
Got you a Coke.

520
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,500
Call the cops.

521
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Didn't you hear me? Call the cops!

522
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,200
Call the fucking police!

523
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
- I can't drink Coke.
- Who says?

524
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,600
Mom and Dad. I mean, Tim.

525
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,600
The door's locked. It's okay.

526
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,300
Gil, open the door.

527
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,300
Hey, Art.

528
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,800
I said, " Enough of this shit.
You sign the contract right now."

529
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,200
He signed it. I swear to God,
on my honour, he signed the contract.

530
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,300
Hey, Gil, got a second?

531
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,700
If you do. It's 8:00.

532
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,800
- Shall we?
- There you go.

533
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,800
Sit down, Gil.

534
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,400
That's okay, I'll stand.

535
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,200
Chuck from McKinley and Everest
called yesterday.

536
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,800
Said they wanted to drop
their account with us.

537
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,100
I sent Figgy over there
to sort things out.

538
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,900
You sent Figgy down?

539
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,400
- Sit down, Gil.
- Yeah, he sorted them out.

540
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,000
He did it with my opening-day tickets.
What are you gonna do about it?

541
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,400
- He didn't steal your account.
- He did. What will you do?

542
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,500
We gave him your account.

543
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
I gave him your account.

544
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,700
What do you mean?

545
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,700
You're not getting
the numbers we need.

546
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,200
I know. It's been a little slow
last couple of months.

547
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,800
But that'll change. I've got
a new strategy. It's gonna work.

548
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,200
- Listen, your behaviour is unacceptable.
- What do you mean?

549
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,400
- People are scared of you.
- Why, because of the other day?

550
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,100
You cannot do things like that
in this day and...

551
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,000
I want your reorder book.

552
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,700
Outstanding commissions
will be forwarded.

553
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,100
My father started this business.

554
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,900
Look, perfection and principles don't
belong in business, not now or then.

555
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,200
- As a friend of your father's...
- Keep your mouth shut.

556
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,300
You know nothing about my father.

557
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,100
- He made this business.
- Your father made knives.

558
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,300
- San Francisco made this business.
- By ripping him off.

559
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,000
He wasn't a businessman, Gil...

560
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,600
...and neither are you.

561
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,700
That's the bottom line.

562
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,700
{y:i}And so, in a Freudian sense, Jewel...

563
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
{y:i}... the catcher is the father,
{y:i}and the son is the pitcher.

564
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,500
{y:i}Wow, that's fascinating.
{y:i}Let me ask you.

565
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,600
{y:i}- What does the bat and ball represent?
{y:i}- Well, the bat speaks for itself...

566
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,200
{y:i}... and, of course,
{y:i}the ball is the ejaculate.

567
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,400
{y:i}Thanks for calling, doc.
{y:i}Who do we have on line two?

568
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,800
{y:i}- Do we have anybody on line two?
{y:i}- I believe everybody hung up.

569
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,400
Hey, man. Hey, you got a van?
Kids are breaking into your van.

570
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,300
Somebody's breaking into your van.
Stop those kids. Cut that out.

571
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,800
- What?
- Kids breaking into a van out there.

572
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,800
- Yeah.
- Here, this is for you.

573
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,700
- What's that?
- Take it. Take it.

574
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,200
- Take it.
- What is it?

575
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,800
It's for you.
It's a temporary restraining order.

576
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,800
- What?
- You have been s"erve"d.

577
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,200
Hey, man, can I use your...?

578
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,600
Okay, last one.

579
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,700
Good swing. All right, who's next?

580
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,400
Eleven. Let's go, buddy.
Hustle up there.

581
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,300
- Okay, pal.
- Come on, Rich.

582
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,800
Okay, watch the ball.

583
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Good swing.

584
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,100
Next one, Richie.

585
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,900
Attaway, Richie boy.

586
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,300
- That's okay.
- He's throwing too hard.

587
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,100
He almost took his head off.
Hey, coach. Coach.

588
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,100
- Yeah.
- Slow down.

589
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,100
- This is Little League. Little League.
- I know.

590
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,200
- Leave him alone, Gil.
- Mind your fucking business.

591
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,800
Hey, coach, mix in some strikes.
What are you doing?

592
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,500
- You're making it hard.
- I'll coach from here.

593
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,300
- Mix in some strikes.
- He's throwing strikes, Gil.

594
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,300
- Fuck it, I'm gonna go down.
- Easy, Gil.

595
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,300
Remember, Ellen's got
that restraining order on you.

596
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,400
- The bat is too fucking heavy.
- Come on.

597
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,800
You fuck with me,
I'll send your head into the outfield.

598
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,600
Go easy. You're letting the bat
swing him.

599
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,600
- Hey, hey, come on, you guy.
- Look how heavy this bat is.

600
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Here.

601
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,400
Let go of my son.

602
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,300
- He's my son too.
- Don't remind me. Get off him.

603
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,500
- He's my son too.
- You are not gonna ruin our lives.

604
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,200
- Tim, call the cops now.
- I'm just trying to tell him something.

605
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,200
Get out of here. Tim!

606
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,600
You get out of here.
Can't you read, stupid?

607
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,000
The restraining order says
you have to stay 100 yards away.

608
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,900
- Tell him one thing.
- You can't come near him.

609
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,800
- I wanna tell him one thing.
- Get out of here.

610
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,800
- I just wanna tell him one thing.
- You better go.

611
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,600
Don't swing at anything.
Wait for a good one.

612
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,300
Step on the eggshell,
squash the bug. Okay?

613
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,000
You mind your fucking business.
You're lucky.

614
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,300
Just give him... Give him something.
He's a kid.

615
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,100
It's okay. Play ball.

616
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,300
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn again
{y:i}failed to earn his k eep.

617
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,200
{y:i}Almost grounding into
{y:i}a game-ending double play...

618
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,300
{y:i}... just beating the throw to first.

619
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,500
{y:i}When the Giants
{y:i}needed a pick-me-up...

620
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,100
{y:i}... number 11, Juan Primo,
{y:i}provides San Francisco with a lift.

621
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,100
{y:i}And it was a big one. His two-run
{y:i}shot over the left-field fence...

622
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,000
{y:i}... scored Rayburn,
{y:i}and the Giants went home happy.

623
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,700
{y:i}That is, except possibly
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn...

624
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,700
{y:i}... whose lackof hitting is giving
{y:i}new meaning to the term "three hole."

625
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,800
{y:i}The way Primo's carried
{y:i}this team on his shoulders...

626
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,000
{y:i}... mak es you wonder who the real
{y:i}$40 million player is.

627
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,700
{y:i}Lanz came up with a big hit to drive
{y:i}in a k ey run in the Giants' victory.

628
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,600
{y:i}Jimmy has been a spark plug
{y:i}during this home stand.

629
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,300
Motherfuck.

630
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,000
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen, now batting,
{y:i}the centre fielder, number 33...

631
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,200
{y:i}... Bobby Rayburn.

632
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,900
All right, Bobby, let's go!

633
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,500
All right, Bobby.

634
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,500
Strike.

635
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,500
Strike.

636
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,900
- Strike thr"ee."
- Shit.

637
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,300
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,
{y:i}with courtesy to the players...

638
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,100
{y:i}... please refrain
{y:i}from excessive noise...

639
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,600
{y:i}... and throwing anything
{y:i}onto the field. Thank you.

640
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,200
Forty-million-dollar man's
paying off, huh?

641
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,800
{y:i}Now batting, number 33,
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn.

642
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,800
Well, here it is, Memorial Day weekend.

643
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,000
You think back to the opening-day
grand slam, doesn't seem long ago.

644
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,300
{y:i}But lately, Bobby Rayburn
{y:i}has really had difficulties...

645
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,900
{y:i}... and can't seem to find his strok e.
{y:i}He lacks aggressiveness.

646
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,900
And you start to wonder
when you call it a slump.

647
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,700
{y:i}Most superstars aren't gonna
{y:i}sit down for you.

648
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,400
{y:i}But you gotta wonder...

649
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,300
{y:i}... when he's gonna
{y:i}breakout of this thing.

650
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,100
Strike.

651
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,400
Come on, Bobby. Come on.

652
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,800
Out.

653
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,700
{y:i}Now batting, number 46, Jimmy Lanz.

654
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,900
You'll be all right.

655
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,300
You still want that interview?

656
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,100
You'd let Bobby Rayburn do an
interview with a...? What was it?

657
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,100
- Castrating ball-buster.
- Castrating ball-buster, that's it.

658
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,100
- I thought I was off your list.
- Come on.

659
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,300
Schindler has a list, not me, okay?

660
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,600
When you're hitting.183,
you don't get to have a list.

661
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,000
{y:i}Lock er room.

662
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,700
- "Giants' lock er room."
- Bobby Rayburn.

663
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,200
- "Yeah, who's calling?"
- A friend of his. I have to talk to him.

664
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,200
It's really important.

665
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,200
{y:i}Rayburn, phone.

666
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,500
- Yeah, this is Bobby.
- "Bobby?"

667
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,300
- Yeah.
- Bobby Rayburn.

668
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,700
"Yes. Yes, who is this"?

669
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,900
{y:i}Hello. Look, say something.

670
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,700
{y:i}Hello?

671
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,500
{y:i}Yo, Stook, I thought you were
{y:i}supposed to screen my calls here.

672
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,400
- Burn, baby, burn.
- Come on, give me some.

673
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,700
- What's up, Dad? Gaining a little weight.
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

674
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,300
- Stopped by the doughnut spot.
- Cool. Is he for me?

675
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,300
Yeah, he's for you.

676
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
What's his name?

677
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,800
- He told me it's Bradley.
- What else did he say, Dr. Dolittle?

678
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,000
Dad, how come
you haven't been hitting?

679
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,100
How's the rib cage, Bobby?

680
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,800
My rib cage is sick
of people asking about it.

681
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,700
They say you should've
came out that first gam"e..."

682
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,800
...but you were hot-dogging,
so you screwed yourself.

683
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,400
That supposed to be a dis
or something? I hit.314 last season.

684
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,600
- That's bullshit.
- I'm telling you what people say.

685
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,700
I can put a positive spin on this.

686
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,100
- How?
- How? I'll tell you how.

687
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,800
We set up an interview,
get a piece out of it.

688
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,400
You tell the people why you stayed in.
It's for the kid in chemo.

689
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,000
You get public sympathy.
I smell forgiveness in the Bay Area.

690
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,600
- Is that exploiting the kid's death?
- Not comfortable with it?

691
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,600
- Should I be?
- I think you should be.

692
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,200
Well, I don't think I am.

693
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,100
Excuse me. I'll have a vodka
and orange juice, please.

694
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,200
And whatever the lady wants.

695
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
Jackon the rocks, thanks.

696
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,600
What?

697
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,300
Oh, shit. I did it again, didn't I?

698
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,200
No, it's okay.
I'm used to all of this interview shit.

699
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,500
Look, no offence intended,
but it's no secret...

700
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,900
...that you're playing like shit.
It's gotta be affecting you.

701
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,800
Of course it's affecting me.

702
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm paid to produce.
I can't even hit the side of a barn.

703
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,700
- How do you think it makes me feel?
- Do you know what I think, Mr. Rayburn?

704
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,800
No, but I'm quite sure
you're gonna tell me.

705
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,200
I think the slump is a good thing.

706
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Now, what kind of twisted shit is that?

707
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,400
It's gonna teach you
to cut yourself a little slack.

708
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,900
- You can't keep up this act forever.
- Now it's an act.

709
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,600
Oh, yeah, Mr. Perfect. Mr. No-Error.
Nobody can live up to that shit.

710
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,200
You gotta give yourself a break.
It's just a lie anyhow.

711
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,900
Yeah. It doesn't seem like a lie
when I'm hitting.

712
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,100
{y:i}Now batting for the Giants,
{y:i}number 11...

713
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,300
{y:i}... the right fielder, Juan Primo.

714
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,800
Sit down, let Bobby bat!

715
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,100
He's a hot dog. He's lucky.

716
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,200
{y:i}Now batting, number 11, Juan Primo.

717
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,700
{y:i}Now batting, number 33,
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn.

718
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,600
Let's play some fucking ball!

719
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,300
Thanks, Primo.

720
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,500
Fuck you, Rayburn.

721
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,700
- You suck.
- Bobby, Bobby.

722
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,600
You suck!

723
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,700
Don't listen to them, Bobby!

724
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,800
Okay.

725
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,400
Line drive to the right.

726
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,100
Don't tell me
where it's gonna go, Dad.
