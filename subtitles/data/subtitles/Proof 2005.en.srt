<i> We all love
the richness of a good eye cream.</i>

2
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:56,389
<i>But it does leave a richness
or a greasiness under the eye.</i>

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,267
<i> Now let's take a look
at that nasty salsa stain.</i>

4
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>This shirt is ruined, right?
Wrong.</i>

5
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,647
<i>Watch the stain-fighting power of...</i>

6
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>... designed with women in mind.</i>

7
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>If you can twist it,
turn it, remove it,</i>

8
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:12,697
<i>then you can fix it,
replace it, or improve it.</i>

9
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,782
<i>My kits includes a guidebook...</i>

10
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:19,245
<i>Plus they painted some people up
like animals, and now it's over.</i>

11
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,083
<i> If you think you need
to go to a gym to lose weight,</i>

12
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,129
<i>stay in shape, and have a body like this,
think again.</i>

13
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:31,382
<i>This is Bowflex, the real workout...</i>

14
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>When you're looking for a home, your
real estate agent is a big part of your life.</i>

15
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,515
<i>You need someone
you can count on.</i>

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,144
<i> Well, they studied science
and medicine in skin care,</i>

17
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:46,481
<i>and combined those two
in your skin solutions line.</i>

18
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:49,609
<i>That's exactly it. I so much
appreciate being able to be here.</i>

19
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,986
<i> Nice to have you with us,
as always.</i>

20
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:56,073
<i>We would love to take your phone calls.
This really is a very...</i>

21
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,162
<i> When you contact a RE/MAX agent
to help you buy yourself a home,</i>

22
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:04,707
<i>you expect service that's
a little out of the ordinary.</i>

23
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,836
<i>After all, RE/MAX agents average
more experience and more sales</i>

24
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,172
<i>than other agents.</i>

25
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,927
<i>So the next time you need outstanding
real estate service, call RE/MAX.</i>

26
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,957
<i> Can't sleep?</i>

27
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,169
Jesus,

28
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:52,880
Oh, you scared me,

29
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,507
I'm sorry,

30
00:02:55,591 --> 00:03:00,304
- What are you doing here?
- I just thought I'd check up on you,

31
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,848
Why aren't you in bed?

32
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:06,018
Your student's still here,
He's up in your study,

33
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:11,732
He's not my student anymore,
He's teaching now, He's a bright kid,

34
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:15,068
- What time is it?
- After midnight,

35
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,487
- So?
- So?

36
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,785
- Happy birthday,
- Dad!

37
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:29,207
Do I ever forget?

38
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,625
Thank you,

39
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,336
27, I can't believe it,

40
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,255
Neither can I,

41
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,592
I forgot the glasses,
You want me to...?

42
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,302
No,

43
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:49,769
This is the worst champagne
I have ever tasted,

44
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,441
- It's not even champagne,
- The bottle's the right shape,

45
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:57,235
"Windy Valley Vineyards,"

46
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,740
I didn't know they made wine in Wisconsin,
You want some?

47
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:05,076
I hope you're not spending
your birthday alone,

48
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:08,204
- I'm not alone,
- I don't count,

49
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,957
- Why not?
- I'm your old man, Go out with friends,

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,169
- Yeah, right,
- Aren't your friends taking you out?

51
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:15,587
- Nope,
- Why not?

52
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,593
For your friends to take you out, you have
to have friends, Funny how that works,

53
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:26,055
You have friends, What about that
cute blonde? Lives over on Ellis Avenue,

54
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,350
- You used to spend every minute together,
- Christie Jacobson?

55
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,269
Christie Jacobson,

56
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,813
- That was in third grade, Dad,
- Oh,

57
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:36,482
Last time I saw her was in a sandbox,

58
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,569
What about Claire?

59
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:43,114
She's not my friend,
She's my sister,

60
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:46,534
And she's in New York,
And I don't like her,

61
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:48,828
I thought she was coming in,

62
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:51,747
Not till tomorrow,

63
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,378
My advice if you can't sleep
is to sit down and do some mathematics,

64
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,964
- Please!
- We could do some together, the old way,

65
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,841
Can't think of anything worse,

66
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:04,927
- Line by line, out loud,
- Sure you don't want any?

67
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:09,098
You better get cracking, By the time I was
your age, I had already done my best work,

68
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:12,059
- How old were you?
- Hmm?

69
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:14,186
When it started,

70
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,439
What?

71
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:19,358
You know, when... you got sick,

72
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:21,193
Uh...

73
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:25,030
- 26, 27, Is that what you're worried about?
- I've thought about it,

74
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:30,494
Just because I went bughouse doesn't
mean you will, It's not strictly hereditary,

75
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:35,374
Listen to me, Life changes fast in your 20s,
and it shakes you up,

76
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:39,461
You're down, you've had a lousy couple of
years, No one knows that better than me,

77
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:41,589
- You're gonna be OK,
- I am?

78
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:43,674
Yes, I promise you,

79
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:47,553
The simple fact that we can
talk about this together is a good sign,

80
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,930
- A good sign?
- Yeah,

81
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,640
How could it be a good sign?

82
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:57,104
Because crazy people don't sit around
wondering if they're nuts,

83
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:59,898
- They don't?
- No, They've got better things to do,

84
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,525
Take it from me,

85
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:07,030
A very good sign that you're crazy is an
inability to ask the question, "Am I crazy?"

86
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:10,367
Even if the answer is yes?

87
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,536
Crazy people don't ask, you see?

88
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:14,872
Huh,

89
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:18,417
What do you say? Let's call it a night,
You can go up and get some sleep,

90
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,544
- Then in the morning...
- Wait,

91
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:23,213
- What's the matter?
- It doesn't make sense,

92
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,507
- Sure it does,
- No,

93
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,719
- Where's the problem?
- The problem is...

94
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:31,346
- You are crazy,
- So?

95
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,851
So you said a crazy person
would never admit that,

96
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,854
Ah, I see,

97
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:41,773
So?

98
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:45,902
- It's a point,
- So how can you admit it?

99
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:48,822
Well, because...

100
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,618
I'm also dead,

101
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,996
Aren't I?

102
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:03,503
- You died a week ago,
- Aneurysm, 63 years old,

103
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:06,381
The funeral's tomorrow,

104
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:21,855
Sorry,

105
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:25,441
- Did I... Did I hurt you?
- No, It's OK,

106
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,526
Good,

107
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,654
Mr., Dobbs, you gonna stand there forever?

108
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,823
This is my daughter Catherine,

109
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,658
- Hi,
- Hi,

110
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,035
Mr., Dobbs is in our infinite program,

111
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,997
As he approaches completion
of his dissertation,

112
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,040
time approaches infinity,

113
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,627
- Catherine?
- What?

114
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:48,506
I'm sorry, I just wanted to say
I'm done for the night,

115
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,550
Good,

116
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,844
- Champagne, huh?
- Yes,

117
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:55,388
- Celebrating?
- Do you want some?

118
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,933
- Sure,
- I'm done, You can take the rest with you,

119
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,394
Oh, Um...

120
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:03,479
- No, thanks,
- Take it, I'm done,

121
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:06,357
No, I'm driving, Um...

122
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,777
- I'll let myself out,
- Good,

123
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,072
- When should I come back?
- Come back?

124
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:16,659
Yeah, I'm no way near finished,
Maybe tomorrow?

125
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:19,370
We have a funeral tomorrow,

126
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:24,208
You're right, I'm sorry,
I was going to attend, if that's all right,

127
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,668
Sure,

128
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,878
What about Sunday?
Will you be around?

129
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:30,714
You've had three days,

130
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:33,050
I know you don't need
anybody in your hair,

131
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:35,886
but someone's got
to go through your dad's stuff,

132
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,098
- There's nothing up there,
- There are 103 notebooks,

133
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:42,309
He was a graphomaniac, Harold,
Do you know what that is?

134
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:44,270
He wrote compulsively,
Call me Hal,

135
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:47,982
It's like a monkey at a typewriter,
103 notebooks full of bullshit,

136
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,526
I'm prepared to look at every page,
Are you?

137
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,778
No,

138
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:55,155
I'm not crazy,

139
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,953
Well, I'm gonna be late,

140
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,705
Some friends of mine are in this band,

141
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:07,626
They're playing in a bar on Diversey,
way down the bill, around 2:30,

142
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,254
- I said I'd be there,
- Great,

143
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:13,006
They're all in the math department,
They're good,

144
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,426
<i>They have this song called "i,"
You'd like it, Lowercase i,</i>

145
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,930
They just stand there,
They don't play anything for three minutes,

146
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:21,932
Imaginary number?

147
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:24,768
It's a math joke,
You see why they're way down the bill,

148
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,854
That's a long drive
to see some nerds in a band,

149
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:31,692
I hate when people say that,
It's not really that long of a drive,

150
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,236
<i>- So they are nerds,
- Oh, they're raging geeks,</i>

151
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,697
But they're geeks
who can dress themselves

152
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,032
and hold down a job at a major university,

153
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:42,577
Some of them have switched
from glasses to contacts,

154
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:47,082
They play sports, They play in a band,
They get laid surprisingly often,

155
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:50,335
So it makes you kind of question
the whole set of terms:

156
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:54,464
"Geek," "nerd," "wonk,"
"Dilbert," "paste-eater,"

157
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:58,260
- You're in this band, aren't you?
- OK, yes,

158
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:01,638
I play the drums, You wanna come?
I never sing, I swear to God,

159
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,641
- No, thanks,
- All right, look, Catherine,

160
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:07,060
- Monday, What do you say?
- Don't you have a job?

161
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:11,064
- A full teaching load plus my own work,
- Plus band practice,

162
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:14,401
- Plus I teach hockey to ten-year-olds,
- You make me sick,

163
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:17,237
I don't have time to do this,
but I have to if you'll let me,

164
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,199
I loved your dad, and I don't believe
a mind like his can just shut down,

165
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,869
He had lucid moments, a lucid year,
a whole year three years ago,

166
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:27,539
- Sorry,
- Look, let me...

167
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:29,999
- Wait, You're 27, right?
- How old are you?

168
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,001
- Doesn't matter,
- How old are you?

169
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:35,255
I'm 26, When your dad
was younger than both of us,

170
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,674
he made major contributions to three fields:

171
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:41,344
- Game theory, algebraic geometry...
- Don't lecture me,

172
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:43,930
If I came up with a tenth
of the shit your dad produced,

173
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:48,851
I could write my ticket
to any math department in the country,

174
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:52,772
Give me your backpack,

175
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,816
Why?

176
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,235
- Because I wanna look inside it,
- What?

177
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:59,654
- Open it up and give it to me,
- Come on,

178
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:02,698
- You're not taking anything out of here,
- I wouldn't,

179
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,117
You're hoping to find something
you can publish?

180
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:07,370
- Sure,
- Then you can write your own ticket?

181
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:10,623
What? No, it would be
under your dad's name, for your dad,

182
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:13,376
- You have something in that backpack,
- What...?

183
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:16,295
- Give it to me!
- Look, you're being a little paranoid,

184
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,007
Just because I'm paranoid
doesn't mean there isn't something in...

185
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:25,805
You said yourself that there was
nothing up there, didn't you? Didn't you?

186
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:29,308
- Yes,
- So what would I take, right?

187
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,770
You're right,

188
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:35,564
Thank you,

189
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,945
Oh, what the hell...?

190
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:46,700
This isn't an airport,

191
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:10,557
You can come back,

192
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:22,694
The University Health Service
is very good,

193
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,864
I'm fine,

194
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:31,703
Also... exercise is great,

195
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:34,748
I go running along the lake
a couple mornings a week,

196
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,875
It clears my head,
It's not too cold yet,

197
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,378
If you wanted to,
I could pick you up,

198
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,797
No, thanks,

199
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,759
All right, Well, I'm gonna be
late for the show, I'd better go,

200
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:52,682
Good night,

201
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,602
- Wait, You forgot your jacket,
- Oh, no, you...

202
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,569
I'm paranoid?
You think I should go jogging?

203
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:07,322
- Just hold on,
- Get out, Get the hell out of my house!

204
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,532
Let me explain,
I wanna show you something,

205
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:11,076
- Give it back,
- Wait...

206
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,286
- I'm calling the police,
- What? Don't,

207
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,497
Look, I borrowed the book, all right?

208
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,210
'Cause I found something your father
wrote, Not math, Just something he wrote,

209
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:23,213
- I'd like to report a robbery,
- Put the phone down,

210
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:24,714
- A robbery,
- It's about you,

211
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:27,383
- He's in the house right now!
- Here's your name,

212
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:30,845
- I'm at 4655 South...
- "Catherine," see? "Catherine,"

213
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:31,888
South...

214
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:34,516
"Not a bad day,
Some good news from Catherine,"

215
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:37,644
I'm not sure what that meant,
I thought you might,

216
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:40,730
<i>- When did he write this?
- Ma'am?</i>

217
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:45,318
Three years ago, "Machinery's not working
yet, but there's cause for optimism,"

218
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:49,238
The machinery is what he called his mind,
his ability to do mathematics,

219
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,741
I know,

220
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:55,453
"Talking with students helps,
so does riding in buses,

221
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,580
"Most of all Cathy,

222
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:04,754
"Her refusal to let me be institutionalized,
caring for me herself,

223
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:07,340
"has certainly saved my life,

224
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:12,803
"Made writing this possible,

225
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:16,891
"Made it possible
to imagine doing math again,

226
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:20,186
"Where does her strength come from?

227
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:23,814
"I can never repay her,
Today is her birthday,

228
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:27,526
"She is 24,
I'm taking her to dinner,"

229
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:32,281
So what are we going
to do on your birthday?

230
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,576
- Dad...
- Let's get the hell out of this neighborhood,

231
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:40,331
Let's go to the North side or Chinatown,
Greektown, I don't know what's good,

232
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,374
- Dad?
- Hmm?

233
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:46,086
I'm going to school,

234
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:48,422
When?

235
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:52,468
I'm gonna start at Northwestern
at the end of the month,

236
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,553
Northwestern?

237
00:14:55,763 --> 00:15:01,727
I shouldn't have tried to sneak it out, I know
it sounds stupid, but I was gonna wrap it,

238
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,276
Happy birthday,

239
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,452
What's wrong with Chicago?

240
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,955
You still teach there,

241
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:27,461
I'm sorry, That is too weird,
me taking classes in your department,

242
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:30,923
- It's a long drive,
- It's not that long, It's half an hour,

243
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:33,300
Still, twice a day,

244
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:35,802
Dad,

245
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,764
I'd live there,

246
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,142
You'd actually want
to live in Evanston?

247
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:46,772
I'd still be close,
I can come home whenever you want,

248
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:49,107
Look...

249
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,986
You've been well, You've been really well
for almost seven months now,

250
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,324
I don't think you need me here
every minute of the day,

251
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:20,889
- Yes?
- Someone here call the police?

252
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,188
No, honey,

253
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:33,860
I think we should put the aqua plates
on the registry and the brown couch,

254
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:36,946
Your mother wants to buy us
a substantial piece of furniture,

255
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,618
and that's the biggest thing that I could find
that will fit in our apartment,

256
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:46,497
Well, then, don't worry about it, honey,
I'll be home by tomorrow night,

257
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,667
Yeah, let's just get through today first,
Hold on a second,

258
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:50,960
Hi!

259
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,004
Huh? Um...

260
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:56,174
I don't know,
She didn't pick up when I called,

261
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:59,344
Hopefully better than yesterday,

262
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:03,973
First thing I'm gonna do is throw her into
the shower and get her out in the sun,

263
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,856
- Better, Much,
- Thanks,

264
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,108
- You feel better?
- Yep,

265
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,319
You look a million times better,

266
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:19,614
- Have some coffee,
- OK,

267
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:24,118
- No, Black,
- Have a little milk,

268
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,419
- Have a banana,
- No, Thank you,

269
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:37,423
Good thing I brought food,
There is nothing in the house,

270
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:39,842
I've been meaning to go shopping,

271
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,637
- Do you want a bagel?
- No, I hate breakfast,

272
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,353
- Coffee,
- Still making those lists, huh?

273
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,439
It's... It's a compulsion,

274
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:59,653
Do you ever cheat and tick off something
you haven't actually done yet?

275
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:02,448
Well, I would only be cheating myself,

276
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,783
Right,

277
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,912
Did you use that
conditioner I brought you?

278
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,915
- No, Shit, I forgot,
- Well, it's my favorite,

279
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,126
You'll love it, Katie,
I want you to try it,

280
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:18,297
- I'll try it next time,
- You'll like it, It has jojoba,

281
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:21,175
What is jojoba?

282
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:24,428
It's something they put in
for healthy hair,

283
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,514
- Hair is dead,
- What?

284
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:30,684
It's... It's dead tissue,
You can't make it healthy,

285
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:34,563
- Whatever, It's good for your hair,
- Like what? A chemical?

286
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,609
- No, It's organic,
- It can be organic and still be a chemical,

287
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:41,486
- I don't know what it is,
- Heard of organic chemistry?

288
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,698
It makes my hair look,
smell and feel good,

289
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:47,284
and that is the extent
of my information about it,

290
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:50,662
You might like it
if you decide to use it,

291
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:53,248
Thanks, I'll try it,

292
00:18:55,709 --> 00:19:01,506
If you don't have anything to wear for
today, we could go shopping downtown,

293
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,632
OK,

294
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,886
It'll be fun,
My birthday present,

295
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,263
Great,

296
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:11,183
Is there anything else you need?

297
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,642
No, I'm cool,

298
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,270
- Anything at all while I'm here?
- Uh-uh,

299
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:19,566
I thought we'd have
some people over tonight,

300
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,027
If you're feeling OK,

301
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:24,696
We are burying Dad this afternoon,

302
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:28,491
You have to have something,
People expect it,

303
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:33,079
And it's the only time I can see
any old Chicago friends, It'll be nice,

304
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:37,375
I think Dad would've
wanted us to have a good time,

305
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:41,880
It's a funeral, but we don't
have to be completely grim about it,

306
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:49,762
- Mitch says hi,
- Hi, Mitch,

307
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:54,100
He sends you his love,
I told him you would see him soon, and...

308
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:56,394
- We're getting married,
- No shit,

309
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:59,147
- Yes, We just decided,
- Yikes,

310
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,231
Yes,

311
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:02,692
- Oh, When?
- In January,

312
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:05,737
You know, his job is great,

313
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,405
I just got promoted,

314
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,074
Huh,

315
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:14,328
- You will come?
- Yeah, Sure, In January?

316
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:19,292
I mean, it's not like I have
to check my schedule or anything, Sure,

317
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,461
- Do you know what you wanna do now?
- No,

318
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:25,256
- Do you wanna stay in Chicago?
- I don't know,

319
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:29,260
- Do you wanna go back to school?
- I haven't thought about it,

320
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:32,388
Well, there's a lot to think about,

321
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,766
- How do you feel?
- Physically? Great,

322
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:38,853
Except my hair seems unhealthy,
I wish there was something...

323
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:44,108
- Come on, Catherine,
- What is the point of all these questions?

324
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:49,363
Katie, some police officers came by
while you were in the shower,

325
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,574
Yeah?

326
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:56,787
They said they were checking up on things
and wanted to see how everything was,

327
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:59,415
That was nice of them,
What about this?

328
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:02,793
They said they responded to a call
last night and came to the house,

329
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:04,753
Yeah?

330
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:07,131
- Did you call the police last night?
- Yeah,

331
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:08,966
Why?

332
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:12,219
Because I thought
the house was being robbed,

333
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:16,640
- But it wasn't?
- No, I changed my mind,

334
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:20,227
The police told me you seemed
disoriented and abusive,

335
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,646
These guys were assholes, Claire,

336
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:25,482
- They seemed perfectly nice,
- They wouldn't leave,

337
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:28,068
They wanted me to, like, fill out a report,

338
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,028
Were you abusive?

339
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:34,783
This one cop kept spitting on me
when he talked, It was disgusting,

340
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:37,661
Did you use the word "dickhead"?

341
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,454
I don't remember,

342
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:43,750
Did you tell one cop to go...
have sex with the other cop's mother?

343
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:44,877
No,

344
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,964
- That's what they said,
- Not with that phrasing,

345
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:52,426
- Did you strike one of them?
- They were trying to come into the house,

346
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:55,178
- Oh, my God,
- No! I might have pushed him a little,

347
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,808
- They said you seemed disturbed,
- They were trying to search my house!

348
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,601
- You called them,
- Yes,

349
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:04,855
But I didn't actually want them to come,

350
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:06,982
So why did you call?

351
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:11,319
Because I was trying
to get this guy out of the house,

352
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,823
- What is this man's name?
- Hal,

353
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,950
Harold, Harold Dobbs,

354
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:21,705
Because the police said
that you were the only person there,

355
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:25,000
- Because he left before they got there,
- With the notebooks?

356
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,212
No, Claire, don't be stupid,
There are over a hundred notebooks,

357
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:32,716
He was only stealing one,
But he was stealing it to give it back to me,

358
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:36,636
So I let him go so he could play with his
band on the north side, What about this?

359
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,055
- His band?
- He was late,

360
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:43,726
He wanted me to come with him,
I was like, "Yeah, right,"

361
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,729
Is Harold Dobbs your boyfriend?

362
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:48,356
No,

363
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,775
- Are you sleeping with him?
- Ew!

364
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:53,111
No, He's a math geek,

365
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:55,947
And he's in a band?
A rock band?

366
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,825
No, A marching band,
He plays trombone,

367
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:02,078
Yes, A rock band,

368
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,207
- What is the name of this band?
- How should I know?

369
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:09,460
Harold Dobbs didn't tell you
the name of his rock band?

370
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:10,837
No,

371
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:13,423
Well, is Harold Dobbs...?

372
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:17,301
- Stop saying "Harold Dobbs,"
- Is this person...?

373
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:21,681
- Harold Dobbs exists,
- I'm sure he does,

374
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:24,642
He's a mathematician at
the University of Chicago,

375
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,644
Call the freaking math department,

376
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:34,569
Mitch has become
an excellent cook, It's like his hobby now,

377
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:36,696
He buys all these gadgets:

378
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:39,448
Garlic press, olive oil sprayer,

379
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:41,701
Every night there's something new,

380
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:45,454
The other day he made vegetarian chili,

381
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:48,958
What are you talking about?

382
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,627
Stay with us for a while,

383
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:53,379
I'm OK here,

384
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:56,924
Chicago is dead,
New York is so much more fun,

385
00:23:57,007 --> 00:24:01,720
Well, the fun thing is not really
where my head's at at the moment,

386
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:04,265
- You look so tired,
- I am,

387
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:07,226
- I just think you could use some downtime,
- Downtime?

388
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,311
Katie, please, you've had a hard time,

389
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:12,398
- I'm perfectly OK,
- I think you're upset and exhausted,

390
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,817
I was fine until you got here,

391
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,193
Wait,

392
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:19,488
Catherine!

393
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:21,907
Who is that?

394
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,622
Harold Dobbs!

395
00:24:29,123 --> 00:24:30,833
Hi,

396
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:32,543
OK?

397
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:36,505
I really don't need this, Claire,

398
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:41,552
I'm fine, you know, I'm totally fine, And then
you show up here with these questions,

399
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:45,722
Like, "Are you OK?" with that
soothing tone of voice, And... Oh,

400
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:50,519
The poor policemen, I think
the policemen can handle themselves,

401
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:53,522
And bagels and bananas and jojoba,

402
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:57,276
And "Come to New York,"
And vegetarian chili!

403
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:02,197
I mean, it really pisses me off,
so just save it,

404
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:08,036
- I'm Claire, I'm Catherine's sister,
- Oh, hi, Hal, Nice to meet you,

405
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,039
So he had to go back
and fix the paper in galleys,

406
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:15,168
He pretty much held it
together with baling wire,

407
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,757
This is a man who,
back in the UK, at the age of 22,

408
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:26,096
basically invented the mathematical
techniques for studying rational behavior

409
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:32,936
and gave the astrophysicists plenty
to think about when he came over here,

410
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:38,358
Men like Robert Llewellyn
come into the world very rarely,

411
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,905
And we will miss the man...
intensely,

412
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:48,535
But... the work will endure,

413
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:20,733
I'm not on the program,

414
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:27,323
Wow,

415
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:32,912
I can't believe how many people are here,
I never knew he had this many friends,

416
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:36,707
Where have you all been
for the last five years?

417
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:41,087
I guess to you guys
he was already dead, right?

418
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:46,259
I mean, what's a great man
without his greatness?

419
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:48,636
Just some old guy,

420
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,558
So you probably wanna catch up
on what you missed out on,

421
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:56,477
Um...

422
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,690
He used to read all day,
He kept demanding more and more books,

423
00:27:01,774 --> 00:27:07,404
I was getting them out of the library
by the carload, There were hundreds,

424
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:11,158
And then one day I realized
he wasn't reading,

425
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:16,247
He believed aliens
were sending him messages

426
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,916
through the Dewey decimal numbers
in the books,

427
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:21,669
He was trying to work out the code,

428
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:28,717
He used to shuffle around in his slippers,

429
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,178
He talked to himself,

430
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:34,390
He stank,

431
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:40,729
I had to make sure he bathed,
which was embarrassing,

432
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:44,525
Then he started writing
19, 20 hours a day,

433
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:49,655
I got him this huge case of notebooks,
He used every one,

434
00:27:49,696 --> 00:27:51,990
I dropped out of school,

435
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:58,080
You see, he was convinced that...

436
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:03,543
he was writing the most beautiful,
elegant proofs,

437
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,339
Proofs like music,

438
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,723
I'm glad he's dead,

439
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:23,814
Catherine,
Catherine,

440
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,163
Catherine,

441
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:46,836
Don't call the cops,

442
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,547
I can't believe I just said that,

443
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:53,593
No, it definitely pushed the envelope,

444
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:59,140
- I think I need to go home,
- Then I'll drive you,

445
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:01,434
No, that's OK,
I'm gonna walk,

446
00:29:01,518 --> 00:29:03,728
It's a long walk,

447
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,438
Thanks,

448
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:21,162
Their day care is excellent,
We're starting to apply for preschools now,

449
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:23,956
which locks you into a commitment,

450
00:29:24,957 --> 00:29:26,167
It does?

451
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,628
- Yeah,
- Yeah,

452
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:31,089
- Do you ever miss Chicago?
- No,

453
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:33,800
I mean, uh...

454
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:35,718
Um...

455
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:37,762
- No,
- You have the house now, though,

456
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:41,724
You and Mitch should move back
and fix it up,

457
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:44,769
You look great,

458
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,021
Claire gave it to me,

459
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:49,482
I... I like it,

460
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:51,734
It doesn't really fit,

461
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:53,402
Sure it does,

462
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:56,614
You can't prove it,

463
00:29:56,697 --> 00:30:00,076
Well, I can try and disprove the opposite,

464
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,495
I can prove that it doesn't not fit,

465
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,038
How?

466
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,749
I could take a vote,

467
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,503
To your old man,
Hell of a guy,

468
00:30:10,544 --> 00:30:11,712
Thank you,

469
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:14,173
Too bad he went nuts,

470
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:16,175
Hell of a guy anyway,

471
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:18,928
- What do you do?
- I'm a currency analyst,

472
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:23,349
I probably inherited
one thousandth of my father's talent,

473
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:25,976
- Are you a mathematician?
- Ooh, Christ, no,

474
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,771
Theoretical phys-physics,

475
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:31,982
- To the physicists,
- Drink up,

476
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,194
When do you think they'll leave?

477
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:39,031
No way to know,
Mathematicians are insane,

478
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:44,161
I went to this conference in Toronto last fall,
I have never been so exhausted in my life,

479
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:48,832
48 straight hours of
partying, drinking, drugs, papers, lectures,

480
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,959
- Drugs?
- Amphetamines mostly,

481
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:54,463
I don't, Some older guys, they're hooked,
They think they need it,

482
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:55,672
Why?

483
00:30:55,756 --> 00:31:00,844
There's this fear that your creativity peaks
around 23, then it's all downhill from there,

484
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:02,471
That's what my dad thought,

485
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:07,142
I guess all the really original work,
it's... all young guys,

486
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:10,604
- Young guys?
- No, there are some women,

487
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,356
Really? Who?

488
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:15,609
There's a woman at Stanford,
I can't remember her name,

489
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:17,402
Sophie Germain?

490
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:22,783
Yeah, I think I've seen her at meetings,
but I don't think I've ever met her,

491
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:26,036
She was born in Paris in 1776,

492
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:29,706
Then I've definitely never met her,

493
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,127
Ah, I'm... Sophie Germain,

494
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:38,506
- I'm stupid, Germain primes,
- Right,

495
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,800
Double them, add one,
you get another prime,

496
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:43,720
Like two is prime,
double plus one is five, also prime,

497
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:45,930
Right,

498
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:51,978
Or 92,305 times two
to the 16,998th plus one,

499
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:53,146
Right,

500
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:57,067
That's the biggest one,
the biggest known one,

501
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,361
Coming through!

502
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:03,865
Oh, what the hell are they doing here?

503
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:49,327
OK,

504
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:53,664
Now we'd like to play a song
in tribute to a great man,

505
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,958
a great mathematician,

506
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,962
It's called "i,"

507
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:05,384
One, two, one, two, three...

508
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:47,009
You're probably right,
That book I stole?

509
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:52,514
I'm starting to think it's the only lucid one,
and there's no math in it,

510
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,558
No,

511
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,602
I mean, I'll keep reading,

512
00:33:56,685 --> 00:34:00,147
but if I can't find anything
in the next couple of days...

513
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,858
Back to the hockey rink?

514
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,568
Yep,

515
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,820
And your own research,

516
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:10,616
Such as it is,

517
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,660
What's wrong with it?

518
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:16,872
The big ideas aren't there,

519
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:22,085
Well, it's not about big ideas,
It's... It's work,

520
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,379
You got to chip away at a problem,

521
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:29,384
- That's not what your dad did,
- I think it was, in a way,

522
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,433
I mean, he'd attack a problem from the
side, you know, from some weird angle,

523
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,977
Sneak up on it, grind away at it,

524
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,231
I don't know,

525
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:46,276
I don't know, I'm just guessing,

526
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:48,486
I enjoy teaching,

527
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,073
- You might come up with something,
- It's not gonna happen, I'm 26,

528
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:54,576
Remember the downward slope?

529
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:58,913
- Have you tried speed? I heard it helps,
- Yeah,

530
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:13,678
So...

531
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,473
This is my room,

532
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,321
Wow, You read a lot of math,

533
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:36,534
<i>No, I read Cosmo.
That's just window dressing,</i>

534
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:42,081
You're a mysterious person, Catherine,
You know that?

535
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:45,626
You want a drink?

536
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,128
I'm OK,

537
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,006
We never got
to celebrate your birthday,

538
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:52,758
OK,

539
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,853
Um...

540
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:07,231
I'm sorry, I just...
I'm a little drunk,

541
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:09,984
It's OK,

542
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:25,916
I'm a little out of practice,

543
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,840
I always liked you,

544
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:36,218
- You did?
- But then I thought:

545
00:36:36,302 --> 00:36:39,722
"You don't flirt
with your doctoral adviser's daughter,"

546
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:42,391
Especially when your adviser's crazy?

547
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:44,685
Especially then,

548
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:50,941
I saw you at my dad's office once,
Do you remember?

549
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:53,736
I can't believe you remember that,

550
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:56,363
I remember you,

551
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:58,532
I thought that you seemed...

552
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,369
not boring,

553
00:37:16,174 --> 00:37:18,427
Oh, I'm sorry,

554
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:22,389
Oh, I feel like
I'm gonna crack open like...

555
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:24,474
Like what?

556
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:27,269
An egg,

557
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:29,771
Or one of those really
smelly French cheeses

558
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:33,275
that ooze out everywhere
when you cut them,

559
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,444
Nice,

560
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:07,535
Catherine,

561
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:44,613
How long have you been up?

562
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:47,032
A while,

563
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:51,453
Is your sister up?

564
00:39:51,537 --> 00:39:53,998
No,

565
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:58,001
Her flight leaves in a couple of hours,
I should probably wake her,

566
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,546
Let her sleep,
She did some serious drinking

567
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:04,007
with the theoretical physicists last night,

568
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:09,763
I'll make her some coffee
when she gets up,

569
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:15,102
Sunday mornings I usually go out,
get the paper, have some breakfast,

570
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:17,729
OK,

571
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,233
Do you wanna come?

572
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:23,318
Oh,

573
00:40:23,402 --> 00:40:26,405
Well, I should probably stick around
until Claire leaves,

574
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:28,156
OK,

575
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,995
Do you mind if I stay?

576
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,747
No,

577
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:39,751
You can work if you want,

578
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:41,920
All right,

579
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:45,340
- Should I?
- You can if you want to,

580
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:47,676
- Do you want me to go?
- Do you wanna go?

581
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:51,012
- I wanna stay here with you,
- Oh,

582
00:40:51,096 --> 00:40:53,598
Wanna spend the day with you,
if at all possible,

583
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,017
I wanna spend
as much time with you as I can,

584
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:58,687
unless I'm coming on way too strong
and scaring you,

585
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,400
in which case
I'll begin back-pedaling immediately,

586
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:19,499
How embarrassing is it if I say
last night was wonderful?

587
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:23,169
It's only embarrassing
if I don't agree,

588
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,964
So?

589
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,341
Don't be embarrassed,

590
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:38,142
What?

591
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:48,319
Here,

592
00:41:53,074 --> 00:41:56,828
The drawer in the desk
in my dad's office,

593
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:59,205
What's in there?

594
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:08,631
Now?

595
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:45,125
- Good morning,
- Please, don't yell, Please,

596
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:47,711
- Are you all right?
- No,

597
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:50,756
- Theoretical physicists,
- What happened?

598
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:54,051
Thanks a lot for
leaving me alone with them,

599
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,054
That band,

600
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:58,138
Yeah,

601
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:03,268
- They were terrible,
- They were OK, They had fun, I think,

602
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:07,648
Well, as long as everybody had fun,
Your dress turned out all right,

603
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:10,484
- I love it,
- You do?

604
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,569
Yeah, It's wonderful,

605
00:43:12,653 --> 00:43:15,948
- I was surprised you even wore it,
- I love it, Claire,

606
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,533
Thanks,

607
00:43:18,283 --> 00:43:21,453
You're welcome,
Well, you're in a good mood,

608
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:25,916
- Should I not be?
- Are you kidding? No, I'm thrilled,

609
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:27,876
It's just... I...

610
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,337
Hold on a second, Katie,
I just...

611
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:34,800
- I'm leaving soon, and...
- I know, You said,

612
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:37,552
I would still like you
to come to New York,

613
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:40,263
Yes, January,

614
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:45,852
I would like you to move to New York,

615
00:43:46,603 --> 00:43:48,105
Move?

616
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:52,067
You could stay with me and Mitch at first,
and then you could get your own place,

617
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:57,030
I've already scouted some apartments
for you, Really cute places,

618
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:59,115
What would I do in New York?

619
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,203
You could do whatever you want, You
could work, You could go back to school,

620
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:05,580
I don't know, Claire,
this is pretty major,

621
00:44:05,664 --> 00:44:08,625
I realize that,

622
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,044
I know you mean well, OK?

623
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:14,923
Well, to be honest,
you were right yesterday,

624
00:44:15,006 --> 00:44:17,550
It's been a pretty weird couple of years,

625
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:21,346
and I think I'd just like to take some time
and figure things out,

626
00:44:21,388 --> 00:44:26,059
But it would be much easier for me to get
you set up in an apartment in New York,

627
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:28,770
I don't need an apartment,
I'll stay in the house,

628
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:31,481
We're selling the house,

629
00:44:31,898 --> 00:44:33,441
What?

630
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:37,946
I'm hoping to do the paperwork this week,
I know that seems sudden,

631
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:41,366
No one was here looking at the place,
Who are you selling it to?

632
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:44,577
The university,
They've wanted it back for years,

633
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:45,912
I live here,

634
00:44:45,995 --> 00:44:48,456
Come to New York,
We'll have so much fun,

635
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:50,875
- I don't believe this,
- It would be so good,

636
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:55,171
You deserve a change, This would be
a whole new adventure for you,

637
00:44:55,213 --> 00:44:57,924
- Why are you doing this?
- I want to help,

638
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:00,259
By kicking me out of my house?

639
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:04,806
- This is my house, too,
- Please! You haven't lived here for years,

640
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:10,061
I know that, You were on your own, I really
regret that, Katie, And now I want to help,

641
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:11,896
You wanna help now?

642
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:13,564
Yes,

643
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:16,442
Dad is dead,

644
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:18,110
- I know,
- He's dead,

645
00:45:18,194 --> 00:45:22,657
Now that he's dead, you fly in for
the weekend and decide you wanna help?

646
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:27,828
You're late, Where have you been?
Where were you five years ago?

647
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:30,748
- I was working,
- I was here,

648
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:33,626
I lived with him alone,

649
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:36,670
I was working 14-hour days,

650
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:41,467
I paid off the mortgage on this house while
living in a studio apartment in Brooklyn,

651
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,928
You had a life,
You got to finish school,

652
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:46,096
- You could've finished school,
- How?

653
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,225
I told you a million times
to do anything you wanted,

654
00:45:49,308 --> 00:45:52,770
- And what about Dad?
- He was ill,

655
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:56,273
He should've been in a full-time
professional care situation,

656
00:45:56,315 --> 00:45:59,193
He didn't belong in the nuthouse,

657
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:04,490
- He might have been better off,
- He needed to be here in his own house,

658
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:06,950
near everything
that made him happy,

659
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:08,577
Maybe,

660
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:12,247
Or maybe some real professional care
would have done him more good

661
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:15,834
than rattling around in this mausoleum
with you looking after him,

662
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:19,797
What about his remission? Three years
ago, he was healthy for almost a year,

663
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,342
- Then he went downhill again,
- He might have been worse in a hospital,

664
00:46:23,425 --> 00:46:27,763
He might have been better,
Did he ever do any work again?

665
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:30,724
- No,
- No, And you might have been better,

666
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:36,271
Better... than what?

667
00:46:36,355 --> 00:46:38,440
You had so much talent,

668
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:43,528
You think I'm like Dad,

669
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:46,656
I think you have some of his talent

670
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,869
and some of his tendency
toward instability,

671
00:46:50,952 --> 00:46:53,330
Claire,

672
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:58,543
In addition to the cute apartments
that you've scouted for me in New York,

673
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:02,005
have you by any chance devoted
some of your considerable energies

674
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:06,968
towards scouting out another type of living
facility for your bughouse little sister?

675
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,846
No, Absolutely not,
That is not what this is about,

676
00:47:09,888 --> 00:47:12,223
Don't lie to me, Claire,

677
00:47:13,224 --> 00:47:15,894
- The resources that I've investigated...
- My God,

678
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:20,148
If you wanted, All I'm saying is, the doctors
and the people in New York are the best,

679
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,525
- Jesus!
- You wouldn't have to live...

680
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:23,902
- I hate you!
- Don't yell,

681
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:26,654
I hate you!

682
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:29,824
What are you doing here?

683
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:32,827
How long have you known about this?

684
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:35,079
A while,

685
00:47:35,538 --> 00:47:37,707
Why didn't you tell me about it?

686
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,210
I wasn't sure if I wanted to,

687
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:45,131
Thank you,

688
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:48,009
You're welcome,

689
00:47:48,051 --> 00:47:51,262
- What's going on?
- Catherine, thank you,

690
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:53,640
- I thought you might like to see it,
- What is it?

691
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:55,433
- It's incredible,
- What is it?

692
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:57,560
Oh, it's a result, a proof,

693
00:47:57,643 --> 00:48:01,147
It looks like a proof, It is a proof,
A very long proof,

694
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,735
I haven't read through it all yet or checked
it, I don't even know if I could check it,

695
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:11,491
But if it's a proof of what I think
it's a proof of, it's a very important proof,

696
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:13,034
What does it prove?

697
00:48:13,117 --> 00:48:17,622
It looks like it proves a mathematical
theorem about prime numbers

698
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:21,918
which mathematicians have been trying
to prove since there were mathematicians,

699
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:24,921
You know about this?

700
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:28,966
- Is it any good?
- It's historic, if it checks out,

701
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,219
What does it mean?

702
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:35,139
It means that when everybody
thought your dad was crazy,

703
00:48:35,222 --> 00:48:37,767
he did some of the most
important mathematics ever,

704
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,896
If it checks out, it means you publish
instantly, You hold press conferences,

705
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:44,231
It means that all newspapers
around the world

706
00:48:44,273 --> 00:48:47,401
are gonna want to talk to the person
who found this notebook,

707
00:48:47,485 --> 00:48:50,613
- Catherine,
- Catherine,

708
00:48:50,696 --> 00:48:53,073
I didn't find it,

709
00:48:53,115 --> 00:48:55,534
- Yes, you did,
- No, I didn't,

710
00:48:56,535 --> 00:48:59,163
- Did you find it or did Hal find it?
- I didn't find it,

711
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:01,457
I didn't find it,

712
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:06,337
I wrote it,

713
00:49:29,193 --> 00:49:30,903
- Hey, guys,
- Where you headed?

714
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:34,573
- I'm late for Bhandari,
- You know what he's like, Better get there,

715
00:49:34,656 --> 00:49:37,576
Catch you later,

716
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:52,966
Yeah,

717
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,261
Ah, Catherine,

718
00:49:56,344 --> 00:49:59,890
- So nice of you to drop by,
- Sorry I'm late,

719
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:04,478
- This work of yours...
- I know, I'm sorry,

720
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:07,439
- I mean, it's interesting,
- You think so?

721
00:50:07,522 --> 00:50:11,109
In that it has nothing to do with
the problems I'd asked you to solve,

722
00:50:11,193 --> 00:50:13,194
- It won't happen again,
- What happened?

723
00:50:13,236 --> 00:50:15,614
You simply couldn't control yourself?

724
00:50:15,697 --> 00:50:20,869
No, I just... I thought I should get all those
ideas down while they were in my head,

725
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,873
and then it was morning,
and I couldn't come in with nothing,

726
00:50:24,914 --> 00:50:28,293
But this is the third time
that inspiration's overtaken you

727
00:50:28,376 --> 00:50:32,130
just at the moment when
you had to submit to my idea

728
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:34,340
of what it is you should be learning,

729
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:38,178
- A third? Really,
- Differential equations don't interest you,

730
00:50:38,261 --> 00:50:41,598
No, they do, I mean...
Yeah, they absolutely do,

731
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:44,350
Oh, but they didn't last night,

732
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:46,477
Not as much as usual,

733
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,775
I mean...

734
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:56,988
I'm worried that your work
is deteriorating,

735
00:50:57,071 --> 00:51:04,662
There are some good ideas here, but...
it isn't a coherent mathematical argument,

736
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:09,375
- Well, I didn't get time to finish it,
- But mathematics isn't jazz,

737
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:13,087
Even the craziest mathematics
is working towards a proof,

738
00:51:13,129 --> 00:51:16,132
Not all the mathematicians
in my family are crazy,

739
00:51:16,215 --> 00:51:22,555
- I wasn't using the word in a clinical way,
- I know, I know, Just for the record,

740
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:28,019
How is your father?

741
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:32,398
I don't know, I haven't been able
to get in touch with him for a week,

742
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:34,525
He's fine,

743
00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:40,656
Last time I talked to him, he was fine, He's
been fine for months now, Nine months,

744
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,783
He was a great man,

745
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,702
He still is,

746
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:50,583
You're gonna fail me, aren't you?

747
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:55,129
I'm giving you another chance
to redo the problem set,

748
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:59,175
You need an A,
You're quite capable of earning one,

749
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,596
Thank you,

750
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:08,851
- Professor Bhandari?
- Yeah,

751
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:11,103
Don't worry about me, OK?

752
00:52:11,186 --> 00:52:17,234
I'm gonna write you a really nice fat set
of answers that you're really gonna like,

753
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,855
<i> Hi. We're not here.
Please leave a message.</i>

754
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:59,568
Claire? Hi, Listen,
When was the last time you spoke to Dad?

755
00:53:01,903 --> 00:53:04,072
Tuesday? Oh, God,

756
00:53:04,906 --> 00:53:07,909
It's fine, It's just that
I normally talk to him every day,

757
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,163
and I haven't been able
to get ahold of him,

758
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:15,083
Well, I'm glad that
you're sure everything's fine,

759
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,420
I feel much more comfortable,
Thank you,

760
00:53:19,504 --> 00:53:23,550
What could have happened?
I mean, he could've had a car accident,

761
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,094
He could've fallen and broken his hip,

762
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:30,598
He could be running naked
down the Midway for all I know,

763
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:35,437
Yes, Claire, I know
that you care about Dad,

764
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,526
Yeah, as much as me, OK,
Now can I please get off the phone?

765
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:16,310
Dad?

766
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:22,441
Hello!

767
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:41,627
Dad?

768
00:54:58,602 --> 00:54:59,728
Dad!

769
00:55:34,346 --> 00:55:36,723
Dad?

770
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:38,851
Catherine, hi,
What a surprise,

771
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:42,688
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm thinking,

772
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,606
Writing,

773
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,401
It's 30 degrees,
It's the middle of the night,

774
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:50,404
- I know,
- Well, aren't you cold?

775
00:55:50,445 --> 00:55:53,907
Of course I am,
I'm freezing my ass off.

776
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:56,326
So what are you doing out here?

777
00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:02,374
It's too hot in the house, The radiators
clank and I couldn't concentrate,

778
00:56:06,753 --> 00:56:09,881
I've been calling and calling,
Did you not get my messages?

779
00:56:09,923 --> 00:56:12,259
It's a distraction,

780
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,595
I didn't know what was going on,
I had to drive all the way out here,

781
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:18,139
I can see that,

782
00:56:18,223 --> 00:56:21,935
- Why don't you answer the phone?
- I'm sorry, Catherine,

783
00:56:22,018 --> 00:56:26,773
But it's a question of priorities,
and work takes priority, You know that,

784
00:56:26,856 --> 00:56:29,276
You're working?

785
00:56:29,317 --> 00:56:32,112
Goddamn it!

786
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:34,489
I'm working!

787
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,536
I mean, I say "I,"

788
00:56:40,787 --> 00:56:42,997
Machinery,

789
00:56:43,081 --> 00:56:46,501
The machinery's working, Catherine,

790
00:56:46,584 --> 00:56:51,965
It's on full blast,
All the cylinders are firing,

791
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:54,342
I'm on fire,

792
00:56:55,510 --> 00:57:00,181
That's why I came out here to cool off,
I haven't felt like this for years,

793
00:57:00,265 --> 00:57:02,016
- You're kidding,
- No,

794
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:06,813
- I don't believe it,
- I don't believe it either, but it's true,

795
00:57:06,854 --> 00:57:09,649
It started about a week ago,
I woke up,

796
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:12,652
I came downstairs,
made a cup of coffee,

797
00:57:12,735 --> 00:57:17,198
Before I could pour the milk in, it was like
someone turned the light on in my head,

798
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:20,660
- Really?
- Not the light, The whole grid, I lit up!

799
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:22,954
It's like no time has passed
since I was 21,

800
00:57:22,995 --> 00:57:25,623
- You're kidding me,
- No, I'm back,

801
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:30,086
I'm back, In touch with the source!
The font,

802
00:57:30,169 --> 00:57:34,340
Whatever the source of my creativity was
all those years ago, I'm in contact with it,

803
00:57:34,423 --> 00:57:38,386
I'm sitting on it, It's a geyser,
and I'm shooting up in the air on top of it,

804
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:40,805
God,

805
00:57:40,846 --> 00:57:45,309
I'm not talking about divine inspiration, It's
not funneling into my head, onto the page,

806
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:49,188
I'm not saying it won't be a lot of work,
It will be, a tremendous amount of work,

807
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:53,275
It's not gonna be easy,
But the raw material is there,

808
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,986
I see places for the work to go,
new techniques,

809
00:57:56,028 --> 00:58:01,409
I'm gonna get whole branches
of the profession talking to each other,

810
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:03,369
I'm sorry,

811
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,788
I'm being rude,

812
00:58:07,957 --> 00:58:10,626
- How's school?
- School's fine,

813
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:12,545
- You're working hard?
- Sure,

814
00:58:12,628 --> 00:58:14,505
- Faculty treating you all right?
- Yes,

815
00:58:14,547 --> 00:58:15,923
- Made any friends?
- Yes,

816
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:17,091
- You dating?
- Dad,

817
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:20,052
No details necessary
if you don't want to provide them,

818
00:58:20,094 --> 00:58:23,597
School is fine, OK?
I want to talk about what you're doing,

819
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:25,933
Great, Let's talk,

820
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:27,893
- This work...
- Yes,

821
00:58:27,976 --> 00:58:30,604
- It's here?
- Part of it, yes,

822
00:58:30,688 --> 00:58:33,065
- Can I see it?
- It's all at a very early stage,

823
00:58:33,148 --> 00:58:34,858
- I don't care,
- It's not complete,

824
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,487
To be honest, it's all in progress,
I think we're talking years,

825
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:42,116
Dad, it's OK,
Just let me see anything,

826
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:44,701
- You really want to?
- Yes,

827
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:48,830
- You're genuinely interested?
- Dad, of course,

828
00:58:48,914 --> 00:58:51,375
Of course, It is your field,

829
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,210
Yes,

830
00:58:53,252 --> 00:58:55,754
You know how happy that makes me?

831
00:58:55,796 --> 00:58:58,090
Yes,

832
00:58:58,131 --> 00:59:02,594
I think there's enough here to keep me
working the rest of my life, And not just me,

833
00:59:02,636 --> 00:59:08,934
I was starting to imagine I was finished,
Catherine, Really finished,

834
00:59:09,017 --> 00:59:13,230
I was terrified I'd never work again,
Did you know that?

835
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:18,235
- I wondered,
- I was absolutely bloody terrified,

836
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:23,657
Then I remembered something,
I remembered you,

837
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:28,995
Your creative years were just beginning,
You'd get your degree, do your own work,

838
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:33,375
If you hadn't gone into math,
that would've been all right,

839
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:37,879
Now, Claire's done well for herself,
I'm satisfied with her,

840
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:40,840
I'm proud of you!

841
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:46,805
I know you've got your own work,
and I don't want you to neglect that,

842
00:59:46,888 --> 00:59:50,809
You mustn't neglect it,
But I could probably use some help,

843
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:54,646
To be honest, I'd like you to help me,
to work with me, if you want to,

844
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:58,525
If you can work it out with your class
schedule, I could help you with that,

845
00:59:58,608 --> 01:00:01,736
Make some calls,
talk to your teachers,

846
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:06,199
I'm sorry,
I'm getting ahead of myself,

847
01:00:06,282 --> 01:00:09,118
Oh, Jesus, look, enough bullshit,

848
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,163
You asked to see something,
Let's start with this,

849
01:00:12,205 --> 01:00:17,335
I have roughed something out,
It's a general outline for a proof,

850
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:20,296
It's a major result,
It's important,

851
01:00:21,297 --> 01:00:25,802
It's not finished, but, uh...
you can see where it's going,

852
01:00:29,555 --> 01:00:32,100
Uh...

853
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:36,938
Here,

854
01:00:49,283 --> 01:00:51,619
It's very rough,

855
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:02,463
- Was there any other work in here?
- No, That's the only...

856
01:01:02,546 --> 01:01:04,882
Can I see it?

857
01:01:11,347 --> 01:01:12,890
I'm sorry, I just...

858
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:18,020
So you wrote this incredible thing,
but you didn't tell anyone?

859
01:01:19,063 --> 01:01:21,899
I'm telling you both now,

860
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:26,236
Catherine, I'm sorry,
but I just find this very hard to believe,

861
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,322
- Claire...
- This is Dad's handwriting,

862
01:01:28,405 --> 01:01:30,616
It's not,

863
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:33,535
- It looks exactly like it,
- That is my writing,

864
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:35,913
I'm sorry,

865
01:01:35,954 --> 01:01:39,041
Well, ask Hal, He's been
looking at Dad's writing all week,

866
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:42,544
- Well, I don't know,
- Hal, come on,

867
01:01:45,422 --> 01:01:49,718
- I'm not a handwriting expert,
- Well, whose writing does it look like?

868
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,096
It looks... I don't know
what Catherine's handwriting looks like,

869
01:01:53,138 --> 01:01:55,349
It looks like that,

870
01:01:55,432 --> 01:01:56,808
OK,

871
01:01:56,892 --> 01:01:59,228
You know what I think?
I think it's early,

872
01:01:59,269 --> 01:02:03,690
and everybody's tired and not in
the best state to make emotional decisions,

873
01:02:03,774 --> 01:02:07,986
- So let's just all take a breath,
- You don't believe me,

874
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,656
Well, I really don't know
anything about this,

875
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:12,532
Never mind,

876
01:02:13,658 --> 01:02:18,205
I don't know why I expected you
to believe me about anything,

877
01:02:19,081 --> 01:02:22,793
Could you tell us the proof?
And then that would show that it was yours,

878
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:24,920
You wouldn't understand it,

879
01:02:25,003 --> 01:02:28,131
Well, tell it to Hal,

880
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:32,469
I mean, I could, We could sit down
and talk it through, It might take a while,

881
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:36,473
- You can't use the book,
- For God's sake, it's 40 pages long,

882
01:02:36,514 --> 01:02:40,644
I didn't memorize it,
It's not a muffin recipe,

883
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:43,855
Oh, Jesus, this is stupid,

884
01:02:43,938 --> 01:02:45,815
- Hal, tell her,
- Tell her what?

885
01:02:45,899 --> 01:02:49,235
- Whose book is that?
- I don't know,

886
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,156
What is the matter with you?

887
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:57,494
You've been...
You've been going through this other stuff,

888
01:02:57,577 --> 01:03:00,622
You know there's nothing
even remotely like that up here,

889
01:03:00,705 --> 01:03:03,041
- Catherine...
- OK, OK,

890
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,378
OK, we'll sit down
and I'll talk you through the proof,

891
01:03:07,462 --> 01:03:09,506
OK? OK?

892
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:12,050
If Claire will please
let me have my book back,

893
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:15,011
All right, OK, talk him through it,

894
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:18,181
- It still wouldn't prove that she wrote it,
- Why not?

895
01:03:18,264 --> 01:03:21,517
Your dad may have written it
and explained it to you later,

896
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:24,395
I'm not saying he did,
I'm saying there's no proof that...

897
01:03:24,479 --> 01:03:30,318
Of course there isn't, But come on!
He didn't write it, He couldn't have,

898
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,820
Even in the year he was well,
he couldn't work,

899
01:03:32,862 --> 01:03:35,615
You know that,
You're supposed to be a scientist,

900
01:03:35,698 --> 01:03:39,202
Here's my suggestion, I know
three or four guys at the department,

901
01:03:39,285 --> 01:03:42,038
sharp, disinterested people,
who knew your dad's work,

902
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:43,748
- I'll take this to them,
- What?

903
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:47,168
I'll tell them that
we found something potentially major,

904
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,795
We're not sure of the authorship,
I'll sit with them,

905
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:52,965
We'll talk through it,
and we'll figure out what we've got,

906
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:56,719
It might take a couple days,
but then we'd have a lot more information,

907
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:59,430
I think that's an excellent suggestion,

908
01:03:59,513 --> 01:04:01,098
- You can't,
- Catherine,

909
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:03,059
- You can't take it,
- I am not taking it,

910
01:04:03,142 --> 01:04:06,687
- This is exactly what you wanted,
- Oh, come on, Jesus...

911
01:04:06,771 --> 01:04:09,940
You don't waste any time, do you?
It's no hesitation,

912
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:13,110
You can't wait to show them
your brilliant discovery,

913
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:16,822
- I am trying to determine what this is,
- I'm telling you what it is,

914
01:04:16,906 --> 01:04:18,240
- You don't know!
- I wrote it!

915
01:04:18,324 --> 01:04:20,659
It is your father's handwriting!

916
01:04:24,371 --> 01:04:27,875
At least, it looks an awful lot
like the writing in the other books,

917
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:31,754
Maybe your writing looks exactly like his,
I don't know,

918
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:35,633
It does look like his,

919
01:04:35,716 --> 01:04:39,303
I mean, it's one of his notebooks,
the exact same kind he used,

920
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:42,890
I told you,
He gave it to me,

921
01:04:46,393 --> 01:04:48,854
I didn't show this to anyone,

922
01:04:51,064 --> 01:04:56,778
I wanted you to be the first to see it,
I didn't know I wanted that until last night,

923
01:04:57,946 --> 01:05:00,657
- I trusted you,
- I know,

924
01:05:00,741 --> 01:05:03,118
- Was I wrong?
- No,

925
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,705
I should've known that she
wouldn't believe me, but why don't you?

926
01:05:06,788 --> 01:05:10,208
I know how hard it would be
to come up with something like this,

927
01:05:10,292 --> 01:05:13,128
You'd have to be your dad
at the peak of his powers,

928
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:16,298
Just because you
and the rest of the geeks worshipped him

929
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:18,050
does not mean he wrote the proof,

930
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:21,970
He was the best, My generation
hasn't produced anything like him,

931
01:05:22,054 --> 01:05:24,931
He revolutionized the field
twice before he was 22,

932
01:05:24,973 --> 01:05:28,310
I am sorry, You took some classes
at Northwestern for a few months,

933
01:05:28,351 --> 01:05:32,606
- My education wasn't at Northwestern!
- Even so, it doesn't matter,

934
01:05:32,647 --> 01:05:37,277
It's too advanced,
I don't even understand most of it,

935
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:40,322
- You think it's too advanced?
- Yes,

936
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:42,699
It's too advanced for you,

937
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:45,994
You could not have done this work,

938
01:05:46,786 --> 01:05:49,372
- But what if I did?
- Well, what if?

939
01:05:50,123 --> 01:05:53,168
It would be a real disaster for you,

940
01:05:54,044 --> 01:05:56,004
Wouldn't it?

941
01:05:56,087 --> 01:05:59,799
You and the other geeks
who barely finished your PhD's,

942
01:05:59,841 --> 01:06:02,844
who are marking time
doing lame research,

943
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:05,680
bragging about
the conferences they go to,

944
01:06:05,722 --> 01:06:07,682
Wow,

945
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:13,354
Playing in an awful band and whining
that they're intellectually past it at 26,

946
01:06:13,438 --> 01:06:16,316
because they are!

947
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:31,122
Catherine,

948
01:06:31,289 --> 01:06:32,749
Catherine,

949
01:06:32,832 --> 01:06:33,958
Oh!

950
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:44,427
When are you going to do
some mathematics with me?

951
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:47,638
I can't think of anything worse,
You want some Parmesan?

952
01:06:47,722 --> 01:06:51,184
I'm all alone, I have important things
to say, and you're not helping,

953
01:06:51,225 --> 01:06:54,145
- You used to love it,
- Not anymore,

954
01:06:54,228 --> 01:06:56,731
You knew prime numbers
before you could read,

955
01:06:56,814 --> 01:07:01,277
- Well, now I've forgotten,
- Don't be lazy, Catherine!

956
01:07:03,154 --> 01:07:07,074
I haven't been lazy,
I've been taking care of you,

957
01:07:08,117 --> 01:07:10,995
You dropped out of school,
You sleep till noon,

958
01:07:11,078 --> 01:07:13,831
You eat junk, You don't work,
Dishes pile up in the sink,

959
01:07:13,914 --> 01:07:17,585
- Some days you don't even get out of bed,
- Those are the good days,

960
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:21,881
They're fever days and you sweated them
away, You'll never know what work you lost

961
01:07:21,922 --> 01:07:25,551
because you were moping, moping
in your unmade bad, Always moping,

962
01:07:25,634 --> 01:07:28,554
Up until four in the afternoon sometimes,
Catherine,

963
01:07:28,596 --> 01:07:32,224
I have you on my clock,
You know I'm right,

964
01:07:32,266 --> 01:07:37,271
You know, I'm told by some very important
people, You know I know,

965
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:43,193
- I've lost a few days,
- How many?

966
01:07:43,277 --> 01:07:45,612
- I don't know,
- I bet you do, I bet you count,

967
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:48,949
- Knock it off,
- How many days have you lost?

968
01:07:48,991 --> 01:07:51,869
- A month, Around a month,
- Exactly,

969
01:07:51,952 --> 01:07:54,955
- Dad, eat your dinner,
- How many?

970
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:58,500
- 33 days,
- Be precise, for Christ's sake,

971
01:07:58,584 --> 01:08:00,961
I slept till noon today,

972
01:08:07,926 --> 01:08:10,762
Make it 33 and a quarter days,

973
01:08:10,804 --> 01:08:13,056
Yeah, all right,

974
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,183
- You're kidding,
- No,

975
01:08:15,267 --> 01:08:18,186
- Amazing number,
- It's a depressing fucking number,

976
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:22,649
If every day you lost were a year, it would
be a very interesting fucking number,

977
01:08:22,733 --> 01:08:27,070
- 33 and a quarter years is not interesting,
- Stop it, You know exactly what I mean,

978
01:08:27,154 --> 01:08:30,574
- 1729 weeks,
- 1729, Great number,

979
01:08:30,657 --> 01:08:34,786
The smallest number expressible as the
sum of two cubes in two different ways,

980
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:37,873
12 cubed plus 1 cubed equals 1729,

981
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:42,085
And 10 cubed plus 9 cubed...
Yes, we've got it, Thank you,

982
01:08:42,169 --> 01:08:44,379
You see?

983
01:08:44,462 --> 01:08:47,674
Even your depression
is mathematical,

984
01:08:47,716 --> 01:08:49,718
Stop moping,

985
01:08:51,886 --> 01:08:54,264
Do some work,

986
01:09:02,313 --> 01:09:04,649
Take a look,

987
01:09:23,877 --> 01:09:25,712
<i> Catherine?</i>

988
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:31,092
Katie, honey?

989
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,941
Catherine,

990
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,461
I figured out how to get
a lower bound for L,

991
01:10:09,463 --> 01:10:12,174
Modification of Landau-Siegel,

992
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:16,012
What if this L had a Siegel zero?

993
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,891
You'd need an effective version,

994
01:10:25,938 --> 01:10:27,064
Shit,

995
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:09,082
Catherine,

996
01:12:13,628 --> 01:12:15,630
Catherine!

997
01:13:39,505 --> 01:13:41,924
Catherine!

998
01:13:41,966 --> 01:13:44,051
- What?
- Aah! Jesus!

999
01:13:46,136 --> 01:13:49,807
God, you scared me,
What are you doing there?

1000
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,852
Sorry, I just...
I wanted to...

1001
01:13:53,936 --> 01:13:56,939
It's wonderful news,

1002
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,982
I think I've got it,

1003
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:05,948
Catherine!

1004
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:07,282
Katie,

1005
01:14:07,324 --> 01:14:10,452
- Katie, what is it?
- It's not mine, It's not mine!

1006
01:14:10,536 --> 01:14:13,914
- It's not mine, It's his, It's not mine,
- What, honey?

1007
01:14:13,997 --> 01:14:18,460
- It's not mine, It's not mine,
- What, honey? What's the matter?

1008
01:14:19,503 --> 01:14:22,256
I stole it from him,
I stole it, It's not mine,

1009
01:14:22,339 --> 01:14:25,801
- What do you mean, you stole it?
- It's not mine,

1010
01:14:25,884 --> 01:14:26,969
OK,

1011
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:30,055
- I killed him, I killed him,
- No, honey, No,

1012
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:33,475
I never should have written it,
I never should have written it,

1013
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:37,854
- OK, You're OK,
- I never should have written it,

1014
01:14:37,938 --> 01:14:41,400
Is it...?
Is it possible, honey, that...?

1015
01:14:43,068 --> 01:14:46,822
Is it possible that you
just wanted to so badly

1016
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:53,954
and you... you deserved to do something
special like this thing, this proof?

1017
01:14:54,037 --> 01:14:58,458
Is it possible
that you just imagined that you wrote it?

1018
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:00,794
Hmm?

1019
01:15:00,877 --> 01:15:05,590
Is it possible
that it really was Dad's after all?

1020
01:15:06,591 --> 01:15:08,510
Hmm?

1021
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:10,887
Is that possible?

1022
01:15:14,224 --> 01:15:17,310
You didn't kill him, sweetheart,

1023
01:15:17,394 --> 01:15:19,854
He just died, that's all,

1024
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,526
He just died,

1025
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:30,365
<i> Hi. We're not here.
Please leave a message.</i>

1026
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:35,245
<i> Catherine, it's me again.
I really need to speak to you,</i>

1027
01:15:35,286 --> 01:15:37,789
<i>so please call me back.</i>

1028
01:16:01,187 --> 01:16:03,606
Can I take these for you?

1029
01:16:05,942 --> 01:16:07,652
Claire!

1030
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:12,949
- I thought you'd left,
- I had to delay my flight,

1031
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:17,203
Where's Catherine?
I need to talk to her,

1032
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:19,288
- She's inside,
- This thing...

1033
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:22,083
checks out,

1034
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:25,670
I've been over it with two sets of guys,
old geeks and young geeks,

1035
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:27,380
It's weird,

1036
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:30,883
I don't know where the techniques
come from, it is very hard to follow,

1037
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:33,469
but we can't find anything wrong with it,

1038
01:16:33,552 --> 01:16:37,264
I mean, there may be something
wrong with it, but we can't find it,

1039
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:39,600
I have not slept,

1040
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,771
It's real,

1041
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:44,772
Thank you,

1042
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:47,399
See, I had to swear these guys to secrecy,

1043
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:49,526
They were jumping out of their skins,

1044
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,737
One email, it's all over,

1045
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,281
I threatened them,
Yeah, I think we're safe,

1046
01:16:54,365 --> 01:16:56,700
They're physical cowards,

1047
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:01,413
- Where's Catherine?
- This is not a good time,

1048
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:05,250
You're leaving?

1049
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:08,545
- The flight is at noon,
- You're taking her away?

1050
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:10,255
Yes,

1051
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:11,965
- To New York?
- Yes,

1052
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:15,177
- You're just gonna drag her away?
- She's entirely happy to come,

1053
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:19,223
- I'd like to speak to Catherine,
- She doesn't want to see you,

1054
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:21,308
Does she have any say
in whether she goes?

1055
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:23,936
She's been completely out of it, Hal,

1056
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:26,647
Five days she wasn't speaking,

1057
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:33,904
Do you want your coat, sweetie?
It's cold,

1058
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:38,659
I'll get your things, The movers
will get anything we've forgotten,

1059
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,036
Are you all right?

1060
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,008
It works,

1061
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:57,677
I thought you might wanna know,

1062
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:02,349
- I had to see you,
- I'm leaving,

1063
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:06,978
- Just wait a minute,
- What? What do you want?

1064
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:09,731
You have the book,
She told me that she gave it to you,

1065
01:18:09,814 --> 01:18:13,318
so do whatever you want with it,

1066
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:16,738
Publish, Go for it,
Have a press conference,

1067
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,657
Tell the world
what my father discovered,

1068
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:22,494
I don't think your father wrote it,

1069
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:28,708
- You thought so last week,
- That was last week,

1070
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,128
I spent this week reading the proof,
I think I understand it,

1071
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:35,089
It uses a lot of newer
mathematical techniques,

1072
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:37,800
things that were developed
in the '80s and '90s,

1073
01:18:37,884 --> 01:18:40,261
Noncommutative geometry,
random matrices,

1074
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:44,265
I think I learned more mathematics this
week than in three years of grad school,

1075
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:46,601
- So?
- So the proof is very...

1076
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:50,271
- hip,
- Get some sleep, Hal,

1077
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:54,192
- What was your father doing for 20 years?
- Are you done?

1078
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,986
He wouldn't have been able to master
those new techniques,

1079
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,405
- He was a genius,
- But he was nuts,

1080
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:01,908
- So he read about them later,
- Maybe,

1081
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:05,620
The books he would've needed
are upstairs in your room, some of them,

1082
01:19:05,703 --> 01:19:09,624
He dated everything, Even his
most incoherent entries, he dated,

1083
01:19:09,707 --> 01:19:11,959
- There are no dates in this,
- The handwriting,

1084
01:19:12,043 --> 01:19:14,462
Parents and children can
have similar handwriting,

1085
01:19:14,504 --> 01:19:18,132
especially if they've spent
a lot of time together,

1086
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:22,178
Interesting theory,

1087
01:19:22,261 --> 01:19:24,263
I like it,

1088
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:27,183
I like it, too,

1089
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:30,353
It's what I told you last week,

1090
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:34,815
I know,

1091
01:19:35,649 --> 01:19:38,486
- You blew it,
- This is yours, Catherine,

1092
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:42,531
It's too bad, too,
'cause the rest of it was really good,

1093
01:19:43,532 --> 01:19:48,537
"I loved your dad," "I always liked you,"
"I wanna spend every minute with you,"

1094
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:50,956
That's killer stuff,

1095
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:53,125
I meant it,

1096
01:19:53,209 --> 01:19:56,045
You got laid and you got the notebook,
You're a genius,

1097
01:19:56,128 --> 01:19:58,881
Talk to me, Catherine,

1098
01:19:58,964 --> 01:20:01,258
- This proof is yours,
- Forget it,

1099
01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:04,553
You'll have to deal with it eventually,
You can't just ignore it,

1100
01:20:04,637 --> 01:20:07,056
- You'll have to publish,
- Leave me alone, Hal,

1101
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:08,891
- Take it at least,
- I don't want it,

1102
01:20:08,974 --> 01:20:11,977
- Come on, I am trying to correct things,
- You can't!

1103
01:20:13,437 --> 01:20:15,481
Do you hear me?

1104
01:20:15,522 --> 01:20:18,692
You think you've figured something out?

1105
01:20:18,776 --> 01:20:23,030
You run over here all pleased with yourself
because you changed your mind?

1106
01:20:23,113 --> 01:20:26,909
Now you're certain?
Hal, you don't know anything,

1107
01:20:26,992 --> 01:20:30,787
The book, the math,
the dates, the writing,

1108
01:20:30,871 --> 01:20:34,374
all that stuff you just decided
with your buddies, it's just evidence,

1109
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:37,169
- It doesn't prove anything,
- OK, what would?

1110
01:20:37,252 --> 01:20:40,047
Nothing,

1111
01:20:42,924 --> 01:20:45,761
You should've trusted me,

1112
01:20:46,928 --> 01:20:48,388
I...

1113
01:20:48,472 --> 01:20:50,807
I know,

1114
01:20:57,606 --> 01:20:59,983
Claire sold the house?

1115
01:21:02,986 --> 01:21:06,448
She wants me in New York,
She wants to look after me,

1116
01:21:06,531 --> 01:21:11,703
What? Do you need looking after?
You looked after your father for five years,

1117
01:21:11,786 --> 01:21:16,124
- So maybe it's my turn,
- There is nothing wrong with you,

1118
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:19,294
We should be on our way, honey,

1119
01:21:19,377 --> 01:21:20,920
You can't just walk away,

1120
01:21:21,004 --> 01:21:24,924
pretend like it never happened and then
get a job at Urban Outfitters or something,

1121
01:21:24,966 --> 01:21:28,762
- Just take it,
- Katie, honey, let's go,

1122
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:31,973
Stay in Chicago,
You're an adult,

1123
01:21:32,056 --> 01:21:33,308
I gotta go,

1124
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:35,477
- Please,
- No,

1125
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,646
- Catherine, this isn't about me,
- Katie, come on,

1126
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:42,233
Don't you owe this to yourself at least?

1127
01:21:42,317 --> 01:21:44,652
Goodbye, Hal,

1128
01:22:00,251 --> 01:22:01,627
Catherine!

1129
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:05,965
Catherine!

1130
01:22:43,627 --> 01:22:46,797
- Hi, And where are you going today?
- To New York City,

1131
01:22:46,839 --> 01:22:48,924
Can I see some photo ID, please?

1132
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:18,704
Wow, You sure got a lot done,

1133
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:21,707
Well, I had five extra days,

1134
01:23:24,877 --> 01:23:27,713
I need some more coffee,
Do you want some?

1135
01:23:27,796 --> 01:23:30,048
Am I on that list?

1136
01:23:30,132 --> 01:23:31,592
What?

1137
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:34,344
"Square away crazy sister,"

1138
01:23:34,428 --> 01:23:36,138
Check,

1139
01:23:37,848 --> 01:23:40,559
That's not fair, Katie,

1140
01:23:40,642 --> 01:23:43,228
I just wanna take care of you,

1141
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:58,577
<i> Catherine!</i>

1142
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:01,830
- What?
- Aah! Jesus!

1143
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:07,586
God, you scared me,
What are you doing there?

1144
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:11,631
Sorry, I just...
I wanted to...

1145
01:24:11,715 --> 01:24:13,884
It's wonderful news,

1146
01:24:14,843 --> 01:24:17,178
I think I've got it,

1147
01:24:25,854 --> 01:24:28,106
What do you think?

1148
01:24:48,168 --> 01:24:51,129
- Wow, Dad,
- Can you believe it?

1149
01:24:52,881 --> 01:24:55,174
I knew you had it in you,

1150
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:57,510
That's a pretty
mealy-mouthed response,

1151
01:24:57,594 --> 01:25:01,347
What about it? What do you think?
Let's talk it through,

1152
01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:03,182
Not tonight, I'm tired,

1153
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:06,394
Come on, This is the beginning
of our real work together,

1154
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:09,605
You think I've stolen the thunder
because I broke through first?

1155
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:12,066
This is only the beginning,

1156
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,528
- I think we should call it a night,
- Read out the first couple of lines,

1157
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:20,116
We go line by line out loud,
see if there's a better way, a shorter way,

1158
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:22,493
No, Come on, Tomorrow,

1159
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,163
I've waited years for this, goddamn it,

1160
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:30,209
- Let's do some work together,
- Dad, I think we should get some sleep,

1161
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:33,379
- Not until we talk about the proof!
- I don't want to talk about it,

1162
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:37,675
Goddammit, open the goddamn book!
Read me the lines!

1163
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:05,828
"Let X equal the quantity
of all quantities of X,

1164
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:09,248
"Let X equal the cold,

1165
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,502
"It is cold in December,

01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:18,966
"The months of cold

1167

1171

1172
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:41,029
<i>"and the bookstores are full.</i>

1173
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:45,409
<i>"Let X equal the month

1174
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,496
<i>"The number of books

1175
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:53,542
<i>"as the number of months of cold

1176
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:01,758

1179
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:19,526

1180
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:23,196
"and so are never full
except in September,"

1181
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:45,635
I'm exhausted,

1182
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:03,796
I can't wait to get back
to the coffee at home,

1183
01:29:03,879 --> 01:29:07,007
We have a place where we buy coffee,
They roast it themselves,

1184
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:11,720
They have an old roaster down in the
basement, You can smell it on the street,

1185
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:17,268
Some mornings you can smell it from
our place, four stories up, It's wonderful,

1186
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:21,939
"Manhattan's Best,"
Some magazine wrote it up,

1187
01:29:22,022 --> 01:29:24,233
I mean, who knows?

1188
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:26,735
But it's very good,

1189
01:29:26,777 --> 01:29:28,737
I think...

1190
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:34,660
I'm actually gonna give up coffee
'cause it's bad for my nerves,

1191
01:29:34,743 --> 01:29:36,578
Catherine,

1192
01:29:37,329 --> 01:29:39,581
Catherine!

1193
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:03,355
<i> How many days have I lost?</i>

1194
01:30:07,526 --> 01:30:11,571
<i>How can I get back
to the place where I started?</i>

1195
01:30:16,034 --> 01:30:22,290
<i>I'm outside a house,
trying to find my way in,</i>

1196
01:30:22,332 --> 01:30:26,711
<i>but it is locked and the blinds are down,</i>

1197
01:30:26,795 --> 01:30:29,422
<i>and I've lost the key,</i>

1198
01:30:29,464 --> 01:30:35,261
<i>and I can't remember what the rooms
look like or where I put anything.</i>

1199
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:42,811
<i>And if I dare go in inside, I wonder...</i>

1200
01:30:45,313 --> 01:30:48,441
<i>will I ever be able to find my way out?</i>

1201
01:31:26,687 --> 01:31:30,608
Sometimes in my head I think it works,
and then...

1202
01:31:32,068 --> 01:31:36,531
Sometimes I just think it's...
crazy,

1203
01:31:38,032 --> 01:31:40,618
There's nothing wrong with you,

1204
01:31:43,454 --> 01:31:46,290
I think I'm like my dad,

1205
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:50,127
I think you are, too,

1206
01:31:54,215 --> 01:31:56,759
I'm afraid I'm like my dad,

1207
01:31:57,718 --> 01:32:01,764
- You are not him,
- Maybe I will be,

1208
01:32:01,847 --> 01:32:04,350
Maybe, and maybe you'll be better,

1209
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:12,024
It was like...

1210
01:32:13,943 --> 01:32:15,945
connecting the dots,

1211
01:32:18,405 --> 01:32:21,867
Some nights I could connect
three or four of them,

1212
01:32:21,909 --> 01:32:25,704
and some nights
they'd be really far apart,

1213
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:31,085
I'd have no idea how to get to the next one,
if there was the next one,

1214
01:32:33,962 --> 01:32:36,673
It just seems
really stitched together and lumpy,

1215
01:32:36,757 --> 01:32:39,384
Dad's stuff was way more elegant,

1216
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:45,224
Talk me through it
and tell me what's bothering you,

1217
01:32:45,265 --> 01:32:49,019
You got a bit of ground to make up, Dobbs,

1218
01:32:49,102 --> 01:32:51,772
You know that?

1219
01:32:57,527 --> 01:33:00,614
And there's no way
to prove that I wrote it,
