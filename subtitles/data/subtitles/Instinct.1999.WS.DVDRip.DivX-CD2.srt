1
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:06,551
Yeah. Yeah.

2
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:12,531
Yeah, I was one of you.
I believed in control.

3
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:13,961
Some control is necessary.

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,999
Is it?

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,800
The gorillas, they let you
stay with them, even at night.
You were becoming one of them.

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,700
- Are you listening?
Are you listening to me?

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,300
Yes.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,700
Not one of them.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,300
Not a gorilla.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,800
Don't you see?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
They accepted a man.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
They reached across.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,300
They took me in
as family.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,100
They welcomed a human being
among them.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,600
That's the miracle.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,400
What about the family
you left behind?

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,900
What about Lyn?

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
We leave her
outside of this.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,600
- Why?
- And my wife. Leave them out.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,400
You think I don't know. I know what
I was, what I lost, what I killed.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,500
- She's not dead. She wants to see you.
- She saw me at the airport.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,000
She saw what I am now.

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,900
You let me
be dead to her.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,500
You change
the subject, "Juha",

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,400
or walk away from this.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,300
Which do you want?

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,700
For now, I want the forest.
Take me there.

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,800
In the forest
for all that time.

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,500
Did you ever miss
the contact with any humans?

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
No. They were there.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,500
I may not have seen them,
but I always knew they were there.

32
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
If you were
learning their ease...

33
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,100
Their peace.

34
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Their peace.
Then why does this all end in murder?

35
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,800
There were many murders.

36
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,300
- Many?
- Yeah.

37
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,700
There's a zoo not far from here
where I studied...

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,700
and many years ago...

39
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,100
and, uh...

40
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,500
they needed
a male gorilla,

41
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,600
a wild capture.

42
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,300
And I did that.
I helped capture him.

43
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,300
I didn't even know what murder
was when I was you, "Juha".

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,300
You know what murder
I'm talking about.

45
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
If you don't talk to me about this,
I can't help you.

46
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,300
- I don't want you to help me.
- What "do" you want?

47
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,300
I want you to listen.

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,200
- And then what?
- Share it.

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
- With?
- Whoever you share with,
the people you're close to.

50
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,900
Are there any?

51
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,500
Why don't you tell others?

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
'Cause I'm not
for this world,

53
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,500
not any more.

54
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,800
What world, then?

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,200
In your memories, locked away
in your mind for the rest of your life?

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
- Is that all you want?
- No, I want to finish this.

57
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,200
- Finish what?
- Telling you what I know.

58
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,500
What makes you think
what you know is any different
than what other people know?

59
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,100
I had different teachers.

60
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,900
Okay, okay.

61
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,300
So I'm supposed to...
pass on your work.

62
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, for all it's worth.

63
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,700
- What made you pick me?
- A look in your eye.

64
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,500
- You seemed to have half a brain.
- Thank you. What look?

65
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
That look...

66
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,400
curious, searching,
unsatisfied,

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,000
slightly pissed off.

68
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Why didn't you pick
your daughter?

69
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,900
Leave it alone.

70
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,300
- Why do you refuse to talk about her?
- Leave it.

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,500
She wants to see you.
I say we talk about it.

72
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,800
Hmm.

73
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,800
I was wrong
about you, "Juha".

74
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,400
- Explain that.
- Tell them to open this door.
You're not the one, "Juha".

75
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,800
- I'm not the one?
- No.

76
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm not the one
who cut your medication?

77
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm not the one to say if
you're competent for a hearing,
a chance of getting outta here?

78
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,900
- I'm the one, Ethan.
- Are you?

79
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm the one.

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,300
- The one in control, huh?
- Yes.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,500
- Who's in control?

82
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,100
So who is in control, huh?
Are you?

83
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,000
Am I?

84
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,500
The guards outside?
The warden in his office?

85
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Yeah?
Who's in control?

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,500
Testing, testing, testing.
One, two, three, four.

87
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,100
Dr Ethan Powell,
interviewing Dr Theo Caulder.

88
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,500
Now, this will be a very simple test.
Pass or fail, life or death.

89
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,900
Ready, "Juha"? Now, you write on
this paper what I have taken from you.

90
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,700
What have you lost?
Write it! Write it!

91
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,900
Wrong. You never had control.
You only thought you had it.

92
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,500
An illusion, "Tabibu Juha"!

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,300
And what do you control
for sure, huh?

94
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,200
The volume on your stereo, the air
conditioning in your car? What else?

95
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,500
What else?
All right.

96
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
Another chance. You were nervous.
Too much pressure. Try again.

97
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,900
What have you lost?
What did I take?

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Write it. Write it!

99
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,100
You're a fool, "Juha".

100
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,700
- Ha!

101
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,700
Did you think
you were free?

102
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Where were you going at 2:00 today?
Into the gym, right?

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,100
In the morning,
your wake-up call.

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,500
In the middle of the night when you wake
up sweating, with your heart pounding.

105
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,000
What is it that has you all tied up,
"Juha", tied up in little knots?

106
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,500
Is it ambition?

107
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,400
Yeah.

108
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,100
You're no mystery
to me, boy.

109
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,800
I used to be you.

110
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,100
Okay. One last chance.

111
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,500
You think I won't do it?

112
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,400
What's one psychiatrist
less to the world?

113
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm already deep in the pit.
So what can they do to me?

114
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,700
Last try.
Get it right.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,100
What have you lost?

116
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,000
What did I take from you?

117
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,600
Write it.

118
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.
Congratulations.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,900
You're a student,
after all.

120
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,200
And you've lost nothing
but your illusions...

121
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,700
and a little bit
of skin.

122
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
What happened
to your face?

124
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,700
Gets a little rough
in there sometimes.

125
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,600
Well, what happened
to it?

126
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,500
Duct tape.

127
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,100
Oh.

128
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,700
- My father did this to you?
- Yes.

129
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,700
- What did he do?
- He was teaching me.

130
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,000
Looks like
a pretty tough class.

131
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,400
Are you gonna quit now?

132
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,900
No. I never quit.

133
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,500
Even when I'm doing something
really stupid, I never quit.

134
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
- Are you like that?
- No.

135
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,100
I once played solitaire for 48 games
straight until I won.

136
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
Solitaire, huh?
That figures.

137
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,500
I don't have time
for a lot of people.

138
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,400
Do you have time
for one?

139
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,500
Don't get nervous.
I didn't mean me.

140
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,300
Uh, want a drink?

141
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,100
- Yes.
- Let's go out.

142
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,800
Two cars.
No date.

143
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,200
You know, it's all right if you need
to hold on to somebody for a minute.

144
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,800
It's all right
if you don't.

145
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,300
- Doc, you won't believe this.
- What is it?

146
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,800
Just see for yourself, Doc.
You got to see it for yourself.

147
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
Doc, what you doing?

148
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,500
Hey, Doc,
what do you make of it?

149
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,500
What is this?

150
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,700
Not finished.

151
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,300
- Ethan...
- Take your time, Doc.

152
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,600
- What are you making here?
- The true history of mankind.

153
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,200
It's a true history.
No fiction, no lie.

154
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
Africa,
two million years ago.

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,300
Humans. Then they moved.

156
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,400
Migrated.

157
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,900
Ten thousand years ago,
civilization. You.

158
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,000
This is me?

159
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,100
Yeah, and me too. Us.

160
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,800
Takers. Who are
the blue people?

161
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,600
They're tribal societies...
hunters, gatherers, planters.

162
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,500
They never killed more animals
than they could use.

163
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,400
They never ploughed more land
than they needed.

164
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,800
They fought, but they never waged war.
Never exterminated.

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,100
They had a place in the world.
And in the world, they were part of it.

166
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,800
And they shared it.

167
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,300
We changed all that.

168
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,400
Now, what, are we supposed to change it
back? What are we supposed to do?

169
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Move.

170
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,300
- Move where?
- Out of my way.

171
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,900
What, are we supposed to unbuild
the cities, wander off into the jungle?

172
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,800
A stupid, specious argument.
You figure it out.

173
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,800
- I'm busy.
- You're a pain in the neck, Ethan.

174
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,500
I know.
Now get out.

175
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,000
Dominion.

176
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,100
What?

177
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,300
We have only one thing
to give up... our dominion.

178
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,300
We don't own the world.

179
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,000
We're not kings here,
not gods.

180
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,100
Can we give that up?

181
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,300
Too precious,
all that control?

182
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,700
Too tempting,
being a god?

183
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Where's my card?
I still don't have my card.

184
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,900
Where's my card?

185
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,000
My card! Where...
Show me my... That's not mine.

186
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,400
- I want my card. Do you have my card?
- I got a box here!

187
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,500
I have a box here
with everybody's name in it!

188
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
It is mine! Give me that!
Show me the card!

189
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,400
I want to see
my ace of diamonds.

190
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,100
- Can you hit that?
- Ace of diamonds! Show it to me!

191
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,700
- Bang that hard. Bang, bang, bang!

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,600
- I didn't do it.

193
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,700
I have a box here
with everyone's name in it!

194
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,800
All of you
are in this box.

195
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,100
I have picked one name.

196
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,500
This is the name of the person
that will go outside today.

197
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,600
We're not using the ace any more.
Understand?

198
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,500
We're not using the ace any more.

199
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,400
Each day I will pick
one name from this box,

200
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,700
and that person
will go outside.

201
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,400
Then I will set his name aside,
and the next day I'll pick a new name.

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,800
Everybody will have
their equal turn.

203
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,500
And today
it's Lester Rodman.

204
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,200
Where are you?
Lester Rodman.

205
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,200
Lester Rodman?

206
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,400
Lester Rodman,
where are you?

207
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,400
- Lester Rodman, today
you get to go outside.
- All right!

208
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,900
Let's find that ace.
Come on. Who's got that ace?

209
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,900
- Who the hell's got it?

210
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,500
- 'Cause I want it!
- We're not using the ace any more.

211
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,400
- Today Lester Rodman goes out...
- Come on. Let's see the cards.

212
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,300
Let's see your card.
Come on.

213
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,500
You got the ace, Pete?

214
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,500
How about you, Ethan?
You got the ace?

215
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,600
Come on, now.
Let me see that card.

216
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,400
Don't be shy.
Let's see your card.

217
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,500
- Dacks.
- Let me see it.

218
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,700
What was that?
Was that a look?

219
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,500
Dacks, damn it, don't.

220
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,800
The cards are finished.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,900
The cards are garbage.
Do you understand?

222
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,400
You throw 'em away.
We're not using the ace any more.

223
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,900
Everybody goes outside.
Everybody goes.

224
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,900
Everybody goes!
Everybody goes outside!

225
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,100
- Everybody goes!
- Everybody goes outside!

226
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,300
Everybody goes outside!
Everybody goes outside!

227
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,000
- Everybody goes.
- Outside, everybody!

228
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,800
Pick up those pieces!

229
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,600
Everybody goes outside!

230
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Dacks, damn it, you hit him again,
I'll have you up on charges.

231
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,900
Pick 'em up.

232
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,600
Son of a bitch.

233
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,000
Lester Rodman goes today.

234
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,100
Maybe you go tomorrow.

235
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
No cards. No ace.

236
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,100
No fighting.

237
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,400
Let's go, Lester.

238
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,600
- Haven't you learned anything yet?
- I guess not.

239
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,300
That coffee's been burning
for nine hours.

240
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
After ten,
use the instant.

241
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,800
It's in the top cupboard.

242
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Well, how's
the medical staff today?

243
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,300
Fine, sir. Fine.

244
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,600
Splendid.

245
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,300
You fine, too,
Dr Caulder?

246
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,200
Doing okay. Can I get you
some coffee, Warden?

247
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
I'm not here for coffee.

248
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
- Okay.
- I'm here to talk about...

249
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,900
that little episode
in the gymnasium today.

250
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,800
We worked out
a different system.

251
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,700
You think you can walk into
my institution, start changing
rules and causing riots?

252
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,700
- There was no riot.
- The prisoners refused orders,

253
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,800
and my guards had to use
force because of you.

254
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,700
The force wasn't necessary.
All the violence came from Mr Dacks.

255
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,100
He was trying
to provoke Powell.

256
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Powell is dangerous, and he was
dealt with as a dangerous psychotic.

257
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,100
No, no, no.
He offered no danger, none.

258
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,900
Dr Murray, did Powell
behave in a threatening way...

259
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,600
at any time?

260
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,000
No.

261
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,000
- I'll have a talk with Mr Dacks.
- Splendid.

262
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,700
Meanwhile, your little game
compromised my authority...

263
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
and the authority
of my guards.

264
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,600
Do you know what that means
at a maximum security prison?

265
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,100
You put everyone at risk.

266
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,500
The safety of every man here rests with
me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.

267
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,000
And I want you out.

268
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,300
You have ten days.
And I'm being generous.

269
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,600
I have 15 days left in my evaluation.
I'll leave when I'm finished.

270
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,800
Now you have seven days.

271
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,200
- How does he have the...
- Hang on a second.

272
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
How does he have the right
to cut my evaluation time?

273
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,900
He doesn't,

274
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,900
but he has the power
to kick you out...

275
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,700
whenever he wants to
and bring in somebody else.

276
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,800
So write your conclusion.
Wrap it up.

277
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,700
If I have more time, I think I can
get him out of there.

278
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,100
What are you
talking about?

279
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,200
The hearing. I think
when the judge hears the man...

280
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,100
who he is, what he has to say...
I think he'll walk out of there.

281
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,300
You're not his defence attorney.

282
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,800
You're not his pal.
What are you after?

283
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,900
- Big time ending for the book?
- Not about a book.

284
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,300
- It's not about my career...
- It should be.

285
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,300
Theo, you walked
into this case...

286
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,300
under my guarantee,

287
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,600
with an opportunity
to further yourself.

288
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,700
Now, are you willing to put
all that at risk possibly,

289
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,700
damage your career
possibly,

290
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,800
embarrass me?

291
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,700
Sorry, yes.

292
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,100
Then stop complaining about the time
you have left and use it.

293
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
Push the man.
Shake him.

294
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,800
- Where does the violence come from?
- I'm not sure...

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
- The gorillas?
- I'm not sure of the connection.

296
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, find it.

297
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,800
The only way he is ever going
to get out of that place...

298
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,300
is for you to make that judge
feel that Powell is sane and safe.

299
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,700
You show where
the violence came from,

300
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,300
and you show
that the violence has gone.

301
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,300
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

302
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Good.
You're on your own.

303
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,700
Thanks.

304
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
- See you later.
- I'll call you later.

305
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,300
Okay.

306
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Hello.
This is a surprise.

307
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,600
Sorry. I, uh...

308
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,500
- The message said you'd be home
after 7:00, so...
- So you came by to check?

309
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,300
Were you hall monitor
in school?

310
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,800
Yes, I was.

311
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,300
Funny, I never got a sense
of you in your parents' house.

312
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,900
- This is definitely more...
- Messy?

313
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,900
More you.

314
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,600
So...

315
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,300
what did he do to you
this time?

316
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,300
I don't see
any cuts or bruises.

317
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,000
This time
it wasn't him.

318
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,500
I only have seven days left
with your father. That's it.

319
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Are they going to take
the case away from you?

320
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Case.

321
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
It's not a...

322
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,300
not a case any more.

323
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,100
It's not a book either.

324
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,600
He may break my neck tomorrow, but I
think I'm becoming a friend of his...

325
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,700
and his student.

326
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,200
His "Tabibu Juha".

327
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
He calls you that?

328
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,800
I think "Tabibu"
means "doctor".

329
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,900
Yes, it does.

330
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,200
What does "Juha" mean?

331
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,800
"Juha" means...

332
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,200
"idiot".

333
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,900
Yeah.

334
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Well, I must be, because
I can't figure this one out.

335
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,100
He knows I can't bring
a gorilla into his cell and...

336
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,700
What?

337
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,700
What?

338
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,300
- Where are we going?
- Fresh air, a ride in the country.

339
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,900
You'll like it. It's wilderness
all the way. They're waiting for us.

340
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,700
Who? What are you
planning, "Juha"?

341
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
I'm not your idiot any more.

342
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
- You finally looked it up.
- No.

343
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,000
Your daughter told me.

344
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Watch your step.

345
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,000
The gorillas are
in the cage room now.

346
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,300
- Whoa!

347
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,900
Jesus Christ.

348
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,500
The old silverback's
been with us the longest.

349
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,500
You remember him, Dr Powell.
He's the one you...

350
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,900
I'm sorry. We need
to be alone in here.

351
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,600
The restraints?

352
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,400
I'll put them back on him
before we leave.

353
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,100
You understand if he comes out of
that door without them on...

354
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,000
I thought you'd feel
safer here.

355
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,400
I thought if you were around them,
you'd talk to me.

356
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,600
Tell me about the violence,
about the killing.

357
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,600
These are shadows
of gorillas.

358
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,300
Born in cages.

359
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,300
Only the old male...
he was free once.

360
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,800
Still alive.

361
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,300
Goliath.

362
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,900
I named him that.
I brought him here.

363
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,200
This cage has broken him.

364
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,500
Broken his heart,
broken his mind.

365
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Made him insane.

366
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,000
I did that.

367
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,300
I understand that, Ethan.
I do.

368
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,500
But I need to know
about the killing.

369
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,900
There's a female
just like that one.

370
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,700
Was there ever
any violence among them?

371
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,600
Was there any violence
towards you?

372
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,400
There were warnings.

373
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Warnings.

374
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,000
She was a good mother
and a good teacher.

375
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,600
The baby was always protected,
always instructed.

376
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,700
Always groomed,
always...

377
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,600
touched,

378
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,500
safe.

379
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,700
She used to watch
over him,

380
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,900
the way the old silverback
used to watch over...

381
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,500
all of us,

382
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,500
even me.

383
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,700
It's an amazing...

384
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,000
feeling, Theo,
to be watched over.

385
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,300
I discovered
in that look of his...

386
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,000
more than watchfulness...

387
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,500
tolerance,

388
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,600
acceptance.

389
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,700
- In fact, he was...

390
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,300
Ethan?

391
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,000
Ethan, what is it?

392
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,400
- What is it?

393
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,700
What's wrong?

394
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,600
- Shh. Shh.

395
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,400
- Shh.

396
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,900
It was me.

397
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,300
They'd found my things.

398
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,700
Been tracking me.

399
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,200
So I brought them.

400
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,700
I brought the... takers...

401
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,500
and death.

402
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,500
Still he looks at me
without blame.

403
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,200
Because you're
not to blame,

404
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,100
not for any of it.

405
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,000
You were just defending
your family.

406
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,500
- Ethan, close it.
- He won't come out.

407
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,900
You see?
Even if he can.

408
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,000
Not far from here is a fence, and on
the other side of that fence is freedom,

409
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,800
and he can smell it.

410
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,000
He'll never try
to get there,

411
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,900
'cause he's given up.

412
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,900
By now he thinks freedom
is something he dreamed.

413
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,800
And you?

414
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,400
Have you given up?

415
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,600
Because we have a chance to get you
out of here now, a good chance.

416
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,100
This is all I need...
what you've told me.

417
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
It's not just something
you dreamed.

418
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,500
It's real.

419
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,600
- I'd like you to wear this
to the hearing today.
- Where'd you get that?

420
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,700
Lyn brought it.

421
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,000
She's still here.

422
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,500
- Ethan, you can do this.
- Leave it alone.

423
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,100
What are you so afraid of?

424
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,400
I don't want to hurt her.

425
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,600
You've already done that.

426
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,300
Remember the first thing you said
to me? The first word? Remember?

427
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,200
You told me to tell
your daughter goodbye.

428
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,800
Tell her yourself.

429
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,300
I don't know what to say.

430
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,200
How are you?

431
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,400
That sounds stupid,
I guess.

432
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,500
I miss you.

433
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,300
Your father is a fool.

434
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,300
If you were just born, I would
pick you up and hold you...

435
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:20,000
and take you everywhere with me
and never walk away from you.

436
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,600
You're such
a treasure, Lyn.

437
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,600
You're so much better
than your father. You don't hate.

438
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,900
You don't even hate me.

439
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,200
You know that
when I went away from you,

440
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,300
I always took you
with me, inside.

441
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,100
I would love
to believe that.

442
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Well, this is all
I have left for you.

443
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,600
It's the only possession
I kept.

444
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,700
You'll wait in your cell
till I come and get you.

445
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,900
The van'll be here in 25 minutes.
The hearing starts at 4:00. Understand?

446
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,600
You'll change out of
that pretty blue suit...

447
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,800
and turn it over
for storage.

448
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,900
- Any questions?
- Sorry, Ethan.

449
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,200
Ethan, there was
nothing we could do.

450
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,100
Inside.

451
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,700
I said, "Inside"!

452
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,500
Stop hitting him!
Stop hitting him!

453
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,300
- You think that's funny, Nicko?
- Just stop hitting him!

454
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,200
Ow!

455
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,300
- I got Dacks!
- Oh, you wanna play, Pete?

456
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,700
- No, no! Sorry, Mr Dacks.
- You think that's funny, Pete?

457
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,400
- Huh? You think that's funny?
- It was an accident.

458
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,500
- You want to play? Come here.
- No, you can't come in here.

459
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
You can't come in, Mr Dacks.
You can't come in.

460
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,300
No, Mr Dacks.
No, don't be bad, Mr Dacks.

461
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,700
You wanna play "Can't Come In"?
We'll play.

462
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,200
- No! Mr Dacks!
- Let's play, Pete.

463
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,200
- No!
- You wanna play, Pete?

464
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,100
- No!
- Well, let's play!

465
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,400
- Ow! No! Ow!

466
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,700
You want to play?
Think this is for fun?

467
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,900
Huh?

468
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,300
- Aah!

469
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,200
Damn it! Lock this place down!

470
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
- I want this place locked down!

471
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,800
Anderson, secure the block
and cuff that son of a bitch!

472
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,200
Get back in there!
Settle down!

473
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,900
- Shut up! Shut up!

474
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,100
I heard. You want
to stay for supper?

475
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,700
- I blew it. I lost him.
He's silent again.

476
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,100
It's over.
Let it go.

477
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,900
He was protecting
his family... again.

478
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,300
I should have been with him
every minute.

479
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,800
Let it go.

480
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,500
And don't worry...
about anything.

481
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,500
I'll speak to Josephson,
smooth things over.

482
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,400
I'll help you cut
your losses.

483
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,700
And his losses?

484
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's true, isn't it?

485
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,000
He'll never get out
of there.

486
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,100
It was never your job
to get him out of there.

487
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,400
Theo, there is nothing
to be done.

488
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,300
Know when to walk away.

489
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,800
You help the ones you can.

490
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm sorry. I've let you down,
and I barged in here...

491
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,900
Theo.

492
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:48,100
If you don't let this end,
you'll do yourself damage.

493
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,900
You got involved...
emotionally. It happens.

494
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,100
Now you have to get
your focus back.

495
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,700
You're losing control.

496
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,400
Wouldn't that be nice?

497
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Mealtime!
Line 'em up!

498
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,500
- You heard him. Let's go.
- Single file!

499
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,500
I'm ready,
I'm ready, I'm ready.

500
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,400
Dr Caulder,
what's wrong with him?

501
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,100
- Nicko, back in line.
- Dr Caulder...

502
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,300
Any change?

503
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,300
Not a word in three days.

504
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,800
- Sorry.
- Hey, ape man!

505
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,700
He said mealtime!

506
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,800
Can you leave him there,
Dacks?

507
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,300
Keep your hands
at your side!

508
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm sorry, Ethan.

509
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,400
I don't know if you can hear me,
but this is my last day, so...

510
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I put Dacks up on charges.

511
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,000
I still might be able to get you
that hearing, if you would just speak.

512
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,500
If you would just come back.

513
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,900
Okay, Ethan.

514
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,300
You asked me
a question once.

515
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,700
"What has you
all tied up in knots...

516
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,400
when you wake up sweating
in the middle of the night?"

517
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,000
You still wanna know?

518
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,500
I've been thinking about it.
I've been thinking about it a lot.

519
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,800
It's not the work.
I love the work.

520
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,400
I've always loved the work.

521
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,900
It's the game.

522
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,900
The game, Ethan.

523
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,000
And I was so good at it.

524
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,100
I made sure all
the right people liked me.

525
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,600
At night, I'd do
the checklist in my mind.

526
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,500
Am I cool with Ben Hillard?

527
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,500
Am I cool with Dr Josephson?

528
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,800
Am I cool with all the people
who can help me?

529
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,100
Am I cool with all the people
who can hurt me?

530
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,500
Nobody thought I was weak
or a loser.

531
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,900
There was nobody
I was offending,

532
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,500
nobody I loved.

533
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,900
"That" game, Ethan.

534
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,700
But guess what?

535
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,400
You taught me how
to live outside of the game.

536
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,300
You taught me how to live.

537
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,900
And you know what
scares me even more?

538
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,200
That I'm going back in.

539
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,100
"Forgive me, Ben.
Put me back in the game."

540
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,000
"I'll make you like me again!
I'll do the work."

541
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,200
"I'll do all the work,
just put me back in the game!"

542
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,100
And do you wanna know...

543
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,100
You wanna know the psychology
behind this?

544
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,500
Now, pay attention,
because I'm good at this.

545
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,200
I'm trying not to say
goodbye to you.

546
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,400
I'm trying not to say
I'll miss you.

547
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:21,300
I'm trying to forget you.

548
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,100
Ethan Powell, case closed.

549
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,100
Case closed!

550
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,400
Look at me.

551
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,500
- Come on!

552
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,600
Oh, come on!

553
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,400
- Take the bat
off your shoulders, you bum!
- Calm down, Dacks!

554
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,300
Hey, on a three-two count you gotta
protect the plate, you moron!

555
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,300
- Three and one,
Dacks, not three and two.
- First base.

556
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,700
- I would protect the plate.
- We're on first base.

557
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,100
- You gotta protect the plate.
- Right, the plate.

558
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,700
- Protect the plate.

559
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,400
- You see? You see? You see?

560
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,300
You take the lumber off
the shelf and you get a hit.

561
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,000
- Peter! Hey, come on!

562
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,800
- Pete, put it back in! Pete, please!

563
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,600
- Put it back in, Pete!
- Hey, Pete!

564
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,100
Give me the plug, Pete!
Give me the plug!

565
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,900
- Give me the plug now!
- Stop! Stop it!

566
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,100
Peter, give Guard Anderson
the plug. It's his birthday.

567
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:28,100
That's right, Pete.
It's my birthday.

568
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,900
You wanna give me
a present?

569
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,600
Come on, buddy.
Let me have it.

570
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,500
- That's it. Let go.
- All right, all right.

571
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,200
- Plug it in. Come on.
- There you go.

572
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,700
Are you gonna leave it alone now?

573
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,700
- For you.
- Okay. For me.

574
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,500
Hey, Dr Caulder's here!
Glad to see you, Doc.

575
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,000
Hey! Caulder's back!
Welcome back, Doctor!

576
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,100
Anything he does out there
is gonna come down on my head,

577
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,800
and I'm gonna come down
on yours!

578
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,500
Heard you were long gone
back to the city. I thought
you were all through here.

579
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,900
- I came back to talk to Powell.
- Well, your highflier's
gone out the window!

580
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,800
Went through a hole
in the fence.

581
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,700
We think he scaled the other one.
He must have had some help!

582
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:49,900
And he even wrote
a little note... to you!

583
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,600
Can you make heads or tails
of that? I sure can't.

584
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,900
What?

585
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,800
- You're never gonna find him.
- You know where he is?

586
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,300
You're never
gonna find him.

587
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,800
- If you got any idea where...
- If you're holding out on me,
you could be aiding an escapee.

588
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,200
That is a felony, and I could
have you arrested for that!

589
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,200
I'm beginning
to like it here.

590
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,100
"Dear Theo."

591
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,900
"I'm sorry I'm not there
to say goodbye."

592
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,700
"You were right.
Freedom is not just a dream."

593
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,600
"It's there on the other side of those
fences we build all by ourselves."

594
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,300
"Thank you for giving me hope and for
giving me back my daughter."

595
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,700
"And I thank you, Theo, for sharing
this journey with me."

596
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,400
"Your friend, Ethan."

597
