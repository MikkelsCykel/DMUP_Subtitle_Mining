1
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,163
In the bleak days of 1983...

2
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:53,368
as England languished in the doldrums
of a ruinous monetarist policy...

3
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:57,171
the good, loyal men
of the Permanent Assurance Company...

4
00:00:57,255 --> 00:01:01,407
a once-proud family firm
recently fallen on hard times...

5
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:06,052
strained under the yoke of their
oppressive new corporate management.

6
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:09,332
Terrible. Really terrible.

7
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,410
Row!

8
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,406
That's it, Evans. You're fired.

9
00:01:58,175 --> 00:01:59,654
You heard me. Out.

10
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:03,325
Did you hear that?
He's been sacked.

11
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,128
Sacked?

12
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:11,413
Sacked? Come on, boys. Let's get at 'em.

13
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,044
Come on!

14
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:13,972
Let me out of here!

15
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:18,134
I demand to see my lawyer!

16
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,014
Tooley! Come on.

17
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,571
Quiet! Silence!

18
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:58,051
Now, lads, let's move.

19
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:01,889
You, you and you, break open the weapons.

20
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,813
You, you and you, into the rigging.

21
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:09,604
- And you, put the kettle on.
- Aye, sir.

22
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,127
There, there, Charles.

23
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:57,524
Sorry!

24
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,211
Come on, Tooley. This way!

25
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,807
Weigh the anchor!

26
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:27,928
Weigh the anchor!

27
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,768
Weigh the anchor.

28
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,173
And so,
the Crimson Permanent Assurance...

29
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:40,373
was launched upon the high seas
of international finance.

30
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:00,453
Come on, boy. Watch it. Route. Route!

31
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,688
Cup of tea, dear?
Hey, Captain!

32
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:07,610
Look! To starboard!

33
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:14,413
There it lay:
The prize they sought.

34
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,487
Hard to starboard!

35
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:22,087
A financial district swollen
with multinationals, conglomerates...

36
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:25,846
and fat, bloated merchant banks.

37
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:31,772
All right, lads, battle stations!

38
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,166
Come on! Move it!

39
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,128
All right, then.
That's enough. Take cover!

40
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:24,852
Down, down!

41
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,606
Hard to starboard!

42
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:25,974
Fire!

43
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:34,891
Eric! My balance sheets!

44
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:39,166
Ross! Get the readouts!

45
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,325
- Stop him!
- Eric!

46
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,494
Thanks! Charge!

47
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,770
No, no! Let me! Let me!
Okay, Kane.

48
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:49,244
Captured!

49
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,010
Gotcha!

50
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,490
Take this.

51
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,012
Here. File this.

52
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,330
Shit!

53
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:07,611
And so,
heartened by their initial success...

54
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:12,530
the desperate and reasonably violent
men of the Permanent Assurance...

55
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:15,968
battled on, until...

56
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:20,567
as the sun set slowly in the west...

57
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:25,447
the outstanding returns on their bold
business venture became apparent.

58
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:30,929
Once-proud financial giants lay in ruins...

59
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:35,485
their assets stripped...

60
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,847
their policies in tatters.

61
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,327
Full speed ahead, Mr. Cohen!

62
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,893
Up, up, up your premium

63
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:02,411
Scribble away and balance the books

64
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:05,807
Scribble away, but balance the books

65
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:09,691
It's fun to charter an accountant

66
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:13,245
And sail the wide accountancy

67
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:17,814
To find, explore the funds offshore

68
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:21,205
And skirt the shoals of bankruptcy

69
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,846
It can be manly in insurance

70
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:28,731
We'll up your premium semi-annually

71
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:33,094
It's all tax-deductible
We're fairly incorruptible

72
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:36,247
Sailing on the wide accountancy

73
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:41,724
And so, they sailed off
into the ledgers of history...

74
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:45,089
one by one, the financial capitals
of the world...

75
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,167
crumbling under the might
of their business acumen.

76
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:50,373
Or so it would have been...

77
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:53,845
if certain modern theories
concerning the shape of the world...

78
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,484
had not proved to be disastrously wrong.

79
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:26,137
- Morning.
- Morning.

80
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,996
- Morning.
- Morning.

81
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,409
Morning.

82
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:41,905
- Morning.
- Morning.

83
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:44,424
- What's new?
- Not much.

84
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,054
- Morning! - Good
morning! - Morning!

85
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:57,747
- Frank was just asking what's new.
- Was he?

86
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:00,265
Yes. Hmm.

87
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:06,604
- Hey, look. Howard's being eaten.
- Is he?

88
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,977
- Makes you think, doesn't it?
- Mmm.

89
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:19,896
- I mean, what's it all about?
- Beats me.

90
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:22,867
* Why are we here

91
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:26,344
* What's life all about

92
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,373
* Is God really real

93
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:30,786
* Or is there some doubt

94
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:37,159
* Well, tonight we're going
to sort it all out

95
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:40,509
* For tonight it's
The Meaning of Life

96
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,820
* What's the point
of all these hoax

97
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,421
* Is it the chicken
and the egg time

98
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,029
* Are we just yolks

99
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:56,953
* Or perhaps we’re just one
of God's little jokes

100
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:00,946
* Well, ca c'est
le meaning of life

101
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:05,010
* Is life just a game

102
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,522
* Where we make up the rules

103
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:12,319
* While we're searching
for something to say

104
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:17,785
* Or are we just simply
spiralling coils

105
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:20,843
* Of self-replicating DNA

106
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,362
* Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay
Nay, nay, nay, nay

107
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:26,197
* What's life
What is our fate

108
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,123
* Is there heaven and hell

109
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:32,925
* Do we reincarnate

110
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:38,040
* Is mankind evolving
or is it too late

111
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:41,128
* Well, tonight
here's the meaning of life

112
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:44,329
* For millions

113
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,972
* This life
is a sad vale of tears

114
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:51,105
* Sitting round with really
nothing to say

115
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:55,297
* While scientists say

116
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,493
* We’re just simply
spiralling coils

117
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:01,436
* Of self-replicating DNA

118
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,928
* Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay
Nay, nay, nay, nay

119
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:07,700
* So just why
Why are we here

120
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,716
* And just what

121
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:12,112
* What, what, what
do we fear

122
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,687
* Well, ce soir
for a change

123
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,027
* It will all be made clear

124
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:21,886
* For this is
The Meaning of Life

125
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,909
* C'est la sens de la vivre *

126
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,379
* This is
The Meaning of Life

127
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:03,290
- One thousand and eight!
- Mrs. Moore's contractions are
more frequent, Doctor.

128
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,005
- Good. Take her into the
fetus-frightening room. - Right.

129
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:19,079
Jolly good. It's, uh, a bit
bare in here today, isn't it?

130
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:22,920
- Yes.
- Yes. More apparatus, please, Nurse.

131
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:26,942
- The EEG, the BP monitor and the AW.
- Certainly, Doctor.

132
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:29,123
And get the machine
that goes "ping!"

133
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,968
And get the most expensive machines
in case the administrator comes.

134
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,539
That's it. Bring it in. Bring
it right here. Behind me.

135
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:46,416
- Lovely, lovely.
- Jolly good. That's better.

136
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:50,438
- That's much, much better.
- Yes, more like it.

137
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,082
Uh, still something
missing, though.

138
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,581
Hmm?
Hmm.

139
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,738
- Patient.
- Patient. Yes.

140
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,134
- Where's the patient? Patient!
- Anyone seen the patient?

141
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,929
- Ah! Here she is.
- Bring it over here.

142
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:10,033
- Mind the machines! -
Sorry, Doctor. - Come along!

143
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,055
- Come along.
- Jump on it. Hup!

144
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:15,630
- Hello. Now don't you worry.
- We'll soon have you cured.

145
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,347
Leave it all to us.
You'll never know what hit you.

146
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,708
- Good-bye. Drips up.
- Injections.

147
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:24,737
- Can I put the tube in the baby's head?
- Only if I can do the episiotomy.

148
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:26,983
- Okay. Thank you.
- Uh, legs up.

149
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:30,242
- Oh, come in. Come on in, all of you.
- That's it. Jolly good.

150
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,793
- Come on.
- Come along. Spread round there.

151
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:34,815
- Who are you?
- I'm the husband.

152
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:38,805
I'm sorry. Only people involved
are allowed in here.

153
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:41,080
- What do I do?
- Yes?

154
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:45,103
- What do I do?
- Nothing, dear. You're not qualified.

155
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:47,625
- Leave it to us.
- What's that for?

156
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:50,216
That's the machine
that goes "ping!"

157
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:55,171
You see? That means
your baby is still alive.

158
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:58,687
And that's the most expensive
machine in the whole hospital.

159
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:03,326
- Yes, it cost over 3/4 of a million pounds.
- Aren't you lucky!

160
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:05,912
The administrator is here, Doctor.

161
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:09,210
- Switch everything on.
- Morning, gentlemen.

162
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,258
- Morning.
- Morning, gentlemen. Morning.

163
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,176
- Morning, Mr. Pycroft.
- Mr. Pycroft.

164
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:15,094
Oh, very impressive.
Very impressive.

165
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:18,157
- And what are you doing this morning?
- It's a birth.

166
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:20,241
Ah. And what sort of thing is that?

167
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:25,419
Well, that's when we take a new baby
out of a lady's tummy.

168
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:27,498
Wonderful what we can do nowadays.

169
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:30,627
Ah! I see you have the machine
that goes "ping!"

170
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:34,336
This is my favourite. You see, we lease
this back from the company we sold it to,

171
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,774
and that way, it comes under the monthly
current budget and not the capital account.

172
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:47,376
Thank you, thank you. We try to do
our best. Well, do carry on.

173
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:50,029
- Oh, the vulva's dilating, Doctor.
- Oh, yes, there's the head.

174
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:52,998
Yes, four centimetres,
five, six centimetres.

175
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,101
- Lights! - Amplify the
ping machine. - Masks up!

176
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:58,920
- Suction!
- Eyes down for a full house!

177
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:01,414
Here it comes.

178
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:04,953
And frighten it.

179
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,405
- Thank you.
- And the rough towels!

180
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,535
Show it to the mother.
That's enough.

181
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:14,874
- Right. Sedate her.
- Number the child.

182
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,952
Measure it, blood-type it
and isolate it.

183
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:19,221
Okay, show's over.

184
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:22,382
Is it a boy or a girl?

185
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:26,275
I think it's a little early to start
imposing roles on it, don't you?

186
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:29,162
Now, a word of advice. You may find
that you suffer for some time...

187
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,347
a totally irrational feeling of depression,
P.N.D., as we doctors call it.

188
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:35,748
So, it's lots of
happy pills for you,

189
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,234
and you can find out all about
the birth when you get home.

190
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,880
It's available on Betamax,
VHS and Super 8.

191
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:05,920
Oh, bloody hell.

192
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,313
- Oh, get it, would you, Deidre?
- All right, Mum.

193
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,874
- Now whose teatime is it?
- Mine!

194
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,956
Shh! Come on. Out you go.

195
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:33,539
Now, Vincent, Tessa, Valerie, Janine,

196
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:36,573
Martha, Andrew, Thomas,
Walter, Pat, Linda,

197
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,839
Michael, Evadne, Alice, Dominique
and Sasha, it's your bedtime.

198
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,839
- Aww!
- Now don't argue!

199
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:45,691
Laura, Alfred, Nigel,
Annie, Simon and...

200
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,062
Wait. I've got something
to tell the whole family.

201
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,565
Oh, quick. Go and get the others in,
Gordon.

202
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,584
The mill's closed.
There's no more work.

203
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:01,061
We're destitute.

204
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,032
Come in, my little loves. I've got no
option but to sell you all...

205
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:06,056
for scientific experiments.

206
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:08,229
Oh!

207
00:25:08,231 --> 00:25:10,650
No, no, that's the way
it is, my loves.

208
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,818
Blame the Catholic Church for not letting me
wear one of those little rubber things.

209
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:16,852
Oh, they've done some
wonderful things in their time.

210
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,598
They've preserved the might and majesty,
even mystery of the Church of Rome,

211
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:25,036
and the sanctity of the sacrament,
the indivisible oneness of the Trinity,

212
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:28,912
but if they'd let me wear one of those
little rubber things on the end of my cock,

213
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:31,404
we wouldn't be
in the mess we are now.

214
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:35,295
Couldn't Mummy have worn
some sort of pessary?

215
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:39,425
Not if we're going to remain members of the
fastest-growing religion in the world, my boy.

216
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:43,385
- Mmm, he's right.
- You see, we believe...

217
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:45,440
* Let me put it like this. *

218
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:47,893
* There are Jews
in the world *

219
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,915
* There are Buddhists *

220
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:54,134
* There are Hindus
and Mormons and then *

221
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:57,523
* There are those
that follow Mohammed *

222
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:01,991
* But I've never been
one of them *

223
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,712
* I'm a Roman Catholic *

224
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:11,230
* And have been since
before I was born *

225
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:14,299
* And the one thing
they say about Catholics *

226
00:26:14,403 --> 00:26:18,261
* Is they'll take you
as soon as you're warm *

227
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,713
* You don't have to be
a six-footer *

228
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,132
* You don't have to have
a great brain *

229
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,684
* You don't have to have
any clothes on *

230
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:32,843
* You're a Catholic
the moment Dad came *

231
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:35,691
* Because *

232
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:40,323
* Every sperm is sacred *

233
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:44,893
* Every sperm is great *

234
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:49,083
* If a sperm is wasted *

235
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:52,377
* God gets quite irate *

236
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:57,586
* Every sperm is sacred *

237
00:26:57,688 --> 00:27:01,426
* Every sperm is great *

238
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:06,091
* If a sperm is wasted *

239
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:10,310
* God gets quite irate *

240
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:14,367
* Let the heathens
spill theirs *

241
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,655
* On the dusty ground *

242
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:21,718
* God shall make them pay *

243
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:26,486
* For each sperm
that can't be found *

244
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:30,924
* Every sperm is wanted *

245
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,854
* Every sperm is good *

246
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:39,495
* Every sperm is needed *

247
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:43,454
* In your neighbourhood *

248
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,819
* Hindu, Taoist, Mormon *

249
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:50,655
* Spill theirs just anywhere *

250
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:54,262
* But God loves those
who treat *

251
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:58,518
* Their semen with more care *

252
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:02,769
* Every sperm is sacred *

253
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:05,997
* Every sperm is great *

254
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:09,955
* If a sperm is wasted *

255
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:13,702
* God gets quite irate *

256
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:17,540
* Every sperm is sacred *

257
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:21,430
* Every sperm is good *
* Every sperm is good *

258
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:24,982
* Every sperm is needed *

259
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:28,856
* In your neighbourhood *

260
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:32,495
* Every sperm is useful *

261
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:36,206
* Every sperm is fine *

262
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:39,718
* God needs everybody's *

263
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:43,135
* - Mine * * - And
mine * * - And mine *

264
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:01,072
* Let the pagans
spill theirs *

265
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:05,002
* O'er mountain
hill and plain *

266
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:07,855
* God shall strike them down *

267
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:12,587
* For each sperm
that's spilt in vain *

268
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:16,294
* Every sperm is sacred *

269
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:20,099
* Every sperm is good *

270
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:23,772
* Every sperm is needed *

271
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:27,165
* In your neighbourhood *

272
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:30,707
* Every sperm is sacred *

273
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,385
* Every sperm is great *

274
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,866
* If a sperm is wasted *

275
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:39,889
* God gets *

276
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:45,448
* Quite irate **

277
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,314
So you see my problem,
little ones.

278
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:55,361
I can't keep you all
here any longer.

279
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:57,280
Speak up!

280
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:59,798
I can't keep you all
here any longer!

281
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:04,152
God has blessed us so much
I can't afford to feed you anymore.

282
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,799
Couldn't you have
your balls cut off?

283
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:10,314
It's not as simple as that, Nigel.
God knows all.

284
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:15,432
He'd see through such a cheap trick.
What we do to ourselves, we do to Him.

285
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:19,872
You could have had them
pulled off in an accident.

286
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:23,901
No. Children, I know you're trying to help,
but believe me, me mind's made up.

287
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,816
I've given this long
and careful thought,

288
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,376
and it has to be medical
experiments for the lot of you.

289
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:31,770
Ohh.

290
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:37,040
* Every sperm is sacred

291
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:41,416
* Every sperm is great

292
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,865
Look at them. Bloody Catholics.
Filling the bloody world up...

293
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:49,346
with bloody people they can't afford
to bloody feed.

294
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:53,985
- What are we, dear?
- Protestant, and fiercely proud of it.

295
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,701
Well, why do they have
so many children?

296
00:30:56,803 --> 00:31:00,661
Because every time they have sexual
intercourse, they have to have a baby.

297
00:31:00,768 --> 00:31:03,732
- But it's the same with us, Harry.
- What do you mean?

298
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:06,008
Well, I mean we've got
two children,

299
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,405
and we've had
sexual intercourse twice.

300
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:11,663
That's not the point.
We could have it any time we wanted.

301
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:13,841
- Really?
- Oh, yes. And what's more,

302
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:18,060
because we don't believe in all that
Papist claptrap, we can take precautions.

303
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:20,107
What, you mean lock the door?

304
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:23,900
No, no. I mean because we are members of
the Protestant Reformed Church,

305
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:28,062
which successfully challenged the autocratic
power of the Papacy in the mid-16th century,

306
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:31,226
we can wear little rubber
devices to prevent issue.

307
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,033
- What do you mean?
- I could, if I wanted, have sexual intercourse
with you...

308
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:38,773
- Oh, yes, Harry.
- ... and, by wearing a rubber sheath over my
old fellow,

309
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:42,284
I could ensure that when I came off,
you would not be impregnated.

310
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:45,768
That's what being a Protestant's all about.

311
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:48,804
That's why it's the church for me.
That's why it's the church for anyone...

312
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:51,690
who respects the individual
and the individual's right...

313
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:54,025
to decide for him or herself.

314
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:58,276
When Martin Luther nailed his protest
up to the church door in 1517,

315
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:01,271
he may not have realized the full
significance of what he was doing,

316
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,277
but 400 years later,
thanks to him, my dear,

317
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:07,030
I can wear whatever I want
on my John Thomas.

318
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:10,990
And Protestantism doesn't stop
at the simple condom. Oh, no!

319
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,677
- I can wear French Ticklers if I want.
- You what?

320
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:16,777
French Ticklers,
Black Mambos, Crocodile Ribs.

321
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:19,497
Sheaths that are designed
not only to protect...

322
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,857
but also to enhance the stimulation
of sexual congress.

323
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:25,734
- Have you got one?
- Have I got one? Well, no,

324
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:28,611
but I can go down the road anytime I want
and walk into Harry's...

325
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,771
and hold my head up high and
say, in a loud, steady voice...

326
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,327
"Harry, I want you to sell me a condom.

327
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:38,137
"In fact, today I think I'll have
a French Tickler, for I am a Protestant. "

328
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:40,753
- Well, why don't you?
- But they... They cannot...

329
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,724
because their church never made the
great leap out of the Middle Ages...

330
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:47,143
and the domination
of alien Episcopal supremacy.

331
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:49,168
But despite the attempts
of Protestants...

332
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:51,677
to promote the idea
of sex for pleasure,

333
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:54,185
children continue
to multiply everywhere.

334
00:32:56,456 --> 00:33:01,023
The Adventures of Martin Luther.

335
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,542
An exciting and
controversial examination...

336
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:17,041
of the Protestant reformer
whose reassessment of the role...

337
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:18,736
of the individual in Christian belief...

338
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:21,320
shook the foundations
of a post-feudal Germany...

339
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,817
in the grip of the 16th century.

340
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:31,643
It was a day much like any other
in the quiet town of Wittenberg.

341
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:34,143
Mamie Meyer was preparing fat
for the evening meal...

342
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,604
when the full force
of the Reformation struck.

343
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:39,514
Mamie! Martin Luther's out!

344
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,911
Oh, Martin Luther.

345
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:50,351
Did you get the suet, Hymie?

346
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:52,590
Oy vey! The suet I clean forgot.

347
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:54,124
The suet? You forgot?

348
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,840
The lard, the fish oil, the butter fat,
the dripping, the bull grease...

349
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,822
I'll remember,
but the suet, oy vey.

350
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:01,219
So, what do you keep up here?
Adipose tissue?

351
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,565
- Look out. Here he comes.
- Girls, your father forgot the suet!

352
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:09,148
- Hello, Martin.
- Where's the john?

353
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,561
- We don't have one.
- No john? What do you do?

354
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,597
- We eat fat.
- That stops you going to the john?

355
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:18,383
- It's a theory.
- Yeah, but does it work?

356
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:20,879
- We ain't got no john.
- Yeah, but you need to go.

357
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,373
You know how it is with theories.
Some days they're fine...

358
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,908
maybe one, two, three days.

359
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,329
Then just when it looks like
you're ready for the publish...

360
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:28,905
you need a new kitchen floor.

361
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:31,301
You should be so lucky.

362
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,763
Do you need any cleaning inside?

363
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:35,777
Not today.
It's all going fine.

364
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:38,393
How's about showing me the cutlery?

365
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,380
I got a woman and children in there.

366
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:43,444
So, there's no problem.
I'll just look at a few spoons.

367
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:46,161
I got two girls in there, Martin.
You know what I mean?

368
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:48,181
Honest, I don't look at your girls.

369
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:50,482
I don't think about them.
There.

370
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:53,066
I'll put them out of my mind...
their arms, their necks...

371
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:56,613
their little legs and bosoms
I'll wipe from my mind.

372
00:34:57,484 --> 00:34:59,241
You just want to see the spoons?

373
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:01,637
My life.
That's what I want to see.

374
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,362
- I know I'm gonna regret this.
- No, listen.

375
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,479
Cutlery's really my thing now.

376
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,641
Girls with round breasts
is over for me.

377
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,786
What am I doing?
I know what's going to happen.

378
00:35:13,788 --> 00:35:16,183
I'll crouch behind you.

379
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:21,329
Mamie, guess who's come to see us?

380
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:25,637
Hymie, are you out of your mind already?
You know how old your daughters are.

381
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:27,405
He only wants to see the spoons.

382
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:29,859
What do you have to bring him
into my house for?

383
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:31,656
He doesn't think about girls anymore.

384
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:35,101
Mrs. Meyer, as far as
girls is concerned...

385
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:36,963
I shot my wad.

386
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:40,157
- You shot your wad?
- Definitely.

387
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:43,253
- Which spoons do you want to view?
- I guess the soup spoons.

388
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:45,082
Now, they're good spoons.

389
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:47,732
- You got them arranged?
- No, but I can arrange them for you.

390
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,877
Don't put yourself
to no bother, Mrs. Meyer.

391
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,494
It's no bother.
I want for you to see these spoons...

392
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:54,801
like I would want
to see them myself.

393
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:57,070
You're too kind, Mrs. Meyer.

394
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,053
You could get your daughters
to show me them.

395
00:35:59,054 --> 00:36:01,194
Hymie, get him out of here!

396
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:04,291
Mamie, he only said for Audrey
and Myrtle to show him the spoons.

397
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:06,788
You think I'm running some kind
of bordello here?

398
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:09,470
Mrs. Meyer, how can you
say such a thing?

399
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:12,350
Listen, Martin Luther. I know
what you want to do with my girls.

400
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:13,726
Show me the spoons.

401
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:15,515
You want them
to pull up their skirts...

402
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:17,881
and then lean over a chair
with their legs apart!

403
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:19,767
- Mamie, don't get excited.
- I'm getting excited?

404
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:23,474
- It's him that's getting excited!
- My mind is on the spoons.

405
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:26,188
But you can't stop thinking
of those little girls over the chairs.

406
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,548
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- I'm a married woman!

407
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,404
Just show him the spoons.

408
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:34,085
And you don't want to
put nothing up me?

409
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:38,919
Mrs. Meyer, you read my mind.

410
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:41,422
Yes, another convert
for the Protestants.

411
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:45,005
But despite Luther's efforts to
promote the idea of sex for pleasure...

412
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,510
children multiplied everywhere.

413
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:59,941
"And spotteth twice they the
camels before the third hour.

414
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,490
"And so the Midianites
went forth to Ram Gilead...

415
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,838
"in Kadesh Bilgemath...

416
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,920
"by Shor Ethra Regalion...

417
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:12,083
"to the house of
Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda,

418
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:14,770
"he who brought the butter dish
to Balshazar...

419
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:18,173
"and the tent peg
to the house of Rashomon...

420
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,088
"and there, slew they the goats,

421
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:26,428
yea, and placed they the bits
in little pots. "

422
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:29,707
Here endeth the lesson.

423
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,108
Let us praise God.

424
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:40,695
- O Lord.
- O Lord.

425
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:43,194
Ooh, You are so big.

426
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:46,653
Ooh, You are so big.

427
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:52,718
So absolutely huge.

428
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:57,718
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell You.

429
00:37:57,822 --> 00:38:02,617
Gosh, we're all really
impressed down here, I can tell You.

430
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:07,104
Forgive us, O Lord, for this,
our dreadful toadying.

431
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:10,059
And barefaced flattery.

432
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,334
But You're so strong...

433
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:15,952
and, well, just so super.

434
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:18,452
Fantastic.

435
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,729
- Amen, reverend.
- Amen.

436
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,995
Now two boys have been found
rubbing linseed oil...

437
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,714
into the school cormorant.

438
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:31,164
Now some of you may feel that the cormorant
does not play an important part...

439
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:33,416
in the life of the school,
but I would remind you...

440
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:37,415
that it was presented to us by the
corporation of the town of Sudbury...

441
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:40,139
to commemorate Empire Day,
when we try to remember...

442
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:42,829
the names of all those
from the Sudbury area...

443
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:45,751
who so gallantly
gave their lives...

444
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:48,248
to keep China British.

445
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:52,511
So from now on, the cormorant is
strictly out of bounds!

446
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,126
Oh, and, Jenkins,

447
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,748
apparently, your mother
died this morning.

448
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,250
Chaplain.

449
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:08,497
* O Lord, please
don't burn us *

450
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,495
* Don't grill
or toast Your flock *

451
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:16,631
* Don't put us
on the barbecue *

452
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:20,994
* Or simmer us in stock *

453
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:24,707
* Don't braise or bake
or boil us *

454
00:39:24,808 --> 00:39:28,642
* Or stir-fry us in a wok *

455
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:33,842
* Oh, please don't
lightly poach us *

456
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:36,945
* Or baste us
with hot fat *

457
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,161
* Don't fricassee
or roast us

458
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:46,464
* Or boil us in a vat

459
00:39:46,562 --> 00:39:50,789
* And please don't stick
Thy servants, Lord

460
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,504
* In a Rotissomat

461
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:04,496
He's coming!

462
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:11,517
All right, settle down,
settle down.

463
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:15,649
Now, before I begin the lesson,
will those of you...

464
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,404
who are playing in the match this
afternoon move your clothes down...

465
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:22,700
onto the lower peg immediately after lunch,
before you write your letter home,

466
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:25,257
if you're not getting your hair cut,
unless you've got a younger brother...

467
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:28,113
who's going out this weekend as the
guest of another boy, in which case,

468
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:31,664
collect his note before lunch, put it
in your letter after your haircut...

469
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,807
and make sure he moves your clothes
onto the lower peg for you.

470
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,247
- Now...
- Sir?

471
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:39,458
- Yes, Wymer?
- My younger brother's going out with Dibble
this weekend, sir,

472
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,397
but I'm not having my hair cut today,
so do I move my clothes...

473
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:45,123
I do wish you'd listen, Wymer.
It's perfectly simple.

474
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:49,486
If you're not getting your hair cut, you
don't have to move your brother's clothes.

475
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:54,062
You simply collect his note before lunch,
after you've done your Scripture prep,

476
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:58,709
when you've written your letter home before
rest, move your own clothes onto the lower peg,

477
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,524
greet the visitors and report to Mr. Viney
that you've had your chit signed.

478
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:06,657
Now, sex.

479
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:11,721
Sex, sex, sex.
Where were we?

480
00:41:14,862 --> 00:41:17,286
Well, had I got as far as...

481
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,942
the penis entering the vagina?

482
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:26,362
- N-N-No, sir.
- No, sir. No, sir.

483
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:29,116
Well, had I done foreplay?

484
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:36,350
- Yes, sir.
- Ah. Well, as we all know all about foreplay,

485
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:40,552
no doubt you can tell me
what the purpose of foreplay is.

486
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:44,942
Biggs.

487
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:49,078
Don't know.
Sorry, sir.

488
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,650
- Carter?
- Oh. Was it taking your clothes off, sir?

489
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:58,274
Well, a-and after that?

490
00:41:58,275 --> 00:42:00,675
Oh! Putting them on a lower peg, sir.

491
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,989
The purpose of foreplay is to cause
the vagina to lubricate...

492
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:10,634
so that the penis
can penetrate more easily.

493
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:12,788
Could we have a window
open, please, sir?

494
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:16,852
Yes. Harris, will you? And, of course,
to cause the man's penis to erect...

495
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:21,180
and har... den.

496
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:25,342
Now, did I do
vaginal juices last week?

497
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:29,409
Oh, do pay attention, Wadsworth! I know it's
Friday. Oh, watching the football, are you?

498
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:32,615
Boy, move over there.
I'm warning you.

499
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,305
I may decide to set
an exam this term.

500
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:37,458
- Oh, sir!
- Sir!

501
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:39,859
So just listen.

502
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:44,630
Now did I or did I not...

503
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,669
do vaginal juices?

504
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:49,792
Yes, sir.

505
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:53,758
Name two ways of getting them
flowing, Watson.

506
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:56,263
Rubbing the clitoris, sir?

507
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:02,985
What's wrong with a kiss, boy? Hmm?

508
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:06,092
Why not start her off with a nice kiss?

509
00:43:06,198 --> 00:43:09,780
You don't have to go leaping straight
for the clitoris like a bull at a gate.

510
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:12,155
Give her a kiss, boy.

511
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:16,056
- Suck the nipple, sir?
- Good, good. Well done, Wymer.

512
00:43:16,162 --> 00:43:18,718
- Uh, stroking the thighs, sir?
- Yes, yes.

513
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:20,742
- I suppose so.
- Biting the neck.

514
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:22,697
Yes, good.
Nibbling the earlobe,

515
00:43:22,698 --> 00:43:25,254
uh, kneading the buttocks
and so on and so forth.

516
00:43:25,357 --> 00:43:27,599
So we have
all these possibilities...

517
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,598
before we stampede
towards the clitoris, Watson.

518
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:33,846
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

519
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:36,982
Now, all these forms
of stimulation...

520
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,483
can now take place.

521
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:50,432
And, of course, tonguing will give you
the best idea...

522
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:54,023
of how the juices
are coming along.

523
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:57,198
Helen? Now,
penetration and coitus...

524
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,882
that is to say intercourse
up to and including orgasm.

525
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:07,385
Ah, hello, dear. Do stand up when
my wife enters the room, Carter.

526
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:10,491
- Oh, sorry, sir. Sorry.
- Humphrey, I hope you don't mind.

527
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:13,020
I told the Garfields we would dine
with them tonight.

528
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:16,743
Yes, well, I suppose we must.
I said we'd be there by 8:00.

529
00:44:16,843 --> 00:44:19,431
At least it'll give me a reason to
wind up the staff meeting.

530
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:24,756
- I know you don't like them, but
I couldn't make another excuse.
- It's just that I felt...

531
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:28,239
Wymer! This is for your benefit.

532
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:30,459
Would you kindly wake up?

533
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,918
I've no intention of going
through this all again.

534
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:47,849
- Ah. We'll take the foreplay as read,
if you don't mind, dear.
- No, of course not, Humphrey.

535
00:44:47,954 --> 00:44:52,236
So, the man starts by entering or
mounting his good lady wife...

536
00:44:52,343 --> 00:44:54,264
in the standard way.

537
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:59,192
Uh, the penis is now, as you will
observe, more or less fully erect.

538
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:01,664
There we are.
Ah, that's better.

539
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,812
Now... Carter.

540
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:06,213
- Yes, sir?
- What is it?

541
00:45:07,658 --> 00:45:11,372
- It's an ocarina, sir.
- Bring it up here.

542
00:45:11,471 --> 00:45:15,469
The man now starts making thrusting
movements with his pelvic area,

543
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:18,128
moving the penis up and down
inside the vagina...

544
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:22,097
Put it there, boy.
Put it there on the table.

545
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:25,752
...while the wife maximizes her clitoral
stimulation by the shaft of the penis...

546
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,906
by pushing forward.

547
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:31,326
Thank you, dear. Now, as
the sexual excitement mounts...

548
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:34,401
What's funny, Biggs?

549
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:37,641
- Oh, nothing, sir.
- Do, please, share your little joke with
the rest of us.

550
00:45:37,742 --> 00:45:41,608
- I mean, obviously, something frightfully
funny's going on.
- No, honestly, sir.

551
00:45:41,715 --> 00:45:46,227
Well, as it's so funny, I think you'd better
be selected to play for the boys' team...

552
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:48,634
in the rugby match against the masters
this afternoon.

553
00:45:48,636 --> 00:45:51,036
Oh, no, sir!

554
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,955
Come on, Buster!

555
00:46:08,147 --> 00:46:12,756
Well played, well played.

556
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:45,731
Okay, Blackitt, Sturridge and Walters,
you take the buggers on the left flank.

557
00:47:45,834 --> 00:47:48,652
- Hordern, Spadger and I will go for the gun post.
- Hang on, 68.

558
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,600
- You'll never make it, sir. Let us come with you.
- Do as you're told, man.

559
00:47:51,697 --> 00:47:54,220
Righto, Skipper.
Oh, sir, sir?

560
00:47:54,324 --> 00:47:57,142
I- If we don't
meet again, sir,

561
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:01,337
I'd just like to say it's been a real
privilege fighting alongside you, sir.

562
00:48:01,438 --> 00:48:04,889
Yes, well, this is hardly the time
or place for a good-bye speech, eh?

563
00:48:04,994 --> 00:48:09,506
Me and the lads realize that, sir, but,
well, we may never meet again, so...

564
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:12,545
- Yes, all right, Blackitt. Thanks a lot.
- No, just a moment, sir.

565
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:15,589
Me and the lads, we've had
a little whip-around, sir.

566
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:18,895
We've bought you something,
sir. We bought you this.

567
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:22,995
Oh! Well, it...
I don't know what to say.

568
00:48:23,096 --> 00:48:27,771
It's... It's a lovely thought.
Thank you. Thank you all.

569
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:31,069
But I think we'd better
get to cover...

570
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:35,298
We've got something else
for you as well, sir.

571
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:38,150
Sorry it's another clock, sir,
only there was a bit of a mix-up.

572
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,957
Walters thought he was buyin' a present, and
Spadger and I had already got the other one.

573
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:45,677
Well, it's beautiful.
They're both beautiful.

574
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:51,127
I think we'd better get to cover now.
I'll thank you properly later on.

575
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:55,160
Corporal Sturridge got this for you as
well, sir. He didn't know about the others.

576
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:58,398
- It's Swiss.
- Well, now, that is thoughtful, Sturridge.

577
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:00,868
- Good man.
- There's a card, sir.

578
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,452
From all of us. Sorry
about the blood, sir.

579
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:08,005
- Thank you all.
- Squad! Three cheers for Captain Biggs.

580
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,954
Hip, hip.
Hooray!

581
00:49:11,956 --> 00:49:14,708
- Hip, hip...
- Blackitt! Blackitt!

582
00:49:14,806 --> 00:49:17,941
I'll be all right, sir. There's just
one other thing, sir.

583
00:49:18,043 --> 00:49:20,599
- Spadger, give him the check.
- Oh, yeah.

584
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:22,783
This is really going too far.

585
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:25,635
I don't seem to be able to find it, sir.
Uh, be in number four trench.

586
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:28,133
For Christ's sake, forget it, man.

587
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,432
You shouldn't have said that, sir.

588
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:35,942
- You've hurt his feelings.
- Don't mind me, Spadge.

589
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:40,276
Toffs is all the same. One minute,
it's all please and thank you.

590
00:49:40,374 --> 00:49:43,192
- The next, they'll kick you in the teeth.
- Yeah.

591
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:46,194
- Let's not give him the cake.
- I don't want any cake.

592
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:49,338
Look. Blackitt cooked it especially
for you, you bastard.

593
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:51,362
He saved his rations
for six weeks, sir.

594
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:53,822
- I don't mean to be ungrateful.
- I'll be all right...

595
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:57,345
Blackie! Blackie!

596
00:49:57,451 --> 00:50:01,165
Look at him! He worked on that cake
like no one else I've ever known.

597
00:50:01,263 --> 00:50:04,201
Some nights it was so cold we could hardly
move, but Blackitt'd be out there,

598
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:06,928
slicing the lemons,
mixing the sugar and almonds.

599
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,257
I mean, you try getting butter to melt
at 15 degrees below zero.

600
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:16,031
There's love in that cake... this man's
love... and this man's care and...

601
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:21,284
- Oh, my Christ!
- You bastard.

602
00:50:22,826 --> 00:50:26,310
All right, we will eat the cake.
They're right.

603
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:28,814
It's too good a cake
not to eat.

604
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,275
- Get the plates and knives, Walters.
- Yes, sir. How many plates?

605
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,100
Six.

606
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,886
- Oh. Better make it five.
- Tablecloth, sir?

607
00:50:36,987 --> 00:50:39,387
Yes, get the tablecloth.

608
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:42,459
No, no,
I'll get the tablecloth.

609
00:50:42,562 --> 00:50:44,483
You better get the gate-leg table,
Hordern.

610
00:50:44,484 --> 00:50:46,884
And the little lamp, sir?

611
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,825
Yes. Oh, and while you're at it,
you'd better get a doily.

612
00:50:49,931 --> 00:50:52,803
- I'll bring two, sir, in case one gets crumpled.
- Okay!

613
00:50:57,203 --> 00:51:00,305
But, of course, warfare isn't all fun.
Right. Stop that.

614
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:02,457
It's all very well
to laugh at the military,

615
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,379
but when one considers
the meaning of life,

616
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,831
it is a struggle between alternative
viewpoints of life itself.

617
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:10,493
Without the ability to defend
one's own viewpoint...

618
00:51:10,596 --> 00:51:12,901
against other perhaps more
aggressive ideologies,

619
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,704
then reasonableness and moderation
could quite simply disappear.

620
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:19,979
That is why we'll always need an army.

621
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,479
May God strike me down
were it to be otherwise.

622
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:29,017
Don't stand there gawping...

623
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:31,704
like you've never seen
the hand of God before!

624
00:51:31,806 --> 00:51:36,121
Now, today we're going to do
marching up and down the square.

625
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:40,422
That is, unless any of you
got anything better to do.

626
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,793
Well?

627
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,908
Anyone got anything
they'd rather be doing...

628
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,875
than marchin'
up and down the square?

629
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:52,994
Yes! Atkinson.

630
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:59,943
What would you rather be doing,
Atkinson?

631
00:52:00,045 --> 00:52:03,562
Well, to be quite honest, Sarge, I'd
rather be home with the wife and kids.

632
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,381
Would you now?

633
00:52:07,382 --> 00:52:10,068
- Yes, Sarge.
- Right. Off you go.

634
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,594
Now...

635
00:52:12,701 --> 00:52:15,322
everybody else happy
with my little plan...

636
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,882
of marching up and down
the square a bit?

637
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:19,908
- Sarge?
- Yes?

638
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:22,497
- I've got a book I'd quite like to read.
- Go read your book then.

639
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,682
Now!

640
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:28,811
Everybody else quite content
to join in...

641
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,089
with my little scheme...

642
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:34,805
of marchin'
up and down the square?

643
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:36,825
Sarge?

644
00:52:36,826 --> 00:52:38,843
Yes, Wyclif, what is it?

645
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:42,362
Well, I'm, uh, learning the piano.

646
00:52:42,465 --> 00:52:44,450
Learning the piano?

647
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,851
- Yes, Sarge.
- And I suppose...

648
00:52:46,918 --> 00:52:49,604
you want to go practice, eh?

649
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:53,540
Marchin' up and down the square
not good enough for you, eh?

650
00:52:53,646 --> 00:52:56,046
- Well...
- Right! Off you go!

651
00:52:56,114 --> 00:52:58,735
Now, what about the rest of you?

652
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:03,698
Rather be at the pictures,
I suppose.

653
00:53:06,335 --> 00:53:08,608
All right!
Off you go!

654
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:13,926
Bloody army. I don't know
what it's coming to.

655
00:53:13,927 --> 00:53:16,327
Right. Sergeant Major marching
up and down the square.

656
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,699
Left, right, left.

657
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:22,317
Democracy and humanitarianism have always
been trademarks of the British Army.

658
00:53:22,418 --> 00:53:24,467
- Rubbish!
- Shh!

659
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:27,340
...And have stamped its triumph in the
furthest-flung corners of the Empire.

660
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,607
It is worth reminding ourselves
that without war...

661
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,167
there would have been little
or no development...

662
00:53:34,273 --> 00:53:36,482
of small, pre-packed cheeses...

663
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:39,333
no great leap forward
in the building trade...

664
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:43,210
no holiday camps,
no drip-dry shirts...

665
00:53:43,308 --> 00:53:45,233
All these things,
and other things too...

666
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:48,309
are byproducts of war.

667
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:51,651
But, in the great fight
for these byproducts of war...

668
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:55,658
perhaps no army has shown
more courage, valour...

669
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:58,291
and tenacity than the British Army...

670
00:53:58,396 --> 00:54:01,602
which went selflessly
to the four corners of the globe...

671
00:54:01,702 --> 00:54:04,777
to defend a civilization and empire...

672
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:07,344
a way of life that was truly...

673
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:09,470
the greatest achievement...

674
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:11,900
of the genius of the British people.

675
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:33,799
But no matter where or when
there was fighting to be done,

676
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:37,710
it has always been the calm
leadership of the officer class...

677
00:54:37,818 --> 00:54:40,444
that has made the British Army
what it is.

678
00:55:13,821 --> 00:55:16,226
Excuse me.

679
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,606
- Morning, Ainsworth.
- Morning, Pakenham.

680
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:27,913
- Sleep well?
- Not bad. Bitten to shreds, though.

681
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:30,032
Must be that hole in
the bloody mosquito net.

682
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:33,108
Yes, savage little
blighters, aren't they?

683
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:35,232
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Chadwick?

684
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:37,794
I'm afraid Perkins got rather badly
bitten during the night.

685
00:55:37,897 --> 00:55:41,453
- Well, so did we. Ha!
- Yes, but I do think Doctor ought to see him.

686
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:44,983
- Well, go and fetch him then.
- Right you are, sir.

687
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:47,494
Suppose I'd better go along.
Coming, Pakenham?

688
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:49,966
Yes, I suppose so.

689
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:53,361
- Here now.
- Come on, boy.

690
00:56:02,264 --> 00:56:03,771
Morning, Perkins.

691
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:06,432
- Morning, sir.
- What's all the trouble, then?

692
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:09,325
Bitten, sir.
During the night.

693
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:12,334
Hmm.
Whole leg gone, eh?

694
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,845
- Yes.
- How's it feel?

695
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,886
- Stings a bit.
- Mmm. Well, it would, wouldn't it?

696
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:22,578
That's, uh, quite a bite
you've got there.

697
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:24,734
Yes. A real beauty, isn't it?

698
00:56:24,735 --> 00:56:28,576
- Any idea how it happened?
- None whatsoever. Complete mystery to me.

699
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,629
Woke up just now
one sock too many.

700
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:34,842
- You must have a hell of a hole in your net.
- We've sent for the doctor.

701
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:37,953
- Hardly worth it, is it?
- Oh yes. Better safe than sorry.

702
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:42,031
- Yes. Good Lord, look at this.
- By Jove! That's enormous.

703
00:56:42,135 --> 00:56:45,046
- You don't think it'll come back, do you?
- For more, you mean?

704
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,302
Yes. You're right. We'd better
get this stitched.

705
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,549
- Right.
- Hello, Doc!

706
00:56:49,551 --> 00:56:53,140
Morning. I came as fast as I could.
Is something up?

707
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:58,114
Yes. During the night, old Perkins
got his leg bitten sort of... off.

708
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:01,545
Oh, yeah.
Been in the wars, have we?

709
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:05,309
- Yes.
- Any headache? Bowels all right?

710
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,715
Mmm. Well, let's have a look at this
one leg of yours, then, eh?

711
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:12,502
Yes. Yes,
yes, yes.

712
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:16,641
Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Yes, well,
this is nothing to worry about.

713
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:20,046
- Oh, good.
- There's a lot of it about. Probably a virus.

714
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:23,000
Keep warm, plenty of rest and if
you're playing football or anything,

715
00:57:23,098 --> 00:57:25,087
try and favour the other leg.

716
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:28,394
- Oh, righto.
- As right as rain in a couple of days.

717
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,417
Oh. Thanks for
the reassurance, Doc.

718
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:32,406
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.

719
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,963
- Any other problems I can reassure you about?
- No, I'm fine.

720
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,280
Jolly good.
Well, must be off.

721
00:57:38,282 --> 00:57:41,608
So it'll... just grow back again,
then, will it?

722
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:44,990
Uh...

723
00:57:44,992 --> 00:57:48,100
I think I'd better come clean
with you about this.

724
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:51,628
It's, uh...
It's not a virus, I'm afraid.

725
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:55,542
You see, a virus is what we doctors
call very, very small...

726
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:59,076
so small it could not possibly
have made off with a whole leg.

727
00:57:59,181 --> 00:58:03,055
What we're looking for... and this is
no more than an educated guess...

728
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:05,407
is some multi-cellular
life-form...

729
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:09,677
with stripes, huge, razor-sharp
teeth, about 11 foot long...

730
00:58:09,775 --> 00:58:12,180
and of the genus Felis Horribilis...

731
00:58:12,183 --> 00:58:15,871
what we doctors,
in fact, call a tiger.

732
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:17,896
A tiger?

733
00:58:17,897 --> 00:58:19,822
A tiger?

734
00:58:23,226 --> 00:58:25,631
A tiger in Africa?

735
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:28,071
A tiger in Africa!

736
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:32,812
- Ah, well, it-it's probably escaped from a zoo.
- Doesn't sound very likely to me.

737
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:35,296
- Stumm, Stumm, Stumm.
- Sir! Sir!

738
00:58:35,297 --> 00:58:38,920
- The attack's over, sir. The Zulus are retreating.
- Oh, jolly good.

739
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,676
Quite a lot of casualties, sir. C-division
wiped out. Signals gone.

740
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:44,733
- Thirty men killed in F-section.
- Yes, I see.

741
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:48,488
- I should think about 150 men altogether, sir.
- Jolly good.

742
00:58:48,587 --> 00:58:51,826
I haven't got the final figures, but there's
a lot of seriously wounded in the compound...

743
00:58:51,926 --> 00:58:55,482
Yes, well, the thing is, Sergeant,
I've got a bit of a problem here.

744
00:58:57,383 --> 00:59:00,042
One of the officers
has lost a leg.

745
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:02,573
- Oh, no, sir!
- I'm afraid so.

746
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,175
- Probably a tiger.
- In Africa?

747
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,906
The M.O. Says we can
stitch it back on...

748
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:10,126
if we can find it
immediately.

749
00:59:10,128 --> 00:59:14,451
- Right, sir. I'll organize a party.
- It's hardly the time for that, Sergeant.

750
00:59:14,558 --> 00:59:18,794
- A search party.
- Ah, ah, ah! Much better idea.

751
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:26,970
Sorry about the mess, sir. We'll try and
get it cleared up by the time you get back.

752
00:59:27,078 --> 00:59:29,163
- We showed 'em, didn't we, sir?
- Yes.

753
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,570
Here. We got a search party.
Leave that alone.

754
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:35,358
- All this killing, bloodshed...
Bloody good fun, sir, isn't it?
- Yes, very good.

755
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:37,886
- Morning, sir.
- Nasty wound you've got there, fella.

756
00:59:37,993 --> 00:59:40,398
Thank you very much, sir.

757
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:42,806
Come on, Private.
Making up a search party.

758
00:59:44,735 --> 00:59:48,806
Better than staying home, isn't it? I mean,
at home if you kill someone, they arrest you.

759
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:51,534
Here, they give you a gun
and show you what to do, sir.

760
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:56,190
I mean, I killed 15 of those buggers,
sir. At home, they'd hang me.

761
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,697
Here, they'll give me
a fucking medal, sir.

762
01:00:13,049 --> 01:00:15,166
Ahem.

763
01:00:15,168 --> 01:00:18,079
Sorry, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

764
01:00:18,186 --> 01:00:20,591
Mm-hmm.

765
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,252
Look!

766
01:00:38,442 --> 01:00:40,847
My God!
It's huge!

767
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:52,494
Uh, don't shoot. Don't shoot.
We're not a tiger.

768
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:56,258
Uh, we were just, um...

769
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,665
Why are you dressed
as a tiger?

770
01:00:58,731 --> 01:01:02,572
Hmm?
Oh, why, why, why?

771
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,573
Ha! Isn't it
a lovely day today?

772
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:07,748
- Answer the question.
- Oh, we were just...

773
01:01:07,848 --> 01:01:11,372
Well, actually, we're
dressed like this because...

774
01:01:12,438 --> 01:01:14,363
Oh, no, that's not it.

775
01:01:14,365 --> 01:01:16,794
Oh, we did it for a laugh.
Part of a spree. High spirits.

776
01:01:16,901 --> 01:01:19,944
- Simple as that.
- Nothing more to it.

777
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:22,870
Well, actually, we're on a mission
for British Intelligence.

778
01:01:22,969 --> 01:01:25,464
There's a pro-czarist
Ashanti chief...

779
01:01:25,568 --> 01:01:27,493
- No, no, no, no.
- Uh, no, no, no, no.

780
01:01:27,495 --> 01:01:29,677
No, no, no, no. We're doing it for
an advertisement.

781
01:01:29,678 --> 01:01:31,989
Ah, that's it.
Forget about the Russians.

782
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,485
Uh, we're doing an advert
for Tiger Brand Coffee.

783
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:38,562
"Tiger Brand Coffee is a real treat.
Even tigers prefer a cup of it to real meat. "

784
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,130
- Now, look...
- All right, all right.

785
01:01:41,235 --> 01:01:44,179
We are dressed as a tiger because he had
an auntie who did it in 1839...

786
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:47,294
- ... and this is her 50th anniversary.
- No. We're doing it for a bet.

787
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:51,120
- God told us to do it.
- To tell the truth, we are completely mad.

788
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:53,593
We're inmates of a Bengali
psychiatric institution,

789
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:58,082
and we escaped by making this skin
out of old used cereal packets.

790
01:01:58,185 --> 01:02:00,495
- It doesn't matter!
- What?

791
01:02:00,496 --> 01:02:05,465
It doesn't matter why they're dressed
as a tiger. Have they got my leg?

792
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:08,129
Good thinking.
Well, have you?

793
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:10,639
- Actually...
- Yes?

794
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,633
We were thinking of
training as taxidermists.

795
01:02:12,633 --> 01:02:15,434
- We wanted to get the feel of it
from the animal's point of view.
- Be quiet!

796
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:20,387
Now look, we're just asking you
if you've got this man's leg.

797
01:02:20,496 --> 01:02:22,967
- A wooden leg?
- No, no, a proper leg.

798
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:28,444
He was fast asleep, and someone...
or something... came in and removed it.

799
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,285
Without waking him up?

800
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,863
- Yes.
- I don't believe you.

801
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:37,500
We found the tiger skin
in a bicycle shop in Cairo.

802
01:02:37,605 --> 01:02:40,042
- The owner wanted it taken to Dar Es Salaam...
- Shut up!

803
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:43,786
Now look, have you or have you not
got his leg?

804
01:02:43,888 --> 01:02:47,556
- Yes.
- No. No, no, no, no.

805
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,804
- Why did you say yes?
- I didn't.

806
01:02:51,911 --> 01:02:54,324
I'm not talking to you.

807
01:02:55,456 --> 01:03:00,157
Um... um...
Hmm.

808
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:02,284
Right. Search the thicket.

809
01:03:02,286 --> 01:03:06,987
Oh, come on. Do we look like the sort of
chaps who'd creep into a camp at night,

810
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:09,889
steal into someone's tent, anaesthetize
them, tissue-type them,

811
01:03:09,988 --> 01:03:12,209
amputate a leg
and run away with it?

812
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:14,303
Search the thicket.

813
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:16,941
Oh, leg! You're looking
for a leg!

814
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:19,298
Actually, I think there is one there
somewhere.

815
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,738
Somebody must have abandoned it here,
knowing you were coming after it.

816
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:25,963
We stumbled across it, actually.
They'll be miles away by now.

817
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:29,351
We'll have to take
all the blame.

818
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:33,390
Hello, good evening and welcome to
The Middle of the Film.

819
01:03:40,307 --> 01:03:42,781
Hello, and welcome to
The Middle of the Film,

820
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:47,055
the moment where we take a break to invite
you, the audience, to join us, the filmmakers,

821
01:03:47,153 --> 01:03:49,822
in "Find the Fish. "

822
01:03:49,924 --> 01:03:52,308
We're going to show you
a scene from another film...

823
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,979
and ask you to guess
where the fish is.

824
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,686
But if you think you know,
don't keep it to yourselves.

825
01:03:57,789 --> 01:04:02,782
Yell out so that all the cinema can hear you.
So here we are with "Find the Fish. "

826
01:04:12,276 --> 01:04:15,901
I wonder where that fish has gone.

827
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:17,911
You did love it so.

828
01:04:17,912 --> 01:04:20,766
You looked after it like a son.

829
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:24,977
And it went wherever I did go.

830
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:28,507
- Is it in the cupboard?
- Yes! No!

831
01:04:28,611 --> 01:04:32,714
Wouldn't you like to know?
It was a lovely little fish.

832
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:37,396
And it went wherever I did go.

833
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:41,631
- It's behind the sofa!
- Where can that fish be?

834
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:44,115
Have you thought of the
drawers in the bureau?

835
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:47,038
It is a most elusive fish.

836
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:51,117
And it went wherever I did go.

837
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,160
Oh! Fishy, fishy,
fishy, fish.

838
01:04:55,263 --> 01:04:59,616
Uh, fish, uh, fish,
uh, fishy, ohh!

839
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:04,400
Ohhh! Fishy, fishy,
fishy, fish!

840
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:08,471
That went wherever I did go.

841
01:05:08,574 --> 01:05:11,906
- Look up his trunk!
- Yeah! It's in his trousers!

842
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:14,366
- That was terrific!
- Great! Yeah!

843
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,766
- Best bit so far.
- Fantastic! Really great!

844
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,256
Really risky, yeah.

845
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:26,874
They haven't said much about the
meaning of life so far, have they?

846
01:05:26,978 --> 01:05:29,362
- Well, it's been building up to it.
- Has it?

847
01:05:29,397 --> 01:05:32,164
Yeah, I expect
they'll get onto it now.

848
01:05:32,264 --> 01:05:36,497
Personally, I doubt they're going to say
anything about the meaning of life at all.

849
01:05:36,594 --> 01:05:39,448
- Oh, come on. They've gotta say something.
- They're bound to.

850
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:41,940
Yeah.

851
01:05:44,301 --> 01:05:47,253
- What do you think the next bit will be?
- Caption, I expect.

852
01:05:47,357 --> 01:05:49,741
What, about the next stage of life, you mean?
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

853
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:19,562
Oh, gee.

854
01:06:19,564 --> 01:06:21,823
Wow.

855
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:23,702
What a wonderful room.

856
01:06:23,704 --> 01:06:26,504
Right. Real homey.

857
01:06:26,601 --> 01:06:28,985
Yeah.

858
01:06:30,581 --> 01:06:33,413
Could we have our cases
down here, please, Ricky?

859
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,874
- Cheapskate.
- Thank you.

860
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:50,760
- Isn't he cute?
- Sure is.

861
01:06:58,507 --> 01:07:00,901
Look at this, darling.

862
01:07:03,782 --> 01:07:06,331
That's wonderful.

863
01:07:06,434 --> 01:07:08,031
I love snowscapes.

864
01:07:08,034 --> 01:07:10,428
- Me too.
- Me too.

865
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:13,331
Well, guess I could use a bath...

866
01:07:13,435 --> 01:07:16,278
and freshen up a little.

867
01:07:16,376 --> 01:07:18,452
Then maybe we could go explore.

868
01:07:18,454 --> 01:07:20,562
That's a real good idea.

869
01:07:20,564 --> 01:07:23,277
I'm gonna just empty out
the contents of my bag...

870
01:07:23,378 --> 01:07:25,486
and have a look through them, okay?

871
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,881
Yeah. Great idea.

872
01:07:28,876 --> 01:07:31,270
Great.

873
01:07:40,128 --> 01:07:41,820
- Feeling better, honey?
- Yeah.

874
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,035
That's good.

875
01:07:43,037 --> 01:07:45,880
Well, what's in your handbag
today, honey?

876
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,894
Oh, just the usual thing.

877
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:49,908
Powder case, lipstick...

878
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:52,328
some packets of gum, hairbrush...

879
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:54,448
diary, 38 tampons...

880
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:56,269
Thirty-eight tampons?

881
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,456
I was just signing my name in...

882
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:00,864
and the girl said to me,
"How old are you?"

883
01:08:00,964 --> 01:08:03,020
And I said, "I'm 46."

884
01:08:03,022 --> 01:08:05,302
And she said,
"Are you still menstruating?"

885
01:08:05,305 --> 01:08:07,712
- And I said, "Sure. "
- Right.

886
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,727
So she gave me a couple
of these little boxes...

887
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:12,888
courtesy of the Super Inn.

888
01:08:12,891 --> 01:08:15,269
Aren't they cute?

889
01:08:15,271 --> 01:08:18,416
"Have a nice month. "
Oh, that's real good.

890
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:21,761
- I really love this hotel, Marvin.
- Me too.

891
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:29,893
Oh, that's much better.

892
01:08:30,058 --> 01:08:31,824
Thank you, honey.

893
01:08:31,826 --> 01:08:34,488
Everything was a little bit
misty before.

894
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:38,158
Hi. How are you?

895
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,592
- Oh, we're just fine.
- That's good.

896
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,947
How's the cholera problem coming on?

897
01:08:42,948 --> 01:08:44,812
Just fine.
I think we got it licked.

898
01:08:44,814 --> 01:08:48,760
Oh, that's great. It's a real
nasty thing to have happen in a hotel.

899
01:08:48,864 --> 01:08:51,493
Right. Cholera is no fun.

900
01:08:51,597 --> 01:08:53,589
Did you know in the 19th century...

901
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:57,436
cholera accounted for
over 12 million deaths in Europe alone?

902
01:08:57,544 --> 01:08:59,021
- Is that so?
- Right.

903
01:08:59,023 --> 01:09:01,367
So you can see how keen we are
to get it around here.

904
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:04,514
Right now we need cholera
like a hole in the head.

905
01:09:04,616 --> 01:09:06,446
Right.

906
01:09:06,448 --> 01:09:09,242
So, what kind of food would
you like to eat tonight?

907
01:09:09,342 --> 01:09:11,873
Well, we sort of like pineapple.

908
01:09:11,977 --> 01:09:14,322
Yes, we love pineapples.

909
01:09:14,325 --> 01:09:16,541
Anything with pineapple in's
great for us.

910
01:09:16,543 --> 01:09:18,888
Well, why not the dungeon room?

911
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:20,881
Oh, that sounds fine.

912
01:09:20,882 --> 01:09:22,809
Sure is. It's real Hawaiian food...

913
01:09:22,812 --> 01:09:26,758
served in an authentic medieval
English dungeon atmosphere.

914
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,269
Oh, it sounds wonderful.

915
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:37,204
Hello, I'm Diana.
I'm your waitress for tonight.

916
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:38,819
Where're you from?

917
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:41,680
- We're from room 259.
- Where are you from?

918
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:44,185
- I'm from out those doors over there.
- Oh.

919
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:45,344
Great.

920
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,856
- Ice water?
- Thank you.

921
01:09:46,857 --> 01:09:48,687
- Coffee?
- Thank you very much.

922
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,122
- Ketchup?
- Oh, lovely. Real nice.

923
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,761
- TV?
- Oh, that's fine.

924
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:55,375
- That's swell.
- Yeah.

925
01:09:55,377 --> 01:09:57,498
- Telephone.
- A telephone?

926
01:09:57,499 --> 01:09:59,906
You can phone any other table
in the restaurant after 6:00.

927
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:01,643
Oh, that's great.

928
01:10:01,646 --> 01:10:03,155
- Some choice.
- Yeah, right.

929
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:05,884
Okay. Do you want
any food with your meal?

930
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,329
Well, what do you have?

931
01:10:08,332 --> 01:10:11,279
Well, we have things shaped
like this in green...

932
01:10:11,386 --> 01:10:13,793
or things shaped like that in brown.

933
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:16,364
What do you think, darling?

934
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:18,361
Well, it is our anniversary, Marvin.

935
01:10:18,363 --> 01:10:20,643
Yeah, what the hell.
We'll have a couple of things...

936
01:10:20,645 --> 01:10:23,052
shaped like that in brown, please.

937
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,977
Okay, fine.
Thank you, sir.

938
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,927
Two brown.
Number 259.

939
01:10:29,035 --> 01:10:31,442
And will you be
having intercourse tonight?

940
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:34,464
Do we have to decide now?

941
01:10:35,818 --> 01:10:37,519
Sounds a good idea, honey.

942
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:39,801
I mean, it sounds swell.

943
01:10:39,804 --> 01:10:41,731
Why not?

944
01:10:41,733 --> 01:10:44,943
Yeah, right.
Could be fun.

945
01:10:45,044 --> 01:10:48,189
Compliments of the Super Inn.
Have a nice fuck.

946
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:50,698
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

947
01:10:50,895 --> 01:10:53,302
"Super Inn Skins. "

948
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:10,067
Isn't this nice?
How are ya?

949
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:14,886
- Take a little Kodak.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

950
01:11:28,941 --> 01:11:31,988
Good evening. Uh, would you
care for something to talk about?

951
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:34,018
Oh, that would be wonderful.

952
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:36,428
Our special tonight is minorities.

953
01:11:36,432 --> 01:11:38,552
Oh, that sounds real interesting.

954
01:11:38,553 --> 01:11:41,917
- What's this conversation here?
- That's, uh, football.

955
01:11:42,025 --> 01:11:44,370
You can talk about the
Steelers-Bears game Saturday...

956
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:47,581
or you could reminisce about
really great World Series.

957
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:50,060
No, no, no.
What is this one here?

958
01:11:50,062 --> 01:11:53,656
- Ah, that's philosophy.
- Is that a sport?

959
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:56,225
Ah, no, it's more of an attempt...

960
01:11:56,331 --> 01:12:00,089
to construct a viable hypothesis
to explain the meaning of life.

961
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:03,136
- What was that?
- What's he saying?

962
01:12:03,242 --> 01:12:07,769
Oh, that sounds wonderful. Would you like
to talk about the meaning of life, darling?

963
01:12:07,872 --> 01:12:09,992
Sure. Why not?

964
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,114
- Philosophy for two?
- Right.

965
01:12:12,115 --> 01:12:14,042
- Room?
- 259.

966
01:12:14,044 --> 01:12:18,954
- 259.
- Yeah. Uh, uh, how do we...

967
01:12:19,059 --> 01:12:22,686
- Oh, you folks want me to start you off?
- We'd appreciate that.

968
01:12:22,788 --> 01:12:25,965
Okay! Well, uh, look.

969
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:29,114
Have you ever wondered
just why you're here?

970
01:12:30,986 --> 01:12:33,933
Well, we went to Miami last year
and California the year before...

971
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,502
No, no, no. I mean, uh, why we're
here, on this planet.

972
01:12:39,504 --> 01:12:41,431
Mmm, no.

973
01:12:41,433 --> 01:12:45,992
Right. Ah, you ever wanted to know
what it's all about?

974
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:47,924
Nope.

975
01:12:47,927 --> 01:12:50,808
Righty-ho!
Uh, well, uh,

976
01:12:50,917 --> 01:12:53,612
see, throughout history, there've
been certain men and women...

977
01:12:53,713 --> 01:12:57,724
who've tried to find the solution
to the mysteries of existence.

978
01:12:57,829 --> 01:13:00,710
- Great!
- And we call these guys philosophers.

979
01:13:00,818 --> 01:13:03,034
- Oh!
- And that's what we're talking about.

980
01:13:03,036 --> 01:13:05,316
- Right!
- Oh, that's neat.

981
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:09,362
Well, you look you're getting the idea, so
why don't I give you these conversation cards.

982
01:13:09,466 --> 01:13:13,795
They'll tell you a little about philosophical
method, names of famous philosophers.

983
01:13:13,902 --> 01:13:18,297
- There you are. Have a nice conversation.
- Oh, thank you very much.

984
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:21,350
- He's cute.
- Yeah, real understanding.

985
01:13:21,456 --> 01:13:25,598
Oh! I never knew Schopenhauer was
a philosopher.

986
01:13:27,146 --> 01:13:31,157
Oh, yeah. He's the one
that begins with an "S."

987
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:35,211
Oh.

988
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:39,019
Um, like Nietzsche.

989
01:13:40,394 --> 01:13:42,785
Does "Nietzsche"
begin with an "S"?

990
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,866
Uh, there's an "S"
in "Nietzsche. "

991
01:13:48,438 --> 01:13:51,364
Oh, well, yes, there is.

992
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:53,704
Do all philosophers
have an "S" in them?

993
01:13:53,706 --> 01:13:56,513
Uh, yeah. I think most of them do.

994
01:13:56,611 --> 01:14:00,975
Oh. Does that mean Selina Jones is
a philosopher?

995
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:04,299
Yeah! Right! She could be.

996
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,472
She sings about the meaning of life.

997
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:11,163
Yeah. That's right, but I don't think
she writes her own material.

998
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:15,146
No. Oh, maybe Schopenhauer
writes her material.

999
01:14:15,253 --> 01:14:18,027
No. Burt Bacharach
writes it.

1000
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:20,835
There's no "S"
in "Burt Bacharach. "

1001
01:14:20,936 --> 01:14:23,169
Or in "Hal David. "

1002
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,684
Who's Hal David?

1003
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:29,041
He writes the lyrics.
Burt just writes the tunes.

1004
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,546
Only now, he's married
to Carol Bayer Sager.

1005
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:38,458
Uh, waiter?
This conversation isn't very good.

1006
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:43,433
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Ah, we do have
one today that's not on the menu.

1007
01:14:43,537 --> 01:14:47,356
It's sort of a specialty of the house,
you know? Live organ transplants.

1008
01:14:48,676 --> 01:14:51,067
Live organ transplants?
What's that?

1009
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:02,010
Don't worry, dear.
I'll get it.

1010
01:15:09,235 --> 01:15:12,455
- Yes?
- Hello. Uh, can we have your liver?

1011
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,945
- My what?
- Your liver.

1012
01:15:14,949 --> 01:15:18,584
It's a large glandular organ
in your abdomen.

1013
01:15:19,929 --> 01:15:22,671
You know, it's
reddish-brown, sort of...

1014
01:15:22,771 --> 01:15:26,623
Yeah, yeah, I know what it is, but
I'm using it.

1015
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:32,818
- Come on, sir. Don't muck us about.
- Hey, hey, hey!

1016
01:15:32,922 --> 01:15:35,313
Hello!

1017
01:15:36,434 --> 01:15:38,849
- What's this, then?
- A liver donor's card.

1018
01:15:38,956 --> 01:15:40,965
- Need we say more?
- No.

1019
01:15:40,966 --> 01:15:44,568
Listen, I can't give it you now.
It says "in the event of death. "

1020
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:49,358
No one has ever had their liver
taken out by us and survived.

1021
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:51,872
Just lie there, sir.
It won't take a minute.

1022
01:16:05,419 --> 01:16:09,054
- Here. What's going on?
- He's donating his liver, madam.

1023
01:16:09,153 --> 01:16:13,201
Is this because he took out
one of those silly cards?

1024
01:16:13,303 --> 01:16:16,077
- That's right, madam.
- Typical of him.

1025
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:18,346
He goes down to
the public library,

1026
01:16:18,348 --> 01:16:20,262
sees a few signs up,

1027
01:16:20,263 --> 01:16:22,654
comes home all full
of good intentions.

1028
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:26,423
He gives blood, does cold research,
all that sort of thing.

1029
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:33,056
What do you do
with them all, anyway?

1030
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,329
They all go to
saving lives, madam.

1031
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:37,244
That's what he used to say.

1032
01:16:37,246 --> 01:16:39,543
"It's all for the good of the country,"
he used to say.

1033
01:16:39,546 --> 01:16:43,430
Do you think it's all for
the good of the country?

1034
01:16:43,534 --> 01:16:46,395
Do you think it's all for
the good of the country?

1035
01:16:46,503 --> 01:16:50,322
I wouldn't know about that, madam.
We're just doing our jobs, you know?

1036
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:54,381
You're not doctors, then?

1037
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,558
Oh, blimey, no.

1038
01:16:56,559 --> 01:17:00,030
Mum, Dad, I'm off out now.

1039
01:17:00,135 --> 01:17:02,526
- I'll see you about 7:00?
- Righto, son.

1040
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:05,016
Look after yourself.

1041
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:12,485
You, uh, fancy a cup of tea?

1042
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:15,511
Oh, well, that'd be very nice.
Thank you.

1043
01:17:15,617 --> 01:17:18,008
Thank you very much, madam.

1044
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:21,041
I thought she'd never ask.

1045
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:27,746
Uh, you do realize...

1046
01:17:27,748 --> 01:17:32,591
he has to be, uh, well, dead
by the terms of the card...

1047
01:17:32,696 --> 01:17:34,610
before he donates his liver.

1048
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:38,724
Well, I told him that, but he
never listens to me, silly man.

1049
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:41,216
I mean, I was wonderin', uh...

1050
01:17:41,315 --> 01:17:43,958
Well, you know, what you was
thinkin' of doin' after that.

1051
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:47,020
I mean...
Will you stay on your own?

1052
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:51,238
Or is there, well,
someone else, sort of...

1053
01:17:52,808 --> 01:17:54,722
on the horizon?

1054
01:17:54,723 --> 01:17:58,129
I'm too old for that sort of thing.
I'm past my prime.

1055
01:17:58,234 --> 01:18:01,901
Not at all.
Very attractive woman.

1056
01:18:02,002 --> 01:18:05,309
Well, I'm certainly not thinking
of getting hitched up again.

1057
01:18:06,885 --> 01:18:09,276
- Sure?
- Sure.

1058
01:18:16,623 --> 01:18:20,225
- Can we have your liver then?
- I would be scared.

1059
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:22,716
All right.

1060
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,462
I'll tell you what.

1061
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:28,162
Listen to this.

1062
01:18:28,164 --> 01:18:31,460
* Whenever life gets you
down, Mrs. Brown, *

1063
01:18:31,568 --> 01:18:34,864
* and things seem
hard or tough... *

1064
01:18:34,973 --> 01:18:39,518
* and people are stupid,
obnoxious or daft... *

1065
01:18:39,617 --> 01:18:42,284
* And you feel
that you've had *

1066
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:46,387
* Quite enough *

1067
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:51,664
* Just remember
that you're standing *

1068
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,996
* On a planet
that's evolving *

1069
01:18:53,997 --> 01:18:57,619
* And revolving at
900 miles an hour *

1070
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,526
* It's orbiting at 19 miles a second
so it's reckoned *

1071
01:19:01,633 --> 01:19:05,504
* A sun that is the source
of all our power *

1072
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:08,905
* The sun and you and me and all
the stars that we can see *

1073
01:19:09,013 --> 01:19:12,667
* Are moving
at a million miles a day *

1074
01:19:12,768 --> 01:19:16,639
* In an outer spiral arm
at 40,000 miles an hour *

1075
01:19:16,744 --> 01:19:19,314
* Of the galaxy
we call the Milky Way *

1076
01:19:28,038 --> 01:19:31,660
* Our galaxy itself contains
a hundred billion stars *

1077
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:35,567
* It's a hundred thousand
light years side to side *

1078
01:19:35,673 --> 01:19:38,915
* It bulges in the middle
16,000 light years thick *

1079
01:19:39,014 --> 01:19:43,049
* But out by us, it's just
3,000 light years wide *

1080
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:46,640
* We're 30,000 light years
from galactic central point *

1081
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:50,399
* We go round
every 200 million years *

1082
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,056
* And our galaxy is only
one of millions of billions *

1083
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:57,909
* In this amazing
and expanding universe *

1084
01:20:28,677 --> 01:20:32,516
* The universe itself keeps on
expanding and expanding *

1085
01:20:32,622 --> 01:20:36,211
* In all of the directions
it can whizz *

1086
01:20:36,312 --> 01:20:39,934
* As fast as it can go the speed
of light you know *

1087
01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:43,330
* Twelve million miles a minute and
that's the fastest speed there is *

1088
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:47,244
* So remember when you're feeling
very small and insecure *

1089
01:20:47,352 --> 01:20:51,071
* How amazingly unlikely
is your birth *

1090
01:20:51,169 --> 01:20:54,791
* And pray that there's intelligent
life somewhere up in space *

1091
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,641
* 'Cause there's bugger all
down here on earth. *

1092
01:21:03,054 --> 01:21:05,737
Makes you feel so...
sort of insignificant, doesn't it?

1093
01:21:05,838 --> 01:21:08,235
Yeah. Yeah.

1094
01:21:08,814 --> 01:21:12,392
Can we have your liver, then?

1095
01:21:12,495 --> 01:21:14,892
- Yeah, all right. You talked me into it.
- Eric!

1096
01:21:23,409 --> 01:21:26,507
Which brings us, once again,
to the urgent realization...

1097
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:30,473
of just how much there is
still left to own.

1098
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:35,401
Item six on the agenda:
"The Meaning of Life. "

1099
01:21:37,461 --> 01:21:40,079
Now, uh, Harry, you've had
some thoughts on this.

1100
01:21:40,182 --> 01:21:43,051
I've had a team working on this over
the past few weeks,

1101
01:21:43,157 --> 01:21:48,394
and what we've come up with can be
reduced to two fundamental concepts.

1102
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,601
One: People are not
wearing enough hats.

1103
01:21:51,704 --> 01:21:54,322
Two: Matter is energy.

1104
01:21:54,424 --> 01:21:59,313
In the universe, there are many energy
fields which we cannot normally perceive.

1105
01:21:59,418 --> 01:22:01,815
Some energies have
a spiritual source...

1106
01:22:01,818 --> 01:22:04,501
which act upon a person's soul.

1107
01:22:04,603 --> 01:22:08,181
However, this soul
does not exist ab initio...

1108
01:22:08,284 --> 01:22:11,153
as orthodox Christianity teaches.

1109
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:13,404
It has to be brought into existence...

1110
01:22:13,405 --> 01:22:17,202
by a process of guided self-observation.

1111
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:20,473
However, this is rarely achieved owing
to man's unique ability...

1112
01:22:20,575 --> 01:22:24,634
to be distracted from spiritual matters
by everyday trivia.

1113
01:22:28,768 --> 01:22:31,165
What was that about hats again?

1114
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:35,448
- Oh, people aren't wearing enough.
- Is this true?

1115
01:22:35,553 --> 01:22:39,382
Certainly. Hat sales have increased,
but not pari passu, as our research...

1116
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:41,911
When you say "enough,"
enough for what purpose?

1117
01:22:42,019 --> 01:22:44,572
Can I just ask, with reference to
your second point,

1118
01:22:44,676 --> 01:22:49,018
when you say souls don't develop because
people become distracted...

1119
01:22:51,237 --> 01:22:53,634
Has anyone noticed
that building there before?

1120
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:58,432
- What?
- Good Lord!

1121
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:19,658
Good Lord!

1122
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:23,041
The Crimson Permanent Assurance!

1123
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:28,107
We interrupt this film to apologize
for this unwarranted attack...

1124
01:23:28,206 --> 01:23:30,220
by the supporting feature.

1125
01:23:30,222 --> 01:23:32,204
Luckily, we have been prepared
for this eventuality...

1126
01:23:32,205 --> 01:23:34,348
and are now taking steps
to remedy it.

1127
01:23:34,351 --> 01:23:36,748
Thank you.

1128
01:23:41,745 --> 01:23:44,200
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1129
01:23:44,305 --> 01:23:47,304
Here's a little number I tossed off
recently in the Caribbean.

1130
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:50,191
* Isn't it awfully nice
to have a penis *

1131
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:53,105
* Isn't it frightfully good
to have a dong *

1132
01:23:53,203 --> 01:23:55,952
* It's swell to have a stiffy
It's divine to own a dick *

1133
01:23:56,052 --> 01:23:59,467
* From the tiniest little tadger
to the world's biggest prick *

1134
01:23:59,572 --> 01:24:02,768
* So three cheers for your Willy
or John Thomas *

1135
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,739
* Hooray for your
one-eyed trouser snake *

1136
01:24:05,846 --> 01:24:09,621
* Your piece of pork your wife's
best friend your percy or your cock *

1137
01:24:09,718 --> 01:24:12,914
* You can wrap it up in ribbons
You can slip it in your sock *

1138
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:15,862
* But don't take it out in public
or they will stick you in the dock *

1139
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,327
* And you won't come back **

1140
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:20,726
Thank you very much.

1141
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:23,958
Oh, what a frightfully witty song.

1142
01:24:23,994 --> 01:24:26,391
So clever.

1143
01:24:28,058 --> 01:24:30,479
- Jolly good.
- Marvellous.

1144
01:24:37,757 --> 01:24:40,154
Oh, shit!
It's Mr. Creosote!

1145
01:24:57,985 --> 01:25:01,301
- Ah, good afternoon, sir, and how are we today?
- Better.

1146
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:04,476
- Better?
- Better get a bucket. I'm gonna throw up.

1147
01:25:04,579 --> 01:25:07,448
Uh, Gaston? A bucket for monsieur.

1148
01:25:10,693 --> 01:25:13,090
There we are, monsieur.

1149
01:25:27,688 --> 01:25:29,895
- Merci, Gaston.
- I haven't finished.

1150
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:31,751
Oh, pardon!
Gaston?

1151
01:25:31,753 --> 01:25:33,831
A thousand pardons,
monsieur.

1152
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:37,958
Now, this afternoon, we have monsieur's
favourite: The jugged hare.

1153
01:25:38,058 --> 01:25:40,136
The hare is very high,

1154
01:25:40,139 --> 01:25:42,626
and the sauce is very rich,

1155
01:25:42,732 --> 01:25:47,205
with truffles, anchovies,
Grand Marnier, bacon and cream.

1156
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:49,730
- Thank you, Gaston.
- There's still more.

1157
01:25:49,837 --> 01:25:52,234
Ah. Allow me.

1158
01:25:53,422 --> 01:25:55,819
A new bucket for monsieur.

1159
01:25:59,214 --> 01:26:01,611
And the cleaning woman.

1160
01:26:03,376 --> 01:26:06,223
Et maintenant, would monsieur care
for an aperitif...

1161
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:08,718
or would he prefer
to order straightaway?

1162
01:26:09,841 --> 01:26:13,550
Today, we have for appetizers...
excuse me...

1163
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:18,865
uh, moules marinieres, pate de
foie gras, beluga caviar,

1164
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:22,411
eggs Benedictine, tarte de
poireaux... that's leek tart...

1165
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:26,257
frogs' legs amandine or oeufs
de caille Richard Shepherd...

1166
01:26:26,357 --> 01:26:30,318
C'est a dire, little quails' eggs on
a bed of pureed mushrooms.

1167
01:26:30,421 --> 01:26:32,340
It's very delicate,
very succulent.

1168
01:26:32,343 --> 01:26:35,026
I'll have the lot.

1169
01:26:35,127 --> 01:26:38,902
A wise choice, monsieur.
And now, how would you like it served?

1170
01:26:38,999 --> 01:26:41,396
All, uh, mixed up
together in a bucket?

1171
01:26:41,464 --> 01:26:43,383
Yeah. With the eggs on top.

1172
01:26:43,384 --> 01:26:46,865
- But of course. Avec les oeufs frites.
- Don't skimp on the pate.

1173
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,548
Oh, monsieur, I assure you: Just because
it is mixed up with all the other things,

1174
01:26:50,651 --> 01:26:52,921
we would not dream of giving you
less than the full amount.

1175
01:26:52,923 --> 01:26:56,982
In fact, I will personally make sure
you have a double helping.

1176
01:26:57,083 --> 01:27:00,246
Maintenant, quelque chose a boire.
Something to drink, monsieur?

1177
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:03,382
Yeah, I'll have six bottles
of Chateau Latour '45...

1178
01:27:03,486 --> 01:27:06,420
- '45.
- And a double Jeroboam of champagne.

1179
01:27:06,526 --> 01:27:08,923
Bon. And the usual brown ales?

1180
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:12,667
Yeah. No, wait a minute. I think
I could only manage six crates today.

1181
01:27:12,767 --> 01:27:17,208
I hope monsieur was not
overdoing it last night.

1182
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:19,295
- Shut up!
- D'accord.

1183
01:27:19,297 --> 01:27:22,395
Ah! The new bucket
and the cleaning woman.

1184
01:27:29,156 --> 01:27:31,075
Is there something
wrong with the food?

1185
01:27:31,076 --> 01:27:32,995
No, the food was excellent.

1186
01:27:32,996 --> 01:27:36,159
- Perhaps you're not happy with the service?
- No, no complaints.

1187
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,609
It's just that we have to go.
I'm having rather a heavy period.

1188
01:27:40,933 --> 01:27:43,714
And we have a train to catch.

1189
01:27:43,815 --> 01:27:46,978
Oh! Yes, of course.
We have a train to catch.

1190
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:50,625
And I don't want to start bleeding
all over the seats.

1191
01:27:50,727 --> 01:27:53,377
- Madam?
- Perhaps we should be going?

1192
01:27:54,825 --> 01:27:58,120
Ah, very well, monsieur.
Thank you so much.

1193
01:27:58,218 --> 01:28:02,277
So nice to see you, and I hope very
much we will see you again very soon.

1194
01:28:02,378 --> 01:28:04,617
Au revoir, monsieur.

1195
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:07,749
Oh, dear.
I have trodden in monsieur's bucket.

1196
01:28:11,308 --> 01:28:13,705
Another bucket
for monsieur!

1197
01:28:15,693 --> 01:28:18,474
And perhaps a hose.

1198
01:28:20,526 --> 01:28:23,493
Oh, Max.
Really!

1199
01:28:38,738 --> 01:28:42,414
- Finally, monsieur, a wafer-thin mint.
- Nah!

1200
01:28:42,515 --> 01:28:45,646
Oh, sir, it's only
a tiny, little thin one.

1201
01:28:45,748 --> 01:28:49,261
- No, fuck off. I'm full.
- Oh, sir. Hmm?

1202
01:28:50,901 --> 01:28:52,915
It's only wafer-thin.

1203
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:57,619
Look, I couldn't eat another thing.
I'm absolutely stuffed.

1204
01:28:57,718 --> 01:29:01,612
- Bugger off.
- Oh, sir, just... just one.

1205
01:29:04,664 --> 01:29:08,145
- Oh, just one.
- Just the one, monsieur.

1206
01:29:09,882 --> 01:29:12,279
Voila.

1207
01:29:15,514 --> 01:29:17,911
Bon appetit.

1208
01:29:57,155 --> 01:30:00,122
Thank you, monsieur,
and now, here's your check.

1209
01:30:32,395 --> 01:30:35,429
You know, Maria, I sometimes wonder...

1210
01:30:35,533 --> 01:30:39,657
if we'll ever discover
the meaning of it all...

1211
01:30:39,757 --> 01:30:42,154
working in a place like this.

1212
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:45,955
Well, I've worked in worse places,
philosophically speaking.

1213
01:30:46,063 --> 01:30:48,997
- Really, Maria?
- Yes.

1214
01:30:49,103 --> 01:30:51,819
I used to work
in the Academie Francaise,

1215
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,317
but it didn't do me
any good at all.

1216
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:59,501
I once worked in the library
in the Prado in Madrid,

1217
01:30:59,602 --> 01:31:03,083
but it didn't teach me nothin',
I recall.

1218
01:31:03,187 --> 01:31:07,824
And the Library of Congress you'd have
thought would hold some key,

1219
01:31:07,923 --> 01:31:12,396
but it didn't, and neither did
the Bodleian Library.

1220
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,777
In the British Museum,
I hoped to find some clue.

1221
01:31:16,886 --> 01:31:21,359
I worked there from 9:00 'til 6:00,
read every volume through,

1222
01:31:21,463 --> 01:31:26,133
but it didn't teach me nothing
about life's mystery.

1223
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:30,771
I just kept getting older,
and it got more difficult to see.

1224
01:31:30,872 --> 01:31:35,476
'Til eventually, me eyes went, and
me arthritis got bad.

1225
01:31:35,577 --> 01:31:38,227
So now, I'm
cleaning up in here.

1226
01:31:39,611 --> 01:31:42,008
But I can't be really sad...

1227
01:31:42,074 --> 01:31:45,587
'cause you see,
I feel that life's a game.

1228
01:31:45,692 --> 01:31:48,626
You sometimes win or lose,

1229
01:31:48,732 --> 01:31:51,415
and though I may be
down right now,

1230
01:31:51,517 --> 01:31:54,004
at least I don't work for Jews.

1231
01:31:58,335 --> 01:32:00,638
I'm so sorry.

1232
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,283
I had no idea we had
a racist working here.

1233
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:07,451
I- I apologize
most sincerely.

1234
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,758
I mean...

1235
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:12,379
Where are you going?
No, I can explain...

1236
01:32:12,482 --> 01:32:14,879
Oh, quel domage.

1237
01:32:17,315 --> 01:32:19,426
As for me... Huh!

1238
01:32:19,427 --> 01:32:21,848
If you want to know
what I think...

1239
01:32:21,955 --> 01:32:24,352
I'll show you something.

1240
01:32:25,157 --> 01:32:28,539
- Come with me.
- I was saying that...

1241
01:32:28,646 --> 01:32:31,043
- Uh, hello?
- Come on.

1242
01:32:31,783 --> 01:32:34,180
Uh, hello?

1243
01:32:35,207 --> 01:32:37,604
- Hello!
- This way.

1244
01:32:42,504 --> 01:32:44,959
Come on. Don't be shy.

1245
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:47,462
Mind the stairs, all right?

1246
01:32:51,562 --> 01:32:53,959
I think this will help explain.

1247
01:33:00,877 --> 01:33:03,274
Come along. Come along.

1248
01:33:05,773 --> 01:33:08,170
Over here.

1249
01:33:17,648 --> 01:33:20,045
Come on. Come on.

1250
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:26,318
This way.

1251
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:31,376
Come on.

1252
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,338
This way.

1253
01:33:37,172 --> 01:33:39,569
Stay by me, huh?

1254
01:33:41,813 --> 01:33:44,210
Nearly there now.

1255
01:33:53,144 --> 01:33:55,541
You see that?

1256
01:33:56,921 --> 01:33:59,318
That's where I was born.

1257
01:34:00,762 --> 01:34:04,559
You know, one day,
my... my mother,

1258
01:34:04,667 --> 01:34:07,088
she put me on her knee
and she said to me,

1259
01:34:08,412 --> 01:34:10,618
"Gaston, my son,

1260
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:13,468
"the world is a beautiful place.

1261
01:34:14,813 --> 01:34:17,976
"You must go into it
and love everyone.

1262
01:34:19,935 --> 01:34:25,205
"Try to make everyone happy and
bring peace and contentment...

1263
01:34:25,311 --> 01:34:27,708
everywhere you go. "

1264
01:34:28,736 --> 01:34:31,133
So I became a waiter.

1265
01:34:39,138 --> 01:34:42,585
Well, it's... it's not much
of a philosophy, I know.

1266
01:34:44,419 --> 01:34:47,288
Well, fuck you.

1267
01:34:47,396 --> 01:34:51,290
I can live my own life
in my own way if I want to.

1268
01:34:51,397 --> 01:34:53,794
Fuck off.

1269
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:57,093
Don't come followin' me!

1270
01:35:32,076 --> 01:35:34,253
This man is about to die.

1271
01:35:34,254 --> 01:35:37,103
In a few moments now,
he will be killed,

1272
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,689
for Arthur Jarrett
is a convicted criminal...

1273
01:35:39,795 --> 01:35:43,507
who has been allowed to choose
the manner of his own execution.

1274
01:35:47,387 --> 01:35:49,786
There he is!

1275
01:36:02,988 --> 01:36:08,328
Arthur Charles Herbert
Runcie MacAdam Jarrett,

1276
01:36:08,432 --> 01:36:12,013
you have been convicted
by 12 good persons, and true,

1277
01:36:12,116 --> 01:36:16,975
of the crime of first degree making
of gratuitous sexist jokes...

1278
01:36:17,082 --> 01:36:19,481
in a moving picture.

1279
01:36:54,752 --> 01:36:57,274
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1280
01:37:02,023 --> 01:37:05,604
It's no good.
I- I just can't go on.

1281
01:37:05,706 --> 01:37:08,011
I'm no good anymore.

1282
01:37:08,013 --> 01:37:10,830
I- I want to end it all!

1283
01:37:10,928 --> 01:37:13,327
Good-bye!
Good-bye!

1284
01:37:20,345 --> 01:37:23,445
Oh, my God!

1285
01:37:23,549 --> 01:37:26,104
Oh, no! I...

1286
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:29,143
What'll I do?
I can't live without him!

1287
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:31,650
I- I-I...

1288
01:37:35,304 --> 01:37:37,320
Mummy! Mum, where are you?

1289
01:37:37,323 --> 01:37:40,008
Daddy?
Mummy?

1290
01:37:40,109 --> 01:37:42,827
Mummy?

1291
01:38:45,712 --> 01:38:48,111
Yes?

1292
01:38:48,755 --> 01:38:51,178
Is it about the hedge?

1293
01:38:52,503 --> 01:38:54,423
Well, I'm awfully sorry, but...

1294
01:38:54,425 --> 01:38:56,666
I am the Grim Reaper.

1295
01:38:56,667 --> 01:38:58,844
- Who?
- The Grim Reaper.

1296
01:38:58,846 --> 01:39:02,843
- Yes, I see.
- I am Death.

1297
01:39:02,945 --> 01:39:06,690
Yes, well, the thing is, we've got some
people from America for dinner tonight...

1298
01:39:06,789 --> 01:39:09,125
- Who is it, darling?
- It's a Mr. Death or something.

1299
01:39:09,128 --> 01:39:12,261
He's come about the reaping?
I don't think we need any at the moment.

1300
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:15,715
Hello. Don't leave him hanging around
outside, darling. Ask him in.

1301
01:39:15,823 --> 01:39:18,222
- I don't think it's quite the moment.
- Do come in. Come along.

1302
01:39:18,321 --> 01:39:21,170
Come and have a drink.
Do. Come on.

1303
01:39:24,216 --> 01:39:26,868
It's one of the little men
from the village.

1304
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:29,819
Do come in.
Please.

1305
01:39:29,917 --> 01:39:32,919
- This is Howard Katzenberg from Philadelphia.
- Hi.

1306
01:39:33,025 --> 01:39:35,809
- And his wife, Debbie.
- Hello there.

1307
01:39:35,907 --> 01:39:39,259
And these are the Portland Smythes,
Jeremy and Fiona.

1308
01:39:39,366 --> 01:39:42,434
- Good evening.
- This is Mr. Death.

1309
01:39:49,137 --> 01:39:52,718
- Well, do get Mr. Death a drink, darling.
- Yes.

1310
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:55,219
Mr. Death is a reaper.

1311
01:39:55,255 --> 01:39:58,257
The Grim Reaper.

1312
01:39:58,362 --> 01:40:00,761
Hardly surprising in this weather.

1313
01:40:02,975 --> 01:40:05,563
So you still reap around here,
do you, Mr. Death?

1314
01:40:05,665 --> 01:40:10,655
I am the Grim Reaper.

1315
01:40:10,759 --> 01:40:14,821
- That's about all he says.
There's your drink, Mr. Death.
- Do sit down.

1316
01:40:14,922 --> 01:40:18,088
We were just talking about some of
the awful problems facing the Third...

1317
01:40:22,643 --> 01:40:26,575
Would you prefer white?
I'm afraid we don't have any beer.

1318
01:40:26,678 --> 01:40:28,373
The Stilton's awfully good.

1319
01:40:28,376 --> 01:40:31,476
I am not...

1320
01:40:31,579 --> 01:40:34,778
of this world.

1321
01:40:37,185 --> 01:40:39,105
Good Lord.

1322
01:40:39,106 --> 01:40:41,824
I am Death.

1323
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:49,255
Well, isn't that extraordinary? We were just
talking about death only five minutes ago.

1324
01:40:49,358 --> 01:40:52,939
Yes, we were. You know, whether
death is really the end...

1325
01:40:53,042 --> 01:40:55,978
As my husband Howard here feels,
or whether there is...

1326
01:40:56,085 --> 01:40:59,185
and one so hates to use words like
"soul" or "spirit"...

1327
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:01,207
- What other words can one use?
- Exactly.

1328
01:41:01,209 --> 01:41:04,921
You do not understand.

1329
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:08,533
Ah, no.
Obviously not.

1330
01:41:08,641 --> 01:41:11,425
- I'll tell you something, Mr. Death...
- You don't...

1331
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:13,923
I'd like to express
on behalf of everybody here...

1332
01:41:14,023 --> 01:41:16,039
what a really unique
experience this is.

1333
01:41:16,041 --> 01:41:19,109
- Hear, hear.
- Yes, we're so delighted that you dropped in.

1334
01:41:19,212 --> 01:41:22,182
- Can I just finish, please?
- Mr. Death.

1335
01:41:22,287 --> 01:41:25,005
Is there an afterlife?

1336
01:41:25,106 --> 01:41:27,249
Dear, if you could just
wait, please...

1337
01:41:27,252 --> 01:41:29,172
Are you sure you wouldn't like
some sherry or...

1338
01:41:29,174 --> 01:41:32,210
- Angela, I'd like to say this, please.
- Be quiet!

1339
01:41:32,313 --> 01:41:35,097
- Can I just say this at this time, please?
- Silence!

1340
01:41:35,195 --> 01:41:37,913
I have come for you.

1341
01:41:40,225 --> 01:41:42,145
You mean to...

1342
01:41:42,147 --> 01:41:45,215
Take you away.

1343
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:49,150
That is my purpose.

1344
01:41:50,893 --> 01:41:53,924
I am Death.

1345
01:41:56,393 --> 01:41:59,390
Well, that's cast rather a gloom over
the evening, hasn't it?

1346
01:41:59,497 --> 01:42:02,429
I don't see it that way, Geoff.
I think we're dealing with...

1347
01:42:02,535 --> 01:42:05,315
a potentially positive learning
experience that can...

1348
01:42:05,413 --> 01:42:08,193
Shut up!
Shut up, you American.

1349
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:11,136
You always talk, you Americans.

1350
01:42:11,234 --> 01:42:13,687
You talk and you talk
and you say...

1351
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:19,156
"Let me tell you something"
and "I just wanna say this. "

1352
01:42:19,262 --> 01:42:22,740
Well, you're dead now,
so shut up!

1353
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:25,240
- Dead?
- Dead.

1354
01:42:27,259 --> 01:42:30,355
- All of us?
- All of you.

1355
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:36,171
Now look here. You barge in here
quite uninvited, break glasses...

1356
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:38,674
and then announce quite casually
that we're all dead.

1357
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:43,441
- Well, I would remind you that
you're a guest in this house...
- Be quiet!

1358
01:42:43,539 --> 01:42:47,693
Englishmen! You're all
so fucking pompous!

1359
01:42:47,793 --> 01:42:50,212
None of you
have got any balls.

1360
01:42:51,504 --> 01:42:54,917
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

1361
01:42:55,021 --> 01:42:57,768
How can we all have died
at the same time?

1362
01:43:10,023 --> 01:43:12,418
The salmon mousse.

1363
01:43:13,637 --> 01:43:16,701
Darling, you didn't use
canned salmon, did you?

1364
01:43:16,803 --> 01:43:20,313
I'm most dreadfully embarrassed.

1365
01:43:20,417 --> 01:43:23,643
Now the time has come.

1366
01:43:25,055 --> 01:43:29,209
Follow.
Follow me.

1367
01:43:42,903 --> 01:43:45,650
Just testing.
Sorry.

1368
01:43:46,709 --> 01:43:50,961
Follow me.
Now.

1369
01:43:56,977 --> 01:43:59,372
Come.

1370
01:44:01,838 --> 01:44:04,389
The fishmonger promised me
he'd have some fresh salmon.

1371
01:44:04,493 --> 01:44:06,731
He's normally so reliable.

1372
01:44:06,732 --> 01:44:09,348
- Can we take our glasses?
- Good idea.

1373
01:44:12,489 --> 01:44:15,454
Hey! I didn't even eat the mousse.

1374
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:22,816
Honestly, darling,
I'm so embarrassed.

1375
01:44:22,884 --> 01:44:26,197
It really is embarrassing. I mean,
to serve salmon with botulism...

1376
01:44:26,307 --> 01:44:28,224
at a dinner party is social death.

1377
01:44:30,497 --> 01:44:33,016
- Shall we take our cars?
- Why not?

1378
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:36,019
- Good idea.
- Why not?

1379
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:13,183
Behold
Paradise.

1380
01:45:14,923 --> 01:45:18,881
- I love it here, darling.
- Me, too, Marvin.

1381
01:45:18,985 --> 01:45:21,982
Hello. Welcome to heaven.

1382
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:32,985
Excuse me. Could you just
sign here, please, sir?

1383
01:45:33,091 --> 01:45:35,456
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1384
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:38,325
There's a table for you through there,
in the restaurant.

1385
01:45:38,431 --> 01:45:41,744
- For the ladies.
- Mmm! Afterlife mints.

1386
01:45:41,855 --> 01:45:43,931
- Thank you.
- Happy Christmas.

1387
01:45:43,933 --> 01:45:46,517
- Oh, is it Christmas today?
- Of course, madam.

1388
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:48,570
It's Christmas every day
in heaven.

1389
01:45:48,572 --> 01:45:51,417
- Oh! How 'bout that?
- Lovely.

1390
01:46:34,565 --> 01:46:36,482
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1391
01:46:36,485 --> 01:46:40,705
It's truly a real honourable experience
to be here this evening,

1392
01:46:40,802 --> 01:46:43,255
a very wonderful and warm...

1393
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:46,229
and emotional moment
for all of us.

1394
01:46:46,336 --> 01:46:48,381
And I'd like to sing a song...

1395
01:46:48,382 --> 01:46:51,795
for all of you.

1396
01:46:55,356 --> 01:47:00,688
* It's Christmas in heaven
All the children sing *

1397
01:47:00,793 --> 01:47:02,710
* Ah, ah-ah-ah *

1398
01:47:02,713 --> 01:47:05,427
* It's Christmas
in heaven *

1399
01:47:05,527 --> 01:47:09,353
* Hark, hark, those
church bells ring *

1400
01:47:09,462 --> 01:47:12,623
* It's Christmas in heaven *

1401
01:47:12,723 --> 01:47:16,036
* The snow falls
from the sky *

1402
01:47:16,147 --> 01:47:19,460
* But it's nice and warm
and everyone *

1403
01:47:19,568 --> 01:47:22,729
* Looks smart
and wears a tie *

1404
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:31,719
* It's Christmas
in heaven *

1405
01:47:31,819 --> 01:47:34,948
* There's great films
on TV*

1406
01:47:35,049 --> 01:47:38,691
* The Sound of Music
twice an hour *

1407
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:42,269
* And Jaws I, II and III *

1408
01:47:42,374 --> 01:47:45,852
* There's gifts for all the family *

1409
01:47:45,956 --> 01:47:49,369
* There's toiletries
and trains *

1410
01:47:49,474 --> 01:47:52,854
* There's Sony Walkman
headphone sets *

1411
01:47:52,961 --> 01:47:56,253
* And the latest video games *

1412
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:59,163
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas in heaven *

1413
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,873
* Hip, hip, hip, hip
hip hooray *

1414
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:06,354
* Every single day *

1415
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:08,853
* Is Christmas Day *

1416
01:48:10,424 --> 01:48:13,040
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas in heaven *

1417
01:48:14,423 --> 01:48:16,876
* Hip, hip, hip, hip
hip hooray *

1418
01:48:16,981 --> 01:48:20,240
* Every single day
is Christ... *

1419
01:48:24,497 --> 01:48:27,211
Well, that's the end of the film.
Now here's The Meaning of Life.

1420
01:48:29,168 --> 01:48:31,563
Thank you, Brigitte.

1421
01:48:32,462 --> 01:48:35,046
Ahem.

1422
01:48:35,149 --> 01:48:38,408
Well, it's nothing very special. "Try and
be nice to people. Avoid eating fat.

1423
01:48:38,508 --> 01:48:40,840
"Read a good book every now and then.
Get some walking in...

1424
01:48:40,841 --> 01:48:44,799
and try and live together in peace and harmony
with people of all creeds and nations. "

1425
01:48:44,904 --> 01:48:47,684
And finally, here are some completely
gratuitous pictures of penises...

1426
01:48:47,782 --> 01:48:50,595
to annoy the censors and to hopefully
spark some sort of controversy,

1427
01:48:50,693 --> 01:48:53,789
which is the only way these days to
get the jaded video-sated public...

1428
01:48:53,891 --> 01:48:56,344
off their fucking asses
and back in the sodding cinema.

1429
01:48:56,451 --> 01:48:59,231
Family entertainment?
Bollocks. What they want is filth...

1430
01:48:59,329 --> 01:49:02,261
people doing things to each other with
chain saws during Tupperware parties,

1431
01:49:02,367 --> 01:49:05,593
baby-sitters being stabbed with knitting
needles by gay presidential candidates,

1432
01:49:05,694 --> 01:49:07,611
vigilante groups strangling chickens,

1433
01:49:07,613 --> 01:49:10,164
armed bands of theatre critics
exterminating mutant goats.

1434
01:49:10,269 --> 01:49:13,169
Where's the fun in pictures?
Oh, well, there we are.

1435
01:49:13,275 --> 01:49:15,662
Here's the theme music.
Good night.

1436
01:49:28,222 --> 01:49:32,481
* Just remember that you're
standing on a planet *

1437
01:49:32,587 --> 01:49:37,651
* That's evolving and revolving
at 900 miles an hour *

1438
01:49:37,751 --> 01:49:41,380
* It's orbiting at 19 miles
a second, so it's reckoned *

1439
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:45,141
* A sun that is the source
of all our power *

1440
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:48,803
* The sun and you and me and all
the stars that we can see *

1441
01:49:48,905 --> 01:49:52,686
* Are moving at
a million miles a day *

1442
01:49:52,793 --> 01:49:56,552
* In an outer spiral arm
at 40,000 miles an hour *

1443
01:49:56,649 --> 01:49:59,321
* Of the galaxy
we call the Milky Way *

1444
01:50:08,026 --> 01:50:11,752
* Our galaxy itself contains
a hundred billion stars *

1445
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:15,576
* It's a hundred thousand
light years side to side *

1446
01:50:15,675 --> 01:50:18,825
* It bulges in the middle
16,000 light years thick *

1447
01:50:18,926 --> 01:50:23,131
* But out by us, it's just
3,000 light years wide *

1448
01:50:23,228 --> 01:50:26,629
* We're 30,000 light years
from galactic central point *

1449
01:50:26,733 --> 01:50:30,546
* We go round every
200 million years *

1450
01:50:30,654 --> 01:50:34,055
* And our galaxy is only
one of millions of billions *

1451
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:37,180
* In this amazing
and expanding universe *

1452
01:51:08,259 --> 01:51:12,616
* The universe itself keeps on
expanding and expanding *

1453
01:51:12,721 --> 01:51:16,284
* In all of the directions
it can whizz *

1454
01:51:16,386 --> 01:51:20,015
* As fast as it can go at the
speed of light you know *

1455
01:51:20,115 --> 01:51:23,483
* Twelve million miles a minute and
that's the fastest speed there is *

1456
01:51:23,589 --> 01:51:27,533
* So remember when you're feeling
very small and insecure *

1457
01:51:27,635 --> 01:51:31,416
* How amazingly unlikely
is your birth *

1458
01:51:31,524 --> 01:51:34,805
* And pray that there's intelligent
life somewhere out in space *

1459
01:51:34,902 --> 01:51:37,607
* 'Cause there's bugger all
down here on earth. *
