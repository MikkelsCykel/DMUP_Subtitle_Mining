1
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,830
I think he's inside.
I'm gonna check it out.

2
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,131
<i>Burke, wait for backup. </i>

3
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,001
He killed my partner.

4
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,006
I'm not waiting.

5
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,508
<i>Listen, Burke, </i>
<i>this is L.A., not Canada. </i>

6
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,104
<i>We have procedures here. </i>
<i>You can't handle this alone. </i>

7
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,710
What's the problem?

8
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,582
Hey, man, what you doing here?

9
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,848
I'm busy. Scram.

10
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,015
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson in manners.

11
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,758
I'm gonna get you, man!

12
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,024
Like I said, I'm going in.

13
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,308
Time to go to sleep...

14
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,219
and join your old partner.

15
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,654
I'm the Sandman.
You can't stop me.

16
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,472
You're under arrest.

17
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,002
Detective Burke.
Have a seat.

18
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,312
Tom Vogler, attorney general.

19
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,714
On my right is Ben Keane,
on your left is Sam Waldon.

20
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,083
I represent the governor.
I'm heading his task force on prisons.

21
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,816
I'm with State Board of Corrections.

22
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,825
- And who are you?
- Amanda Beckett.

23
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,420
- She works for me.
- Detective Burke.

24
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,864
Specialized in undercover work with
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police...

25
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,198
stationed in Quebec.

26
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,204
You followed Christian Naylor,
"the Sandman," to L.A.

27
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,699
We've had some problems in one of
our prisons... Harrison Penitentiary.

28
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,245
It's a local piece,
small-town news.

29
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,205
The assistant warden was murdered.

30
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,614
Now a guard's intimated...

31
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,313
that it might be linked
to the deaths of some prisoners...

32
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,117
nine in the last few months.

33
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,057
We've got a gubernatorial election
coming up this fall.

34
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,324
Prisons are already an issue. We don't
want this to become a part of it.

35
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:14,128
The governor's put me in charge
of rectifying this little mishap.

36
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,366
We wanna send you undercover
into Harrison as a prisoner.

37
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,837
You're from Quebec.
No one in jail will recognize you.

38
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,210
Only this committee
will know you're an officer.

39
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,306
You'll be sentenced to Harrison
for armed robbery.

40
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,045
Armed robbery is
a respectable crime among inmates.

41
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,246
It's implicitly violent.

42
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,084
They respect violence.

43
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,352
We're also assigning
a partner of sorts.

44
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,758
Amanda will act as your liaison.

45
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,423
She'll be posing as your wife.
Amanda will relay information.

46
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,865
Through her, we'll be able
to closely monitor the operation.

47
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,470
Well, Detective, what do you say?

48
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,213
I'll let you know.

49
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,649
Would like me to file the papers
for you first thing in the morning?

50
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,954
I think the sooner, the better.
I know you always do a good job.

51
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,085
- We'll see you tomorrow night then?
- Yeah.

52
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,095
Have Helen call me
if she wants me to bring anything.

53
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,324
- I will.
- Bye.

54
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,333
A pleasure meeting you, Mr. Burke.

55
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,670
- How long have you known him?
- A long time.

56
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,798
He's really been like a father to me.

57
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,399
I've been working for him
ever since I graduated law school.

58
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,604
When was that?

59
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,271
Last year.

60
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,118
Is there a problem, Detective Burke?

61
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,485
You don't have enough experience
to be on this case.

62
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,051
Let's get something straight here.

63
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,786
I'm no girl Friday.

64
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,889
I graduated top in my class
at Stanford.

65
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,901
If you're uncomfortable with the fact
that I'm a woman...

66
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,403
then that's your problem, not mine.

67
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,234
Okay.

68
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:04,538
Check the files of any serial killers
at Harrison Prison.

69
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,408
Then you'll take the case?

70
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,982
I'll see you Tuesday.

71
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,652
I'll get to work.

72
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,186
You're getting wet.

73
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,625
Listen up!

74
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,466
Clasp your fingers in front of you.

75
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,435
And don't move.

76
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,977
I am Sergeant DeGraf.

77
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,484
I decide when you eat...

78
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,614
when you shower...

79
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,885
when you have visitors.

80
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,894
You are fish.

81
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,554
New arrivals.

82
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,960
People will try to hurt you...

83
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,628
rob you...

84
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,799
even rape you.

85
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,363
He said, don't move.

86
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,599
Very good.

87
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,233
It's important...

88
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,640
that you obey my rules...

89
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,954
rules to make the difference
between your life and your death.

90
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:14,422
I'm Dr. Gottesman.
Any communicable diseases?

91
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,092
Not yet.

92
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,929
Excuse me?

93
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,898
You're Burke, right?

94
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,373
You have AB negative blood.
That's very rare.

95
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,973
Okay, take it into
the next room, please.

96
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,984
Come on. Move it.

97
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,159
Your identification number's 72688.

98
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,959
Memorize your number... 72688.

99
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,399
This is your identification card,
Mr. 72688.

100
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,961
Your new home is C level,
cell C-71.

101
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,337
Next.

102
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,339
- It's dead.
- Excuse me?

103
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,679
The eye.
You were looking at it.

104
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,219
It's dead.
Got stabbed in it.

105
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,548
In the eye?

106
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,754
Yeah, I got stabbed in the eye.

107
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,391
Okay, you got your towel,
you got your toothbrush.

108
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,161
Meal shift starts
every morning at 6:10.

109
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,671
Lunch is noon straight up.
Dinner is at 6:30 p.m.

110
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:29,139
You can take a shower once a day,
check yourself for fungus and body lice.

111
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,903
Any questions?

112
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,071
Your identification number is 72689.

113
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,615
Memorize your number... 72689.

114
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,776
72689. Right.
My name is Burke.

115
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,015
Here's your I.D. card, Mr. 72689.

116
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,855
Your new home is C level.
Cell C-68. Next.

117
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,262
Okay, you got your towel,
you got your toothbrush.

118
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,416
What are you doin' here?
And what do you think you're lookin' at?

119
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,580
I'm new here.

120
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,251
I don't care what you are.
You think you can sleep here?

121
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,524
Real estate.
Cost you $500.

122
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,627
Don't have any money.

123
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,365
You don't have any money?
Well, that's okay.

124
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,334
- You can punk.
- Excuse me?

125
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,709
You can get down
on your hands and knees...

126
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,479
and you pay,
just like any other cherry.

127
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,086
I don't think so.

128
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,682
You don't think so?

129
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,556
Possibly...

130
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,190
you might wanna reconsider.

131
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,565
I don't pay, I don't punk.

132
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,771
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

133
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,676
I was jerking you around.
Don't have a hair ball about it.

134
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:51,183
- You want the top bunk, take it.
- The bottom would be nice.

135
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,514
- Better yet. You got it.
- Thanks.

136
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,631
72689, remember?

137
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,337
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
Don't eat that.

138
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,512
What's wrong with my food?

139
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,780
Hey, nigger.

140
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,479
Are you talkin' about me, <i>ese? </i>

141
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,418
We keep to ourselves now.

142
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,051
- We don't give a shit about you people.
- Oh, yeah?

143
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,220
- Hey, listen.
- Hey, it's on me!

144
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,924
- Let him go. Let him go.
- It's cool, <i>ese. </i>

145
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,401
You're dead, <i>ese! </i>

146
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,904
You're fuckin' dead, <i>ese! </i>

147
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,711
You're dead!

148
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,085
Let me go, homes.

149
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,440
I'll talk to you later.

150
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,278
Hawkins.

151
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,446
I know... always the nigger's fault.

152
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,056
You're not gonna last too long.

153
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,028
Is that a threat?

154
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,534
No.

155
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,963
That's a promise.

156
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,948
It never happened!

157
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,608
Back to dinner!

158
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,021
You're a <i>rata, ese. </i>
Fuckin' dead.

159
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,674
What's the matter with you?

160
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,307
Can't you see this is a black table?

161
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,380
Stick with your own kind.
Trust no one.

162
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,220
What about you?

163
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:51,190
What about me?
You don't know who I am.

164
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,659
You don't know anything.

165
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,627
Hey, fish.

166
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,600
Why don't you sit with us, fish?

167
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,661
Sit down, bright boy.

168
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,395
- So what are you in for?
- I was a bad boy.

169
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,404
And you?

170
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,877
Me and Keel here,
we got the big bitch.

171
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,378
Habitual.

172
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,341
See these?

173
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,421
Those are the people he's killed.

174
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,550
That's very special.

175
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,127
Lock 'em up, Dick.

176
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,475
Begin count.

177
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,741
Tier 2-C, 69.

178
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,417
Tier 2-C, 68.

179
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,665
Pruno.

180
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,227
Make it ourselves.

181
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,890
It's good for what ails you.

182
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:04,627
I saw you helpin' out
that nigger Hawkins.

183
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,495
Not good.
It's bad mojo.

184
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,364
Most of the time, you can't even
trust your own kind in this place.

185
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,871
Hey, Konefke.

186
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,683
How long have you been here?

187
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,585
Maybe six years.

188
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,787
I hear a lot of guys are dying.

189
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,166
Yeah, maybe.

190
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,336
But I don't see so well no more.

191
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,947
Like one of those monkeys
you hear about.

192
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,014
Hear no evil, see no evil.

193
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,250
Hi, Louis.

194
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,255
That's a nice outfit.

195
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,814
Thank you.

196
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,826
Are you trying to get me killed?

197
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,727
You're supposed to be my wife,
not a princess.

198
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,260
I didn't realize.

199
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,259
Pay attention next time.

200
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,300
I ran your M.O. check
on serial killers here.

201
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,942
Nothing matches up.
I checked all the death certificates.

202
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,884
All the victims died of puncture wounds
to the back of the skull.

203
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,385
Maybe it's a serial killer,
but I'm thinking maybe it's gangs...

204
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,222
or, like, ritual killings.

205
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,524
Let's concentrate on the big tips.

206
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,628
Last one was Alvin Barrett.

207
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,393
His cell mate, I'll talk to him.

208
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,497
You did good.

209
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,607
Thanks.

210
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,846
I need you to give me some money.

211
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,509
I'll have the office credit
your prison account this afternoon.

212
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,612
That's no good. I need real cash
to get anything done here.

213
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,157
Inmates aren't allowed to have cash.

214
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:50,218
You'll find a way
to bring me the money easy.

215
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,021
I don't know if I can do that.

216
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,296
This is my life we're talking about.

217
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,306
I'll get you the money.

218
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,479
Tell the kids Daddy loves them.

219
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,587
I'm telling you,
I won't condone it.

220
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,363
If you won't authorize the money,
I'll give it to him myself.

221
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,670
Don't play games with me,
Miss Beckett.

222
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,910
You are a liaison on this case
and nothing more.

223
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,274
Take it easy.

224
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,444
Don't let him get to you.

225
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,124
Another one of your lovely peers?

226
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,153
Hi, Helen.

227
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,891
Thank you, Rosarita.
I'll do it.

228
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:04,959
I stopped asking Tom about
these investigations years ago.

229
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,369
It's all so sordid anyway.

230
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,875
- I thought politics interested you.
- No, not anymore.

231
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:15,277
Since I got out of the hospital,
things have taken on a new perspective.

232
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,826
Remember me?

233
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,073
I want you to meet my homey.
Bruce!

234
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,447
He likes to kick the shit
out of white trash like you, boy.

235
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,810
So what you gonna do? Huh?

236
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,351
Where'd you get all those books?

237
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,362
My wife.
We like to read a lot.

238
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,129
Shit. The only thing I read
is girly magazine letters.

239
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,794
Get back.

240
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,006
Listen to this one.

241
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,373
"Dear Sirs.

242
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:30,040
I never thought this would happen to me,
but I was workin' the late shift...

243
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,050
when this big-titted mama
comes up to me."

244
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:40,013
You think any of this stuff
ever really happens?

245
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,151
- Don't know.
- Never happened to me.

246
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,306
Hawkins... you know him?

247
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,538
Thanks.

248
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,705
Hello, guys.
You miss me?

249
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,578
It's the Lone Ranger.

250
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,346
Hi-ho, Silver.
What's up, Kimosabe?

251
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,747
The man just waltzes
right on in here...

252
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,089
visits with the happy, old negros.

253
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,332
You're Lobo, Burke.
You know that.

254
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,958
- I'm Lobo?
- Yep.

255
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:01,665
You know how wolves stake out
their territory pissin' on things?

256
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,072
I figure you pissed on
just about everything around here.

257
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,040
- You know everything, right?
- Been here a long time.

258
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,241
What are you in for?

259
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,181
Murder.

260
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,380
Let me guess.

261
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,021
You're innocent, right?

262
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,158
I choked the son of a bitch
just as sure as I'm sittin' here.

263
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,225
Been here over ten years.
That's a long time...

264
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:34,534
to be rollin' smokes
and countin' cockroaches.

265
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,373
What's that?

266
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,377
Makin' shot for zip guns.

267
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,844
Scary times. People gettin'
spiked in the head and shit.

268
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,046
Gotta learn to defend yourself...

269
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,490
- So you don't get dusted.
- I heard that, man.

270
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,094
You probably figure I owe you something
'cause of what you did the other day.

271
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:05,999
Barrett... who killed him?
He was my friend.

272
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,998
Let me tell you something.
I don't owe you jack shit.

273
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:18,444
You wanna know what happened
to your friend? See the Priest.

274
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,916
The Priest?

275
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,445
That's all I'm sayin'.

276
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,556
<i>I'm tellin'you, the lower you go, </i>
<i>the funkier it gets in this place. </i>

277
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,096
Down where we're goin',
the guards won't even come down here.

278
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,223
This guy I'm gonna introduce you to...

279
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,824
Priest, man.
He's part fuckin' snake.

280
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,836
I know you think I'm shittin' you,
but I'm not.

281
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:41,270
Wait till you see his eyes.
Don't look at 'em too long.

282
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,603
It gives me the fuckin' creeps.

283
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,634
You gotta cover your ass down here,
and I mean that literally.

284
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,149
It's gonna blow your mind, man.

285
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,151
You gotta see this.

286
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,214
What?

287
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,051
What are you talkin' about?

288
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,756
- Look, that's not the deal we made.
- Priest...

289
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,821
Listen! Look.

290
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,995
I want my stuff now.

291
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,796
Like I started saying before...

292
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:52,105
Priest, this is Burke.

293
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,974
Yeah.

294
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,503
I heard you went airborne on Perez.

295
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,708
You want a lady?

296
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,714
He thinks he's too good for me.

297
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,783
What's wrong with my ladies?

298
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,886
Nothing.

299
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,454
I just need some help.

300
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,640
I help lots of people.

301
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,843
I get Jersey hormone pills.

302
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,581
Is that the kind of help you want?

303
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,249
Alvin Barrett... who killed him?

304
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,725
Someone punched a hole in his head.

305
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,785
Why?

306
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,058
I can't just tell you these things.

307
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,499
I give you a little,
you taste it.

308
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,833
That's how things work.

309
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:59,176
You could talk to Myerson,
Barrett's former cell mate.

310
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,235
He's in solitary now...

311
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:05,306
but he works in the infirmary,
night shift.

312
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:09,217
He can fill prescriptions
if you got the money.

313
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,556
Sure you don't wanna sample my goods?

314
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,616
I'll take a rain check.

315
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,468
Got another one.

316
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,977
He won't be home for dinner.

317
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,785
- What is this?
- Goddamn medical waste.

318
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,625
Medical waste.

319
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,103
- You Myerson?
- What do you want?

320
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,408
I need some medicine.

321
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,811
I got prescription drugs...
morphine and uppers. What do you need?

322
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,816
I hear you were Barrett's cell mate.
He was a good kid, huh?

323
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,250
- He's dead now.
- Yeah.

324
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,756
On drugs. Bad news.

325
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,654
No way.

326
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,659
He was as green as grass.
He never did nothin'.

327
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,854
Convenience store robbery,
and that's it.

328
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,954
Maybe he was in a gang then.

329
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,933
I said he was clean.
What are you so curious about?

330
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,968
He was my friend
who got spiked in the head.

331
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,599
Maybe you know who did it.

332
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,478
- I'm not saying another word.
- Yes, you are.

333
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,947
Hey, fuck you!

334
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,614
What is this?

335
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,247
It's soda pop.

336
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,453
You're gonna drink this.

337
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,690
Please, man, don't!
I didn't do nothing! Christ!

338
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,324
Look, they'll kill me if I talk.
A guard let 'em in, not me.

339
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,493
Lockup, five minutes.
Move it!

340
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,572
I'll talk to you.

341
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,847
- Hello?
- <i>It's Burke. </i>

342
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,514
<i>I've got something. </i>

343
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,687
Hang on a second.

344
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,251
<i>Okay, I'm ready. </i>

345
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,593
Barrett's cell mate is scared.

346
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,190
Whatever's going on,
the guards are involved.

347
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,963
<i>I need to see the victims'files. </i>

348
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,937
The files haven't been transferred
to computer yet.

349
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,939
Harrison's files
are all still at the prison.

350
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,837
What are you doing?

351
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,778
Right now?

352
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,376
Eating dinner.

353
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,861
Is there anything else?

354
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,762
<i>I'll be in touch. </i>

355
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,644
Have a nice little chat?

356
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,543
I need the key to the records room.

357
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,382
That can be arranged.

358
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,723
- Hey!
- What?

359
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,801
What do you got here?

360
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,668
A load of shirts
for the reception desk.

361
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,285
Okay, you got me.

362
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,882
I was takin' some pruno
over to the guys in storage.

363
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,984
Now, you know I'm gonna have
to take that.

364
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,494
Sure.

365
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,427
You ever actually taste that stuff?

366
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,301
- I don't think so.
- All right.

367
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,430
Well, maybe.
Let me try some.

368
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,764
Oh, man!

369
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,774
Well, you're gonna have to develop
a taste for it.

370
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,867
You just can't go
wading into the shit, you know.

371
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,152
New arrival.

372
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,341
- What was that?
- What was what?

373
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,311
I must be going crazy.

374
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,559
Lot of old ghosts
hangin' around this place.

375
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,697
Let's get out of here.

376
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,840
Only the murder victims
have the "SL" notation.

377
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,243
The victims are brand-new...
no drugs, no gangs.

378
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,573
All different ages and race.

379
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,010
I can check with the mainframe system.

380
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:53,649
Maybe "SL" is some sort of
departmental abbreviation.

381
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,716
I've got the guy for you.

382
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,159
I've worked with him before.
He's a real pro.

383
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,629
He'll do the hacking for you.

384
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,265
And don't tell Keane about this, okay?

385
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,137
You know this is illegal,
don't you?

386
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:20,150
Sort of illegal.
Do you mind?

387
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,547
Are you kidding?
I love it.

388
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,181
See, I like to think of myself
as a renegade.

389
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,657
You know, like a cowboy.

390
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,526
Yeah, I'm a computer cowboy.
That's what I am.

391
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,501
- Well?
- Well, what? It's checking.

392
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,672
"SL" can stand
for virtually anything...

393
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,682
or nothing at all.

394
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,681
So, you got a boyfriend or something?

395
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,619
The computer looks for combinations
of words beginning with "SL."

396
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:09,997
Then it sees if there are
any files in the system named that.

397
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,868
Shit. I'm missing <i>Star Trek. </i>

398
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,872
You wanna watch <i>Star Trek? </i>

399
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,274
All right. So...

400
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,408
We got something here.

401
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,251
Now we see where the files
are most commonly accessed from.

402
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,456
- Bingo!
- That's it. That's the file.

403
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,521
Shit! We need the password.

404
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,099
That's okay.
It's a start.

405
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,932
Give me a day or two...

406
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,768
and I can locate any terminals
it's been accessed from.

407
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,866
You'll find out whose file it was.

408
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,077
Great. I'll take you home.
Your parents'll kill me.

409
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,979
Who needs parents?
We're both adults.

410
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,815
Aren't we?

411
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,782
I'm an adult...

412
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,553
and you're a kid.

413
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,288
Your hormones are workin' overtime.

414
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,796
Come on.
I'll take you home.

415
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,899
I'd rather not tell Keane about
what I'm doing with the computers.

416
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:24,874
Burke thinks we can get it done
a lot quicker without his interference.

417
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,139
I wonder if Detective Burke isn't
interfering with your work habits.

418
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,146
We have procedures for a reason.

419
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,214
I know what I'm doing.

420
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,979
I hope you do.

421
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,044
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.

422
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,714
Don't worry.

423
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,595
Damn it!
It took you long enough.

424
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,536
You want to talk now?

425
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,740
Look, I found out some things...
about what they did to Barrett.

426
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,976
He didn't deserve
what they did to him.

427
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,348
We used to smuggle out
some drugs from overstock.

428
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,254
Well, I was in surgery last night...

429
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,588
Shit. That's...

430
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,653
If he finds his keys missing,
I'm a dead man.

431
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,789
Relax.

432
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,060
Don't worry.

433
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,860
I need protection.

434
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,872
Another guy got spiked last night,
and this is serious shit!

435
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,033
Quiet.

436
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,133
I've got to get this key
back to Priest.

437
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,851
Protection.

438
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,716
I need protection.

439
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,895
Lady-killer.

440
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,337
Just thought you'd like to know...

441
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,034
I think somebody's
gonna pay you a visit tonight.

442
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,009
I'd think twice about sleeping.

443
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,505
Thanks.

444
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,346
I just hate to see
a good man go to waste.

445
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,727
I finally figured out the password.

446
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,733
I've had the computer running
word variations for hours.

447
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,929
Of course, you know, it was
a special program I devised myself.

448
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,905
You know, I was reading
this article in a men's magazine...

449
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:43,708
about the virility of men
in their middle to late teens...

450
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,612
- Right.
- Just do it.

451
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,742
Right. Here we go.

452
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,422
Morpheus was the Greek god of sleep.

453
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,425
I'm a whiz at mythology.

454
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,620
Criminals have a sense of humor.

455
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,755
Yes! We're in.

456
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,027
You're kidding me?

457
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:07,502
No. Is there anything else you need?

458
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:10,301
Print it out.
Can you make a copy of this file?

459
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,399
- Sure I can.
- Great.

460
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,574
What the hell is it doing?

461
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,775
Someone is destroying it
from the other end.

462
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,148
- Well, stop it.
- I can't.

463
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,847
We just have to hope
it started the print copy first.

464
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,736
Where's this file accessed from?

465
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:47,141
The infirmary, for one.
I checked up on the other abbreviation.

466
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:50,180
"H-L-E" is a coding system
for a tissue type.

467
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,909
I'm still checking on
that other point of access.

468
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:55,009
It's definitely someone
outside the prison.

469
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,754
That's our key player.

470
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,722
This is my beeper number.
Call me as soon as you find it out.

471
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,090
Tisdale, you are a stud.

472
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,865
All the Sleep file contained was
a list of prisoner I.D. numbers...

473
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,911
strung together along with
the prisoners' blood types.

474
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,503
Every person who was on that list
has been killed.

475
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:26,744
- It's a hit list.
- <i>Exactly. </i>

476
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,081
<i>Each victim had a physical</i>
<i>days before they were killed. </i>

477
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,348
Each one came up clean.

478
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:34,016
No diseases, no drug addiction,
nothing.

479
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:38,551
I think someone from the outside
is working with the guards.

480
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,929
Keane would have access to the files.

481
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,831
There's something else.

482
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:54,538
Your number's next on the list.

483
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,622
What's going on in here?

484
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,624
Help me.

485
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,450
- Grab him.
- Help me!

486
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:23,099
What are you doing in my prison?

487
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,137
Is something wrong with your mouth?

488
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,290
You killed Konefke.

489
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:52,018
I didn't do it.

490
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,395
I know.

491
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,268
Strip him.

492
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,677
<i>When I know you</i>

493
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:18,412
<i>When I know you</i>

494
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:21,287
<i>When I know you like I know</i>

495
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,666
You got a big mouth, Jersey.

496
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,470
I didn't say no names.

497
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,572
I didn't say you.

498
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,785
Who's there?

499
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:29,716
What's going on?
What do you want?

500
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,591
We wanna talk, just like Burke.

501
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,997
I didn't talk to Burke.
I didn't say nothing.

502
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,296
Who said I talked to Burke?
This is bullshit.

503
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,168
What is that?

504
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,774
Shit. Oh, God.

505
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:48,971
Hey, wait a minute.
You can't do this.

506
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,277
You gotta hear my side of it.
Somebody's lyin', man!

507
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,579
Somebody's fuckin' lying on me!

508
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:57,587
You can't do this, man!

509
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:00,021
Oh, God. Just stop.
Wait a minute.

510
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,684
Just wait one second!
Oh, God.

511
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,955
What did you say to Burke?

512
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:07,088
Who said I talked?
How did you find that out?

513
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,825
That's bullshit, man!

514
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:14,635
I swear to God I didn't talk!
Stop it! What are you doin'?

515
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:17,265
You're crazy, man!
People will find out!

516
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,309
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?

517
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,539
I'll give you anything!
What do you want?

518
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,376
You're a liar, Myerson.

519
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,939
Don't! Please!

520
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,369
This is ridiculous.

521
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,808
Do you wanna see your husband?

522
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,114
The purse.

523
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:06,713
Then bring in a female guard.

524
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,815
None seem to be available.

525
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,263
Up with the arms.

526
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:30,705
I don't know.

527
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,209
I'm sorry, missy...

528
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,947
but you're gonna have
to remove your clothes.

529
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,685
Your husband is waiting.

530
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,854
Clean up and get dressed.

531
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,897
Your pretty little wife
wants to see you.

532
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,810
You have a half hour, Burke.

533
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,047
Have a good time there, buddy.

534
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,501
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

535
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,803
- Who did this to you?
- The guards.

536
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:10,472
They let two prisoners into my cell.

537
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,811
One of them had an ice pick.

538
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:15,317
At least we know
who's been spiking people.

539
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,014
What about you?

540
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,359
Nothing.

541
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,997
You look like hell.

542
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,233
So do you.

543
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,955
I checked on Dr. Gottesman, and...

544
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,122
And?

545
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:01,824
He didn't get into med school here.

546
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,599
He went to South America.

547
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,260
South America?

548
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,507
- And, um...
- And?

549
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:16,638
There were a couple...

550
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,305
of, um...

551
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,445
malpractice suits.

552
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,966
You're so beautiful.

553
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,358
You guys are all spooked 'cause
you think there's some big conspiracy.

554
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:15,997
Priest, you know as well as I
what's going on.

555
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,573
Brother got his brains scrambled
just last night.

556
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:22,703
Straight through the skull
like a piece of meat.

557
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,940
It could be me next,
could be you.

558
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:27,916
So big, white Superman's
gonna save our asses?

559
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:30,419
What makes you think
we wanna be saved?

560
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,614
Burke needs our help.

561
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,623
He needs a distraction.

562
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:47,528
- Good work, Hawkins.
- Thank the Priest.

563
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,663
- Shit!
- Yeah, it's locked.

564
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,140
They cart this medical waste
in and out of here day and night.

565
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,574
- Where?
- I don't know.

566
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,272
They got a special pickup for it.
It's hazardous.

567
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,337
Oh, yeah?

568
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,576
Let's see what's inside.
Watch your eye.

569
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:02,346
Funny. Hurry up.

570
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,196
Hold this.

571
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,337
It's a human heart.

572
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:33,144
Oh, God.

573
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:39,852
What's going on?

574
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,857
New dude being brought in.

575
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,859
All this for a new fish?

576
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:47,294
Man, this ain't no fish.
This is the man.

577
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,875
Long time no see, Burke.

578
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,261
Would you like to know
what's out there, Burke?

579
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:31,431
Would you like to know
what's on the other side?

580
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,863
You know what prisoners hate
more than anything else, Burke?

581
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:44,837
Prisoners hate cops
more than anything else.

582
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,507
Fucking pigs!

583
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,584
Every killer in this prison...

584
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:53,589
is gonna know who you are.

585
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,254
And you're not gonna know
when it's coming.

586
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,532
Let him go.

587
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,311
Bring me a dream, Burke.

588
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,755
Bring me a dream.

589
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:54,578
Hey, you belong to me!

590
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,916
He's a cop!
The only good cop...

591
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:09,994
I'm gonna rip your eyes out!

592
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:12,057
Get me some chitlins.

593
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,004
I gotta get outta here!

594
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,404
Get me out of this pen!

595
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,409
You pig!

596
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:34,112
That's a load of shit you were
giving us. Barrett wasn't your friend.

597
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,554
I'm trying to stop
what's going on here.

598
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,562
Doesn't that make a difference?

599
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,997
In the cage, man,
a cop is worse than a...

600
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,001
baby raper.

601
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,465
Why are you still here?

602
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,473
You're a dead man.

603
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,844
I need your help.

604
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,949
It's too late.

605
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,457
Miss Beckett,
I've been looking for you.

606
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,857
You stay the hell away from me.

607
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:48,125
Tom. Excuse me.
I need to speak with you.

608
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:50,063
- What's wrong?
- It's urgent.

609
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,725
It's about Keane.

610
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,735
Let's go inside.

611
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,181
Now, you want to tell me
what's going on?

612
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,189
We have to get Burke out of there.

613
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,919
Keane has been in on this
the entire time.

614
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,461
Wait. This has to do with it.

615
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,567
- Yeah, Tis, it's me.
- <i>Amanda, listen. </i>

616
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:34,508
<i>I tried the other point of access. </i>
<i>The number's 555-6799.</i>

617
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:39,473
<i>Vogler's house! </i>

618
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:44,580
I'm sorry, Amanda.
I never wanted this.

619
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,122
Helen and I
really did care about you.

620
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:54,290
If Helen found out,
it would kill her.

621
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,828
We have to...

622
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:00,836
keep the bad parts
of our lives private.

623
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,241
Burke proved so resourceful...

624
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,511
that when the others
didn't take care of him...

625
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,677
I had the Sandman transferred there.

626
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:20,583
Why?

627
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:23,023
I did it to save her life.

628
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,289
Helen got sick.
She needed a liver.

629
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,798
She couldn't get one.

630
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,529
It didn't matter
how much money I had.

631
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,537
The list was too long.

632
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,407
So I found a doctor.

633
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:44,238
He said he could get one.

634
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,748
Once he started...

635
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:50,308
he found you could make
a lot of money selling life.

636
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,125
We're killing criminals.

637
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,785
Garbage.

638
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,122
And after a while...

639
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,632
you stop thinking of them as humans.

640
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,168
Oh, Tom, there you are.

641
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,402
What's going on?

642
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:20,612
Why don't you tell her, Tom?

643
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:24,150
Tell her how you murdered for her.

644
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:12,633
Hey, Burke,
Sandman's comin' to see ya.

645
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,669
You don't have the guts
to come in this cell.

646
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,108
What happened?

647
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,843
- What happened?
- He got Keller!

648
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:04,412
Jesus Christ!
Secure this door! Grab him!

649
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,852
Bring him too. Come on.

650
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,394
Gene, secure the infirmary.

651
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:27,766
Well, well,
look who we have here.

652
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,567
Great. Now we have
all the assholes in one room.

653
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,131
You've caused us a great deal
of trouble, Detective Burke.

654
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:34,608
You scum.

655
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,612
Let me do it.

656
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:46,484
It's gonna be messy if you
kill an undercover officer.

657
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:48,319
Go ahead, dust him.

658
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,552
Blow his fuckin' head off!

659
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:08,340
Come on! Stop playin' around!
Let's get the hell out of here!

660
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,559
Why did you do it?

661
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,623
I don't know.

662
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,360
Maybe I'm goin' soft
in my old age.

663
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,766
Let's just say
I owe somebody somethin'.

664
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:09,337
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go through the kitchen.

665
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:36,390
Quick! The elevator to the kitchen!

666
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,568
Oh, God.

667
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:54,275
You're just in time
for surgery, Doc.

668
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,123
Let's do it.

669
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,108
- Easy.
- Thanks.

670
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,786
It's going to hurt now, okay?

671
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,795
Yeah. Stop yacking at me.

672
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:43,661
It's secure.
We're okay for a while.

673
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:50,939
Can you make it?

674
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,669
- I don't think so.
- He's better off here.

675
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,812
I have to get to the outside.

676
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:04,819
I'll be back for you.

677
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,922
Just hang on.

678
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,989
Go with him, man.
Make sure he gets to the outside.

679
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,998
Go on! Go on!

680
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:35,183
I know you're in here, Burke.

681
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,755
You know why?

682
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:44,153
'Cause I can smell the nigger.

683
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,493
Kiss your black ass good-bye.

684
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,733
Go fuck yourself, you pudgy bastard.

685
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:53,428
I knew you needed me, brother.

686
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:57,557
You make a deal with the Priest,
it's for keeps.

687
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,488
It's okay.
You need me more than he does.

688
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,149
Follow me.

689
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:27,025
We have to take the catwalk
through the boiler room.

690
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:29,394
That's the only way
to get out to the yard.

691
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,512
Come on, Burke!

692
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:52,679
Come to Papa!

693
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:07,001
I'm up here, Burke!

694
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,970
If you leave, Hawkins dies!

695
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:56,684
Come on!

696
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,871
You like that, Burke?

697
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:26,199
This is the part I love.

698
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,231
Move, move, move!

699
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,616
Wakey, wakey, Burke.

700
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,530
Time to bleed.

701
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:28,753
Come on!

702
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,303
Welcome to hell!

703
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,840
Can't kill me, Burke.

704
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,844
I'm the Sandman.

705
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:42,949
- Let the man through.
- Let him go, man.

706
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,215
- He just dusted the Sandman.
- Open up, man. Let him out.

707
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:54,719
Let him go by.

708
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:56,730
You did it, man.

709
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,732
You really did it.
You dusted him.

710
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:03,799
Open up, man. Open up.
He just kicked up the Sandman.

711
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:13,972
Back up, <i>vatos. </i>

712
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,018
Clear it out back there.

713
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:20,145
You got it, homes.

714
01:24:55,057 --> 01:24:56,490
Easy.

715
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:02,195
This is Hawkins.
He saved my life.

716
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,198
I had to, Burke.

717
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:07,702
I took a life.
I gave one back.

718
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,101
Maybe now I'm even.

719
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:12,902
Just watch your ass, 72689.

720
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,908
I won't be there the next time.

721
01:25:15,908 --> 01:25:25,908
