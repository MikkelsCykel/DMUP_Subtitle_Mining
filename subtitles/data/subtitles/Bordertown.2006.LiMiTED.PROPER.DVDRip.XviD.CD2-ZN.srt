00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,031
- What are you talking about?
- The psychologists are convinced...

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:07,032
that Eva imagined
the second killer.

3
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:09,952
I don't care what the doctors say.
I was there. I saw it.

4
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:13,072
She comes from an Indian culture.
Her people...

5
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:17,632
often don't distinguish real things
from the things they imagine.

6
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:20,312
- Are you saying she's crazy?
- No! She's not crazy.

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:25,912
She believes what she says.
But this doesn't mean that it's true.

8
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:29,832
I saw the look on that man's face.

9
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,672
- He recognized her.
- No, please.

10
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:33,592
- That is the man...
- Don't!

11
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:36,672
Don't. This is my house and this
stops here. I can't deal with this.

12
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:39,072
- You wanted this story, too.
- No!

13
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,912
Your story is destroying her.

14
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:44,792
And, God, Lauren.
You can be killed too.

15
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:48,592
You understand that? They tried it
before and they will kill you.

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,752
I cannot do this anymore.
Please, just leave.

17
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:04,792
- I'm sorry. Did we wake you up?
- Are they photos of the bus drivers?

18
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:08,272
- It's not important right now.
- It is important.

19
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:14,552
- Eva. Please. You need to heal.
- No, Teresa.

20
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,752
The only thing
that will heal me...

21
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:21,192
the only thing that will
give me back my life...

22
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,872
is to find my attackers.

23
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:26,072
Lauren is helping me.

24
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:32,672
And we are gonna find them
together. Right?

25
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:21,712
This is the road
where Eva was raped.

26
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:26,552
This is where I want you to be.
You and the police.

27
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:30,232
Eva identified the bus driver.
His name is Domingo Esparza.

28
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:33,712
They drive the victims out here
and then meet the other attacker.

29
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:39,032
I'll go undercover into the factory
he worked for and pose as a worker.

30
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:41,872
If we know who this Esparza is,
just have him arrested.

31
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,672
If we have him arrested, we have
no chance of catching the second guy.

32
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:47,552
He's already seen Eva.
He'll come after her.

33
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:51,392
I'm going into the factory as bait.
It's our only chance to catch both.

34
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:55,552
You can't. We have to warn too many
people. The police'll never allow it.

35
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:59,632
That's why you'll only tell them
after I'm in there already.

36
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:02,112
They're not gonna risk having
an American journalist killed.

37
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:05,832
There must be people
on the police that you trust.

38
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:08,792
- People who care about the truth.
- Yeah, I know people.

39
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,672
I think I can trust them.
But you never really know.

40
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:15,552
People get bribed. I'm not going
to gamble with your life.

41
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:19,072
I'm not gonna gamble with Eva's life.
It's now or never. Don't you see?

42
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,272
No, I don't see.
This is out of the question.

43
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:24,352
- Diaz, listen to me.
- I won't listen to you.

44
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:28,832
I won't let you. If anything happened
to you, I'll never forgive myself!

45
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:41,592
I can't do this.

46
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:58,072
All right.

47
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:01,552
You are not going into the factory.

48
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:04,192
And we will find another way
to hunt around this. Get in the car.

49
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:06,272
It's not your choice to make.

50
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:11,672
I promised Eva that I'd help her
find these men.

51
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:14,992
And I pray that you'll help me.

52
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:21,192
But even if you don't, I'm going
into that factory tomorrow.

53
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:49,592
Eva! You've come home.

54
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:58,352
Come in, come in.

55
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,672
How do I look?

56
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:18,072
- With just this.
- Okay.

57
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:23,072
- Like that?
- Something like that.

58
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:28,912
You look pretty.

59
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:31,352
For good luck.

60
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,032
Now you look like me.

61
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:46,072
I want to give you something.

62
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:50,272
- No, it's okay.
- Yes. Yes. No.

63
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:55,152
She protect me that night.

64
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,312
Now she's gonna protect you.

65
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,552
Let me.

66
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:03,712
Okay.

67
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:14,712
You are safe now.

68
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,312
Daughter, Cecilia is here.

69
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,232
- Hi. Lauren.
- Eva.

70
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:26,672
This is dangerous.
You shouldn't be doing this.

71
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:28,072
It's too dangerous.

72
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,432
I'll be fine.

73
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:38,432
Good luck, Lauren.

74
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:50,672
- This is my cousin, Silvia Rojas.
- Yes, we've been expecting her.

75
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:53,872
We've received her paperwork
from the front office.

76
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:59,112
This is where you'll work.
This is your supervisor.

77
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:21,472
<i>Lines 1 and 3 are falling
behind their quotas.</i>

78
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:25,192
<i>Accelerate production.</i>

79
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:42,632
<i>Accelerate production.</i>

80
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:16,312
<i>The shift has ended.
Please leave quickly.</i>

81
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:19,832
<i>The next shift starts
in 10 minutes.</i>

82
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,752
<i>Please leave quickly.</i>

83
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,432
<i>The next shift starts
in 10 minutes.</i>

84
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:06,392
Do you mind if I stop for gas?

85
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:49,712
<i>Attention all units.
There's still no sign of the bus.</i>

86
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,552
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

87
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:40,472
<i>We've received a call
from lauren.</i>

88
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:43,432
<i>She's in a junkyard.</i>

89
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:54,432
You all right?

90
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,632
A mass grave.

91
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,912
It was a mass grave.

92
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,112
We didn't find the other attacker.

93
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:11,632
There was nobody there.

94
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,552
Well, he was there.
He's out there.

95
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,912
I'm telling you, he was here.

96
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:21,272
He can see us.
I can feel it.

97
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:23,712
This isn't over until I find him.

98
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,832
When I was on that bus...

99
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,712
everything was just as Eva told it.

100
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:39,592
It made me feel like
I was living her story.

101
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,312
<i>"The screams of the women
of Juarez are silent...</i>

102
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>because no one will listen...</i>

103
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:14,872
<i>not the corporations who make
their profits from their labor.</i>

104
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:19,632
<i>Not the governments of Mexico
and the United States...</i>

105
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,272
<i>who benefit
from the free trade agreements.</i>

106
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:24,992
<i>No one will listen.</i>

107
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:29,272
<i>All the evidence points to the fact
that there are many killers.</i>

108
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,392
<i>A whole culture of murder
that just gets worse and worse...</i>

109
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:35,152
<i>the more it's denied
and covered up.</i>

110
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:40,392
<i>Covering it up is less expensive
than protecting these women.</i>

111
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,432
<i>Money is
about the bottom line.</i>

112
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:46,552
<i>And so the death toll mounts.</i>

113
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:51,272
<i>Eva Jimenez, 16 years old.</i>

114
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:55,272
<i>She works in a factory
assembling televisions.</i>

115
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,072
<i>She makes five dollars a day."</i>

116
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:01,472
- I finished your story.
- Yeah? You finished my story.

117
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:04,832
Tomorrow it'll be printed
and everybody will know about it.

118
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:08,392
Don't forget that in five days
you're gonna have to go to court.

119
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:09,872
- I know.
- You'll have to talk to a judge...

120
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:13,472
and you'll have
to tell him everything.

121
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:17,392
- Can you do this?
- I think I can.

122
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:29,032
The man we saw at the party,
we didn't catch him.

123
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,352
- What?
- I know. It's gonna be okay.

124
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:37,072
No, you don't.
He is the Devil. The Devil.

125
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:40,832
He'll take me to Hell.
He don't want me to go to the judge.

126
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:43,312
Eva, please.

127
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,952
You'll be safe.

128
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,032
You have to believe me.

129
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,272
I will not let anything
happen to you.

130
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,512
And I will find this man.

131
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,312
You're gonna be okay.
I know how to find him.

132
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:54,232
- Just leave the glass there?
- Just leave the glass there.

133
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:58,272
- Here comes the magic.
- All right.

134
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:01,912
- You gonna show me something?
- Now it's gonna disappear.

135
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:10,192
It took me two semesters at Harvard
to learn that trick.

136
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:16,392
I learned that first week
at St. Mary's High.

137
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:19,752
- I was always a poor student.
- Don't worry. I give tutorials.

138
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,352
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

139
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:26,432
What was it like being a Mexican at
Harvard? They had two of you there?

140
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:29,312
But I'm an American citizen.

141
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:32,632
It's convenient. I can be Mexican
whenever I want to or American.

142
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:35,192
- So, deep down you're just a gringo.
- Well, of course.

143
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,912
It's the best thing to be.
The whole world wants to be gringo.

144
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,952
Come to think of it, there were a lot
of gringos at your party that night.

145
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,032
- I even saw Senator...
- Rawlings.

146
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:44,472
- Right.
- You know...

147
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:47,672
my family owns most of the land.

148
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:50,592
So, he's given us a great
opportunity with NAFTA.

149
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:53,632
There was somebody else there, too.

150
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:58,872
So he was tall. He was kind
of dark eyes. Gold teeth?

151
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:02,472
- Why do you wanna know?
- No reason. It was just...

152
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:07,992
something that Teresa had said.
He had a scar right here.

153
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:11,312
Aris. Aris Rodriguez.

154
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,432
His family's involved
with the NAFTA factories.

155
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:15,912
A very old family, too.

156
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,712
Who's calling me?

157
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,552
George!

158
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:28,472
Hey can you give a minute?
Hold on. I'm in a restaurant.

159
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:31,992
So, did you read the piece?
What'd you think?

160
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:36,512
<i>Best think you've ever done.
It's got something I've never seen.</i>

161
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,512
Some incredible humanity.

162
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,392
And this portrait of Eva?
Quite beautiful.

163
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:44,832
I don't know what to say.
You're my inspiration, George.

164
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:47,672
It means the world to me
that you liked it.

165
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:50,592
Frankly, I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

166
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:52,952
Congratulations.

167
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:09,272
Diaz, I just got off the phone
with Chicago. They loved the story.

168
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:12,152
You want my husband.

169
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,832
<i>- Alfonso, telephone.
- In a minute.</i>

170
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:25,752
<i>Daddy! Kick me the ball.</i>

171
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:28,072
- Hey, George.
- No. This is Frank.

172
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:35,112
I'm not supposed to tell you this,
but George didn't print the story.

173
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:38,152
He got a visit from some political
types, including Senator Rawlings.

174
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:40,152
After that, it was a no go.

175
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,392
They're not printing it at all?

176
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:46,232
You don't understand. Rawlings is
pushing a bill through Congress...

177
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,992
to expand the Free Trade agreements
to include Central America...

178
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,832
and they don't want
any bad press right now.

179
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:54,712
- You dug too deep.
- Okay.

180
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:59,152
<i>- Your story is too fuckin' hot.
- Do me a favor.</i>

181
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:02,912
- Put me on the phone with George.
- He's not gonna talk to you.

182
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,832
They're gonna say it's temporary
and for you to stay put.

183
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:07,832
But that's just a smoke screen
to kill it.

184
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:10,712
If you want the story printed,
you've gotta get back here.

185
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:13,672
<i>- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause it's a great story.</i>

186
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,832
It needs to be printed.
It's now or never.

187
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:51,632
<i>So, Eva, I have something
to tell you. Your story...</i>

188
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:58,072
I have to fight for it.

189
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:00,952
<i>What do you mean?
They don't want my story?</i>

190
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:03,592
No, they will want it.

191
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:06,512
But, because of that...

192
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:11,032
- I have to go.
- You can't go.

193
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,592
<i>I have to talk to the judge
in three days.</i>

194
00:24:13,592 --> 00:24:17,472
<i>- I know.
- The murderer'll be there.</i>

195
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:20,752
- I'm very afraid. You can't go.
- Don't worry.

196
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:25,632
<i>I will return.
They will not publish my story.</i>

197
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:28,832
And you will not return.

198
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,512
People promise many things,
but that never happens.

199
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:35,512
<i>I will get your story printed
and I won't stop...</i>

200
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:37,992
<i>until both of your attackers
are punished.</i>

201
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:39,672
And I will be back.

202
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,192
Eva, look at me.

203
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:43,912
I will return.

204
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:45,232
I promise.

205
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:26,952
Teresa!

206
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:34,832
Teresa! Teresa!

207
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:37,872
What happened?

208
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:42,272
- Calm down.
- He's in there.

209
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,432
Search her room.
Search outside!

210
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:50,192
What's the matter?

211
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:52,152
- The Devil is here.
- Who?

212
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,032
The Devil!

213
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:59,032
It's all right. It's all right.

214
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:01,512
Tell me.

215
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:03,992
- Nobody is there.
- Nobody, right?

216
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:06,752
See? No one is there.

217
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:11,472
It was just a nightmare.
Look at me.

218
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:14,672
He's not real.

219
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:19,952
It was just a nightmare.

220
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:24,952
Everything is all right.

221
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,792
Miss, you can...
Lauren, is that you? Wait a minute!

222
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:58,192
- Could you just...
- Lauren, come in.

223
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:01,032
Lauren Adrian,
this is Samuel Denton...

224
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:04,512
the C.E.O. of the publishing
syndicate that owns the Sentinel.

225
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:07,392
- This is Senator...
- Rawlings, I know.

226
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,752
Saw you in Juarez last week
at the Salamanca house.

227
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:13,552
- What were you doing there?
- Hi. I'm Denise McKenzie.

228
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:15,512
I'm head
of all syndicate operations.

229
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:19,312
Congratulations. You're gonna make
an exceptional foreign correspondent.

230
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:21,352
We are all very excited.

231
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:26,952
We're gonna have to let you go, or
else we're not gonna make our lunch.

232
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:28,512
- I'll talk to you later.
- All the best.

233
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:30,312
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

234
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:37,952
- Foreign correspondent?
- How about that?

235
00:27:38,512 --> 00:27:41,592
- It's unbelievable.
- Your first assignment.

236
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:50,952
- This is a bribe, isn't it?
- What do you care?

237
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,032
You'd do anything for this job.
Consider it a freebie.

238
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:56,792
This can't be you.
You can't bow to those people!

239
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,952
- I'm not bowing to anyone.
- Then print my story.

240
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:01,192
We cannot print your story.

241
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:03,472
In three days,
a 16-year-old girl...

242
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:05,912
is going into court to face
the man who tried to kill her!

243
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:08,792
All because we said
that we would print her story.

244
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:12,672
This story could save her life and
the lives of many women in Juarez.

245
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,432
This is a fucking important story!

246
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,472
I understand that.
But you are blaming...

247
00:28:16,472 --> 00:28:18,792
- the Mexican and American governments.
- You're god damned right I am.

248
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:21,752
- And the Free Trade Agreement.
- It isn't free trade!

249
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:25,592
It's slave trade. It's a scam.
Everybody is making too much money...

250
00:28:25,592 --> 00:28:27,632
- to give a shit about these women.
- Listen to me.

251
00:28:27,632 --> 00:28:31,352
These are very serious accusations,
they're damn near criminal.

252
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,192
And this newspaper is not
prepared to make 'em...

253
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:35,072
- and you can't substantiate them.
- And they're true!

254
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:37,472
This is now a matter
of corporate responsibility.

255
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:40,432
Since when do you put corporate
responsibility above the truth?

256
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:44,072
Get off your soapbox. I liked you
better as a cutthroat reporter.

257
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:47,232
I like you better as an editor who
couldn't be bought or intimidated!

258
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,232
- A man I admire.
- The days of investigative reporting...

259
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:51,072
are over, Lauren.

260
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,832
The news isn't news anymore. It's
as dead as the typewriter I used!

261
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:57,272
Corporate America
is running the show now.

262
00:28:57,272 --> 00:29:01,272
And their news agenda is free trade,
globalization and entertainment.

263
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,992
That's our glorious future!

264
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:07,352
You know what would happen to me
if I published your story on my own.

265
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:09,152
If you don't have the balls
to print my story...

266
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:12,072
- I will find someone who will.
- It's not that easy, kid.

267
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:14,752
Read your contract.

268
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:18,912
The Sentinel owns your story.
Hell, it owns you.

269
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,672
Nobody owns me!

270
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:27,192
That's the difference
between me and you.

271
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:29,752
Lauren!

272
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:52,512
Take the job, Lauren.

273
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:55,232
You got a damn fine career
in front of yourself...

274
00:29:55,232 --> 00:29:57,072
and you're throwing it all away
and for what?

275
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:59,992
Your story about these women
is just not worth it.

276
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,512
Not worth it?

277
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:04,472
I forgot. They're just Mexican women
so they're not worth it.

278
00:30:04,472 --> 00:30:06,272
I didn't mean it that way.

279
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:09,152
Do you see this?

280
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:11,512
And this?

281
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:16,912
And this? And this? And this?

282
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:22,112
All of it is assembled in Juarez
and it's all covered with blood.

283
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,312
Would you calm down?
If you walk out of here today...

284
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:26,232
you could never get back in here,
and you know it.

285
00:30:26,232 --> 00:30:28,792
- For God's sakes, let this thing go!
- I can't.

286
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,672
- You think this is your big story.
- My parents are from Mexico.

287
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:35,072
- You identify with it.
- I'm one of them. Can't you see?

288
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:41,872
My parents came here
as migrant farm workers.

289
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:45,632
They were killed...

290
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:49,152
so I was adopted.

291
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:59,752
I only have vague
memories of them.

292
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:06,472
I remember a field
filled with workers...

293
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,552
My mother.

294
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:13,512
My father.

295
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,632
I was there when he was killed.

296
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:27,952
I saw him die.

297
00:31:29,912 --> 00:31:33,712
- I'm sorry.
- When I met Eva, I saw myself.

298
00:31:33,712 --> 00:31:39,512
I've been running away
from who I am my whole life.

299
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:44,752
Because you don't wanna be Mexican,
not in this country.

300
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,112
You see?

301
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:56,912
I could be one of the women
in those factories.

302
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:03,192
It could be me
in one of those graves.

303
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:11,112
I can't let this go.

304
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:47,192
Alfonso, hurry.
What are you doing?

305
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:49,512
Just a minute, my love.

306
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:17,432
Alfonso!
Call an ambulance!

307
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,512
Out of the way!

308
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:37,872
Get up. Let's go.

309
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:42,432
Come on. Quickly!

310
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:47,792
Get in before the Border Patrol
finds us!

311
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:51,192
Watch your head.

312
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:12,992
Can I speak to Diaz?

313
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,032
What?

314
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,872
He's coming back. Let's go!

315
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:44,152
What?

316
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:20,672
- Who did this?
- I don't know. Nobody does.

317
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,912
Diaz is gone.

318
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,552
And tomorrow the bus driver's
gonna be a free man.

319
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:30,552
No! With Eva's testimony,
he will go to jail.

320
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:32,952
- Eva's gone.
- What?

321
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:37,712
She ran away. Nobody knows
where she is, not even her mother.

322
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,872
Her mother. To move away
from Colonia Anapra.

323
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:45,192
She want to be there for her,
waiting for her at their home...

324
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:48,632
but she doesn't feel safe
there anymore.

325
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:50,952
How could she? Tomorrow...

326
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:53,752
Domingo Esparza
is gonna be a free man.

327
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:58,352
- This isn't happening.
- It is happening.

328
00:36:59,152 --> 00:37:00,392
It's all over.

329
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,072
Kids, get up.

330
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:47,032
Oh, jeez. Poor people.

331
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:18,432
- Lauren.
- Who are you?

332
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:22,072
Would you gentlemen please
excuse us for a moment?

333
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:23,792
Do you believe in anything?

334
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,552
Are you, Mexican? American?
What are you?

335
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:31,352
These are limiting terms. They don't
mean much now in a modern world.

336
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:34,192
Alfonso Diaz was my friend.
Now he's dead.

337
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:36,032
I wanna know what happened to him.

338
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:43,072
He was reporting things
people didn't want reported.

339
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:44,872
What did you think
was going to happen to him?

340
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:47,792
- Who did it?
- Do you think I know that?

341
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,432
Do you think I even concern myself
with such things?

342
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:54,072
- It gets taken care of.
- Is Aris involved?

343
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:57,152
How many more women is he gonna kill?
Why don't you tell somebody about it?

344
00:38:57,152 --> 00:39:00,632
And who am I gonna tell?
These people know more than me.

345
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:04,152
- Lf they arrest him, nothing'll change.
- He's a murderer.

346
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:07,352
- He's protected by the authorities.
- You have to be realistic.

347
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,272
There are two sets of laws
in any country, okay?

348
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:12,992
The laws for rich and powerful people
and the laws for everybody else.

349
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,712
And don't think it's any different
in the United States...

350
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:18,312
because I buy politicians on both
sides of the border all the time.

351
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:20,232
What do you think built this?

352
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,072
Now...

353
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:29,792
when can we get together again?

354
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,792
I can free my schedule anytime.

355
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:34,032
What do you say?

356
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:41,872
I wish people like you didn't exist.

357
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:53,592
And on top of everything else...

358
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,872
you're a lousy god damned fuck.

359
00:39:58,072 --> 00:40:05,272
<i>The first shift has ended.
Please leave quickly.</i>

360
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:09,512
<i>The second shift
will start in 10 minutes.</i>

361
00:40:09,512 --> 00:40:12,952
<i>Please leave quickly.</i>

362
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:20,152
<i>The first shift has ended.
Please leave quickly.</i>

363
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,112
<i>Vamanos. Let's go.</i>

364
00:40:24,112 --> 00:40:25,872
They're shipping you back
to Juarez.

365
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:41,792
Hurry up, Nacho.
We need the electricity.

366
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,712
Hold on. I'm doing it.

367
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,992
Eva?

368
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:28,592
Eva?

369
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,552
It's morning and the court
will be in session soon.

370
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,872
They're gonna be waiting for you.

371
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:32,792
We're both pretty beat up.

372
00:46:37,752 --> 00:46:41,472
Maybe if we help each other...

373
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:44,712
well then we can make it.

374
00:47:19,352 --> 00:47:23,152
<i>Eva testified against her attacker,
Domingo Esparza.</i>

375
00:47:23,352 --> 00:47:25,232
<i>He is awaiting trial.</i>

376
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:29,432
<i>Eva was reunited with her mother.</i>

377
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:32,872
<i>They are being protected
by a human rights organization.</i>

378
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:41,992
<i>Aris' body was found.
It was never claimed.</i>

379
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:49,952
No one was arrested
for the murder of Alfonso Diaz.

380
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,672
<i>I took over Diaz's paper.</i>

381
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:01,912
<i>I continue to write to tell
the truth about Juarez.</i>

382
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:06,672
<i>Congress passed the bill expanding
the free trade agreements...</i>

383
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:08,792
<i>to Central America.</i>

384
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:13,272
<i>There are still no provisions
protecting the workers.</i>

385
00:48:17,512 --> 00:48:21,272
<i>Last week another body
was found in the desert.</i>

386
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:25,072
<i>A girl. About seventeen.</i>

387
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:32,272
<i>She was still dressed
in her blue factory smock.</i>

388
00:48:42,112 --> 00:48:44,952
<i>The murder of woman
in Juarez continues.</i>

389
