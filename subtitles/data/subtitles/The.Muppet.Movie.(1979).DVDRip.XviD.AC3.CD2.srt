00:00:00,326 --> 00:00:03,489
- Watch down the road!
- Kermit!

2
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:08,432
Look out for the billboard!

3
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:16,769
- Take off. Fozzie!
- Yes. sir!

4
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:19,777
Come back. you!

5
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:23,042
No frog's gonna make
a monkey outta me!

6
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:30,018
- I'm back.
- I don't understand any of this.

7
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:39,053
I just gotta
catch up with those guys!

8
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:45,870
Kermit. You were so courageous.
so magnificent.

9
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,697
Gee. I don't know what to say.

10
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:52,039
Say the bear was magnificent.
After all. I did the driving.

11
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:55,603
And I took a 1 00-foot belly flop
onto a moving car.

12
00:00:55,681 --> 00:01:00,084
Yes. but. Kermit assumed
the awesome responsibility...

13
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:01,813
of command.

14
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:05,220
- Gee.
- Oh. brother.

15
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,257
Why don't we stop
somewhere for the night...

16
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:13,492
and have a quiet.
little dinner for two?

17
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:16,557
Terrific!
I'll eat with you. Miss Piggy.

18
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:19,433
Not you. buzzard beak!

19
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:21,439
<i>Just mon capitaine...</i>

20
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:23,532
<i>and moi.</i>

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,307
Well.
that might be nice.

22
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:41,717
Wow.

23
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:47,229
Good evening. Miss Piggy.
You look lovely tonight.

24
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,426
Thank you.

25
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:02,404
I'm so sorry
if I kept you waiting.

26
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,506
It was worth it.

27
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,574
<i>How charming of vous.</i>

28
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:19,628
I took the liberty
of ordering us some wine.

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,492
Oh. waiter.

30
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,061
Yes?
May I help you?

31
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,404
The wine. please.

32
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:37,677
You mad. impetuous fink.
It's champagne.

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,480
Not exactly.
Sparkling muscatel.

34
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:44,648
One of the finest wines of Idaho.

35
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:49,319
- You may serve us now. please.
- May I?

36
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:55,492
- Look how he does that.
- Yeah. Pretty suave.

37
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:08,305
Don't you want to smell
the bottle cap?

38
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:14,275
- Smells good.
- Yeah.

39
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:16,014
Would you like
to taste it first?

40
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,318
Well--

41
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,225
- I think he's supposed to.
- Would you taste it for us. please?

42
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,174
Excellent choice.

43
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:41,337
Should be for 95 cents.

44
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:48,343
- And may we have straws. please?
- Yes.

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,412
I expected that.

46
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,685
Thank you.
That'll be all for now.

47
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:59,993
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,692
Thank you!

49
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,334
Here's to you. Miss Piggy.

50
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,997
Drink up.

51
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,859
Makes me giggly.

52
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,062
The wine?

53
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:35,232
Everything.

54
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:41,431
It's a beautiful evening.
isn't it?

55
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,136
Uh-huh.

56
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,838
And the moon
is just lovely.

57
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,176
but you know. Miss Piggy...

58
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,347
the moon doesn't look like you.

59
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,499
Miss Piggy! Miss Piggy!

60
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:13,004
- Are you Miss Piggy?
- Yes?

61
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,629
Telephone.

62
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:24,240
I did place one phone call
to my agent.

63
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:28,480
It'll only be
an eensy-teensy moment.

64
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,092
What the hey.

65
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,347
Evenin'.
Rowlf. Rowlf the Dog.

66
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,647
Sit yourself down.

67
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,347
- Kermit. Kermit the Frog.
- Pleased to meet ya.

68
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,220
I'm no Heifetz.
but I get by.

69
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,559
That was--
That was very nice.

70
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:16,533
Whoa. hey.
broken heart. right?

71
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:18,730
Does it show?

72
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:23,207
Listen. when you've been ticklin'
the ivories as long as I have...

73
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:26,301
you've seen a broken heart
for every drop of rain.

74
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:29,245
A shattered dream
for every fallen star.

75
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,114
Exactly.
She just walked out on me.

76
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:38,452
- Typical. That's why I live alone.
- You do. huh?

77
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,388
You bet.

78
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,326
I finish work.
I go home. read a book...

79
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:46,990
have a couple of beers.
take myself for a walk and go to bed.

80
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:49,033
Nice and simple.

81
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:53,435
- Stay away from women. That's my motto.
- but I can't.

82
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:56,440
Neither can I.
That's my trouble.

83
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,369
<i>You can't live with 'em</i>

84
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:02,709
<i>You can't live without 'em</i>

85
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:07,047
<i>There's something
irresistible-ish about 'em</i>

86
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:10,646
<i>we grin and bear it
'cause the nights are long</i>

87
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,520
<i>I hope that somethin'better
comes along</i>

88
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:16,784
I see what you mean.

89
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:20,662
<i>It's no good complainin'
and pointless to holler</i>

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,765
<i>If she's a beauty
she'll get under your collar</i>

91
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,530
<i>She made a monkey
out of old King Kong</i>

92
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:31,872
<i>I hope that somethin'better
comes along</i>

93
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,979
<i>Still. it's fun
when you're fetchin'</i>

94
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:38,983
<i>And agree to see an etching</i>

95
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,680
<i>That you keep at your lily pad</i>

96
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,690
<i>There is no solution
It's part of evolution</i>

97
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,692
<i>The pitter patter of soles</i>

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,853
<i>The little feet of tadpoles</i>

99
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,864
Rowlf. tadpoles don't have feet.

100
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,924
Sorry about that.
Two. three. four.

101
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:01,496
<i>There's no limitation
to mixin'and matchin'</i>

102
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:05,304
<i>Some get an itchin'for a critter

103
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:08,869

104
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,881
<i>I hope that something better</i>

105
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,940
<i>I hope that something better</i>

106
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:18,923
<i>I hope that something better
comes along</i>

107
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,534
Phone call for Kermit the Frog!

108
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,468
- You Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.

109
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:33,629
Phone.

110
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:43,775
It's not that often you see a guy
that green have the blues that bad.

111
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,254
Kermie. please!

112
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:54,719
<i>- Piggy. is that you?
- Yes. that's her.</i>

113
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:58,991
<i>And this is Doc Hopper.
Now you listen. frog. and listen good.</i>

114
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:03,933
Step outside the motel right now.
My guys'll meet you there.

115
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:07,628
Well.
what if I don't?

116
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:11,039
Then your girlfriend
will be ham hocks by breakfast.

117
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:14,578
Kermie. don't. don't!

118
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,655
Are you the guys
I'm supposed to meet?

119
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,402
Good. Glen. That's good.
Nice and tight.

120
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,606
- The professor's here. Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.

121
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,678
Kermie. I'm not a bit worried.

122
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:55,083
I know you're planning
something bold and clever.

123
00:09:55,153 --> 00:09:57,917
Well. I got us
this far. didn't I?

124
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:05,026
- How are you?
- Professor Krassman.

125
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:08,327
It's good to see you. Doc.
you little rustic devil. you.

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,063
Where's my victim?
I mean. patient.

127
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:14,071
- Step this way. Professor.
- Of course.

128
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,199
Let me introduce you
to your patient.

129
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,539
Prof. Krassman is
the world's leading authority...

130
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,011
on mind control in frogs.

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,710
It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic. don't you?

132
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:29,686
Tell us what you're gonna do
to our little Kermit.

133
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:34,714
Well. we're going to perform
an electronic ''cerebrectomy.''

134
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:38,058
- A what?
- An electronic cerebrectomy!

135
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:42,299
What's that?

136
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:46,030
It's something so sensational
that you'll have to hold on to your hat.

137
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,265
- Yes?
- When a German scientist says...

138
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,501
'' Hold on to your hat.''
it's not casual conversation.

139
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:53,135
Hold on to your hat!
Hat. hold! Good!

140
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,578
Now. what we're going to do is bring out
a machine that's going to wow you.

141
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:59,412
bertram. bertram.
bring out the machine!

142
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,850
Wait till you see this. You think
we're sleeping in Dusseldorf?

143
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,151
You think we're taking a nap
in Cologne? No. we're working at night.

144
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:08,590
Each night. a new dial.
a new knob. a diode.

145
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,925
- Electronic ce--
- Cerebrectomy.

146
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:15,433
- Electronic cerebrectomy.
- What does it do?

147
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,593
What does it do?

148
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:20,433
It turns the brains into guacamole.

149
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:26,076
First of all.
I'll pull out of this. okay?

150
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,078
Wonderful.

151
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,240
Second?

152
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,285
Halt!

153
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,949
I detest the surfeit
of provincial laughter.

154
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,722
Now. we take your friend.
the little '' F-O-R-G''...

155
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:46,559
put him in the chair.
clamp on the terminals...

156
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,826
drop the electronic yarmulke...

157
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,835
and throw. what we call
in German. the switch.

158
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,966
Yes. you little green devil...

159
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:01,172
soon it'll be a hot time
at the old skull tonight.

160
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:04,545
Thank you. Herr Machine.
Now. the frog will do your bidding.

161
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:08,279
He will do your every whim. He will do
your television commercial. yes.

162
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:12,449
He will sell your frogs' legs.

163
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,856
- Zaparooni.
- Head full of jelly.

164
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:19,124
- A noggin full of library paste!
- Let's fry them brains!

165
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,291
- You've got a fun job.
- I love it. I love it.

166
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,167
If I could inflict a little pain during
the afternoon. I sleep good at night.

167
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:28,705
- We'll let you get on with it. then.
- My pleasure.

168
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:31,003
Max.

169
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:35,342
I'll be back later
to pick up what's left of the frog.

170
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:39,076
''What's left of the frog.'' You can have
everything. excuse the brain.

171
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,675
All right.
bring over the frog.

172
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:46,117
Kermie. whatever happens next...

173
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:49,888
I wouldn't give up
this evening together for anything.

174
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:52,896
- Would you?
- Make me an offer.

175
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,161
Okay. I got him.
I got him.

176
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,707
Good. good.

177
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:06,266
And why don't we take
a little seat. Kermit?

178
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:08,835
Hold his hands down.

179
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,905
Get your feeties in place.

180
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,281
Will you
stop whimpering?

181
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,980
Go out like a frog.
not a little toad.

182
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:21,719
Okay. Herr Machine. this is
big time here. Ready to go to work?

183
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:23,988
Hand clamps!

184
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,927
Foot clamps!

185
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,861
You can struggle
all you want now. frog.

186
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,302
It'll do you
very little good.

187
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:37,466
All right. And now
it's time to drop...

188
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,476
the electronic beanie.

189
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:44,670
Soon there'll be enough voltage coursing
through your little frog brain...

190
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,616
to light up Cincinnati.

191
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:51,280
- Here we go.
- Oh. please! Not my frog. please!

192
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:55,486
- Say good-bye to the frog. pig.
- Why should I?

193
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,623
because in ten seconds.
he won't know you from kosher bacon.

194
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,632
That does it!

195
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,826
What the heck's goin' on here?

196
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:32,954
A pig that goes bananas?
What is this. a luau?

197
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,999
Where'd she go?

198
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:37,091
Oh. boys.

199
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,159
There she is! Get her!

200
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:43,774
I must reach the switch.
I must!

201
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,833
- Switch-- I must reach--
- Oh. no.

202
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:55,385
- Now. Kermie.
- Thank you.

203
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,933
Well...

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,968
shall we go now. Kermie?

205
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:17,033
Well--
Just a second.

206
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,907
What?
Piggy. it's your agent.

207
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,019
Thank you.

208
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,848
Yeah. Morty.
What have you got?

209
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:34,221
Commercial?

210
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:39,729
How much? When?

211
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:41,924
Take it.

212
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:52,442
Good-bye!

213
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,619
What happened?

214
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,431
Flip. flip. flip. flip.

215
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:23,897
Don't worry. Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.

216
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:27,570
Yeah. yeah.just be cool and
eat another seat cushion.

217
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,579
Seat cushion!

218
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:35,185
Well. how do you
like the film?

219
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:39,349
I've seen detergents that
leave a better film than this.

220
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:43,622
I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm having a great time.

221
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,526
Oh. good.

222
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:50,428
- The ''flim'' is okey-dokey.
- Good. Roll film.

223
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,492
'' Flim'' is ''rooling.''

224
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,538
Quiet. quiet.

225
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,407
This is the patriotic part.

226
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,310
- Should we stand up?
- No.

227
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:08,014
<i>Oh. beautiful
for spacious skies</i>

228
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:12,182
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

229
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:16,522
<i>For purple mountains'majesties</i>

230
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:20,997
<i>Above the fruited plain</i>

231
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:25,365
<i>America. America</i>

232
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:29,805
<i>God shed His grace on thee</i>

233
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:34,311
<i>And crown thy good
with brotherhood</i>

234
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:36,779
<i>From sea to</i>

235
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,409
<i>Shining sea</i>

236
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,184
Patriotism swells in the heart
of the American bear.

237
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,270
Hold it. boys. Hold it!

238
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:06,276
Hold your fire!

239
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:11,179
Now. boys. no reflection
on the job you been doin'...

240
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,683
but I decided
to bring in a specialist.

241
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,464
Now. boys.
this is Snake Walker.

242
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,728
Tell 'em what you do. Snake.

243
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,595
Kill frogs.

244
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:44,743
- How long is it to Hollywood?
- We gotta be there by tomorrow.

245
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,751
Hey. Kermit! Are you going to
get an agent like that pig had?

246
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:50,549
Gonzo. you know
he's touchy about that.

247
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,282
- Hey. who's that? I don't believe that.
- Oh. no.

248
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,129
- That's Piggy.
- Yeah. I know.

249
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,024
Do you think we should
help her with her bag?

250
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,771
Oh. Kermie!
What an unbelievable coincidence!

251
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:19,412
Hello again.
It's me!

252
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,748
Would you hold
my laundry case?

253
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:27,286
- Well.
- Well what?

254
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:29,918
So much has happened to me
since I saw you last.

255
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,590
Frankly. Miss Piggy.
I don't give a hoot.

256
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:39,034
My name is Rowlf the Dog. and I was
playin' the piano in a-- Oh. never mind.

257
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,776
I missed you.

258
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,240
Don't I get
one kissy-kissy?

259
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,649
I don't think so. Miss Piggy.

260
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,120
Just one little hug?

261
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,820
<i>You've been listening
to music to hug frogs by...</i>

262
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,390
<i>and this is Doc Hopper sayin'
that if Kermit the Frog...</i>

263
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:12,595
don't stop right now and call me...

264
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,629
and agree to be my national spokesman.
he will soon be a frogburger.

265
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:23,808
<i>- We'll be okay.
- Oh. mon capitaine.</i>

266
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:33,146
Oh. boy. Yeah.
What? No problem!

267
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:36,990
It's okay. it's okay.
No problem. Hey. all right!

268
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,723
We're in trouble.

269
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,360
I wish I still had
my Studebaker.

270
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,904
There's probably somethin'
broken about the engine.

271
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:50,805
Hey. don't worry.
Someone's bound to come along.

272
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,308
Yeah?

273
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,229
Well. I guess we blew it.
huh. Gonzo?

274
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,232
Yeah.

275
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,928
but the sky sure is
beautiful out here.

276
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:22,939
Look at that.

277
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:30,180
We're gonna miss
the auditions tomorrow. right?

278
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:44,657
boy. you could get lost
in a sky like that.

279
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:49,289
I wish I had
those balloons again.

280
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:52,564
So much for Hollywood.

281
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:57,033
Listen. gang.
I never promised we'd make it.

282
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,009
I never promised anything.

283
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:11,614
<i>This looks familiar</i>

284
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,989
<i>Vaguely familiar</i>

292
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:54,092
<i>Is that a song there</i>

293
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,430
<i>And do I belong there</i>

294
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:02,029

315
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:33,363
<i>Someday</i>

316
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,765
I didn't promise anybody anything.

317
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:15,204
What do I know
about Hollywood anyway?

318
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:19,140
Just the dreams I got from sitting
through too many double features.

319
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,111
<i>So why did you leave the swamp
in the first place?</i>

320
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:25,342
'Cause some agent fella
said I had talent.

321
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,407
He probably says that
to everybody.

322
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,010
<i>On the other hand.
if you hadn't left the swamp...</i>

323
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,715
<i>you'd be feeling
pretty miserable anyhow.</i>

324
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,124
Yeah. but then it would
just be me feelin' miserable.

325
00:25:37,194 --> 00:25:40,288
Now I got a lady pig
and a bear and a chicken...

326
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:43,458
a dog. a thing--
whatever Gonzo is.

327
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:47,334
- He's a little like a turkey.
- Yeah. A little like a turkey.

328
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:49,804
- but not much.
- No. I guess not.

329
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:52,468
Anyhow. I brought 'em all out here
into the middle of nowhere.

330
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:54,511
It's all my fault.

331
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:57,012
Still...

332
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,072
whether you promised them
something or not...

333
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,813
you gotta remember
they wanted to come.

334
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:05,321
but that's because
they believed in me.

335
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,914
No. they believed
in the dream.

336
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:11,155
- Well. so do I. but--
- You do?

337
00:26:11,228 --> 00:26:14,755
- Yeah. Of course I do.
- Well. then?

338
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:17,232
Well. then...

339
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:20,168
I guess I was wrong
when I said I never promised anyone.

340
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:23,306
I promised me.

341
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,017
Hey. now. wait a minute.

342
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,501
Hey. what's happening?

343
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,367
At the moment.
we're what's happening.

344
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,834
Oh. great!
Wonderful! Yeah!

345
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,343
Zoot! Hey. Zoot!

346
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,745
Hold it. hold it.
Animal. cool it back there.

347
00:27:04,815 --> 00:27:07,249
Yeah.

348
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:10,014
All right. yeah.

349
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:13,420
Hey. it's wonderful to see you.
but how did you ever find us?

350
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,584
Oh. easy. We just read
the screenplay you left us.

351
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,096
'' Exterior desert. night.''
We knew right where you were.

352
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:22,189
Like. can you get behind it?

353
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,826
Hey. when you dudes
have to be at that audition?

354
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:27,928
- 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
- Well. climb aboard the bus.

355
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:30,439
We'll have breakfast
at Hollywood and Vine.

356
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:39,815
<i>Movin'right along</i>

357
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:42,181
<i>Oh.yeah</i>

358
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,118
Here we go.

359
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:48,348
<i>Movin'right along</i>

360
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:02,368
Kermie. whisper sweet nothings
into my ear.

361
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,873
Motorcycle cop.

362
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:07,069
'' Motorcycle cop''
is a sweet nothing?

363
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,578
A motorcycle cop is chasing us.

364
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:13,382
Hey. Dr. Teeth.
you better pull over.

365
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,284
Hey. easier done than said.

366
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,723
- Drag city.
- What do we do now?

367
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:26,327
Oh. dear.

368
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:29,332
Hey. hey. The man with the badge.
The police.

369
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,096
The cops. the fuzz. the P-I--

370
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,798
- Don't you dare.
- I wouldn't think of it.

371
00:28:40,477 --> 00:28:42,809
Did we do something
wrong. Officer?

372
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:47,813
- Kermie. it's him!
- Okay. gang. Let him explain.

373
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:50,911
This whole disguise is
only so I could warn you.

374
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:53,013
Yeah. Sure. sure.

375
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,254
I never thought Doc would hurt Kermit.
I thought he was gonna lean on him.

376
00:28:57,328 --> 00:29:00,195
but now he's got this
frog killer in from the coast...

377
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:02,198
and the man is deadly!

378
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,291
Oh. no. Kermit.
what are we gonna do?

379
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,166
It's time to beat feet.
green stuff.

380
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:09,933
I love it. Chase music is
one of our best riffs.

381
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:12,475
Hold it. Dr. Teeth.
What's up ahead?

382
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,740
- Only an old ghost town.
- Fine.

383
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:19,112
Listen. you go tell Doc Hopper
I'll be waiting for him there.

384
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:22,346
- What?
- Kermit. you'll get killed!

385
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,354
Listen. guys. Listen.

386
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:28,050
I can't spend my whole life
running away from a bully.

387
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,559
It's time for a showdown.

388
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:48,937
Chugga. chugga.

389
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:02,717
Hey. listen.
I'm gonna check things out.

390
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:05,227
Everybody stay
on the bus. okay?

391
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,593
- Hey. Kermit?
- Yeah?

392
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:14,068
Can I take Animal for a walk?
He needs some exercise.

393
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:16,072
Yeah. sure.

394
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,549
What is that?

395
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:40,188
That's one of my latest inventions--
a musical rotating rain barrel.

396
00:30:40,264 --> 00:30:42,732
- Oh. yeah.
- You see...

397
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,294
I'm Dr. bunsen Honeydew.
and this is my assistant. beaker.

398
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:49,999
We live here.
perfecting useful inventions.

399
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:52,064
Come in. come in.

400
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,782
Welcome to our laboratory.

401
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,677
Please don't touch anything.

402
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,154
Is this the only street into town?

403
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:12,161
Yes. yes.

404
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:15,158
Hey. what are you dudes
doin' in here?

405
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:17,359
I'm so glad you asked!

406
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,834
We're perfecting
our latest invention...

407
00:31:19,903 --> 00:31:22,633
insta-grow pills.

408
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:26,301
Well. what in the name
of Fats Waller is that?

409
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:30,375
A four-foot prune!

410
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:32,745
A four-foot prune.

411
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:36,479
Yeah. man. Well. what else
do these pills make big?

412
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,521
They work on anything.

413
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:40,887
but the effect is.
sadly. temporary.

414
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,721
Sadly temporary.

415
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,904
Hey. Kermit!
Here comes Doc Hopper!

416
00:31:54,972 --> 00:31:57,566
I know.
I'll be ready for him.

417
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:06,180
Okay. frog. Where are ya?

418
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:09,577
I'm here. I'll meet you
in the middle of the street.

419
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:13,680
- Oh. yeah?
- Man to frog.

420
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:36,974
- All right. Hopper.
- All right. frog.

421
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:40,175
One last chance.

422
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,708
You can do my TV commercials
live or stuffed.

423
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,691
What's the matter with you?

424
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,125
You gotta be crazy chasin' me
halfway across the country.

425
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:53,128
Why are you doin' this to me?

426
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:58,229
'Cause all my life I wanted to own
a thousand frog-leg restaurants...

427
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:00,236
and you're the key. greenie.

428
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:02,499
Yeah. well.
I've got a dream too.

429
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:06,100
but it's about singing and
dancing and making people happy.

430
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:09,771
The kind of dream that gets better
the more people you share it with.

431
00:33:09,846 --> 00:33:17,446
And. well. I've found a whole bunch
of friends who have the same dream.

432
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:20,547
And it kind of
makes us like a family.

433
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,489
You have anybody
like that. Hopper?

434
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,756
Once you get all those restaurants.
who're you gonna share it with?

435
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:30,163
Who are your friends. Doc?
Those guys?

436
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:36,832
I got lots of friends.

437
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:40,609
Max. for instance.

438
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,681
- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man. Doc.

439
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,980
I think if you look
in your heart...

440
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:51,782
you'll find you really want
to let me and my friends go...

441
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,982
to follow our dream.

442
00:33:54,057 --> 00:33:57,618
but if that's not
the kind of man you are...

443
00:33:57,694 --> 00:34:01,027
and if what I'm saying
doesn't make any sense to you...

444
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:04,898
well. then.
go ahead and kill me.

445
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:20,082
All right. boys.

446
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,412
Kill him.

447
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,546
No. wait. please!

448
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:21,100
- Everybody goin' to Hollywood?
- Yeah!

449
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,084
Next stop is
Hollywood and Vine.

450
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,501
Look at the ocean!
The ocean!

451
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:52,705
Yes. Mr. Lord. I'll have those
deal memos for you in a jiffy.

452
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:00,539
I'm sorry.

453
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:04,348
Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.
He's packaging a blockbuster.

454
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:11,326
Look! It's wonderful!
Like a dream come true.

455
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:15,160
Don't count your tadpoles until they're
hatched. I still have to audition.

456
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,757
Hey. ain't nothin' to it
but to do it.

457
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:23,771
And where do you think
you're going?

458
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,503
Hi. there!
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.

459
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:30,512
You can't just walk in here
off the street. you know.

460
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,673
Especially not with
all these animals.

461
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,842
Animals?
What's wrong with animals?

462
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:41,551
This is a movie studio.
not a zoo!

463
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,490
besides--

464
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,560
I'm allergic to animal hair.
Now. get along. all of you.

465
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,965
Now. wait a second.
See here. miss.

466
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:55,493
I may not be one of your fancy
Hollywood frogs. but I deserve a chance.

467
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:59,133
We're going to stay here until you let
us in to see Lew Lord. aren't we. gang?
