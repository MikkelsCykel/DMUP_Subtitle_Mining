1
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,833
GEE, YOU LOOK SO FINE.

2
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,740
GEE, YOU SHOULD BE MINE.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,812
GEE, OH HOW I PINE.

4
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,916
GEE, YOU SURE ARE FINE.

5
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:39,086
GEE, LIKE...

6
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,891
GEE, AND THAT'S NO LIE.

7
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:47,690
YOU SURE LOOK GOOD TO ME.

8
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,257
MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

9
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,466
YOU THRILL ME BODACIOUS.

10
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,764
YOU'RE MY ADMIRATION LIKE...

11
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:00,205
A SWINGING KING
WHEN IT STARTS TO SWING.

12
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:02,704
GEE, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,209
GEE, I'M IN LOVE...

14
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:08,511
YOU SEE. GEE, CAN'T WE AGREE?

15
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,814
ON ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
YOU AND ME.

16
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,962
GEE, YOU LOOK SO FINE.

17
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,903
GEE, YOU SHOULD BE MINE.

18
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:08,942
GEE, OH HOW I PINE.

19
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,113
GEE, YOU SURE ARE FINE.

20
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,041
GEE, LIKE CHERRY PIE.

21
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,116
GEE, I HOPE TO DIE.

22
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,118
GEE, AND THAT'S NO LIE.

23
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:24,219
JACK, YOU SURE LOOK GOOD TO ME.

24
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,184
MY...

25
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,523
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

26
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,258
YOU THRILL ME BODACIOUS.

27
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,797
YOU'RE MY ADMIRATION...

28
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,627
LIKE A SWINGING KING...

29
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,864
WHEN IT STARTS TO SWING.

30
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,336
GEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

31
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:43,374
GEE, I'M IN LOVE, YOU SEE.
GEE...

32
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:45,071
CAN WE AGREE?

33
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:48,446
ON ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, YOU AND ME.

34
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:24,044
Hey, we're all proud of you, Buster.
Charlie.

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,988
Small town cops dropping
a pair like this.

36
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,857
Wait a lifetime, never even
sniff one this good.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,655
Wanna make a move to the boroughs,
you let me know.

38
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,023
It's a phone call.

39
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,792
Hey, maybe you
wanna throw the switch.

40
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,025
I can fix that, too.

41
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,969
You are such an asshole.

42
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,729
You don't even know
what you have here.

43
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,933
Whatever it is,
consider it our gift to you.

44
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,339
You know,
you don't have to go in there.

45
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,580
Yeah, I do.

46
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,862
If any two maggots ever deserved
to boil in their own shit,

47
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,499
it was Ray Fernandez
and Martha Beck.

48
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:13,965
They'd probably still be cozy

49
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,435
in a Lansing jail cell
if it weren't for Buster.

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,599
Or, maybe it was Annie.
Buster's wife.

51
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,915
Who one September night stuck
a service thirty-eight in her ear.

52
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,712
No note. No nothin'.

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
Just blew her brains
out all over the bathtub.

54
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,520
Cops don't talk about what they see.

55
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:42,490
They push it down with a stiff Bromo
and a bourbon back, hide behind a...

56
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:46,329
newspaper and hope nobody notices.
But after...

57
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,063
Buster found Annie in the bathroom,
that all changed.

58
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:53,139
And he took it out on Fernandez
and Beck with a vengeance.

59
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,413
If they wrote
a book on confidence men,

60
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:03,809
Ray Fernandez would've
been the pinup boy.

61
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:09,519
He wasn't the first rat-fuck barnacle
to play the Ionely hearts game.

62
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:15,092
But he might've been the smoothest.
He knew the game, he knew his marks.

63
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,198
He loved the way it made him feel.

64
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,798
Hell, he was so slick, he even convinced
himself he was Don-fucking-Juan.

65
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,670
Oh Bea...

66
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:28,038
I'm so sorry I'm late.
A thousand apologies.

67
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:31,078
So sorry I'm late.
The meetings with my lawyers ran over.

68
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:32,408
I'm so sorry I'm late.

69
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,209
Had a meeting with my lawyers.
It went over.

70
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,817
I nearly missed the plane.

71
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:36,917
I was in such a hurry I...

72
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,647
left my wallet and my passport.

73
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,223
I left my wallet and my passport.

74
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:45,691
And I left my passport
and my wallet...

75
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,058
on the counter at the airport.

76
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:49,422
You're even more...

77
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,055
beautiful than your picture.

78
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:53,830
Stunning.

79
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,338
Today's a special day.

80
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,343
It's the oldest con in the book.

81
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,915
He pen paled 'em, war widows,
old maids, spinsters, anyone alone.

82
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:10,717
Was like picking plums.

83
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:14,451
They advertised, for Christ sake,
through correspondence clubs

84
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,989
and Ionely hearts rags.

85
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,890
He was quite the bard.

86
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,755
Always slipping in a little
fishing expedition to feel...

87
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:25,994
out their bank account.
If he smelled... money, Valentino.

88
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,499
If he thought they were broke...

89
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,571
he'd bounce 'em...
like a bad check.

90
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:41,015
Buster was my partner.

91
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,276
We went all the way back to a squad car,
for Christ sake.

92
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,420
He was the toughest badge
I'd ever seen.

93
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:50,322
Turned more collars than
a Chinaman drycleaner.

94
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,723
But after he lost Annie,
he parked himself behind the desk,

95
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:59,560
pushing paper, taking phone calls,
and a lot of other people's shit.

96
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,827
I didn't understand that.

97
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,030
Robinson, Homicide.

98
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,231
You don't know shit
because Jackie Robinson is a...

99
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,672
I don't know shit?
Veteran baseball...

100
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,708
Fuck Jackie Robinson.

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,608
Jesus Christ, let me tell you
something so everybody can hear me.

102
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:11,838
You gave me a hundred to one.

103
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:12,948
Hundred to one I wouldn't drop

104
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:14,777
a nickel on the first team
to put a nigger in baseball.

105
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,613
Okay? Even, even if he
is a cousin of Robinson's here.

106
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:18,913
Okay?

107
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,244
It's okay.

108
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,913
Hello. Oh, Mrs. Reilly?

109
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,992
Oh, Reilly,
your wife's on the phone.

110
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,316
Her negro lover just left,

111
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,326
wants to know if I can
come down there and finish her off.

112
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:28,157
How you gonna...
finish her off,

113
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,288
you haven't seen your prick
in six months, you fat fuck.

114
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,798
That's funny, your wife...
found it real good.

115
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,629
You think I'm scared of you...
you big fuckin' sack of meat?

116
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:34,633
- Get outta here.
- Why don't ya...

117
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,930
keep your mouth shut
and learn something?

118
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,061
Fuck you.

119
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,436
I'm telling you, he's gonna
burn your house... down one day.

120
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:40,667
He's a rat.

121
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,210
Listen, me and Eastman,
we're going over to Jimmy's.

122
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,509
We're gonna uh, play some cards,
suck on the beer tit, tell some lies.

123
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,673
How 'bout it?

124
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,008
Hey Robbie.

125
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,210
Hey Rene.

126
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,853
I can't.
I... gotta take the train tonight.

127
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:55,957
Train?
What happened to your car?

128
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,081
What, you didn't hear?

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,989
The kid drove
it into some garbage cans.

130
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,754
Siren going, lights, everything.

131
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,727
Which bone did you break?

132
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,024
The one between his ears.

133
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,063
Hey, I can drop you.

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,225
Yeah, Rene could give you...
a lift.

135
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,167
Nice.

136
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:09,862
Okay.

137
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:10,802
Enough.

138
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,838
What?

139
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,168
So we...
playing cards or what?

140
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,742
No, but I'II...
take that ride.

141
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,205
Meet ya at Jimmy's.

142
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,342
By the time Fernandez picked up

143
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,818
on Martha Beck's bullshit smear
in some Ionely hearts rag...

144
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,712
she'd already
been picked over by every...

145
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:31,384
Tom-Dick son of a bitch who ever
sniffed a skirt, including her own...

146
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:35,293
brother, who started raping her from...
the time she was ten.

147
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:37,897
She was good-Iooking, alright.

148
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,033
But damaged goods.

149
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,062
Martha.

150
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,163
Raymond.

151
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,669
Uh, uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

152
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:51,608
The meetings with my uh,
lawyers ran over.

153
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:53,606
I was in such a hurry I...

154
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,017
I nearly missed my plane

155
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:58,086
and I left my wallet
and passport at the counter.

156
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:00,189
What kind of lawyers?

157
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:05,058
Oh... just, u- regular lawyers.

158
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:10,059
We're closing in on some uh,
some import prospects.

159
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:19,034
I can't believe you're here.
I can't believe we're here.

160
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:23,042
I mean af- after so many letters...
and for such a long time, it's...

161
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,878
It's incredible.

162
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,609
I mean, here we are...
face to face.

163
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:30,608
Oh, what?

164
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,243
Please say something.

165
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,548
I uh...

166
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,987
You're just so beautiful.

167
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,356
May I... show you to a table?

168
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,064
How's room service?

169
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,757
It's off the menu, ma'am.

170
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,398
We'll have... breakfast in bed.

171
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,266
What are you doing?

172
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,602
I have an appointment.
I won't be an hour.

173
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,643
I love the way you write.

174
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,076
Such a poet.

175
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,050
Raymond?

176
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:07,619
You don't disappoint.

177
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,020
A regular Charles Boyer.

178
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,859
Hey, what d'you say we...

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,992
test our luck later,
watch the greyhounds run?

180
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,404
Think you can wait... for me?

181
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,869
Oh, I can wait.

182
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,633
The question is, can you?

183
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,952
Hey, you're a little kitty cat.

184
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,159
Toodle-Ioo.

185
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,058
Toodle-Ioo.

186
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,103
Maybe he skinned out
'cause she was broke.

187
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,535
Or maybe he was afraid
she was a keeper.

188
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,532
Either way, Martha had him...
figured at Hello.

189
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,449
Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

190
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:13,686
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

191
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:17,656
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord... forever. Amen.

192
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,535
Dorothy.

193
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:35,341
My deepest sympathies.

194
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:36,775
Well thank you.

195
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,747
I'm sorry. Raymond...

196
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,748
Martin.
I was a customer of your husband's.

197
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:44,409
He was a tough...
but honest businessman.

198
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:47,750
And I know he'll be missed,
that son of a gun.

199
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,185
What company...
you with?

200
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,817
Bradley Coachworks in Cleveland.
I manage receivables.

201
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,123
So you know our...
account man, Ben Chadwick.

202
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:58,332
Of course.
Ben, he's a good man.

203
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,832
Anybody who knew
my father knew he was...

204
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,027
a son of a bitch.

205
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,195
And Ben Chadwick's
been dead five years.

206
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:08,671
Oh my... god!

207
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,770
Oh my god!

208
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,186
My husband's company has been
a loyal customer for many years.

209
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,285
In spite of your...
disregard for the deceased,

210
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,621
he did a fair business with us.

211
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,654
And it's disgraceful
that you'd humiliate a...

212
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,460
patron on this, of all days.

213
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:35,727
Shame on you!
Shame on you.

214
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,331
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby.

215
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,067
Shame on you!

216
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,442
Come on.
Are you okay?

217
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,945
I'm okay.

218
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,814
It's hard to say whose...
voodoo was working on who.

219
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,085
But the day them
two figured each other out

220
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:57,418
was the beginning of
a bad end for a lot of people.

221
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,188
So what's up with Rene?

222
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,696
You don't need to know.

223
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,960
What, she's got those uh,
silver dollar summits.

224
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,195
Am I right?

225
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,595
Come on.
A week's pay for confirmation.

226
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,037
You don't make enough, Charlie.

227
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:13,903
Well that's true.

228
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,010
- Slow down here.
- Leave it alone.

229
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,202
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Leave it alone.

230
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,505
No-no, come on, stop.

231
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:18,408
Come on.

232
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,741
Stop.

233
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:24,480
What're you doing?

234
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,315
- Borrowing money?
- Shut... the fuck up.

235
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,444
What're you doing?

236
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,817
Back up! Back up, now!

237
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,828
Back up, shit stick.

238
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,965
We gotta get him to County.

239
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,033
You're not putting...
that bloody mess in my car.

240
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,698
Let's go.

241
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:46,965
What?

242
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,976
Look. Look at my car.
It's full of blood.

243
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,406
Next time you take the train.

244
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,515
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:54,274
Oh.

246
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,007
I'll pay for it.

247
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,310
My ass.

248
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,378
What're you trying to do anyway,
get yourself killed?

249
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:06,057
Baker Baker.
Baker Baker, you up?

250
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:08,990
Two Baker Baker.

251
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:11,793
Deceased female in Wantaugh,
twenty-seven thirty-two Merrick Road.

252
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,992
Possible suicide.

253
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,432
Uh, we're ten-ten.

254
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,698
Detective Reilly
requested you, sir.

255
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,365
I've been babysitting this
fuckin' midget for a year, now.

256
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:20,770
Let's just go.

257
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,275
- With you?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,402
- Nah.
- No-no, let's just do it.

259
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,872
Come on.

260
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,375
Two Baker Baker en route.

261
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,387
It's raining out there.

262
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,224
You know if she had
any family or relatives?

263
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,596
I, you know, I don't... know.

264
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,856
What's the story?

265
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,262
We're supposed to be off duty.

266
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,966
Well the book says uh,
two detectives from Homicide.

267
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,463
What're you... doing here?

268
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,697
Me? I was losing.

269
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,468
Suspicious.

270
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:54,707
You are such a piece of shit.

271
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,839
That's not really the point,
is it?

272
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,858
Patty Forsythe, twenty-five.

273
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:19,564
Filleted the radial,
couple superficials.

274
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:22,899
Had a hard time getting started
but eventually got it right.

275
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,335
Good, all we need is...

276
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:26,498
some celery sticks and we can
have a couple Bloody Marys.

277
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,274
Why is this suspicious?

278
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,210
Why is it suspicious?

279
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,509
Well, look, tasty... dame.
Right? She got a nice place.

280
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,206
She got a job.

281
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,942
What, out of the blue
she just decides to play...

282
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,177
connect the dots with a razor?

283
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:37,944
Come on.

284
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,918
All right, everybody out.

285
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:40,646
Let's go.

286
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,257
I want names and badges.
Everyone.

287
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:44,688
Come... on.

288
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,387
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Huh?

289
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:48,325
What do you mean
what's wrong with me?

290
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,590
It's a suicide.

291
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,063
A minute ago you said
it was suspicious.

292
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,666
Which is it?

293
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,530
It's a suspicious suicide.
How's that?

294
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:00,066
I make her a snow cone uh,
thirty-six to forty-eight.

295
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:00,766
Mm-hm.

296
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,968
She used ice.
Probably thought it would hurt.

297
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:04,306
Yeah... probably did.

298
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,707
Vascular contractions would
explain the false starts.

299
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,680
Alright, give me a liver...
temp on her.

300
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,683
So, since...
when is he back on the job?

301
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,086
He's always been on the job.

302
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,190
- Oh. Really?
- Mm.

303
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,849
See that, all this time I'm thinking
he works for the fuckin' phone company.

304
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,452
You called us, remember?

305
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:20,994
- Mm-hm.
- He's top dick.

306
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,825
Yeah, he is.
You got that right.

307
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,488
Why don't you
keep your mouth shut.

308
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:25,657
Why?
What, is he gonna do something?

309
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:26,631
He's not gonna do anything.

310
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,430
You know why?
'Cause he's a fucking pug.

311
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,598
Keep it up.

312
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,271
Donuts for the note.
Reilly's buying.

313
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,604
There's no note.

314
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,938
There is a note.

315
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,208
She wanted
to get somebody's attention.

316
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,871
You'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

317
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,078
Hey.

318
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,479
Hey-hey. I can't...

319
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:44,643
You bite...
your fuckin' tongue out, you...

320
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:45,776
Hey. Hear me?

321
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,183
Huh?

322
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:48,946
I can't...

323
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,925
Found it.

324
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,399
Eclair for me, shit stick.

325
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:01,833
Fuck you.

326
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:23,923
Hey.

327
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,105
Don't forget my father.

328
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,085
So your sister's got Eddie?

329
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,319
Yeah, but I still gotta go.

330
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,494
It's two in the morning.

331
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,602
Yup. I gotta go.

332
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:13,569
Where are my pants?

333
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:14,971
Over here.

334
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,740
How long you gonna
keep me a secret, huh?

335
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,478
You're no secret.
Trust me.

336
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,354
Shoes?

337
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,080
They're down over there.

338
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,282
Oh yeah. I heard the Dispatch.
You okay?

339
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,654
Yeah.

340
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:36,488
I mean come on, that's my job.
Been doing it a long time.

341
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,400
That doesn't
mean you're not human.

342
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,602
I don't wanna talk about it.

343
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,598
Hey, I'm... not your wife.

344
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,133
So don't treat me like one.

345
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,039
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:55,083 --> 00:19:01,249
You know Eddie, he never cried.
Not even at the funeral.

347
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:02,117
No?

348
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:03,349
No.

349
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,787
Kid shouldn't
have to be that tough.

350
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:08,724
Neither should you.

351
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,494
Make you some eggs?

352
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,433
You're a doll.
But I gotta go.

353
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,376
Bye. See you later.

354
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:26,046
Okay. Wanna take my car?

355
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,412
Nah. I'll just walk down to Merrick...
take the bus.

356
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,380
It'll be easier.

357
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,144
Okay.

358
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:49,902
How'd you find me?

359
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:52,531
I'm a detective, remember?

360
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,801
Well, I thought
maybe you was a peeping Tom.

361
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,913
You know uh,
no one's gonna hold her against you.

362
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,620
Yeah, except for maybe my son.

363
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,121
Two fights in one night.
That's pretty good.

364
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,788
And Reilly.

365
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,166
Reilly's a... fuckin' idiot.
You used to know that.

366
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,858
I don't know, Charlie.

367
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,770
People don't just punch out
for no reason.

368
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:28,334
Yeah well, she had a reason.

369
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,447
Uh, I was talking about Annie.

370
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,075
Yeah, I know.

371
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,347
All right, so our girl, she comes
home early with the groceries.

372
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,158
She's looking
for a little romance.

373
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:49,287
She's got uh, candles,
bottle of chianti, and some rib eyes.

374
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,598
She sees the boyfriend through
the back door with his sister

375
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,636
bent over the table, here,
doing a donkey.

376
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,531
A sister?

377
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,604
Yeah, sister.

378
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,503
Bent over...

379
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,769
Seen them through the back...
door on this table.

380
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,535
People are work.
What can I tell ya?

381
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,942
Jesus Christ.

382
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:10,711
All right, so, she leaves,
comes back after they're gone.

383
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:15,346
She scrubs the table with Brillo.
Goes into the bathroom.

384
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,254
You know the rest.

385
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:18,620
Did they dust?

386
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,161
No.

387
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,420
Why not?

388
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,526
Because while fucking around

389
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,825
on your girlfriend may be shitty,
it ain't illegal.

390
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,464
At least not yet, anyway.

391
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,362
Well it... is,
if it's your sister.

392
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:34,871
She had to have cash or...
jewelry or silverware or something.

393
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,671
Yeah, she had the ruby
slippers and the diamond broche

394
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,780
she wears to the
steno pool every day.

395
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:40,972
She worked for the L-I double-R,
for Christ sakes.

396
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:42,481
She's got nothing.

397
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,083
Let me stake you a...
roll of quarters,

398
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,881
we can still shine them
freebooters down at Jimmy's.

399
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:47,579
Come on.

400
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,850
Nah. I gotta go home.

401
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,114
Yeah.

402
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,506
Where you been?

403
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:16,647
Huh?

404
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,047
You first.

405
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,655
Where you been?
You been out drinking? Huh?

406
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:23,621
- Buster.
- Let me smell your breath.

407
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,624
- Buster, don't. Buster, don't.
- Did you really do that?

408
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,955
- Stop it.
- Let me smell your breath.

409
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,062
- Stop. Buster, stop.
- This is...

410
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,288
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stay out of it, Ida.

411
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,125
Stop.

412
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,256
- So... What're you doing!
- What's wrong with you?

413
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:33,095
What's wrong with you?

414
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm trying to keep you from making
an ass out of yourself.

415
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:39,499
Ida, he wrecked the car a week ago.
He shouldn't even been driving.

416
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,610
He's been delivering papers
so he could pay to fix the car.

417
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:44,473
He wanted to surprise you.

418
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,013
Yeah, well, how the hell
was I supposed to know?

419
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:51,516
I don't know, you tell me,
you're the cop.

420
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,484
Eddie. Eddie.

421
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,048
I'M IN TOWN.

422
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,054
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME HONEY,
I'M IN TOWN.

423
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,323
HANGIN' ROUN',
JUST WAITIN' FOR YOU.

424
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:12,765
CAN'T YOU SEE, YOU'RE THE ONE
AND ONLY BO Y FOR ME.

425
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:18,045
MM, YOU AND ME ARE.
UNINTELLIGIBLE.

426
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:23,846
Sweetest Delphine, your letter
of last week gives me such hope.

427
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,282
The way you speak
of your daughter gives me

428
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:30,619
a sense that there is love
in this world left for me.

429
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:33,491
No-no-no-no, too soft,
too soft.

430
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,186
And mention the kid's name,
mothers love that stuff.

431
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,922
It's the simple things.

432
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:41,033
I will arrive on March tenth
with my sister Martha.

433
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,101
Excellent.

434
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,330
She's the hottest
bitch you've ever seen,

435
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,441
and does me like a kitten.

436
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,140
That's for sure.

437
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:49,874
Mm.

438
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,308
You smell like a pimp.

439
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,880
That's the only way I can
get your scent off me, Kitty Cat.

440
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,209
Okay, okay, sign this.

441
00:23:57,052 --> 00:24:01,045
Yeah. Ray Martin.

442
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,687
Hey, hold on.

443
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:10,389
What?

444
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:11,793
Go get dressed.

445
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,161
What for?

446
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:16,101
Because I want you with me.

447
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,201
Really? Why?

448
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:22,209
Make sure I behave.

449
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:26,846
Besides,
I like it when you watch me work.

450
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,914
So feisty.

451
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,725
I've been trying to get your
ass street side for a year,

452
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,792
and you wanna chase this?

453
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:40,986
Yeah I do.

454
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,391
If it'd make you feel better,

455
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,658
I'll put a car on the house,
maybe they'II... come back.

456
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,857
They're not coming back.

457
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,798
Look Buster, you wanna get your ass

458
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,904
off the desk and get
back to work, that's great.

459
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,336
This thing,
it's just a heart break.

460
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,271
Robbie,
Motor Pool sent up your keys.

461
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,501
Say your car's as good as new.

462
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:56,838
Thanks.

463
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,415
Look, a girl don't rip herself up
like that for no reason.

464
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:11,356
With all due respect to your wife,
this case isn't fucking about her.

465
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:15,954
Let me tell you something, Mac.

466
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,793
You couldn't find a rattlesnake
in a fucking lunch bag.

467
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,259
This is a Ionely
hearts a mile away.

468
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,904
Get outta my way,
I'll make you look like a genius.

469
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,236
And don't ever mention
my wife again.

470
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:28,239
It's none
of your fucking business!

471
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,079
Fuckin' asshole.

472
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,485
Wounds are consistent
with self-infliction.

473
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:41,980
So, didn't we know that...
already?

474
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:43,819
She pregnant?

475
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:46,894
Very good, Detective.

476
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:48,723
Oh, Jesus Christ.

477
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:50,622
Think she knew?

478
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,993
Can't help you there.

479
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:54,293
Sure she did.
That was the hook.

480
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,501
She thought they were...
gonna be a family.

481
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,204
That's why she did it.

482
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,341
What're you gonna
do with her body?

483
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:03,704
No kin.

484
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,708
Probably send
it to the medical college.

485
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:07,815
They're always looking
for cadavers.

486
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:10,541
Call the Weiss Brothers
in Massapequa.

487
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:14,244
Tell 'em I'll take care of it.
They know me there.

488
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,520
You know that girl in there?

489
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,255
No.

490
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:24,365
Why you paying
for her funeral?

491
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,023
Well, you know, medical schools,
they saw 'em up.

492
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,225
You wanna see her sawed up?

493
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,068
Tell you the truth,
I don't give a shit.

494
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:30,034
Well you know,
maybe you should.

495
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,605
You got three daughters, right?
Think about it.

496
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,539
You dropping a month of paychecks
on a box ain't gonna change nothin'.

497
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,737
It's my paychecks.
Mine. Come on.

498
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,145
Hey, you okay?

499
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,074
I'm fine.

500
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,648
Really?

501
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,584
Really. Let's go.

502
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,922
Remember what you told me
when I made detective?

503
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:59,490
Huh? You said, do the job.
Make sure you go home.

504
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:02,501
Don't tell your wife nothing,
and keep the blood out here.

505
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:05,328
What do you think, you actually make...
a fucking difference out here?

506
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:07,301
I was kind of hoping we did.

507
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,774
We didn't make this fucking...
sewer, we just work in it.

508
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:11,936
You taken a good look
at these people?

509
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,569
Huh?

510
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,511
They're fucking animals,
what they do to each other.

511
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,441
You're not gonna change that.

512
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,115
You know,
all I got is the job. Okay?

513
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,688
That's a straight line.
I know that.

514
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,420
Uh, okay, you wanna do this,

515
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:28,390
this makes some kind
of sense to you, fine.

516
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:31,329
I'll back you up.
I owe you that.

517
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,391
But for both our sakes,
don't make it personal.

518
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:38,597
Do it right.
Act like a cop.

519
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,774
Ain't nothing out here
but bad road and trouble.

520
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,618
It's beautiful.

521
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:56,951
The woods... the silence.
No people.

522
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,324
People die in the damn woods.

523
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:03,595
And bears fuck there.

524
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,529
By the time Fernandez and Beck
left Patty Forsythe in the bathtub...

525
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,763
they'd already conned a dozen
Janes from Staten Island to Miami Beach.

526
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,807
Martha played the part
of Ray's spinster sister to a T.

527
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,777
Who's the
best you've ever had, hm?

528
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:18,879
Some sister.

529
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,820
Oh, shit! Shit, shit.
Martha, Martha stop.

530
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,356
It's the cop- it's the cops,
god damn it!

531
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,516
Stop.

532
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,427
Oh god! Oh god!

533
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,868
Oh, okay. Okay.
Okay, okay stop it.

534
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,733
Come here.
Come here. Come on.

535
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,977
Uh... shit. Shit.

536
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,914
License and registration.

537
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:03,319
I wasn't speeding.
Was I speeding?

538
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,221
You were all
over the place, Mister.

539
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,666
What the hell are you... doing?

540
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,500
Schooling you
a little, Raymond.

541
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:22,038
The car is stolen, Martha.

542
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,772
I changed the plates, but if
he checks the registration, Jesus!

543
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,313
I'II... take care of it.

544
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,708
What're you gonna do?

545
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,679
Explain it to him.

546
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,555
Wait. Wait. Stop.

547
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,884
See what you did?

548
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:42,726
Oh, my god.

549
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:46,324
Martha. Martha.

550
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:13,217
God.

551
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:20,924
Okay.

552
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,509
Nice.

553
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,454
Drive carefully.

554
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,496
Thanks.

555
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,538
Now...

556
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,876
who's the best you've ever had, hm?

557
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:08,241
You are.

558
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:10,510
Best that peach
fuzz ever had, too.

559
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,586
He shot off like a cap gun.

560
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:17,287
Don't ever forget who...
butters your bread, Raymond.

561
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,395
Don't you ever love them.

562
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,225
Who?

563
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,056
Any of them.

564
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,132
Don't even pretend.

565
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,595
Understood?

566
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:33,931
Yeah.

567
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,773
Let's go.

568
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:41,442
It's hot.

569
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,927
My god...
why would she do that?

570
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:55,759
I was hoping that you'd tell me.

571
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,731
She have any family?

572
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,703
Um, she lost a husband in the war.

573
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,667
What about...
this Raymond guy?

574
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,204
Ray Martin?

575
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:07,604
Ray Martin.

576
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:11,007
Run it.
How'd they meet?

577
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,076
Why don't you...
just ask him?

578
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:15,279
You got a number?
Address?

579
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,145
Oh my god, he doesn't know?

580
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:20,376
He's from Florida.
I mean that- that's all I know.

581
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:23,452
What was he like?
Is he a... good guy? Bad guy?

582
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:24,148
Raymond?

583
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,190
Yeah.

584
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:26,850
He's a sweetheart.

585
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:32,194
He's so... uh, handsome, you know.
He writes her letters and whatnot.

586
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,128
Poems, even.

587
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:34,927
Poems.

588
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,697
He uh...
never lets you pay for anything.

589
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,704
Loves to go dancing.

590
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:44,809
He took us all out
to the Rivoli Ballroom one time.

591
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,408
He can really cut it up.

592
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:52,049
Where'd you learn to dance like this?
You should be in shows or something.

593
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,120
Me and
Arthur Murray go way back.

594
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,517
The real Arthur Murray?

595
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:58,626
Sure. When we get back from
Florida you can ask him all about it.

596
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,851
Tell me about Florida again, Ray.

597
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:03,589
Can't be out of
this damn cold soon enough.

598
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,165
Tomorrow, sweetie,
on our drive down to the city,

599
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,791
I'll tell you about it as
many times as you want.

600
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:17,343
In the meantime,
I'm gonna fill up these glasses.

601
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:20,038
I can't stand
to see beauty go wanting.

602
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,223
Ray said you got
separated during the war.

603
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:35,258
Oh yeah. My mother took me
to Spain to her hometown,

604
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,023
when I was just a little girl.

605
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:39,732
Then the war came
and we couldn't get out.

606
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,424
What happened to Ray?

607
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,533
He didn't tell you?

608
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,697
What?

609
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:48,270
Don't tell him I told you,

610
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,472
but he worked for
the British Intelligence.

611
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,375
He fought fascists.

612
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:55,807
Like a secret agent?

613
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,814
You didn't hear it from me.

614
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:02,853
I tell you something, Martha.

615
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,118
Spy or no spy, that brother

616
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,752
of yours makes me feel
positively adolescent.

617
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,125
Oh honey, you've got
something on your teeth.

618
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:49,424
Let me ask you something.

619
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,365
What in the
fuck are we doing back here?

620
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:53,898
He's got a hunch.

621
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:57,004
He's got a hunch.
And this is uh, for what?

622
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:01,634
Extractions.
Need a confession, you pull a tooth.

623
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,001
Oh, okay.

624
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:06,879
Oh Christ, what's that stink?

625
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:08,311
Fucking rat.

626
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,776
This is a snipe hunt.
You know that, right?

627
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,615
Cupids Crossroads.

628
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,519
The club for Ionely
heart connections.

629
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,789
Have you ever passed someone
on a corner and wondered,

630
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,294
could that
be my immortal Capulet?

631
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:27,334
My irr- irr- irrevocable Montague?

632
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:30,028
At Cupids Crossroads,
no one escapes...

633
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:31,762
the raptures of love.

634
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,934
How 'bout
this Dream Catcher?

635
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:36,105
Mature female...

636
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:39,680
Ioves nightlife, cozy fires
and bubble baths for two.

637
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,140
Reach out and tell me your dreams.
Your future Mrs...

638
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,751
W-R-l-T-E.

639
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:46,581
Can have the pick of the litter,
Buster.

640
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:51,688
Casanova Cop and his naughty
nightstick seek receptacle for love.

641
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,483
Are you kidding?
Half of these dames, they...

642
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,027
keep their teeth in a jar.

643
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:57,027
They take dinner through
a god damn straw at night.

644
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,859
Not Patty Forsythe.

645
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,391
These dames really want a date...

646
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:02,365
they need to go straight
for the meat and potatoes.

647
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:03,231
Okay?

648
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:06,534
Wild female, she's rich, she likes
to cook, she likes to fuck.

649
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:08,971
Need a personal post office
just to bag the mail.

650
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,634
Well that's how I found your wife.

651
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:12,436
What?
I didn't- I'm sorry, I was far away.

652
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,512
I couldn't hear what the...
fuck you said.

653
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,172
Come here,
you motherfucker.

654
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:20,450
Very loving, older female
considered attractive,

655
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:23,523
and compassionate and ready
to enjoy life to the fullest...

656
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:28,254
Ioves ballroom dancing
and nights under the stars.

657
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:31,829
What d'ya got?

658
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,366
Mrs. Forsythe closed her
personal account five days ago.

659
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,629
She wrote a check
from this account

660
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:39,296
and they deposited
it into a joint account.

661
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,702
With Ray Martin?

662
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,432
That's right.

663
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:42,735
How much did she deposit?

664
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:46,276
Mr. Martin deposited, let's see,
forty-eight hundred seventy dollars.

665
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:48,905
Mrs. Forsythe transferred the
balance of her personal account...

666
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,109
six thousand six hundred
twenty-three dollars.

667
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,014
Six thousand?

668
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:53,552
For a combined...
total of eleven thousand,

669
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,282
four hundred and ninety-three
dollars in the... joint account.

670
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:59,018
And now... you're saying that
account is closed as well?

671
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,860
The next day
Mr. Martin withdrew the balance.

672
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:02,860
And that was a check?

673
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,555
No... cash.

674
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,563
Thank you.

675
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,479
So?

676
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,206
She had almost seven thousand.

677
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:25,346
Yeah, seven thousand dollars
at thirty-five bucks

678
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:27,249
a week is almost
four years pay.

679
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,616
Where'd she get that?

680
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:29,950
Figure it out.

681
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:32,185
What's the army death benefit pay,
ten grand?

682
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:33,088
Yeah, about.

683
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,286
Okay. Well her husband
died in forty-four.

684
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:38,887
She gets a part-time job,
lives off the death benefit.

685
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,433
That's the number.
That's what she had to steal.

686
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,968
Still, it ain't murder.

687
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,164
Not yet.

688
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:59,375
Well...
welcome home, Janette.

689
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:09,886
I know it's not much
to look at, darling.

690
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:11,555
It's one of my rentals.

691
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,096
It's just
for a couple of nights.

692
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:21,905
Look... we get our business out
of the way in the morning,

693
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,768
go to the church
in the afternoon,

694
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,706
we'll be on our honeymoon...
by Tuesday.

695
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:32,179
Is she coming with us?

696
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:34,144
Who, Martha?

697
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:36,917
She doesn't like me, Raymond.

698
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,553
Well how can you say that?
Martha likes everybody.

699
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:40,591
She's a nurse.

700
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,992
She didn't say a single thing to me,
the whole trip,

701
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,792
just glared at me
in the mirror.

702
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:52,495
Well, even if that were true,
it's none of our business, is it?

703
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,908
No it isn't.

704
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,343
You need a hand?

705
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,342
No, but I think the kitchen might.

706
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:00,844
I'll take... care of it.

707
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,075
She's alone Janette.
You're a beautiful woman.

708
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:11,447
You and me, we got each other.
She sees that.

709
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:14,627
It's difficult.

710
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,759
I hadn't thought
about it that way.

711
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,526
You want me to get her a hotel
for the night, I will. I will.

712
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,703
Or maybe you and
I should go to a hotel, huh?

713
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,110
That'd be fun.

714
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,142
I suppose I can take
it a while longer if she can.

715
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,876
Mm. That's a good girl.

716
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:48,425
Okay. We'll make it work.
No problems. Forget about her.

717
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:52,194
It's you and me, kid.
Come on, let's get in there.

718
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:56,166
Tea time.

719
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,300
Janette, lemon, honey?

720
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:05,935
Nothing. No thank you.

721
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,445
How 'bout you, Ray?

722
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,348
You want honey?

723
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:14,084
I wanted to surprise you.

724
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:18,655
That's wonderful.

725
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,282
Martha, find some tools.
We'll hang it up.

726
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:22,292
You're gonna... ruin him.

727
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:39,443
She's right, you know?
You're too good to me.

728
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,582
I'm- I'm cold.
I think I'll run a bath.

729
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:53,683
Why don't you give me a
few minutes and sneak in with me?

730
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:57,964
Okay.
I'll see ya soon.

731
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:12,208
Ray?

732
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:13,813
It's all right.

733
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,714
There, you do it.

734
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,184
What the hell is wrong with you?

735
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:19,484
Excuse me?

736
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:21,746
Are you trying to blow this?

737
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:23,284
What are you talking about?

738
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,017
You are driving her crazy.

739
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:29,788
Staring at her in the car.
God damn tea?

740
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,557
You want me to
send you to a hotel?

741
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:32,631
How dare you.

742
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:35,234
I've been so nice to that old cow.

743
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:38,167
And you two have been treating
me like the fucking maid.

744
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,068
I'm not gonna put up
with it, Ray.

745
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:42,206
We are getting out
of here right now.

746
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,935
We don't have the money,
Martha.

747
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:45,602
Ray.

748
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,808
It's alright, it's alright.
In a minute.

749
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,508
What... about that other girl,
the one from Michigan...

750
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,846
the one with the kid?

751
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:53,849
That's the real money.

752
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,081
We don't... need this whore.
Let's... leave right now.

753
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:58,282
Are you listening to
anything that I'm... saying?

754
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,017
Anything?

755
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:04,830
All of our cash, all of it,
is in her bank account.

756
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:09,430
Ray, I... don't care
about the money.

757
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,133
Look, sit down.
Sit down for a second.

758
00:43:14,908 --> 00:43:16,842
The checks clear
Monday morning.

759
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:18,205
Okay?
Monday morning.

760
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,812
- Baby.
- It'll be all over.

761
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:22,415
- Baby, I can't wait 'til Monday.
- I promise, it'll all be over.

762
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:23,875
Come on.

763
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,076
That's enough.

764
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:29,087
Please, let's just get out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

765
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:31,714
- You got such a fire, baby...
- Come on.

766
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,326
You put it out with this.

767
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,520
But I'm not leaving without my money.
Got it?

768
00:43:58,018 --> 00:43:59,246
You need any help?

769
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,852
Yeah. Keep that dog out of here.
There's glue all over.

770
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:07,484
Skip. Skipper. Skipper.
Skipper, come on. Come on, boy.

771
00:44:11,332 --> 00:44:14,733
Here uh, I got...

772
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,998
What's that?

773
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,637
Billy G's... paying me
a dollar and a half a week.

774
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:20,933
What for?

775
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,866
On account of he's got...
uh, football practice,

776
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,571
doesn't wanna lose
his paper route, so.

777
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,340
Why aren't you
playing football?

778
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:31,942
Gotta pitch papers.

779
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:36,449
Well it's gonna take a lot of papers to...
pay for that fender.

780
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,716
I know.

781
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:47,767
Why don't ya pick up a block...
help me. Go 'head.

782
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:51,902
Wipe it down with this.

783
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:03,775
Tell me you love me, baby.

784
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:06,910
I want to hear you say it.

785
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:09,851
Yeah, sure.

786
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,150
Say my name.

787
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:13,591
What are you talking about?

788
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:15,291
My name.

789
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,128
Say my name.

790
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,861
Come on. Janette.

791
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:26,802
Say I, I love you.

792
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,339
I love you Kitty Cat.

793
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,639
I do. Come on.

794
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:39,375
Oo!

795
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:42,119
Oh my god.

796
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:43,953
Oh...

797
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:45,217
Jesus Christ!

798
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,917
You trying to drive...
me crazy?

799
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:49,391
Do you enjoy...
playing with my heart like this, huh?

800
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,656
Hurting me like this?

801
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:53,824
No... baby, no.
I was just working.

802
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:57,535
Son of a bitch!
You called... her my name!

803
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,002
You called her fucking...

804
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:00,538
- No-no-no-no.
- My...

805
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,800
No.

806
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:02,966
I... heard you.

807
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,510
My eyes...
were closed, Kitty Cat.

808
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,775
I was with you.
Don't you see?

809
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:10,247
The only way
I could do it was to see you.

810
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,114
I'm always with... you.

811
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,123
I'm always with you.
I'm always...

812
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:20,953
Yeah. Mm-hm.

813
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:22,718
I love you, Ray.

814
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:32,299
Oh, yeah.

815
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:37,038
Mm, Kitty Cat.

816
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:39,144
No, no baby, no.

817
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,947
No-no-no,
wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.

818
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,844
Wait.
Don't stop, Kitty Cat.

819
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:45,008
- No let me...
- Don't stop.

820
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:46,516
No.

821
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,255
Close your eyes now.

822
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,518
And finish yourself.

823
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:55,517
I want to see you see me.

824
00:46:56,263 --> 00:47:01,599
And Raymond...
if you're lying, I'll know.

825
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,070
I'll see your heart.

826
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:18,778
Baby. Close your eyes.

827
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:35,328
Oh, god Martha,
you made such a mess.

828
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,301
Oh, Martha.

829
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,614
Rene.
What're you doin' here?

830
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,284
You shouldn't be here.

831
00:47:55,422 --> 00:48:01,361
No. No.
You never answer your phone, and...

832
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:03,823
I try to get you, you show...
up in the middle of the night.

833
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:04,862
- Oh...
- And when something happens,

834
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:06,124
I don't know how to get a hold...
of you.

835
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:06,994
What happened?

836
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,158
My father.

837
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,326
What?

838
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,834
My dad died.

839
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,232
I just need you to hold me.

840
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,071
I found him in the kitchen.

841
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:22,171
My daddy.

842
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,512
Come on, let's- let's...
go inside.

843
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:28,783
Where is he now?

844
00:48:29,923 --> 00:48:31,185
Dad.

845
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:33,091
Eddie, don't.

846
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:36,954
Eddie.

847
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:39,660
Eddie.

848
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:56,014
You're gonna break it.

849
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,609
Well she don't fit.

850
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,745
I'll make her fit.

851
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,120
The bitch won't die.

852
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,540
Why'd she do it?

853
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,116
Was it because...
of that woman?

854
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:33,344
No.

855
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,555
Though I can't say at the time
I didn't think about it.

856
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,719
Well I guess
you got what you wanted.

857
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:41,093
You...
have no idea what I want.

858
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,093
Then why don't you...
explain it to me.

859
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:48,731
'Cause you can't.

860
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,019
Holster your weapons.

861
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,296
You're... gonna love this.

862
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,799
Missing Persons blotter.

863
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:22,867
Lady says
her mother disappeared

864
00:50:23,003 --> 00:50:24,368
three days ago
with two characters that...

865
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:26,131
sound like our friends
from Wantaugh.

866
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:28,101
Off to Florida.

867
00:50:28,308 --> 00:50:29,673
Cleared out her bank account.

868
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,002
Ray Martin?

869
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:34,211
It's gotta be.
It's also gotta be an alias.

870
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:40,679
Coffee?

871
00:50:41,054 --> 00:50:43,045
No, no-no, after.

872
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:54,131
We need to talk.

873
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,333
About what?

874
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,032
About us.

875
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,903
I think about the future,
Raymond.

876
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:04,171
Planning...
the future, huh?

877
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:06,935
See, there you go again.

878
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:10,879
There I go what? Hm?

879
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,911
I'm trying to talk about something
that's important to me,

880
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:17,148
something that means something.
And you get sarcastic.

881
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:22,052
Look, I'm tired.
Okay? I'm sorry.

882
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,058
What do you wanna talk about?
Come here.

883
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:31,798
Let's talk.

884
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:33,071
Don't laugh.

885
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:35,333
Mm... I promise.

886
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:40,879
I want a baby.

887
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:44,580
A baby?

888
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:46,982
I don't wanna be alone the...
rest of my life.

889
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,712
Babies don't leave.

890
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:53,888
I'd like that.

891
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:55,359
Don't bullshit me, Raymond.

892
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:56,985
No, I would...
like that.

893
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:05,803
You know, to have a boy, a son,

894
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,941
I could take the track,
ballgames or something.

895
00:52:11,978 --> 00:52:13,468
Or maybe a little girl,

896
00:52:14,147 --> 00:52:18,277
I could buy dresses for,
little shoes, dolls.

897
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:21,009
My own little princess
who calls me Daddy.

898
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,582
What's not to like?

899
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:30,360
You mean that?

900
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:31,759
Of course I mean it.

901
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:33,659
We'd... have to get
the hell outta here, though.

902
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,768
City's no place to raise a kid.

903
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:37,860
No. Too many creeps.

904
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:47,640
Yeah. Well Kitty Cat, we get our
business out of the way, we'll be set.

905
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:50,109
Get some money socked away,

906
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:53,452
get a place upriver,
Croton or Hastings.

907
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,983
We can do anything.
We can do whatever we want.

908
00:52:57,557 --> 00:52:59,957
I'll put a bun in the oven,
we'll be on our way.

909
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:02,756
What's the matter?
What did I say?

910
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:06,059
What did I do now?
What's the matter?

911
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:11,566
I'm crying because I'm happy.
