BUG: Now I lay me down to sleep,

00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,149
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

3
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,799
If I should die before I wake,

4
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:14,203
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

NEWSCASTER: Before tonight's murder,

6
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:16,356
there has been no clue...

7
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,125
...as to who this killer might be.

8
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,840
But now the Riverton Ripper
and the knife he uses...

9
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,785
...have been caught by a high-definition...

10
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:23,630
...security camera.

11
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,979
SARAH: Any day, now.
NEWSCASTER: Police say...

12
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,017
...that the killer is a Caucasian male...

13
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:28,268
...in his mid-to-late 30s.

14
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:29,915
It's too dark to see his face...

15
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,071
...but the quality of the image has allowed...

16
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:33,140
...forensic technicians...

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,624
...to zoom in and enhance it enough...

18
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:36,323
...to make out the word 'Vengeance'

19
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:39,093
etched on the blade
of the Ripper's weapon.

20
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:40,759
No one was in the area at the time...

21
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,616
SARAH: That's beautiful, Abel.

22
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,951
And Leah's going to love that house.

23
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:46,987
Shameless distraction device.

24
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,100
Come to bed.

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,005
The news is too scary
for me to watch alone.

26
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,204
Okay, Sarah, I'll be up soon.

27
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:53,699
NEWSCASTER: We consulted
local psychiatrist.

28
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,661
Dr. William Blake.

29
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,096
Oh, shit.

(GROANING)
NEWSCASTER:

31
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:58,298
Here's what he had to say.

32
00:01:58,398 --> 00:01:59,391
DR. BLAKE: The identity of...

33
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,133
...a killer of this sort...

34
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,747
...may well not even be known to himself.

35
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:04,619
He could be anywhere and anyone...

36
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,174
...leading a normal life,
so far as he knows,

37
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,787
and never dream for an instant that,

38
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,202
every so often,
he turns into a monster.

39
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,325
ABEL: What is this?

40
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,413
NEWSCASTER: Twenty-one-year-old.

WOMAN: Help me.

47
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,447
No.

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,937
(GASPING).

49
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,125
NEWSCASTER: The victim's funeral...

50
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:26,993
...will be held tomorrow at...

51
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,983
Dear God, tell me this is a dream.

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,983
ABEL (AS JAMES):
What's with the knife, Abel?

53
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,770
What's with the blood?
It's really crazy stuff.

54
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,340
It's not my knife, James.
I don't know what's with it.

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,280
(AS PENNY) I think someone...

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,775
...has broken in.

57
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,884
(AS BRAD) No one has broken in.

58
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:43,477
Come on, Penny.

59
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,124
FEMALE VOICE: Please, Abel.
Blake said it could happen.

60
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,394
A one in a million chance, he said.

61
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:48,865
(AS PENNY) What if it did?

62
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:51,175
He said to call him, 24/7.

63
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:52,639
(AS BRAD) Abel, listen.
Call him now. You've...

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,353
...got to call Dr. Blake.

65
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,278
(AS PENNY) Please put down the knife.

66
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:56,056
Call the doctor.

67
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,876
FEMALE VOICE: God will help you.

68
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:00,763
(AS RIPPER) Call Dr. Blake,

69
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:01,895
and I kill your family.

70
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:03,778
(GASPING).

71
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:06,662
Sorry, sorry,
I just need a hug.

72
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,620
That knife is so scary,
you know?

73
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:10,916
What knife?

74
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:14,174
SARAH: The Ripper's.
They've got it on tape.

75
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,869
RIPPER: Don't do something...

76
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:16,643
...stupid, Abel.

77
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:17,722
Here's the deal.

78
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,752
Just look the other way when I kill and...

79
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,582
...your family stays alive.

80
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,269
Turn me in,
and you'll live alone...

81
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:26,987
...in a house of blood.

...(PHONE RINGING).

84
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:33,606
Hello?

85
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,544
Abel, this is Dr. Blake.
Is everything okay?

86
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,665
No, no, no.
Everything is not okay.

87
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:38,865
I found something.

88
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,400
What did you find?

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,614
A knife.

90
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:45,121
Under my bench.
And not just any knife.

91
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,089
The one on TV.
The Ripper's knife.

92
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,322
I swear before God,
Dr. Blake, I didn't know.

93
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:50,484
But the second that I went to call you...

94
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:51,178
...there was somebody,

95
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:53,860
and he said don't call you, or else...

96
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
DR. BLAKE: Or else?

97
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:57,265
What?

98
00:03:57,365 --> 00:04:00,899
Or else he would kill Sarah. And Leah.

99
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:02,101
And the others, too.

100
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,109
Abel, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

101
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,592
I want you to tell Sarah...

102
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,308
...to take Leah,
and drive to her sister's.

103
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:10,645
I haven't told her about this part of my life.

104
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:12,210
But you swore to me you would.

105
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,277
That's part of the agreement.

106
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,913
Just get here before it's too late.

107
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:18,388
DR. BLAKE: Abel, have Sarah
drive to May's house,

108
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,139
with Leah.

109
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,523
May is working nights
and Sarah is sound asleep.

110
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:22,891
I can't just wake her up.

111
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,489
DR. BLAKE: You have to.

112
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,428
Abel?

113
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,195
You there?

114
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:30,295
Abel?

115
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,087

116
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,659
ABEL: No. No.

117
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,639
DR. BLAKE: What the hell
are you looking at?

118
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:49,369
Break the door down.

119
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:50,752
ABEL: I won't let you do this. I won't.

120
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,018
DR. BLAKE: Open the door. Abel.

121
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,473
ABEL: I won't...

122
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,573
DR. BLAKE: Abel.

Check him.

BOBBY: No pulse, Frank.
What's your name, huh?

139
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:23,996
BOBBY: I'll check the woman.
No, no, no, no,

140
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:24,404
look at me.

141

You're okay, all right?
You're okay.

142
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:29,265
Get away from me.

00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:32,562
Bobby.
Yeah?

144
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:33,861
Get her downstairs.

145
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:35,961

146
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:37,617
here we go.

147
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:40,333
I got you.
You're going to be fine.

148

Cover us.

149

PATERSON: He's dead.

150
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:45,292
So is Elvis.
You never know.

151
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:46,405
You have an epi?

152

We got it.

He's not a monster.

164

What do you call him, then?

165
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,329
I call him mentally ill.

166

(AS ABEL) Thank you for stopping me.

167
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,396
Abel.

168
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,496
Forgive me.

169
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,500
He's talking to you.

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Please.

171
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:31,671
Would it hurt you to be human?

172
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,771
Just once?

173
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,659
We'll let God sort it out.

174
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
Thank you.

175
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:43,429
(SCREAMING).

176
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,765
No, Abel.

177
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:46,736
Abel, talk to me.

178
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:49,216
(AS RIPPER) Abel's not here.

179
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,109
This is for you, you cunt.

180
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,209
(GUNSHOT).

181
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,210
That's for shut the fuck up.

182
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:08,287
How's Mrs. King doing?

183
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,522
Baby is two months premature.

184
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,291
Dr. Carrie says he's blind, too.

185
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,262
Seven births in one hour,
all premature.

186
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:15,248
What's going on here?
Anarchy.

187
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,327
MAY: What else you got?

188
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:19,335
We got a cop, Frank Paterson,
who took two in the vest.

189
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,202
And?
And we got a perp.

190
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:22,738
Go on.
Mid-30s,

191
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,190
white male, under constraint...

192
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,215
...and critical.

193
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:29,227
Took multiple gunshots and stab wounds.

194
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:29,896
EEG flat.

195
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,442
Oh, and are you ready for this?

196
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:32,699
We think he's the Ripper.

197
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,216
What?
Family guy.

198
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:35,935
Killed the wife,
tried to kill his kid.

199
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,237
You got a name?

200
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:39,337
Plenkov. Abel Plenkov.

201
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,841
GUS: May, you copy?

202
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,812
May?

203
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,061
He said he'd get them all next time.

204
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,949
What do you think he meant?

205
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,110
Maybe he was talking about his other...

206
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,919
...personalities.

207
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,735
My family is from Haiti.

208
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,070
And down there they don't say...

209
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,608
...that someone like him
has multiple personalities.

210
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,593
What do they say he has?

211
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:02,693
Multiple souls.

212
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:04,164
What's the difference?

213
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:07,082
Personalities die when the patient dies.

214
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:09,182
Souls live on.

215
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,748
It's all just superstition,
I suppose.

216
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,111
Could you hand me my jacket, please?

217
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:20,421
It's cold as hell in here.

218
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,949
Thanks.

219
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,495

I can't believe you fucking guys.

227
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:54,596
You're supposed to be watching him.

228
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:55,771
You all right?
You good?

229
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:56,282
Fuck you.

As you all know,

Ripper Day marks two things.

247
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:09,469
One of them bad,
one of them good.

248
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:12,158
The good part is,
it's the birthday...

249

...of seven of us here...

Where you been?
Sleeping.

261

It's okay, Bug takes a little longer...

Now, it's time for the bad part, people.

276
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,932
We of the Riverton Seven...

277
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:12,986
...have had to share our birthday
with a monster,

278
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,336
the serial killer Abel Plenkov,

279
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:18,625
who died at midnight
the day we were born.

280
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,739
It's the Ripper.
CROWD: Ooh.

281
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,510
Legend has it that we,
the Riverton Seven,

282
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,679
are the mirrors of Abel Plenkov's...

283
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:26,599
...personalities.

284
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,516
The ones that turned the Ripper in.

285
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,919
And that the Ripper still wants revenge.

286
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,059
So Abel Plenkov is dead,

287
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,975
but his ghost isn't.

288
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:39,389
No, it lurks underneath
the old railroad bridge.

289
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:40,513
You've seen it.

290
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:42,160
It sleeps in the river.

291
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,684
It roams the darkest corners of the woods...

292
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,191
...just waiting for the next Ripper Day...

293
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,321
...to come around.

294
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:52,076
Because, on that day,
our birthday, tonight,

295
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,906
the devil has told him
that he can take his revenge.

296
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,179
But he can only come out of the river...

297
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,227
...at this spot.

298
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,313
And every year,
since we have been able,

299
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:05,872
one of us Riverton Seven has volunteered...

300
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:08,274
...to drive him back into the river...

301
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:09,724
...where he belongs.

302
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:12,204
And tonight is no exception.

303
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:16,195
And I, personally,
have chosen to volunteer...

304
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:17,598
GIRL 1: Brandon?
GIRL 2: No.

305
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:19,298
...to volunteer Bug Hellerman, that is.

BRANDON: It's your turn, Bug.

00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,902
All the rest of us have done it.

309
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:27,026
We will now summon the Ripper
from the river.

310
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:31,121
If he appears yet again,
then Bug must slay him,

311
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:32,265
or we'll all die.

312
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,844
Can you do it, Bug?
Save us.

313
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:35,944
Let's call him up.

314
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,268
If you can hear me, Ripper,

315
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,507
make yourself known.

316
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,732

317
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:45,943

the coat, his whole outfit.

if he was still alive.

...he was just a ghost.

00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,023
No, he's dead.

403
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:59,691
No. Not necessarily.
They never found his body.

404
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,747
And nobody really knew him
or his wife very well.

this is fascinating.

497
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:07,793
Tell us some more.

498
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:08,973
DR. COOPER: They've been pulled back...

499
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:10,411
...from the brink of extinction a bit.

500
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:11,745
They're hanging in there.

501
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:14,071
The California Condor
has always captured...

502
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:14,967
...the imagination.

503
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,452
A Native American
medicine man once said,

504
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:20,152
'It's true that the condor literally eats death.

505
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,074
'But the great bird is not sickened by this.

506
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:23,423
'No, it has a secret.

507
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:25,932
'It keeps the souls of all
the fallen creatures...

508
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:26,712
...it consumes.

509
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:29,028
'And they are its treasure and its protection.

510
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,094
'And with each soul it
takes in and shelters...

511
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:32,985
...it grows larger and wiser.

512
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,638
'Too large and wise to ever succumb...

513
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:36,722
...to death itself'.

514
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:37,970
RADIO HOST: Well,
we all know that...

515
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,859
...the California Condor was near extinction.

516
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,390
It's so nice to hear that they have...

517
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,461
...a fighting chance now.

518
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,358
DR. COOPER: Oh,
they are surviving with the...

519
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,564
...help of some terrific people.

520
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,852
And they have some
very interesting ways of...

521
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,268
...defending themselves, too.

522
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:50,648
RADIO HOST: Really?
Could you share...

523
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:51,237
...some of those?

524
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,802
DR. COOPER: Not on the radio.

525
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,615
PENELOPE: And please
watch over the missionaries,

526
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:57,643
our soldiers in foreign lands,

527
00:19:57,743 --> 00:20:02,157
the President, Mom and Dad,
and especially the seven...

528
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:04,257
...of us, this day.

529
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:08,775
Is this the year?
It feels like it.

530
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,740
I know you can't tell me,
but please keep Bug safe.

531
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,195
In Jesus' name, amen.

532
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,784
PENELOPE'S MOM:
Penelope. It's getting late.

533
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:25,884
I'm coming.

534
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,139
It's getting late.

535
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:34,741
Thank you.
Message received.

536
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,052
Crows, 10.
Snot-nosed kids, zip.

537
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,788
Hey.

538
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,103
Ass-wipe.

539
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:49,048
Get your little butt to school
before I put my boot up it.

540
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,860
Let's go. Now.

541
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:04,188
Can you step back a little bit, Quint?

542
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:07,433
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

543
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,747
Of course I trust you.

544
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:19,804
Don't trust anyone,
you dumb shit.

545
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,904
(LAUGHS).

546
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,079
Thanks, Quint.
Felt good.

547
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,179
Anytime.

548
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,402
(PHONE RINGING).

549
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,472
I know you want me, Brittany.

550
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:38,796
Speaking.
I've got today's...

551
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:39,645
...assignment, Brandon.

552
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:40,724
Got paper and pen?

553
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:42,495
Of course I do.

554
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,999
Bug Hellerman, three.

555
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,384
Bug?

556
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,498
Alex Dunkelman, eight.
I need it done this morning.

557
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,721
Alex gets an eight?

558
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,604
You have a problem with that?

559
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,718
No, it's just that it's pretty high on Fang's...

560
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:53,492
...punitive scale.

561
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:57,363
Usually, giving an eight
to the son of a felon...

562
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,347
...comes with a bonus, is all.

563
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:00,944
Don't say something stupid, Brandon.

564
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,735
Nothing big.

565
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,670
A blowjob would do.

566
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,588
How about I have my dog bite it off and...

567
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,375
...bury it in my backyard?

568
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,600
How big is your backyard?

569
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,924
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Good morning, Riverton.

570
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:17,061
It's hour 7 of Ripper Day 16.

571
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,898
And we're talking with Betty O'Neil,

572
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:21,089
mother of Riverton star quarterback,

573
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:22,021
Brandon O'Neil...

574
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:25,758
...and head of the group,
Citizens for a Saner Riverton.

575
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,575
Mrs. O'Neil,
why ban Ripper Day?

576
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:30,911
It's just kids having fun, isn't it?

577
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:32,745
BETTY: No, it's not kids having fun.

578
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,046
It's kids having nightmares,

579
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,585
seeing the Ripper everywhere. Kids...

580
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:37,749
...(SCREAMING).

581
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:41,473
Jumpy this morning, aren't we?
Where is the sock puppet?

582
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:42,653
Where did you come from?

583
00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:43,754
Your window, where else?

584
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:45,126
WOMAN ON RADIO: ls Brandon damaged,

585
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:45,611
do you think?

586
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:47,393
BETTY: Of course Brandon isn't...

587
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:48,526
What the fuck is that?

588
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:49,694
Sock puppet.

589
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:51,430
On steroids?

590
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,334
Kind of.
Kind of?

591
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:55,134
Only you wear it this time.

592
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:57,268
What? Excuse me?

593
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:00,428
BUG: Like Jay said,
'Shock and awe.'

594
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,264
Thought Edgar was a home crow.

595
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:06,444
Raven.

596
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:08,132
He's a guard.
He watches over you,

597
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:08,701
you know?

598
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,152
You're still spooked by last night, right?

599
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:12,430
We were all watching
the river and he came...

600
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:12,938
...from the woods.

601
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,085
That's scary.

602
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:18,243
Now, that's Jay's whole thing.
Never do what they expect.

603
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:21,195
And now we got Edgar up there
to keep him away. So...

604
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:24,617
You can have him if you want, after tonight.

605
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,365
Edgar.
Seriously?

606
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:28,302
Yeah. It's your birthday.

607
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:30,434
Well, thanks.

608
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,940
I should get you a present.

609
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,612
How about a weekend in Las Vegas with.

610
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,128
Brittany Cunningham?

611
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:37,376
Brittany doesn't know I'm alive.

612
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:38,431
She's gonna, after two days...

613
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:39,031
...and two nights...

614
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:41,679
...of star-studded shows
and high-stakes gambling.

615
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,151
Oh, yeah.

616
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:46,071
Or I could just help you with that.

617
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,388
Yeah, that's just as good.

618
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:49,520
It's heavy.

619
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,026
It's all the fluids.

620
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:52,291
Fluids?

621
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,036
PENELOPE: The Lord is my shepherd.

622
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:54,780
I shall not want.

623
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,927
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

624
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:59,029
He restoreth my soul.

625
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:00,971
Yea, though I walk through the valley...

626
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,221
...of the shadow of death,

627
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,957
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

628

Thou anointest my head with oil.

My cup runneth over.

630

Yeah, it's great.
Thanks, Mom.

641
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,169
I scotch-taped your number to it.

Happy birthday, Bug.

I love you.

Love you, too.

How do...
Do I close it?

646
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,644
Hit the red button.
Boom, done.

647
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:04,128
Small.

648
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:05,330
That bad?

649
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,734
No, that's good.

ALEX: Catch you later, Jerome.

654
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,169
What did I do now?
See you, Jerome.

655
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:14,660
It's what you're not going to do,

656
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,374
which is hang out with them.

657
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,130
Why not?

658
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,232
It's bad luck,
is 'why not'.

659
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:21,480
Especially on Ripper Day.

660
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,887
You should totally come some year, Fang.

661
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:24,570
It was wild.

662
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,588
Like, Brandon set Bug up
to fight the monster,

663
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:28,719
which was huge, by the way.

664
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,287
And Bug, he was so scared.

665
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:34,470
Brandon didn't set Bug up. I did.

666
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,763
Do you know how to
steam open an envelope...

667
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:38,064
...so it doesn't show?

668
00:25:38,164 --> 00:25:39,365
Put it in the freezer for an hour.

669
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:42,695
It opens itself and reseals perfectly.

670
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,289
This is to Bug.

671
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,491
Oh, really?

672
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:50,827
Here they come.

673
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,799
Hold up, boys.
What do you got there?

674
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,615
Happy birthday, insect.

675
00:25:55,715 --> 00:25:56,916
(DIALING).

676
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:58,737
Clueless as usual.

677
00:25:58,837 --> 00:25:59,938
Go.

678
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:02,802
Mr. Kaiser,
sixth period biology.

679
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,924
It'll be there.

680
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,259
Thanks, Jose.

681
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,892
So, you want to come over tonight?

682
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:10,832
We could burn the house down
with my stepfather in it.

683
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:13,227
(SARCASTICALLY) Ha, ha, ha.

684
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:14,230
He give you anything for your birthday?

685
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,330
Yeah, a hematoma.

686
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,521
Made it himself, too.

687
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,137
Oh.

688
00:26:20,237 --> 00:26:22,988
Behold, Bug,
what light in yonder...

689
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:25,088
...window breaks.

690
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:28,516
She is so beautiful.

691
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:30,616
She's hot for you, too.

692
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,219
You should go over there and talk to her.

693
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,885
Excuse me, Officer Ramirez.

694
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:36,520
Maria told me you know all about baseball.

695
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,655
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-oh.

696
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:38,857
RAMIREZ: What do you want to know?

697
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:41,082
Distraction maneuver.
Run.

698
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,679
Bug. This is a three.

699
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,599
Dunkelman, this is an eight.

700
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:49,699
(GRUNTS).

701
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:52,106
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

702
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:53,525
Dunkelman,

703
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,139
stay away from the Fang Zone.

704
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,874
And you,
you stay away from him.

705
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,201
ALEX: Thanks, Brandon.

706
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:03,635
Felt good.

707
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,119
BRANDON: Ass-wipe.

708
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:09,469
Not as good as your mother
felt last night, though.

709
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:12,060
Just bought yourself a 20.

710
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Brandon O'Neil.

711
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,850
Do not bring the wrath
of Jehovah down upon you.

712
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,244
Your sins are already
a stench in the nostrils...

713
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:21,186
...of an angry God.

714
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:22,769
Like knocking up Melanie Pratt,

715
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:23,488
who's only 15...

716
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,506
...and the principal's daughter.

717
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:27,171
What? Melanie's pregnant?

718
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,143
She's in my prayer group. Duh.

719
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:30,476
What men will do to you in prison...

720
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,556
...is nothing compared
to what demons will...

721
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:33,398
...do to you in Hell.

722
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:36,235
On beds of fire.
Through all eternity.

723
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:38,370
I'm going to get you for this, Penelope.

724
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,474
If you do, God will get you, Brandon,

725
00:27:41,574 --> 00:27:43,342
and it won't be pretty.

726
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:46,502
When you least expect it, Dunkelman.

727
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:50,327
Hi, Bug.
Hi.

728
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:52,398
Happy birthday.
Thanks, Penelope.

729
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:53,218
Same to you.

730
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:54,486
Did you get my note?

731
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:55,666
Note?

732
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,138
I left it in your mailbox.

733
00:27:57,238 --> 00:27:59,238
No.

734
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:00,873
It doesn't matter.

735
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,661
What?

736
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,646
Pray for our souls, Bug.
He's coming.

737
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:05,708
Jesus?

738
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:07,808
We should be so lucky.

739
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,836
Don't forget me.

740
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:16,808
Rise up and gird your loins, Alex.

741
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,908
The end is near.

742
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,165
Why is Penelope always saying...

743
00:28:25,265 --> 00:28:26,018
...weird stuff like that?

744
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:27,535
Parallel universe, baby.

745
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:28,902
I don't understand her,
sometimes.

746
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:31,023
I mean, the way she said that.

747
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,670
(AS PENELOPE) Pray for our souls, Bug.

748
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,770
He's coming.

749
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,728
What if she meant the Ripper?

750
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:38,363
I'm scared.

751
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:40,179
We're 16, Bug.

752
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,829
Like it or not, we're men now.

753
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,914
I don't feel like a man.

754
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,616
No man does.
That's why you...

755
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:46,405
...got to fake it.

756
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,085
Fake being a man to be a man?

757
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,058
That's the way it works.
So, you can't run.

758
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:52,257
You have to face your fear like a man.

759
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,357
Even though I'm not a man?

760
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:54,626
Because you're not a man.

761
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:55,743
Listen, the better you fake it,

762
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:56,682
the better man you are.

763
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:58,734
Just fake it?
Well, fake it good.

764
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,393
Like, if you're scared,
act like you...

765
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:01,253
...don't give a shit.

766
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:04,028
Or if somebody hurts you,
say, 'Thank you very much.

767
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,090
That felt wonderful'.

768
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,205
Thanks, Brandon.
I can't raise my arm.

769
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:10,245
Feels good.
Yeah, there you go.

770
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:11,779
That all you got, Brandon?

771
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:14,445
I mean, I feel downright cheated.

772
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,977
I'm amazed that
you're getting this so quick.

773
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:17,869
It's tricky stuff.

774
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,184
I was faking that I did.

775
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:20,317
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING).

776
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,498
You were?
Completely.

777
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,626
Yeah, but you were faking it good.

778
00:29:24,726 --> 00:29:25,924
I was?

779
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:27,779
Abso-fucking-lutely.

780
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:30,684
You now have permission to shave.

781
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,217
MR. KAISER: As you know, class,

782
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:34,203
we're nearing the end of our reports...

783
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:35,287
...on living creatures.

784
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:38,481
Dogs, fish, honeybees.

785
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,734
We had an especially
nice one from Brittany.

786
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,228
Cunningham last session...

787
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:46,303
...on the butterflies of our state.

788
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,210
Today's presentation
will be by Adam Hellerman...

789
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,804
...and Alex Dunkelman.

790
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:54,904
Are you boys ready?

791
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,220
Boys?
ALEX: Bug, come on.

792
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,389
MR. KAISER: While we're young.

793
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:00,489
Get up.

794
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:04,954
I believe this is yours.

795
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:10,027
'Back from the Brink.' By Adam Hellerman...

796
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:10,989
...and Alex Dunkelman.

797
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,338
Dumbfuckelman.

798
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:14,004
Brandon.

799
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,550
Our subject today is about a bird.

800
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:22,334
You having another one
of your migraines, Adam?

801
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:24,116
Shock and awe.

802
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:26,216
Adam.

803
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,697
Our subject today is the largest bird...

804
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:31,076
...in North America.

805
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,758
Unchanged since the Pleistocene Epoch...

806
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:36,562
...and only recently
rescued from extinction.

807
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,775
I present to you.

808
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:41,903
Gymnogyps californianus.

809
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:43,235
Anus.

810
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:44,856
MR. KAISER: Brandon, second warning.

811
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:46,604
The California Condor.

812
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:47,940
(ALL GASPING).

813
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,194
Good Lord.

814
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:50,374
BUG: Are you ready?

815
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,778
Fly, now.

816
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:53,078
(ALL EXCLAIMING).

817
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:55,049
His wingspan...

818
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:57,149
...is 10 feet wide.

819
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:00,277
His body, more than four feet high.

820
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:03,888
He can weigh as much as 350 parrots.

821
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,393
As for soaring,

822
00:31:05,493 --> 00:31:07,727
he can glide effortlessly for days...

823
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:10,715
...until he finds his food,
which is carrion.

824
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:15,479
A dead, stinking body
crawling with maggots...

825
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,505
...is ice-cream to him.

826
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,124
MR. KAISER: Bug.

827
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,041
Just showmanship, Mr. Kaiser.

There something you're not telling me?

959
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,275
Well, Maria's dad was there.

960
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,165
I thought I told you to distract him with...

961

...the baseball stuff.

962
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:01,305
I did, but Penelope's
yelling got your father...

He's a lunatic, Brittany.

A brain-bomb waiting to go off.

977

His only real friend is Dunkelman,

and Dunkelman just uses
him as his monkey.

He's been in and out institutions...

...half his life.

981
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:36,157
Bug has killed people.

982
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,136
Killed people?
Monkey?

You're right.
He's pathetic.

Brandon's the one for you, Brit.

986
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,230
He's a diamond.

987
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,766
In the rough, I'll admit...

988
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:54,397
...but a diamond just the same.

989
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:58,182
By comparison,
Bug is a lump of coal.

990

Trust me on this.

991
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,359
Okay?

992
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,453
Okay, Fang.

993

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,688
Stop it.

996
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:19,193
Bug, say, 'Thanks, Fang,
that felt great.'

997
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:21,279
I'd be lying.
That's the point.

998
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,281
Thanks, Fang.
That felt great.

999
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:24,664
That felt fucking great.

1000
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:26,228
That's a bad word.

1001
00:38:26,328 --> 00:38:28,353
Be bad.
It makes things good.

1002
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:29,701
Everything's backwards with you.

1003
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:31,801
Just fake you're bad.

1004
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,585
Thanks, Fang.
That felt...

1005
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:40,446
...fucking great.
That felt fucking great.

1006
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,652
Good.
But you do have to do...

1007
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,400
...one more thing.

1008
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,013
I can't handle another fucking thing, okay?

1009
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,919
You've got to get your phone back.

1010
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,984
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not fucking kidding you.

1011
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:49,619
They're going to find it,
they're going to trace it...

1012
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,922
...they're going to call your mom.

1013
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:52,805
She's going to have to come in and get...

1014
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:54,212
...humiliated by Principal Pratt.

1015
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:55,358
No fucking way.

1016
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,993
Way. And enough with the 'fucks' now.

1017
00:38:57,093 --> 00:38:58,128
You say 'fuck'.

1018
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:01,628
You're not me, okay?
You're not me, okay?

1019
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:11,276
Stop it.
Stop it.

1020
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:13,376
Bug?
Bug?

1021

00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,835
BOTH: Boo.

1023
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,824
Cut it out.
Cut it out.

1024
00:39:27,924 --> 00:39:29,262
Bug. Bug.
Bug. Bug.

1025
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,362
Bug.
Bug.

1026
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:35,017
What just happened?

1027
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,153
Nothing.

1028
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:46,114
Do you think I'm a monkey, Alex?

1029
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,232
Have you killed people, Bug?

1030
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:50,372
Not that I can remember.

1031
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:55,215
Well, I can't remember
buying you bananas either.

1032
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
I'll be right back.

1033
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,917
(EXCLAIMING).

1034
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,366
ALEX: Keep it down in there.

1035
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:12,923
Bug? Where are you?

1036
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:16,635
What's taking you so long?

1037
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,895
Bug?

1038
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:25,334
Bug, someone's coming.

1039
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,921
BRITTANY: Alex,
what are you doing here?

1040
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:32,959
ALEX: Hi, Brittany. Brittany,
why are you going back...

1041
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:33,745
...into the bathroom?

1042
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,662
BRITTANY: I forgot my purse.
None of your business.

1043
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:37,762
ALEX: incoming.

1044
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:40,234
BRITTANY: Hello?
Please say...

1045
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:40,885
...this is a nightmare.

1046
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,346
Please say this is a nightmare.

1047
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:43,187
Anyone in there?

1048
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:45,346
Hello? Who locked this?

1049
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:49,391
(BOTH SCREAMING)...

1050
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:51,694
...(SIREN WAILING).

1051
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:12,131
He probably just fell in.
Accidents happen.

1052
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:13,730
If Jeanne-Baptiste is down there,

1053
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,019
we're not talking accident.

1054
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,004
I could fucking feel it coming.

1055
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:19,556
Yeah.
You couldn't feel shit.

1056
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,591
PATERSON: No, I could.

1057
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:25,541
Give me a minute, all right?

1058
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:32,568
JEANNE: Hey, Frank.
Hey.

1059
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,710
He's been dead at least 1 2 hours.

1060
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,945
What the hell hit him, Jeanne?

1061
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:43,680
Two miles of this,
for starters.

1062
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:46,582
Any knife wounds?

1063
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:49,553
Nothing obvious.
Could take an autopsy...

1064
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:50,788
...to know for sure.

1065
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,223
Come on.

1066
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:54,323
JEANNE: What? You're not
thinking what I think you're...

1067
00:41:54,423 --> 00:41:55,059
...thinking, are you?

1068
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,374
PATERSON: What are you thinking?

1069
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:58,109
Probably there was alcohol last night.

1070
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:00,098
Might have gotten tipsy on his way home.

1071
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:02,233
Kid's in my 1 2-step.
JEANNE: Sorry.

1072
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,718
Well, we'll know quick enough.

1073
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,477
The autopsy will tell us
if there's any alcohol...

1074
00:42:06,577 --> 00:42:07,238
...levels in the blood...

1075
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:09,803
...or any water in the lungs.

1076
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:13,726
And I'll check for a knife wound. I will.

1077
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,161
Sixteenth anniversary.

1078
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:17,814
One and six is seven.
We didn't let them...

1079
00:42:17,914 --> 00:42:18,583
...kill him last night,

1080
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,432
first time.

1081
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:21,997
And it was Bug's turn.

1082
00:42:22,097 --> 00:42:24,134
It's kind of funny.

1083
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:26,871
I get scientific in 16 years
and you go voodoo on me.

1084
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:28,670
What did your grandmother say?

1085
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,060
What?

1086
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,451
Did she tell you not to worry if somebody...

1087
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:31,229
...you thought was dead...

1088
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,879
...just might come back alive?

1089
00:42:33,974 --> 00:42:35,974
If he was evil enough?

1090
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:39,270
Call me when you know something, yeah?

1091
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,370
Okay.

1092
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:46,872
(STUDENTS CHATTERING).

1093
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,050

1094
00:42:55,147 --> 00:42:57,133
Turkey Vulture.
You find Jay?

1095
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:59,390
No, weird.
He always answers.

1096
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,792
I saw him.

1097
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,892
Where?

1098
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:07,698
In the boys' bathroom mirror.
He was in the river, I think.

1099
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:09,115
He tried to say something, but...

1100
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:13,953
Bug, it's best not to think
about your nightmares today.

1101
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:15,422
It wasn't a nightmare.

1102
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:17,222
Whatever it was.

1103
00:43:17,322 --> 00:43:20,578
Look, all seven of us are on edge today.

1104
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:23,881
Seeing the Ripper
in all sorts of weird places.

1105
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:25,750
It's like Brandon said,

the way the cookie crumbles.

1107
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:29,187
For us.

1108
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,287
Just for today.

1109
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,888
You're a condor.
You eat death for breakfast,

1110
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:36,894
remember that.

1111
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:38,162
Where you going?

1112
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:40,262
Call me after Pratt.

1113
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,166
Pervert.

1114
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,770
I'm sorry I screamed.

1115
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,739
I don't blame you.

1116
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,392
You should get out more, Bug.

1117
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:58,637
Shop. It's what I do when I'm scared.

1118
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:01,085
You're scared?

1119
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:03,469
Angry, is what I meant to say.

1120
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:04,567
GIRL 1: Stay safe.

1121

1122

Payback time.

00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,616
Think twice, jockstrap.

1124
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:19,164
You know what Fang
would do if she knew...

1125
00:44:19,264 --> 00:44:20,037
...you were moonlighting.

1126
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:21,150
Yeah, well, nobody's looking.

1127
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,751
But somebody's listening, Sasquatch.

1128
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:24,089
Think about it.

1129
00:44:24,189 --> 00:44:26,127
I tell Chandelle,
she tells Fang.

1130
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:27,821
We all know how Fang doesn't like you...

1131
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:28,679
...off your little leash.

1132
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:31,484
She'll mark you.
Put you in the river...

1133
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:33,284
...with concrete flippers.

1134
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:36,614
That's actually just peachy, you know.

1135
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:39,134
I'll let Ripper get you two.

1136
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:42,188
You know, Bug,
a lot of people have seen...

1137
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:43,227
...him already today.

1138
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:46,302
It's not even dark.
Must be scary...

1139
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:51,615
...living in a house
with no father to protect you.

1140
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:58,306
You know, I bet if you look up 'rectum'

1141
00:44:58,406 --> 00:44:59,010
in the dictionary...

1142
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,546
...they would have a
picture of Brandon there.

1143
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:04,097
You don't know fear, Bug.

1144
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:05,728
You puked on Brandon O'Neil.

1145
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,548
You're a hero of the revolution.

1146
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:11,569
Hey, Penelope.

1147
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:13,804
Hey, Jerome.
What was it this time?

1148
00:45:13,904 --> 00:45:16,460
You're wearing those squeaky shoes again.

1149
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,362
You can really hear that?

1150
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:20,462
Got to go. See you.

1151
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:23,065
See you.

1152
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:25,161
Hey.
Hey.

1153
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:31,000
So, I heard you're seeing Principal Pratt?

1154
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:34,143
In 15 minutes.

1155
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:37,496
They called my mom at work.
I'm doomed.

1156

She wants me to pray with her.

You want to come?

1162

I'll be with Father Pratt.

Right. Well,

Don't be.
It's a baby, not a bomb.

1232
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:18,967
It's not important.

1233
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:21,236
You can go now, Adam.

1234
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:23,787
And take your creature with you.

1235
00:49:23,887 --> 00:49:25,208

1236

1237
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,934
We'll speak at home, Bug.

Yes, Ripper Night.

1244
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:48,979
It's an outrage that it's lasted this long.

1245
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,080
And for a sensitive child like Adam,

1246
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,470
it can be especially dangerous.

1247
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,456
I was checking Adam's file
and it's remarkable,

1248

not so much for what's in it,
but for what's not.

Pardon?

1250
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:03,264
I've been a principal here for six months...

...and I can find no medical files for him,

1252

except his vaccination records, of course,

1253
00:50:10,165 --> 00:50:12,870
which are the one thing
he absolutely must have...

1254
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,273
...in order to attend school here.

1255
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:15,871
Bug has no medical issues, really.

1256
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,141
If he did, we'd have
no way of knowing, would we?

1257
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:19,830
I'm his mother, I would.
Well, that's right.

1258
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,613
You're a nurse at Riverton Community.

1260
00:50:24,347 --> 00:50:26,416
Uh-huh.
Are Adam's records there?

1261
00:50:26,516 --> 00:50:29,321
Adam has never been hospitalized.

1262
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:36,095
Has Adam ever been tested?
Neurologically, I mean.

1263
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:38,115
Neurologically?
Why would he be?

1264
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,666
Well, since I've been principal here,

1265
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:41,797
he's awakened twice
in study hall screaming.

1266
00:50:41,897 --> 00:50:44,102
He's got chronic migraines.
He's claustrophobic.

1267
00:50:44,202 --> 00:50:45,268
Claustrophobic?
Last year,

1268
00:50:45,368 --> 00:50:48,271
I was told, a friend put him in an empty...

1269
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:49,660
...locker just for fun...

1270
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,239
...and he was so hysterical
he had to be sent home.

1271
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,663
Brandon O'Neil is no friend.

1272
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,147
He's a bully who never gets...

1273
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:55,412
...more than slap on the wrist.

1274
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:59,082
I'm talking about Adam
here, Ms. Hellerman.

1275
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:01,287
He has serious issues.

1276
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:03,641
And today he terrorized a classroom...

1277
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,176
...with this monstrous bird that he built.

1278
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:07,511
It vomited on them.

1279
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,423
And worse,
he's obsessed with...

1280
00:51:09,523 --> 00:51:10,881
...this California buzzard.

1281
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:13,197
Not a hummingbird, not a robin,

1282
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:15,500
not an American eagle,
but a bird that eats...

1283
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,220
...dead things.

1284
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,704
California Condor.

1285
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:19,205
Whatever.
It eats dead things.

1286
00:51:19,305 --> 00:51:21,207
Native Americans considered it sacred.

1287
00:51:21,307 --> 00:51:24,143
It cleans the earth
to make room for new life.

1288
00:51:24,243 --> 00:51:27,498
Maybe they understood
something we don't.

1289
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:30,382
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

1290
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:33,032
Tomorrow, I am sending Adam...

1291
00:51:33,086 --> 00:51:36,052
...for psychological testing
to a state facility in Boston.

1292
00:51:36,152 --> 00:51:37,456
You what?
For Adam's safety...

1293
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:38,970
...and the safety of the normal students...

1294
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:39,543
...in this school.

1295
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:43,186
It is my responsibility,
and it is my legal...

1296
00:51:43,286 --> 00:51:45,149
...right to do so.

1297
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:47,064
(AS FANG) Brandon's the one for you, Brit.

1298
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:47,818
He's a diamond.

1299
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:50,553
A diamond in the rough,
I admit,

1300
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:52,756
but a diamond just the same.

1301
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:56,690
Compared to him,
Bug's a lump of coal.

1302
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:59,946
BRITTANY: I know.
Church in two hours.

1303
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:00,831
I'll be there.

1304
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:03,651
I'll be home in two shakes. Bye.

1305
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,083
Hey, Brittany.

1306
00:52:08,183 --> 00:52:09,286
(GASPING).

1307
00:52:09,386 --> 00:52:11,325
Training for the marathon, Brandon?

1308
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:14,727
Yeah. You know,
I got to keep in shape.

1309
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:16,229
You're in great shape.

1310
00:52:16,329 --> 00:52:19,146
You got time for that oral?

1311
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:22,835
You're like a crotch dog.

1312
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,004
You know, the kind that stick
their nose in your crotch...

1313
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:26,056
...when you're not looking?

1314
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:27,872
It's like a handshake, really.

1315
00:52:27,972 --> 00:52:29,775
My father had a crotch dog.

1316
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,941
Mom had it put out of its misery.

1317
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,530
Misery is what I'm talking about.

1318
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,401
Come on, Brittany,
I went the extra mile...

1319
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:36,100
...for you today.

1320
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,517
I could've gotten expelled for that eight.

1321
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:41,583
Plus, I got shit on twice.
Once by a Jesus freak,

1322
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:42,920
once by a fucking buzzard.

1323

1325

1326
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:48,889
This is my hobby.

1327
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:51,027
Besides, it's my birthday.

1328
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,661
It's all of our birthdays.

1329
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:55,865
I know, but I need it.
And I want it.

1330
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,337
It should make you feel special.

1331
00:52:57,437 --> 00:53:00,524
Come on. Fang thinks we're a good match.

1332
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:03,042
Fang doesn't run my private life.

1333
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:04,510
Does she know that?

1334
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,840
Because I could bring her up to speed.

1335
00:53:08,365 --> 00:53:10,365
You threatening me?

1336
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,801

It's spring.
I'm feeling romantic.

1343
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:28,934
I got a temper.

1475

...in institutions.

1477
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:29,282

1478
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:32,226
Have I?

1479
01:02:33,096 --> 01:02:35,096
Leah will say anything.

No, please.

1488

1495

I just do.

1496
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,898
Time for presents.

1497
01:03:41,998 --> 01:03:43,566
Well, this is a first.

1498

1499

Go to your room, now.
What did I do?

1506
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:28,009
Just go.
What?

1507
01:04:28,444 --> 01:04:30,654
No, leave that thing here.

1508
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:36,212
Leah gave it to me,
so I guess it's mine.

I'm sorry to hit you.

But you deserve it.

...(HANGS UP PHONE) to each other again.

1517

...if you just keep repeating the lies.

1521
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:13,634
Like, 'The Ripper's dead,
he's not coming back'.

1522
01:05:13,734 --> 01:05:15,510
Would it kill you to look at things...

1523
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,060
...positively just once, Leah?

1524
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,895
You're scared of being human.

1525
01:05:18,995 --> 01:05:20,964
You get your friends to do your dirty work.

1526
01:05:21,064 --> 01:05:22,380
You're still in high school at 19...

1527

...because you're too chicken-shit to get...

You hide behind what should be dead...

...and buried.

1531
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:31,525

1532
01:05:31,624 --> 01:05:33,624
And my mother?

1533
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,834
No, I did what I did to save Bug from...

1534
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:37,147
...what you've become.

1535
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:40,065

had more heart and courage...

you have had in your...

1542
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:04,467
Thanks, Leah.
That felt good.

1543
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:08,980
Why do you hate me?
I've never done...

1544
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,080
...anything to you.

1545
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,295
You've ruined my life.

1546
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:16,795
That's what you've done,

Why?

1550
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:28,543
I will tell you why, maggot.

1551
01:06:28,643 --> 01:06:30,448
From the moment you were born...

1552
01:06:30,548 --> 01:06:33,438
...everything went to shit for me.

1553
01:06:33,736 --> 01:06:35,384
You were the miracle baby,

1554
01:06:35,484 --> 01:06:38,119
and I was the painful reminder.

1555
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:41,322
You got to live in this dream...

1556
01:06:41,422 --> 01:06:44,992
...and I got stuck in a fucking nightmare.

1557
01:06:45,448 --> 01:06:48,906
I am sick to death of your innocence.

1558
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,652
It is an insult to me.

1559
01:06:54,657 --> 01:06:56,657
Why am I innocent?

1560
01:06:57,627 --> 01:07:01,358
You are so clueless,
it is stunning.

1561
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:06,934
Tell me.

1562
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,890
Do you know who your father was?

1563
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:13,092
May said that he loved us very much.

1564
01:07:13,192 --> 01:07:15,044
But who was he?

1565
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:16,779
I don't know.
He died in a car crash.

1566
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:18,229
On the way to the hospital to be with May...

1567
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:20,283
...when she was having you, right?

1568
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:21,497
Yeah.

1569
01:07:21,597 --> 01:07:24,382
What a sad,
yet beautiful story.

1570
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:28,176
Have you ever asked
yourself why May doesn't...

1571
01:07:28,276 --> 01:07:29,525
...ever talk about him?

1572
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,090
Or why there isn't a single fucking picture...

1573
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,696
...of him around the house?

1574
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:35,796
Maybe it's too painful.

Do you know who Abel Plenkov was?

1576

01:07:41,417 --> 01:07:43,417

01:11:44,981 --> 01:11:47,701
I'll go to church with you, May.

1647
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:51,562
But this is the last time.

1648
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:56,983
And I'm sorry,
but I had to tell him.

1649
01:11:57,078 --> 01:11:59,968
I'll get the car and be out front.

1650
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:03,864
Get Bug, okay?

1651
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:09,903
(KNOCKING ON DOOR).

1652
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:12,006
Bug.

1653
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:47,574
Leah?

1654
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,670
Ready?

1655
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:58,834
Fuck.

1656
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:00,934
(HONKING)...

1657
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:22,267

...(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE).

1659
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:35,958
I figured you'd come.

1660
01:13:36,058 --> 01:13:38,492
Really? Have you heard?

1661
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:42,008
I've heard.
I've heard a lot.

1662
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:43,544
Oh?

1663
01:13:43,644 --> 01:13:46,135
The Riverton Ripper,
Abel Plenkov?

1664
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:47,503
Yeah?

1665
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:49,603
He was my father.

1666
01:13:49,705 --> 01:13:50,988
(EXHALING).

1667
01:13:51,088 --> 01:13:53,906
That I know.

1668
01:13:55,177 --> 01:13:56,712
You do?

1669
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:58,961
The parents of all the seven know.

1670
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:00,932
I think I'm the only kid.

1671
01:14:01,032 --> 01:14:03,300
My mother told me the day she died.

1672
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,803
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1673
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,968
Sorry, we thought you were too...

1674
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,603
I don't know.

1675
01:14:08,703 --> 01:14:10,092
Innocent?

1676
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:12,192
I guess.

1677
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:14,291
Well, I'm not anymore.

1678
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:16,384
Yeah. I can see that.

1679
01:14:17,867 --> 01:14:19,867
Who beat you up?

1680
01:14:20,336 --> 01:14:21,937
Fang.

1681
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:24,037
Figures.

1682
01:14:24,306 --> 01:14:25,775
Penelope sent me a letter.

1683
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,875
A love letter?
No.

1684
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:30,040
She wrote to warn me
that he'd be coming...

1685
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:30,680
...back for us.

1686
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,281
My father.

1687
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:33,683
She had a source.

1688
01:14:33,783 --> 01:14:36,513
Oh, yeah.
She say anything else?

1689
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:39,856
She said that there are two ways that...

1690
01:14:39,956 --> 01:14:41,956
...he can come from.

1691
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,458
One,

1692
01:14:44,627 --> 01:14:48,666
if he survived 16 years ago,
then he'll come back...

1693
01:14:48,766 --> 01:14:50,766
...as Abel Plenkov.

1694
01:14:52,168 --> 01:14:53,302
Dad.

1695
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:54,804
Option two?

1696
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:57,304
Option two is he did die...

1697
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:02,142
...and his soul...

1698
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:07,108
...went into one of the seven
kids who were born...

1699
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,184
...the night he died.

1700
01:15:08,284 --> 01:15:09,499
Hopped the nearest bus.

1701
01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:11,981
In this version,
he's one of us...

1702
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:13,522
...killing all the rest.

1703
01:15:13,622 --> 01:15:16,292
Attack from the unexpected direction.

1704
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:17,727
Yeah.

1705
01:15:17,827 --> 01:15:20,746
There's not many of us left
to be unexpected, though.

1706
01:15:20,846 --> 01:15:22,498
You, me and Jerome.

1707
01:15:22,598 --> 01:15:24,333
Jerome's not a very good candidate.

1708
01:15:24,433 --> 01:15:25,716
Mmm-mmm.

1709
01:15:25,816 --> 01:15:27,036
So, you or me.

1710
01:15:27,136 --> 01:15:28,938
That's option two.

1711
01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:31,923
(EXHALING) Well,
I like option one better.

1712
01:15:32,023 --> 01:15:33,324
Makes more sense.

1713
01:15:33,424 --> 01:15:36,901
The Ripper who was stabbed and shot...

1714
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:39,232
...had a little fender-bender,
ended up in the river,

1715
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:39,715
no biggie.

1716
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:43,167
He patched himself up
with stuff from the ambulance.

1717
01:15:43,267 --> 01:15:46,388
Survives on acorns
and crawfish for 16 years.

1718
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:47,968
So he just crawled out of the river...

1719
01:15:48,068 --> 01:15:49,859
...in a rotting overcoat to take his revenge.

1720
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:51,854
I'll just call the cops and tell them to keep...

1721
01:15:51,954 --> 01:15:52,394
...an eye out...

1722
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:55,299
...for the Unabomber's evil twin.

1723
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:57,698
Or not.

1724
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
What's that?

1725
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:03,472
The biggest knife I could find in the kitchen.

1726
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:05,572
Bug...

1727
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:08,075
What would you say...

1728
01:16:08,444 --> 01:16:12,181
...if I told you I was going to kill you, Alex?

1729
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,849
I'd say you weren't.

1730
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:14,996
Why not?

1731
01:16:15,096 --> 01:16:17,646
Because you're my best friend.

1732
01:16:18,387 --> 01:16:20,387
You're Bug.

1733
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:27,561
Now you ask me.

1734
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:36,255
You don't think I could kill somebody?

1735
01:16:36,355 --> 01:16:38,355
No.

1736
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:40,641
You'd be wrong, Bug.

1737
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,479
Dead wrong.

1738
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:45,548
You killed Penelope and Jay?

1739
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:46,749
And the others?

1740
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:48,849
(ALEX GRUNTING).

1741
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,718
Of course not.

1742
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:56,256
I killed my stepfather.

1743
01:16:59,094 --> 01:17:00,462
You killed Quint?

1744
01:17:00,562 --> 01:17:02,562
He was drunk.

1745
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:04,661
He hit me.

1746
01:17:05,034 --> 01:17:07,818
For the first time in my life,
I hit him back.

1747
01:17:07,918 --> 01:17:10,439
Fell down the steps
and broke his stupid neck.

1748
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:13,201
Alex, it's okay, okay?

1749
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,877
No, it's not okay.

1750
01:17:14,977 --> 01:17:16,239
What I did...
It's not okay...

1751
01:17:16,339 --> 01:17:17,046
...for everybody...

1752
01:17:17,146 --> 01:17:20,631
...to be killing each other all the time.

1753
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:30,646
You don't want something to drink?

1754
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:33,226
You got rat poison?

1755
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:37,053
No, we just ran out of rat poison.

1756
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:40,049
I'm going to go get you water.

01:20:09,118 --> 01:20:10,198

(SCREAMING) Son of a bitch.

1763
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:18,692
Drop the knife, Bug.

1764
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:20,927
Now.

1765
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,930
Kick it over to me.

1766
01:20:29,805 --> 01:20:31,874
I'm sorry, I thought
you were somebody else.

1767
01:20:31,974 --> 01:20:33,521
Get your hands up.

1768
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:34,824
Up.

1769
01:20:34,924 --> 01:20:36,924
Walk slow.

1770
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:42,432
Why are you pointing that at me?

1771
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:44,611
That is far enough.

1772
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:47,354
Why?

1773
01:20:47,452 --> 01:20:48,608
Your phone was found next to Brittany.

1774
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:49,324
Cunningham's body.

1775
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:50,842
It fell into her purse at school.

1776
01:20:50,942 --> 01:20:52,728
That was an accident.
You can ask my mom.

1777
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:56,398
Your mom is why I have to arrest you, Bug.

1778
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:02,471
Mom.

1779
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,571
Easy.

1780
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:08,435
Stay there.

1781
01:21:14,116 --> 01:21:15,451
I was there...

1782
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:19,376
...when they cut you
out of your mother, Bug.

1783

01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:41,174
I didn't.

1793
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:44,536
Hold out your hands, son.

How did you get away?

1818
01:24:51,178 --> 01:24:53,016
I was already in the car.

1819
01:24:53,116 --> 01:24:56,516
I came inside just to see where May was,

1820
01:24:56,615 --> 01:24:58,615
and I found her dead.

1821

I knew that fucker would come for us.

1822

He's gone, all right?

You're supposed...

...to be at the church.

1859
01:27:50,111 --> 01:27:52,592
Alex called me.
He said all three of us...

1860
01:27:52,692 --> 01:27:53,982
...should be together.

Watch each ether's backs.

1862
01:27:56,484 --> 01:27:57,699
I was halfway through the window...

1863
01:27:57,799 --> 01:28:00,103
...when the Ripper stabbed me.

1864
01:28:00,203 --> 01:28:01,167
How did he get up here?

1865
01:28:01,267 --> 01:28:04,175
He must have come up the rope like I did.

1866
01:28:04,275 --> 01:28:07,996
I passed out on the roof,
and then I came to...

1867
01:28:08,096 --> 01:28:11,241
...and I heard fighting.
Was that you?

1868
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,884
Him and me. Yeah, it was.
He was kicking my ass, too.

1869
01:28:14,984 --> 01:28:18,356
I tried calling the cops
but I knocked over something,

1870
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:19,919
and then I heard him coming for me,

1871
01:28:20,019 --> 01:28:21,910
so I ducked for the closet.

1872
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,489
You saved my life, Jerome.

1873
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:24,861
I did?

1874
01:28:24,961 --> 01:28:27,349
Yeah, he was going to kill me,
and then you distracted him.

1875
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:28,596
Good.

1876
01:28:28,696 --> 01:28:30,832

01:28:47,736 --> 01:28:49,371

1882
01:28:49,471 --> 01:28:51,471

01:29:20,168 --> 01:29:22,718

1885
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:26,212

01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:30,512
He's dead.

1887
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:32,612
The Ripper got him.

1888
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:34,865
A lot's happened since
you've been gone, Alex.

1889
01:29:34,965 --> 01:29:36,151
Where did you disappear to?

1890
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:38,169
I saw Paterson pulling up outside.

1891
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:39,670
I ran. I hid in the woods.

1892
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:41,172
Then I heard gunshots,
so I came back.

1893
01:29:41,272 --> 01:29:43,258
I was afraid he shot you or something.

1894
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:44,573
Where is he, anyway?

1895
01:29:44,673 --> 01:29:45,894
Downstairs. He's dead.

1896
01:29:45,994 --> 01:29:47,007
What?

1897
01:29:47,107 --> 01:29:49,997
What happened?
The Ripper happened.

1898
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:51,600
He killed Mom, too.

1901
01:29:57,005 --> 01:29:58,673
I can't believe this.

1902
01:29:58,773 --> 01:30:00,421
You went to get me a glass of water...

1903
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:04,771
...and now your mom, Paterson,
and Jerome are dead?

1904
01:30:05,814 --> 01:30:07,382
Where were you?

1905
01:30:07,482 --> 01:30:09,284
I ran into Penelope.

1906
01:30:09,384 --> 01:30:11,384
Penelope is dead, Bug.

1907
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:15,123
I saw her in the bathroom mirror.

1908
01:30:15,223 --> 01:30:19,813
She brought me Ripper's knife,
and she made me take it.

1909
01:30:26,668 --> 01:30:27,714
Then I heard something downstairs...

1910
01:30:27,814 --> 01:30:30,658
...and I went to come check on you,

1911
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:32,758
and you were gone.

1912
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:36,611
Paterson wasn't after you.
He was after me.

1913
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:39,463
He thought that I killed Brittany...

1914
01:30:39,563 --> 01:30:41,282
...and my Mom.

1915
01:30:41,382 --> 01:30:42,884
It was the Ripper.

1916
01:30:42,984 --> 01:30:45,364
And where is the Ripper now?

1917
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,534
I guess he got away out my window.

1918
01:30:47,634 --> 01:30:50,779
Or went out Leah's.
Hers is open, too.

1919
01:30:50,874 --> 01:30:52,794
And he tried to stab me to death with his...

1920
01:30:52,894 --> 01:30:54,062
Stab you with what?

1921
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:56,998
With his knife.
I thought you had his knife.

1922
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:58,366
I did, but...

1923
01:30:58,466 --> 01:31:00,466
Did you kill them, Bug?

1924
01:31:00,568 --> 01:31:01,736
What?

1925
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:03,238
No, I...

1926
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:05,338
I didn't kill anybody.

1927
01:31:05,432 --> 01:31:07,432
Not that you remember.

1928
01:31:09,978 --> 01:31:12,080
Bug, I got to tell you something.

1929
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,760
And don't get upset.

1930
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,083
What?

1931
01:31:15,183 --> 01:31:17,276
My mom told me this.

1932
01:31:17,452 --> 01:31:18,532
Your father...

1933
01:31:18,632 --> 01:31:21,108
...was first diagnosed with schizophrenia...

1934
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:22,190
...when he was 16.

1935
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:23,404
Just like you are now.

It's hereditary.
Plus, you were in your...

...dead Mom forever.

1939
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:30,013
Oxygen deprivation.

1940
01:31:30,113 --> 01:31:32,033
It can make you crazy, too.

1941
01:31:32,133 --> 01:31:33,983
Maybe all this stuff
you've been describing...

1942
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:37,405
...didn't happen exactly
the way you're saying it did.

1943
01:31:37,505 --> 01:31:38,619
You think I'm crazy?

1944
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,456
No, I don't know what I think.

1945
01:31:40,556 --> 01:31:41,998
But I'm not walking away.
I've stuck by you...

1946
01:31:42,098 --> 01:31:42,744
...through everything.

1947
01:31:42,844 --> 01:31:44,029

1950
01:31:46,356 --> 01:31:47,048
...a ticking time bomb.

1951
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:50,123
So, if you're not innocent anymore,

1952
01:31:50,223 --> 01:31:51,098
that's okay.

1953
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:53,144
I mean, I killed my stepfather tonight.

1954
01:31:53,244 --> 01:31:54,255
I'm no angel, either.

I'm not innocent anymore, Alex.

1957
01:32:06,501 --> 01:32:09,117
Not with all of them inside me now.

1958
01:32:09,217 --> 01:32:11,217
What?

1959
01:32:12,674 --> 01:32:14,075
With who inside you?

1960
01:32:14,175 --> 01:32:16,478
The rest of the Riverton Seven.

1961
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:18,346
Even Jerome.

1962
01:32:18,446 --> 01:32:21,166
All their souls are with me now.

1963
01:32:24,752 --> 01:32:28,003
Bug, maybe you should sit down
and take a few deep breaths.

1964
01:32:28,103 --> 01:32:29,424
You think I'm crazy?

1965
01:32:29,524 --> 01:32:32,026
I'm actually a lot smarter
than I was yesterday.

1966
01:32:32,126 --> 01:32:34,336
Let me ask you a question.

1967
01:32:38,066 --> 01:32:39,613
Why is there blood on your left ear?

1968
01:32:39,713 --> 01:32:41,269

1969
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:43,238
The top.

1971
01:32:44,451 --> 01:32:46,451
Hey.

1972
01:32:47,742 --> 01:32:50,478
Almost like you were hit
with a vase or something.

1973
01:32:50,578 --> 01:32:51,759
Brandon told me to look for that.

1974
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:54,130
Bug, you are officially bat-shit nuts.

1975
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:55,897

...when I was in the bathroom
getting you water,

1986

...and kill Paterson.

1988

And you got it from your father.

2008

Maybe you have been in institutions.

...buried along with your
stupid condor outfit.

2015

...and then ran away like cowards.

Jumped into the first babies
you could hide in.

2024

So I saved you for last.

2025

There was no Ripper.

Just one of the Riverton Seven...

2036

...that was a little crazy,
dressed up like the Ripper,

2037

killed your mom, and Paterson,
and four of his birth-mates...

...before we finally stopped him.

2039
01:35:11,098 --> 01:35:12,233
One of the Riverton Seven?

2040
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:15,290
The one of the seven with the bad soul.

came from a totally...
