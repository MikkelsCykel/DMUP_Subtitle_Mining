1
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,124
Your friend is late.

2
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,193
He'll be here.

3
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,924
Oh, yeah?
I do have other bidders.

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,264
I personally vouch for this man.

5
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,032
Oh, well,
I trust you, Michael, but...

6
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,040
you see, with each degree
of separation...

7
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,408
comes a degree of uncertainty.

8
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,818
Mr. Turner.

9
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,755
Mr. Vas.

10
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,727
The KGB once tried
to set me up...

11
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,826
so I had to kill
three of their agents...

12
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,429
and then I hunted down
their families.

13
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,503
The point is, if I sense
anything out of the ordinary...

14
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,570
No, the point is, I haven't seen
anything from you yet...

15
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,208
to justify a payment
of $20 million.

16
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,583
So, before I hand over
a small fortune...

17
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,680
and risk my life,
I want to know 100%...

18
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,987
that you can, in fact,
deliver the device.

19
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,720
That's the point.

20
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,058
Very well.

21
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:23,000
Michelle... owner's manual.

22
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,863
This is your show of good faith?

23
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,204
Well, you're still alive.

24
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,473
You consider that
a show of good faith.

25
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:38,779
- What do you have for me?
- Down payment... $1 million.

26
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,719
So, when do I get the device?

27
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,882
Let's say ten days.

28
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,352
Michael,
you take that telephone...

29
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,898
and I will call you
and tell you how to proceed.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,230
You keep it on you all the time.

31
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,533
As for you, sir,
the next time we meet...

32
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,667
I suggest you be on time.

33
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,814
Nice coat.

34
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,092
Well done.

35
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,097
See you around.

36
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,560
- So far, so good?
- Yeah, so far.

37
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,447
- Kevin's got a tail.
- Is it Vas?

38
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,888
They don't look Russian,
but they don't look friendly.

39
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,925
We'd better go back for him.

40
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,427
You ordered us not
to jeopardize our cover, sir.

41
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,826
Hey, turn left.

42
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,832
Turn left!

43
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,568
Kill him!

44
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,273
- Ambush on the castle steps.
- Come on, faster...

45
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,011
Let's go!

46
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,685
Get down! Get down!

47
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,318
There he is! Pull over!

48
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,658
You're jeopardizing the mission.

49
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,285
Uhh!

50
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,521
You are the mission.

51
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,491
Uhh!

52
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,675
God, that was close.
Did you see who they were?

53
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,881
Kevin?

54
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,597
Doesn't this all smack
of extreme desperation?

55
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,496
A nuclear bomb that fits neatly
into a carry-on suitcase?

56
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,934
Kevin spends two years
getting close to these people...

57
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,630
in order to position you
as the buyer.

58
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,036
Vas won't deal
with anyone else...

59
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,937
and we have nine days
to make this work.

60
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,135
I'd say desperation
was the order of the day.

61
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,872
Maybe Vas set Kevin up.

62
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,914
My guess is,
it's a rival buyer.

63
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,075
Could be Pakistanis,
Chechnyans, North Koreans.

64
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,676
- Libyans.
- Try the entire Middle East.

65
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,244
Adrik Vas is a businessman.
He'll take anyone's money.

66
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,689
Why kill Kevin
if they could just outbid him?

67
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,386
We have deeper pockets.
He priced them out of the game.

68
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,430
- Who do you think it is?
- Well, the cold war is over.

69
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,192
These guys
don't wave flags anymore...

70
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,201
and fanaticism,
terrorism is global.

71
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,238
Whoever it is decided
to eliminate the competition...

72
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,364
and force Vas to deal with them.

73
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,909
So, the future
of the so-called free world...

74
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,946
may rest in
this young man's hands.

75
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,738
Jake Hayes here...
Big-time Tickets.

76
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,149
Whatever you want, I'll get you.
Yankees, third base line.

77
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,050
Knicks, courtside.
Rangers, on the ice.

78
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,716
Masters, I'll put you
on Tiger's tee, a'ight?

79
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,055
No matter what you want,
I got it for you.

80
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,458
Big-time Tickets.
What you need?

81
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,022
Come on, man. You call me
three hours before tipoff...

82
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,967
against the Lakers?
The Knicks sell out every game.

83
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,598
Since I like you, for 850,
I'll get you section 24, row 9.

84
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,073
Twelve back from the bench.

85
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,269
Right behind Woody
with a good view of Spike...

86
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,811
unless he's got that
turban thing on his head...

87
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,107
lookin' like Yasser Araneck.

88
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,880
Check.

89
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,384
Hold on a second.

90
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,910
What's up? Big-time Tickets.
Jake Hayes. What you want?

91
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,456
Checkmate.

92
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,492
"Lion King"? I can't do that.

93
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,754
Jake Hayes here.
Big-time Tickets.

94
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,386
Mr. Johnson, you gonna
go to the game tonight...

95
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,794
or you want to do some business?

96
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,298
Shit, he's kickin' your ass!

97
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,130
Don't look at me.
You need to watch that castle...

98
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,500
'bout to bitch-slap your bishop.

99
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,233
Ehhhh! You lose, Opie.

100
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,433
Damn!

101
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,705
OK, so I'll give you
four hundred for the two.

102
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,576
- Yo, Jake, let's get a slice.
- Hold on one second.

103
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,912
Hello? Big-time Tickets.

104
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,680
Hey, man. I can't.

105
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,778
You always workin'.

106
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,847
Hey, honey. What's up?

107
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,893
OK, I'm gonna
pick you up from work.

108
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,862
Then we'll talk all about it.
Love you, too. Bye.

109
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,024
I gotta pick up
my girl, man.

110
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,568
So check this out...
you're gonna do this, right?

111
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,036
I'm gonna do this.
You're gonna do this.

112
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,938
I'm gonna do this.
Then you're gonna do this.

113
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,236
But I'm gonna do this...

114
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,742
and when you're
thinkin' about this...

115
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,574
I'm gonna do this.
Then the game's over.

116
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,238
So why don't you
give me $20 right now...

117
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,249
- and we'll save twenty minutes?
- Screw you.

118
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,115
You didn't know chess
was a contact sport, did you?

119
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,987
Hey, honey.

120
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,650
Julia Benson.
She's a nurse's aide.

121
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,192
They've been together
three years.

122
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,228
She lives with her sister
and brother-in-law...

123
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,990
in Jersey City.

124
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,157
Amazing resemblance
to Kevin, sir.

125
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,461
Yeah.

126
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,135
Like seeing a ghost.

127
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,334
I don't know how
you're gonna react.

128
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,706
Heh.

129
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,337
Come on. Wait a minute.

130
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,404
I should've known.

131
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,110
The mood swings,
the weight gain.

132
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,175
What weight gain?

133
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,414
You're pregnant.

134
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,014
I want everybody to know.
Hey, everybody!

135
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,117
My woman's havin' a baby,
and we're gettin' married!

136
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,492
I'm not pregnant.

137
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,795
We don't have to get married.

138
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,029
Marriage is a big step.
We should wait a while.

139
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,502
We're young.

140
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,596
I'm moving to Seattle.

141
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,605
Seattle, like,
Seattle Supersonics, Seattle?

142
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,945
Wait a minute.
That's pretty far.

143
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,007
I got offered a job there.

144
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,212
What kind of job
are you gonna get in Seattle...

145
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,584
that you can't get in New York?

146
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,614
A friend of mine
from junior college called.

147
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,524
- Who?
- Kenneth.

148
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,857
Your ex-man Ken?

149
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,026
He's managing a company
out there, and he offered.

150
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,331
So, you're leaving me
and going back to Ken.

151
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,529
No.

152
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,799
- Are you leaving me?
- Sort of, but it's not...

153
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,068
So, you're leaving me
and going back to Kenneth?

154
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:54,010
- That's what I asked you.
- The Ken part is just business.

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,072
And what's the leaving me part?
Pleasure?

156
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,844
Pain.

157
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,352
Your sister put you up to this.
She never liked me.

158
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,651
- It's been three years, Jake.
- I know it's been three years.

159
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,182
We're in the same situation
that we were in when we met.

160
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,955
Meaning, we're not married.

161
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,190
We're not married,
we can't afford to get married.

162
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,632
And it doesn't look like
it's ever gonna change.

163
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,966
You know, poor people
do get married.

164
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,939
I know, but I don't feel
like fighting with you...

165
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,202
every day because we're broke.

166
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,871
Marriage is hard enough
without being poor.

167
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,608
Hey, what happened to the love?

168
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,616
What happened
to all that romance?

169
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,311
You know I love you.

170
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,012
But you are living
in this fantasy.

171
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,578
It's like you're waiting
for some kind of miracle.

172
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,784
I gotta live in reality.
I am not gonna be young forever.

173
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,418
So you gotta put yourself
back on the market...

174
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,724
while the merchandise
is still fresh.

175
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,732
You act like there's
a damn expiration date...

176
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,266
on your forehead!

177
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,438
Come on, come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

178
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,569
You think I like
living like this?

179
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,706
Movin' tickets, hustlin' chess,
DJing at these little clubs?

180
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,274
I should've stayed in college.
I messed up.

181
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,820
I messed up.
I'll go back to college.

182
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,824
I love you, Jake.

183
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,257
I love you, too.

184
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,760
But I...

185
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,926
So, when are you leaving?

186
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:28,904
Couple weeks. But I...
We'll talk before then.

187
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,971
Why?

188
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,419
Jake.

189
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,803
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?

190
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,508
- What's wrong?
- Julie left me.

191
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,212
Sorry. I gotta go.
But I'll catch you tomorrow.

192
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,298
I'm all out of love...

193
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,133
I'm so lost without you...

194
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,469
I know you were right...

195
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,271
Believing for so long...

196
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,244
I'm all out of love...

197
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,610
What am I without you?

198
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,046
I can't be too late...

199
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,710
Hey, you get
your shit together...

200
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,616
or I'm gonna have
to fire your ass!

201
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,314
That's right!

202
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,691
I want you to come back
and carry me home...

203
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,720
Away from these long,
lonely nights...

204
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,697
There's no easy way...

205
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,734
It gets harder each day...

206
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:08,102
Please love me
or I'll be gone...

207
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,767
I'll be gone...

208
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,834
I'm all out of love...

209
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,244
I'm so lost without you...

210
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,282
I know you were right...

211
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,715
Believing for so long...

212
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,776
I'm all out of love...

213
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,879
What am I without you?

214
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,186
It can't be too late...

215
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,921
To say that I was so wrong...

216
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,461
Julie, I'm sorry.

217
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,469
Oh, I'm sorry.
Big-time Tickets.

218
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,097
Yeah, for what game?

219
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,109
How much you want to spend?

220
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,610
Yeah, I can get it.

221
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,813
So, where you at?

222
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,747
Where the hell's that?

223
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,580
Thank you very much.
Now, take off.

224
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,886
Whatever.

225
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,785
- Hop out.
- Hey, what's up?

226
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,022
- Give me your phone.
- What's up?

227
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,496
Hey! Come on, now!
What y'all want?

228
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,056
- Hey, come on!
- Relax.

229
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,296
You know how hard it was for me
to get a cab to come up here?

230
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,271
I hope y'all givin' me
a ride back.

231
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,534
I know you're cops, man.

232
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,666
What do you want, money?
Oh, I understand.

233
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,439
Y'all shot somebody,
and now y'all need a suspect.

234
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:24,676
Mr. Hayes? Jacob Hayes?

235
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,678
I'm Officer Oakes,
that's Officer Seale...

236
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,385
Officer Swanson, Officer Carew.

237
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,792
CIA? What's that for?
"Crackers In my Ass?"

238
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,491
You're gonna arrest me
for scalpin' tickets?

239
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,000
We just want to talk to you
about something.

240
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,628
- About what?
- About your brother.

241
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,639
You got the wrong guy.
I don't even have a brother.

242
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,735
That's just a picture
of me in a suit.

243
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,143
You could've got that
off the internet.

244
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,479
I saw a picture of Bill Gates
with three titties on the net.

245
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,745
OK, September 8, 1970...

246
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,616
Bellevue Hospital,
New York City...

247
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,747
a woman registered
as Mary Jeffries...

248
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,189
gives birth
to identical twins...

249
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,126
but suffers complications
and dies the next day.

250
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,960
- What about the father?
- Thomas B. Jeffries.

251
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,467
Presumed alive.
Whereabouts unknown.

252
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,331
The state
rarely separates twins...

253
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,964
but one of the infants...
Jacob... that's you...

254
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,474
was diagnosed
with severe lung infection.

255
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,409
You still have the scar
from the chest tube...

256
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,740
the incision mark.

257
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,680
An administrator at the hospital
altered the birth record...

258
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,980
to give the healthy child
a better chance at adoption.

259
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,954
A week later,
Roger and Glenda Pope...

260
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,320
took in Kevin Jeffries.

261
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,223
The Popes never knew.
Kevin never knew.

262
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,125
So, I have a twin brother.
Big deal.

263
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,130
What's the CIA
have to do with this?

264
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,823
He couldn't send me a letter?

265
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,199
Your brother's dead.

266
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,567
How?

267
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,003
A helicopter crash.

268
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,103
We need your help, Mr. Hayes.

269
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,908
Your brother was working
on something with us.

270
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,278
My twin brother was CIA?

271
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,783
Yeah, a clandestine operative.

272
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,253
And just before he was killed,
he set up a deal.

273
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,687
What kind of deal?

274
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,657
A very important one.

275
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,458
So, we need you to stand
in for him, just briefly.

276
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,397
- Pretend I'm him?
- Yeah.

277
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,492
- For how long?
- Nine days.

278
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,629
Nine days is not standin' in.
Standin' in is an hour.

279
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,673
Nine days is goin' on tour.

280
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,504
- Is this shit dangerous?
- There's some risk.

281
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,807
What kind of risk?
We talkin' bad credit risk...

282
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,574
or a bullet in the ass risk?

283
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,548
- You'd be well compensated.
- For a bullet in the ass risk?

284
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,643
I hope that's a lot
of compensation. How much?

285
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,085
Throw out a number.

286
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,022
- A billion dollars.
- You've overshot.

287
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,059
I don't know what kind of budget
you're working with.

288
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,459
We were thinking
somewhere in the region of...

289
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,623
let's say... $25,000.

290
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,792
Fifty. Yeah, fifty.

291
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,530
I figure you started with 25,
so I know you got more.

292
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,198
You ain't gonna give me
all your money. 50,000.

293
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,264
This is what I'm thinking,
Mr. Hayes.

294
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,540
With $25,000, your girlfriend
Julie could go to college.

295
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,080
She wouldn't have to go
to Seattle.

296
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,981
Or work with Ken.

297
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,483
OK, here's what I'm thinkin'.

298
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,521
You're gonna give me
$50,000 tax-free.

299
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:21,321
OK, 50,000 after taxes
after the job is done.

300
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,020
Half now, half after.

301
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,188
Ten now, forty after.

302
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,391
Unless my mother had triplets...

303
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:33,234
you're gonna give me ten now,
ninety after.

304
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,399
OK, you got a deal.

305
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,966
- So, when do we start?
- Now.

306
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,236
This is your brother's file.
Study it.

307
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,575
So there's homework.

308
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,309
- Preparation.
- OK.

309
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:48,046
Let's see, Dad sits on the board
of the New York Stock Exchange.

310
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,781
Mom, co-artistic director...

311
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,153
at Lincoln Center.
Must've been nice.

312
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,055
In my foster house,
we were so poor...

313
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,094
we used to lick stamps
for dinner.

314
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,062
Let's see.
Prep school at Exeter.

315
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,931
Then college at Dartmouth.
Served in the Naval Academy.

316
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,869
- That's right.
- What'd he serve, lunch?

317
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,407
Oh, man."Rhoades scholar."

318
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,443
- So my brother was real smart?
- Yeah.

319
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,707
Damn, the CIA is cheap.

320
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,081
Y'all could've got me
a queen size.

321
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,813
What's this, jack size?

322
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,182
Hey, what's "Zachod" mean?

323
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,351
It's Czech for "bathroom."

324
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,191
You'll find the room labelled
with phonetic translations.

325
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,491
Why?

326
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,862
Because the deal goes down
in the Czech Republic.

327
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,198
- Czech Republic?
- Here's a dictionary.

328
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,237
How do I get an outside line?

329
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,795
I need somebody to feed my cat.

330
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,876
You don't have
an outside line or a cat.

331
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,275
So what am I
supposed to be doing here?

332
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,076
There's a tape in the VCR.
It's a video of your brother.

333
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,946
Watch it. The way he talks
and the way he moves.

334
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,246
I know there's a lot
to deal with here...

335
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,844
but we're all behind you.
We'll start in the morning.

336
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,184
You got any questions?

337
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,590
Yeah, if my brother
was such a genius...

338
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,651
then how come he's dead?

339
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,124
- 5 A.M.
- Hey, I don't do 5 A.M.

340
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,725
So, bottom line,
what are our chances?

341
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,739
I'd say anywhere between
nil and zero.

342
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,933
Why do you say that?

343
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,170
I grant you,
he's got potential.

344
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,575
He's pretty street-smart.

345
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,013
In 6 months, he could probably
fool his brother's parents.

346
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,243
But eight days?
You gotta be kidding.

347
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,910
Probably get himself
killed on this mission...

348
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,546
and anyone else
who goes along with him.

349
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,749
Would you like to be replaced
on the mission?

350
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,453
Why? You're going ahead
with or without me?

351
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,257
That's precisely
what I'm saying.

352
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:44,135
Well, sir, when do I tell him
what this mission involves?

353
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,763
If I were you, I would tell him
as little as possible.

354
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,068
Don't put anything
into his head he can't use...

355
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,235
and certainly nothing that
could pop out at the wrong time.

356
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,609
- OK.
- What's he doing now?

357
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,614
He's studying.
We told him to learn...

358
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,809
a few key phrases in Czech.

359
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,452
He seems dedicated.

360
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,424
What's he saying?

361
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,830
He said, "I haven't had
my period in three months."

362
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,842
Now what?

363
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,907
"Where's the hospital?
I have a vaginal infection."

364
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,249
This is gonna be
really interesting.

365
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,118
Can't wait to get started.

366
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,552
Rise and shine, Mr. Hayes!
5 A.M., and all is well.

367
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:48,691
How about three more hours
of sleep and some breakfast?

368
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,496
How about a nice shower?

369
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,595
Aah! Aah! Hey!
What's wrong with you?!

370
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,264
Good morning.

371
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,970
Today we'll be covering
basic operations protocol...

372
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,446
for the acquisition
of foreign assets...

373
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,348
a procedure we like to call
"The Three I's"...

374
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,320
identifying the target,
initiating the contact...

375
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,448
and infiltrating the network...

376
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,321
Now you do it like him.

377
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,759
Man, this is buggin' me out.
I feel like Michael Jackson...

378
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,796
lookin' at old album covers.
Look at this guy.

379
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,163
He looks like me,
but it's not me.

380
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,360
- Yeah.
- So, what did he like to do?

381
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,130
What kind of sports was he into?

382
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,569
What kind of music
did he listen to?

383
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,971
He liked music.
Jazz and classical.

384
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,738
- Classical, like Run-DMC?
- He didn't like rap.

385
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,679
What 29-year-old brother
don't like a little bit of rap?

386
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,409
He didn't listen to rap.

387
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,041
So, what kind of sports
was he into?

388
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,244
Skiing.

389
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,119
OK, so you got skiing,
the Navy, no rap.

390
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,021
We'd have had a lot in common.

391
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,719
- Sir.
- Hmm?

392
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,657
What time?

393
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,665
OK. All right.

394
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,201
Thanks.

395
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,930
So, what's up with
you and Swanson?

396
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,528
- Hmm?
- Aw, come on, man.

397
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,301
I see there's something
goin' on there.

398
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,400
You got a little
something goin' on...

399
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,604
Look at you. You're blushing.

400
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,842
Do you mind if I say something
to you, Mr. Hayes?

401
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:14,511
My friends, Officer Seale,
Officer Swanson...

402
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,420
they have faith in you.
I don't.

403
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,117
And that creates a problem...

404
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,456
because you're in so deep
with us now...

405
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,291
we can never let you go.

406
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,093
So you'd better
learn this stuff...

407
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,226
stone-cold by 0500 hours
tomorrow morning.

408
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,769
Or what?

409
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,829
I'll kill you.

410
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,435
Can we start
a few hours later tomorrow?

411
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,572
Aah! Aah!

412
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,048
Aaah!

413
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,607
Get dressed.

414
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,745
It's 4:59!

415
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,312
The new terrors in rock...

416
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,721
On every block...

417
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,191
Late for school,
late for work...

418
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,921
But ahead of these cops...

419
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,930
My credit is shot,
end up dead in a box...

420
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,627
But so my life
ain't as pathetic as Pac's...

421
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,464
Right away
blow your life away...

422
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,038
So light your haze,
hold tight grenades...

423
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,073
So when it blows
I'm slightly grazed...

424
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,440
Kuniva might be crazed
unleashin' unlikely rage...

425
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,970
Next time you hear a verse
from me I might be caged...

426
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,983
Swirl.
Checking for sediment.

427
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,177
Sniff...

428
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,145
And taste.

429
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,568
Morning, Mr. Hayes. 5 A.M.

430
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,704
No, 5:01.

431
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,275
I believe in people tryin'...

432
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,287
I believe in people cryin'...

433
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,380
I believe
in people breathin'...

434
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,857
I believe in people bein'...

435
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,487
Pope. Kevin Pope.

436
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:12,393
Ha ha ha! Look at this suit.
Man, I got initials on my cuffs.

437
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,803
The only thing I ever have
on my cuffs is steak sauce.

438
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,207
They say "M.T."
What's that for?

439
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,643
Michael Turner.

440
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,544
But I thought I was Kevin Pope.

441
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,515
Kevin Pope is Michael Turner.

442
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,018
Michael Turner
is Kevin Pope's cover identity.

443
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,577
He is a very successful,
very knowledgeable...

444
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,249
very sophisticated
international dealer...

445
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,815
in fine antiquities.

446
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,793
Well, if I'm Jake Hayes
playing Kevin Pope...

447
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,456
playing Michael Turner,
then I should get two checks.

448
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,658
Cheers.

449
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,701
This is a very rare
expensive cognac.

450
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,201
What do you think?

451
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:55,412
Dry. But never precocious.

452
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,075
I love your shirt.
Egyptian broadcloth?

453
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,812
Three days.
Pretty impressive.

454
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,615
Yeah, he's bright.

455
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,714
- I think he can do it.
- He's got my vote.

456
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,053
I said he was bright.

457
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,151
I didn't say he was capable
of saving the world.

458
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,458
- Let's run a real test.
- Like what?

459
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,998
Send him up to New York.
Put him in Kevin's apartment.

460
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,830
Let the neighbors, the doorman,
everybody get a look at him.

461
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,335
See if they buy him
as Michael Turner.

462
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,099
Might even serve
a double purpose.

463
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,436
Whoever tried to kill
Kevin as Michael Turner...

464
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,375
probably doesn't know he's dead.
Might still be looking for him.

465
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,413
So we dangle him as bait,
keep him in the dark.

466
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,678
- He'll be protected.
- What do we tell him?

467
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,878
You're giving him a chance
to practice being Kevin.

468
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,443
That's all you need to tell him.

469
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,421
You're the boss.

470
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,964
You see the van
in front of us?

471
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,265
The one behind us?
Those are our guys.

472
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,964
Here's my cell phone number.

473
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,234
Use it if you get
into any kind of trouble.

474
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,867
- What kind of trouble?
- Any kind.

475
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,070
Shark attack?
Call you. All right.

476
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,443
Could you pop the trunk?

477
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,539
Take this.
Get yourself some shoes.

478
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,174
Little punk.

479
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,913
Mr. Turner, welcome back, sir.

480
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,785
Thanks, Jim.

481
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,193
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

482
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,028
How was Europe?

483
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,429
Like another country.

484
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,565
Ha ha ha ha ha!

485
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,547
Whoo!

486
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,740
You could put this on MTV Cribs.

487
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,747
Man, this is dope!

488
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,850
God damn.

489
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,691
So if I paid taxes...

490
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,254
this is where
the money would go, huh?

491
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,857
Could have
a Puffy party in here.

492
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,393
Let's get some music in here.

493
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:31,868
Whoa-oh-oh!

494
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,675
What's that music?

495
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:43,009
- Just hip-hop stuff.
- It's terrible.

496
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,344
Jake, it's your
downstairs neighbor...

497
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,384
Mrs. Patterson.

498
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,714
Don't forget the radio.

499
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,221
OK.

500
00:29:56,394 --> 00:30:00,091
Hi, Michael! Welcome back.

501
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,598
Mwah. Mwah.

502
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,396
- Vera, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

503
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,834
Hi, Annabella.

504
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,566
We just came in and the doorman
said you were back.

505
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,098
- Annabella missed you.
- Oh, you're far too kind.

506
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,702
I've been waiting desperately
for you to come back.

507
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,304
- Oh? Why?
- I bought a little treasure.

508
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,383
Come on down and tell me
if I got a good buy.

509
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,008
- Oh, OK.
- Hold your baby.

510
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,054
- Yes, my baby.
- How was your trip?

511
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,953
This is gonna be a disaster.

512
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,188
Hello! Go see your nanny, baby.

513
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,856
What do you think?
Is it a good piece?

514
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,797
Uh...

515
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,265
- It's exquisite.
- Ooh! Do you think?

516
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,069
Go ahead, pick it up. Feel it.
Just see how delicate it is.

517
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,736
Pick it up, right?

518
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,803
Yes. Just grab it
and pick it up.

519
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,284
Michael...

520
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,719
that's what we keep
the doggy treats in.

521
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,724
Of course, I knew that.
I was just getting it...

522
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,056
out of the way
so I could see the...

523
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,619
- The vase.
- Of course, the vase! Yes!

524
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,189
May I ask, how much
did you pay for this?

525
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,666
150,000.

526
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,999
Good lord! What you gonna
put in it, cocaine?!

527
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,003
He fooled the doorman,
he fooled the neighbor...

528
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,308
and the neighbor's dog.
What more do you want?

529
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,816
Oakes, we need to know
who's after that bomb.

530
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,283
You're willing
to sacrifice him to find out?

531
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,514
Don't be dramatic.
He's got plenty of protection.

532
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,953
I'll tell you when to pull him.

533
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:01,207
Never safe,
you're never sure...

534
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,482
Somethin's all wrong...

535
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,718
Hope y'all not watching this.

536
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,193
I don't have
to watch this, do I, sir?

537
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,697
- Oh, no. Holy shit.
- Code red. Code red.

538
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,968
Code red! Code red!

539
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,349
Parish, McCain, cover the exits!

540
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,516
Help! Help! Help!

541
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,456
Raah!

542
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,394
Unh!

543
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,257
Unh!

544
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,461
God.

545
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,935
Whoa!

546
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,570
Aah!

547
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,582
Unh!

548
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,618
Unh!

549
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,488
Unh!

550
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,825
Sir, he's headed for the roof.

551
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,457
- We need him alive.
- Yes, sir.

552
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,773
- Whoa!
- Oh!

553
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,198
Drop the knife.

554
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:23,215
Hey, Elvis, if you drop
the knife and step down...

555
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,346
no one is gonna hurt you.

556
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,481
So...

557
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,744
who's got Jake?

558
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,783
Aah!

559
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,348
Well, these last
ten minutes will be used...

560
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,884
as a teaching aid on how
an operation can get totally...

561
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,555
- Screwed up, sir?
- Thank you.

562
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,859
We'll find him, sir.

563
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,368
Yeah? Where are you?

564
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,132
The corner of eat shit
and fuck you!

565
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,733
I'm not gonna let you trace me!
Bye! I'll call you back!

566
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,108
I'm stuck in traffic.
I ask you to do...

567
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,307
Give me that!

568
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,576
Yo!

569
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,675
Run fingerprints, DNA,
anything we can get...

570
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,185
on the guy
who jumped off the roof.

571
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,187
- Yes, sir.
- He looks Afghani, sir.

572
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,688
Don't assume anything.
Just find Jake.

573
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,019
- Yes, sir.
- Jake...

574
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,218
Kevin was murdered!
And they're gonna murder me!

575
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,127
- Let's meet some place...
- No more bullshit!

576
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,133
We lost him
because we lied to him.

577
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,259
No, you lost him
because you lost him.

578
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,234
We treated him like an idiot.

579
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,296
He had a right to know
what we were doing with him.

580
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,365
We're wasting time!
Find him and bring him back...

581
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,604
and spare me your conscience.

582
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,341
Spare my conscience.

583
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,350
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Bye.

584
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,818
It's called chillin'...

585
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,082
6 million ways to live...

586
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,387
6 million ways to live life...

587
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,485
Yeah?

588
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,224
Hello? Pam, it's Jake.
Can I talk to Julie?

589
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,199
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Who's on the phone?

590
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,499
I need to talk to Julie.
Please. This is serious.

591
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,596
It is Jake?
Wait, let me talk to him!

592
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,971
- She's moving on.
- Give me the phone.

593
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,509
We don't need
no more trouble, Jake...

594
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,942
and you ain't nothing
but trouble.

595
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,378
Two suits came around today
looking for you.

596
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,643
Give me the phone!

597
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,618
Hey, hey, hey.
Shit, your phone's tapped.

598
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,450
If Julie's there,
tell her I love her...

599
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,389
and, Oakes, if you're listening,
kiss my ass!

600
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,158
- You get a trace?
- No.

601
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,199
Tch. He hung up.

602
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,966
It's called chillin'...

603
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,267
6 million ways to live...

604
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,308
6 million ways
to live life...

605
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,573
Mr. Hayes, where are you?

606
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,546
Where in the hell are you?

607
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,548
6 million ways
to live lavish...

608
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:12,652
6 million ways to live...

609
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,419
6 million ways
to live lavish...

610
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,723
Beyond all the misery
and mathematic...

611
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,263
From the 6 million ways
to live...
