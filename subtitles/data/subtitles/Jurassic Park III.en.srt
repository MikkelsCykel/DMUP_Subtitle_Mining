{8536}{8602}-Tell me.|-We did cranial scans of a fossil skull...

{8833}{8884}Which explains|why they could work as a team.
{8887}{8973}They'd coordinate attacks so their prey|wouldn't know what was going on.

{10241}{10360}...that we can determine the correlation|between the upperpalate and the larynx.
{10362}{10431}This lets us theorise, theorise, mind you...
{10433}{10527}...that the Raptor was capable|ofsophisticated vocalizations...
{10531}{10613}...which would have been|a tremendous evolutionary advantage.
{10619}{10682}Raptors were fierce, intelligent...
{10684}{10725}...and socially sophisticated.
{10728}{10816}They were able to huntin numbers|and coordinate their efforts.
{10846}{10920}Were it not for the cataclysmic events|which overtook them...
{10922}{10996}...it's entirely possible|that Raptors rather than humans...
{10998}{11080}...would have become|the dominantspecies on this planet.
{11095}{11148}I hope this has been ofinterest.
{11150}{11226}It certainly excites us as paleontologists.
{11240}{11299}There is much more to discover.

{39953}{40010}PAUL: We called everyone.|We did everything we could.
{40013}{40107}No one would help us. The Costa Rican|government said this is a no-fly zone.
{40110}{40186}The U.S. Embassy,|that's our U.S. Embassy...
{40189}{40265}...told us we should accept the inevitable.|Can you believe that?

{40494}{40528}All right, why me?
{40530}{40599}He said we needed someone|who'd been on the island before.
{40601}{40677}Yes, but I did not tell you|to kidnap somebody.
{40688}{40749}I have never been on this island.
{40756}{40809}Sure you have. You wrote that book.
{40811}{40909}That was lsla Nublar.|This is lsla Sorna, Site B.

{41051}{41110}-Eight weeks.|-Almost eight weeks now.
{41171}{41242}Billy. We'll go back to the plane,|salvage what we can.

{41505}{41535}Either way...
{41554}{41623}...you probably won't get off|this island alive.

{81937}{81978}Please, give me the bag.
{82073}{82103}It's not safe.
{82240}{82278}[Unzipping sound]
{82381}{82409}ALAN: Raptor eggs.
{82467}{82524}Did you steal Raptor eggs?
{82696}{82737}Now it all makes sense.
{82743}{82825}BILLY: I swear, if I'd known|you were going to end up with them....
{82871}{82939}It was an impulse,|I thought they'd be worth a fortune.
{82941}{83015}Enough to fund the dig site|another 10 more years.
{83017}{83051}You have to believe me.
{83053}{83139}This was a stupid decision,|but I did it with the best intentions.

{83235}{83352}Some of the worst things imaginable|have been done with the best intentions.
{83385}{83423}You know what, Billy?
{83428}{83471}As far as I'm concerned...
{83474}{83554}...you're no better than the people|that built this place.
{83959}{84035}What are you doing?|Those things are after us because of those.

{98447}{98486}I'm sorry about Billy.
{98582}{98648}You know what the last thing|I said to him was?
{98658}{98682}I said:
{98699}{98771}"You're as bad as the people|that built this place."
{98779}{98814}Which wasn't true.
{98822}{98900}Billy was just young. That's all.
{98952}{99015}I have a theory|that there are two kinds of boys.
{99017}{99076}There are those|who want to be astronomers...
{99078}{99135}...and those who want to be astronauts.
{99150}{99218}The astronomer, or the paleontologist...
{99259}{99353}...gets to study these amazing things|from a place of complete safety.
{99374}{99452}-But then you never get to go into space.|-Exactly.
{99469}{99538}It's the difference|between imagining and seeing.
{99540}{99597}To be able to touch them.
{99619}{99697}And that's all Billy wanted.
{99889}{99915}Dr. Grant.
