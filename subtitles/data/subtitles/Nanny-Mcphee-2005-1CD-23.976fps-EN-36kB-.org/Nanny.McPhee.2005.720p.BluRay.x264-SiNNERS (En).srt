00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,400
[man] We must begin our story, sad to say,
with an empty chair.

3
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,000
If it were not empty,
we would not have a story.

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
But it is, and we do, and it is time to tell it.

[whooshing and tinkling]

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
This is the story of my family,

8
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,100
of my seven children, who are all very clever

9
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
but all very, very, very naughty.

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Aaaaah! Aaaah! Aaaaa-aaaagh...!

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,500
This is Nanny Whetstone,

12
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,800
the 1 7th nanny I had hired
to look after my children.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
- Aaaaagh...!
- She was the strictest, the toughest

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,900
and the most fearless nanny in all the land.

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
As I went to work that day
at the funeral parlour,

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,600
I was confident in the knowledge
that there was nothing, absolutely nothing

17
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
- that my children could do to upset her.

Except that.

- [children] Quick! He's coming!
- Hide!

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,500
- Quiet!
- Stop it!

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,100

You're all cabbagey.

Oh...and you're all gravy-y.

30
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,300
As was your intention, Nanny Whetstone
has resigned from her post.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,300
I shall go to the agency this afternoon
and hire a new nanny.

32
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,100
You will not drive her away
as you have done with her predecessors.

Can't catch me out.
That showed 'em who's boss.

Aaaagh! Whoa! Ooh! [grunts]

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Three days, eight hours and 47 minutes.

38
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,800
So that got rid of her...

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,900
23 hours and 1 3 minutes
quicker than the last one.

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,700
I think the turning point was definitely
eating the baby. Well done, Eric.

41
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,500
Mr Brown, are you all right?

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm perfectly all right.

43
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,200
Evangeline, could you let Cook know
that the new nanny has had to leave

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,500
and I'm off to the agency to find a new one?

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Good. I'll just...

- [woman] We're closed.

48
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
- There's been a tiny hiccup.
- We're not here.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,300
- Please, let me in...
- Go away.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,000
Listen, they didn't eat the baby.
It was a chicken, actually.

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,800
There's no more nannies! You've had your lot.

Is that you, Mrs Partridge?

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,400
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,400
I need her to start right away.
I'm late for a vital tea dance.

Nanny McPhee is not on our books.

Nanny Whetstone's gone.

There's a surprise. Hurry it up there. Spuds.

61
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Mr Brown's gone to the agency.
I said the children'll be fine with us.

62
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,000
They won't be fine with me.

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,500
I won't have them dirty blighters
in my kitchen, and that is that!

64
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,400
I have it in writing. In writing!

- [horrendous cacophony]
- [children shouting]

- Well, that's the final straw.
- Pa!

67
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,800
- There are no more nannies.
- Whoa!

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
None. All over, finished.

69
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,900
I've had to cancel my appointment
and that will cause trouble.

70
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,100
- I told them not to. It wasn't my idea.
- Don't look at me! It's not my fault.

71
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,100
Well, you seem intent on distressing me...

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,600
Er...don't do that, darling, please.
That's my sore bit.

73
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,400
You seem intent on distressing me,
so I'm going to distress you.

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,500
You are to...to go to bed immediately.

75
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,400
Before supper?

76
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
Without supper.

77
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,000
Did he say without supper?

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Never mind that.

You're driving your poor father
to distraction. Stop it.

Lily, what's this word?

94
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,200
Lovingly. "He took her lovingly by the hand."

95
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,100
What's your book about, Evangeline?

96
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,400
It's about the daughter of a nice man
who remarries after his wife dies

97
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,500
and the stepmother's horrid to her.

98
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,200
Why doesn't the man stop her being horrid?

99
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,000
Fathers all turn bad once their wives die.
They don't care any more.

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Simon. Yours does.

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500
No, he doesn't.

102
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,700
Does he read to Chrissie
or play cricket with us like he used to?

103
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,200
He doesn't even sing Loola-bye to Aggy.
We hardly see him.

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,400
He loves you, Simon. You know that.
He's just had a lot on his mind since...

105
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,100
Since Mother died.

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
You used to be as close as anything.

107
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,500
Not any more. All he cares about now
is getting himself a nice new wife.

108
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,000
Well... I don't know if that's true or not,

109
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
but it might be nice to have a new mother.

110
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Don't you know anything about the world?

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,500
Whoever he marries will be vile
and treat us like slaves.

112
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,300
- You don't know that.
- Plenty of hard evidence for it.

113
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
There isn't one stepmother in there
who's even halfway decent.

114
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,500
They're an evil breed. Anyway,
who ever likes other people's children?

115
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,400
I like you.

116
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes, but you're a servant.
You're paid to like us.

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,300
That doesn't count.

[guillotine squeaks, then drops]

120
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
I really am hungry, Evangeline.

121
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Could you maybe bring me
some secret toast and jam?

122
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,000
All right, forget the jam.
Just some secret toast.

Shall I plump the cushion
on Mrs Brown's chair?

126
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,800
I know you like to plump it yourself
sometimes.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Oh, no, that's...that's all right.
You plump away, Evangeline. Thank you.

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,900
I was wondering if I might make
Master Sebastian a piece of toast.

129
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,300
Yes, I should think...
Er...no, under no circumstances. No.

130
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,400
I could do it secret-like.

131
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
No, they'll hear him chewing
and then we're done for.

132
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,900
No, they get nothing.

133
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Righto, Mr Brown.

[mysterious woman's voice]
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

[sighs]

137
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,000
No supper.

Now, you listen here, you pustular tykes.

146
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,400
You ain't allowed in this kitchen,
not now, not ever.

147
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,300
I have it in writing.

148
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,700
Well, dear, the agency has closed its doors.

149
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,300
What am I to do? Aunt Adelaide says...

150
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Your children are out of control, Cedric.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And there was that thing she said
about their needing a female influence. I...

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,800
You know what she's like.
She'll stop the allowance

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
unless I marry again and give them
a new mother within the month.

154
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,500
A month. I mean, it's unbearable.
But l... I had to... I had to promise.

155
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,200
Remember we talked about
what would happen without her money.

156
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,700
The bank will take the house.

157
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,200
There'll be debtors' prison for me,
workhouse for the older children.

158
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,600
Goodness only knows
what'll happen to little Chrissie.

159
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,900
And as for Aggy...

160
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,400
it's unimaginable.

We got Cook!

Eric, you're not making another bomb,
are you?

[yells]

177
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,400
- They're in the kitchen.
- No! No! You took them down for toast!

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,400
I never did!
You sent them to bed with no dinner.

179
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,100

- I'll go.
- No, I'd better...

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,400
- Well, no, I can...
- You, erm... I'll...

185

Good evening, Mr Brown.
I am Nanny McPhee.

191
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,300
Oh, you're... Er...of course.

192
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,800
Good heavens. I suppose the agency...

193
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,400
I do not belong to any agency, Mr Brown.
I am a government nanny.

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,500
A government nanny? How...

195
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,200
.. unusual.

196
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,900
May I come in?

197
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,600
Yes, by all means, do...do come in.

198
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,800
- Hm.
- [thunder rumbles]

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,100
I understand you have
extremely ill-behaved children.

200
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,200
No. No, no. No.
No... Good grief, what a suggestion.

[china shatters, child roars]

- Playful.
- [child] Shut up!

203
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
What are your main concerns?

204
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,400
Concerns?

205
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,400
Mm. Do they go to bed when they're told?

206
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,200
Well, no, not, er... No.

207
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,300
- Do they get up when they're told?
- Er...well, no, not exactly.

208
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,200
- Get dressed when they're told?
- Now, that's a good question.

209
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,300
- Do they say "please" and "thank you"?
- In what context?

210
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,000
- That will do to be going on with.
- [child laughs wickedly]

211
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,100
- Your children need me.
- [china shatters]

212
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,200
I'll go and make sure everything's
in order before I introduce you.

213
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,200
I shall introduce myself.

214
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,900
Please, Mr Brown,

Oh, look.

219
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,900
The door's open and there's nobody there.

I am here.

I am Nanny McPhee.

223
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,800
Oh, did...did somebody speak?

224
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,100
- I didn't hear anything.
- That's because nobody's there.

- [gasps]
- [clanging]

226
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,700
Then listen carefully and try to hear this.

227
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,200
Stop what you are doing,
put the kitchen to rights

228
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
and go upstairs to bed.

[muffled shouts]

230
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,800
- Did you hear what I said?
- I've just had an idea.

231
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,400
Why don't we play here
in the kitchen all night long?

232
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,900
Let's, let's!

[Chrissie] I can't stop!

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,700
[Eric] She banged her stick!

It's her fault!

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,600
It started when she banged the stick!

Say it!

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,200
Actually, Simon, would you,
because this baby's gonna blow!

264
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
- And Aggy's gonna go in the stockpot!
- Put her back, Chrissie!

Oh, for goodness' sake! Please, then!

When Mr Brown said no dinner,
I thought they'd be down in a trice.

283
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,300
They've been ever so quiet.

284
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,400
Don't you fret.
They don't dare come in this kitchen.

285
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,200
I have it in writing.

- What she told us to do.
- Since when did we do what we're told?

292
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,500
Since we nearly got Cook blown up
and Aggy boiled.

293
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,400
May I just remind you of something?
We got rid of the last 1 7 nannies.

294
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
We're getting rid of this one too.

You must feel at such a disadvantage,
Nanny McPhee.

In what way?

302

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm Bum!

314
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh. Bosoms.

315
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,100
[children giggle]

316
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Bum.

317
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,900
You can't be Bum, Aggy.
Sebastian's Bum. You're Poop.

318
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,500
Poop Bum.

319
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,800
You can't be Poop and Bum.

320
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,700
- [children laughing]
- [Aggy giggles then stops]

321
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,600
[whispers] Goodnight, Agatha.

322
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,500
Goodnight, Sebastian.

323
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Goodnight, Tora.

324
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Goodnight, Christianna.

325
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,600
Goodnight, Lily.

326
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
Goodnight, Eric.

327
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Goodnight, Simon.

328
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,600
There is something you should understand
about the way I work.

329
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,200
When you need me but do not want me,
then I must stay.

330
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,600
When you want me but no longer need me,
then I have to go.

331
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,900
It's rather sad, really, but there it is.

332
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,000
We will never want you.

333
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,600
Then I will never go.

334
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,600
- Goodnight, children.
- [magical tinkling]

335
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,400
How did she know our names?
No one ever knows our names.

336
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,500
- Magic.
- Witchcraft.

337
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,600
It doesn't matter.
We're getting rid of her tomorrow.

338
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,900
- [owl hoots]
- [mutters]

339
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,500
- [tinkling wind rushes]
- What? Wha... What? What?

340
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
I did knock.

341
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,600
Of course. You weren't just
creeping up on me. What a suggestion.

342
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,900
- The children are all in bed and asleep.
- Good. Really?

343
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,900
Hm.

344
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,500
- Good grief.
- I shall see myself to my room.

345
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,600
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

346
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,500
No, wait.

347
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
What do you... I mean, how...
What are your terms?

348
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,700
Your children require five lessons.

349
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,000
Lesson one, to go to bed
when they're told, is complete.

350
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,600
As for my terms,
I take Sunday afternoons off.

351
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,000
Goodnight.

352
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,300
Interesting.

353
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,700
[magical breeze sighs]

354

- [geese honk]

355
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,800
[buzzing]

356
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
[grunts and snuffles]

357
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,400
Time to get up.

358
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
[grunts] No.

359
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Hm. I shall give you half an hour to be up,

360
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,800
washed, dressed, teeth cleaned, beds made

361
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,700
and out into the garden
for healthful fresh air before breakfast.

362
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,800
Lessons start at nine...sharp.

363
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
[magical breeze sighs]

364
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,400
I don't know about you lot,
but I want to stay in bed.

365
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,300
Sebastian, run the thermometer
under the hot tap.

366
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,100
Chrissie, chalk. Eric, crayons. Lily, pepper.

367
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
How do you know
she won't do something horrid to us?

368
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,100
I worked it out.

369
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,700
She's a trained hypnotist.
That's how she made us do those things.

370
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,900
Don't look directly at her
and she can't hypnotise us.

371
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,300
[knock at door]

372
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,800
- Morning, Mr Brown.
- Morning.

373
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm off to work early.
We're busy at the mortuary.

374
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,500
Some bout of influenza at Archway
is carrying off all the old folks... Ah-ah-ah!

375
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,000
Still, what's bad for them
is good for us. [chuckles]

376
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
Poor things.

377
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,900
Well, I know. That, too. Of course.

378
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,600
- [door slams]
- Odd. She normally says, "Have a nice day,"

379
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,900
or "Don't forget your jacket" if it's cold out.

380
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Very odd. Most peculiar.

381
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,100
[magical wind rushes]

382
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,800
Hm.

383
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,500
- I did knock.
- Did you? I didn't hear.

384
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,300
I was talking to...

385
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,900
Never mind.

386
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,000
I believe the children
will be staying in bed today.

387
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
The children? What, all day?
Are they ill? What's wrong?

388
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,800
Nothing. I know precisely what to do.
Please leave it to me.

389
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,300
You managed them splendidly last night.

390
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,300
If they are under the weather,

391
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,700
give them what they want,
ice-cream and jelly and suchlike.

392
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,100
My late wife was very particular.
If ever they were ill,

393
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,900
she used to wait on them hand and foot...
even if they weren't ill at all.

394
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,400
I shall be sure to give them
exactly what they need.

395
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Excellent. Excellent.
Well, I'll just be off to work, then.

396
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,600
[magical tinkling]

397
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,500
She's coming!

398
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,700
Remember, everyone, don't look in her eyes.

399
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,600
Dear me.

400
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,900
[coughs] We can't get up. We're ill.

401
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,300
Colds in our doses.

402
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,100
And kemperakurk.

403
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,900
We think it bight be the beasles.

404
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,700
Got measig.

405
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,500
Good heavens.

406
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,900
Then there is of course
no question of your getting up.

407
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,700
I'm very sorry to have to tell you all
that you'll have to stay in bed.

408
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,900
Hm.

[giggling dies away]

413
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,100
- Ah.
- I don't feel well.

414
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,000
- I think I've got a temperature.
- Don't be daft.

415
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,400
Simon, I can't get up.

416
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,700
- You must have looked at her, then.
- I did not look.

417
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,500
I was under the covers the whole time,
Simon. I can't get up either.

418
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,600
- [Sebastian] I can't get up!
- [Eric] I'm stuck like glue!

419
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,500
[Chrissie] I'm stuck, too!

420
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,600
Hypnosis, eh? Bang goes that theory.

421
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,500
Good morning.

422
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,800
[both] Morning, Mr B!

423
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,400
- [they laugh uproariously]
- Good morning, Mr Jowls, Mr Wheen.

424
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,300
- [both] Thought we'd get you that time.
- No, not this time.

425
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,900
- Nice tea dance, Mr B?
- Ooh, lovely, I shouldn't wonder.

426
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,500
No. I didn't even get there. Disaster.
Children, you know.

427
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,400
- We do know.
- We've said it before.

428
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,900
It's not funerals
you should be in the business of.

429
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,400
[both] It's christenings.

430
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,500
[they laugh uproariously]

431
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,400
Good morning.
Just excuse me a moment, would you?

432
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,900
[woman] Cedric,
let me not beat about the bush.

433
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,700
Your children are out of control.

434
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,500
You need a wife
and your children need a mother.

435
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,300
If you do not remarry by the end of the month,
steps will have to be taken.

436
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

437
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,200
What's your wife like?

438
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,000
Never mind. Less than a month to go.
There's nothing for it.

439
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,300
It'll have to be that woman...
the dreadful one.

440
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,800
Mr Jowls, do you recollect
that...enthusiastic lady?

441
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,800
Mrs Swiftly, was it? Or was it
Mrs Thadius something last year?

442
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,900
- Mrs Thadius Quickly?
- Oh, don't.

443
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,000
"Oh, Mr Brown, you are a saint. You have
a lovely look of kindness about you."

444
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,800
What I wouldn't give for a man like you,
Mr Brown, in my hour of need.

445
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
- That one?
- Yes, that one.

446
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,000
We buried Mr Quickly last autumn.
Poor devil.

447
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,800
- He was happy to go.
- He was her third.

448
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,900
You don't happen to know
if... if she ever...ever, erm...

449
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,600
remarried? You know, number four?

450
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,000
Mr Brown, you're not thinking what I think
you're thinking, are you, Mr Brown?

451
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,000
Good grief, no! No, no. No. No.

452
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
No. No, no... no. What a thought. No. No.

453
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,900
[both] Ohhh...

454
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,400
- [gloopy bubbling]
- [children] What's that?

455
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,200
Measle medicine,
to be administered once an hour.

456
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,900
Actually, I'm not sure it is measles.

457
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,000
How can it be anything other?

458
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,000
The chalky-white faces, the livid spots,

459
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,700
- the temperatures of 1 20 degrees.
- [sizzle]

460
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,200
I've seen it time and again. Measles.

461
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,700
Definitely.

462
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,100
[thick, gloopy gurgling]

463
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,000
Urgh!

464
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,700
- Open.
- [Lily] Simon, don't!

465
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,200
- [sludgy bubbling]
- I'm not taking that.

466
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,100
Then you will not get any better.

467
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,000
Believe me.

468
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,700
[Chrissie] It's moving!

469
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,500
Open wide.

470
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,300
Wider.

471
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,800
[Simon grunts and gags]

472
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
Urgh!

473
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,700
- [thick, gloopy gulping]
- Urgh!

474
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,700
[retches]

475
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,200
[Eric] Simon, spit it out!

476
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,000
You'll have to swallow it sooner or later,
so I suggest you get it over with.

477
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
- [thick, bubbling gulp]
- [gags]

478
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,600
Very good. Who's next?

479
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,100
"Took..."

480
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,900
"He..."

481
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,100
"He took her lovingly..."

482
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,200
"He took her lovingly by the...the hand."

483
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,300
- [magical breeze sighs]
- Oh! Nanny McPhee, you startled me.

484
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,000
It was that quiet.

485
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,600
I just got to practising my sounds.
Lily's teaching me to read.

486
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,000
That is good.

487
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,500
They're all good... underneath it all.

488
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,400
- A favourite of yours?
- Don't know.

489
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
I haven't finished it yet.

490
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,000
- The stepmother's a bit of a horror, though.
- Oh, indeed.

491
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,800
It's a pity stories aren't about real people.

492
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This one seems a farm girl,
but I'll bet a pound to a penny

493
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,100
he finds out she's really an educated lady.

494
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,600
And then he falls for her.

495
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
You must read it and find out.

496
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,100
He wouldn't love her if she couldn't read.

497
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,400
He'd think her stupid

498
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,800
and worthless and beneath him.

499
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,100
Hm.

500
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,600
[tinkling breeze sighs]

501
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,900
Buttered spuds for lunch
with boiled beef, apple pie and custard.

502
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,400
Hm.

503
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,200
I think the children will be requiring
something a little more...

504
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,400
austere today.

505
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,300
'Orse what?

506
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,500
The children are not quite themselves,
Mrs Blatherwick.

507
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,100
God! That means jellies and ice-cream,
raspberry cordial and God knows what else.

508
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,900
Well, I'd better get cracking, then.

509
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,300
Evangeline!

510
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,800
Where is that lump?

511
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,500
It'll be snow in August
before that one's there when you need her.

512
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,600
Calm yourself, Mrs Blatherwick.
I'm in charge today.

513
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,200
I understand that you were once
in the armed forces.

514
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,800
I was that. Cooked at a training camp
in Gloucestershire.

515
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,200
Kept those boys strong, I did.

516
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm sure you did. Perhaps a broth
of some sort for the children.

517
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,300
You must be an expert.

518
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,400
Best thin potato gruel with peelings in?

519
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,300
That always got 'em groaning
but kept 'em strong.

520
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,600
Are you well supplied with peelings?

521
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,200
These'll do. Only a day old.

522
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,100
[tinkling breeze blows]

523
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,000
A bit of gristle for flavour. Ever so tasty.

524
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,800
[chuckles]

525
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Get that down you.
There's a lot of goodness in a turkey neck.

526
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,300
That'll put the hairs back on your chest.

527
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,900
[inhales deeply] Smell that.
That is the smell that forged this empire.

528
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,400
That pong is the pong of conquerors.

529
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,900
All right, men. As you were.

530
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,400
They actually are starving us.

531
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,900
I wonder how long it will take for us all to die.

532
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,800
[cat yowls]

533
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,100
[floorboards creak]

534
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Quickly...

535
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,600
Quickly, Quickly, Quickly...

536
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,300
Mrs Selma Quickly.

537
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,800
[footsteps approach]

538
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Have you lazy lot been in bed all day?

539
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,600
Evangeline.

540
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,000
You've been doing measles, haven't you?

541
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,500
The situation's very simple, Evangeline.

542
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,900
The nanny, who in my opinion is a witch,

543
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,800
made us ill and fed us boiled-down toads.

544
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,000
Nanny McPhee is not a witch, Eric.
You're very naughty to say so.

545
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm sure she knew what she was doing.

546
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,500
- She must be fully trained.
- Yes, but as what?

547
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm unbelievably hungry, Evangeline.

548
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,000
Can you please get us
something decent to eat?

549
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,500
Did you just say "please"?

550
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,900
[children] Please, please, Evangeline!

551
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,200
Well, children,
I hear you've been in bed all day

552
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,100
but that you're better now.

553
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,500
It wasn't our fault.

554
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,700
I'm sure it wasn't anybody's fault.
You can't help it if you're ill.

555
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,700
But you're better now.

556
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,000

[crashing thud]

558
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,900
- Papa?
- Yes, Chrissie?

559
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,300
Now that we're better, can we get up?

560
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,500
- Erm...
- [children] Can we get up, please?

561
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,200
[tinkling breeze blows]

562
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,300
Of course you can.

563
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,100
Read to us.

564
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,700
I, erm... I have my letter-writing to do. I...

565
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,600
I'll read to you tomorrow.
Goodnight, my dears.

566
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Evangeline,

567
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
please ask Cook to make the children
scrambled eggs on toast.

568
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,700
I'm sure they'd like supper
now they're feeling better.

569
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,000
I'll do it myself, Nanny McPhee.

570
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
- [clears throat gently]
- [tinkling breeze sighs]

571
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,300
Didn't she have two bumpy things?

572
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,600
The word is "wart".

573
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Traditionally associated with witches,
as it happens.

574
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,900
Well, one of 'em's gone.

575

- [magical wind rushes]
- [gasps]

576
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,700
I did knock.

577
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
Of course you did.

578
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Lesson two, to get up when they're told,
is complete.

579
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,400
Of course. Very good. Thank you.

580
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

581
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,900
- Nanny McPhee...
- Yes, Mr Brown?

582
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,400
Didn't you used to have two...

583
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,900
w...w...?

584
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Never mind. It's, er... it's my imagination.

585
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,000
[church bell tolls]

586
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,200
There was a telegram, Mr Brown.

587
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.

588
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
- Ah, Nanny McPhee.
- Pa!

589
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,300
Good, good, good.
All right, I have an announcement.

590
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,000
Yes...

591
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Your Great-Aunt Adelaide
is coming for tea today.

592
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,900
[grizzles]

593
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,900
- No!
- Aunt Adelaide is vile and vicious.

594
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,600
She's blind as a bat.
And we are convalescing, for heaven's sake!

595
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,300
That's enough. I don't want to hear
anything bad about her. She pays the rent.

596
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,000
- She scares me.
- She's only coming for tea.

597
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,500
You'll all put your best clothes on

598
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,200
and Nanny McPhee will keep you in order.

599
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,800
I shall do my best, sir,
considering that today is Sunday

600
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and I am off duty this afternoon.

601
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,000
- [jingle]
- Off duty?

602
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,100
- [rattle jingles]
- Mm.

603
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,800
- [rattle jingles]
- You're off duty when...?

604
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,900
You can't be off duty.
I need you. They need you.

605
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,100
- [jingle]
- I shall be leaving at noon.

606
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,900
Thereafter, I'm sure the children will do
exactly as they're told. Won't you, children?

607
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,800
Listen to this, dear. Aunt Adelaide says,

608
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,500
"l am coming with the express intention

609
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,700
of easing your financial burden."

610
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,100
Maybe she's thought the better
of my having to remarry.

611
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,000
Perhaps I won't have to go through with it.

612

614
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,400
[Sebastian] I hate my best clothes.
They're itchy.

615
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
Well, we promised, so that's that.

616
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,900
Tora's right.
We should do exactly as we're told.

617
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,200
We've been told to put
our best clothes on, haven't we? Right.

618
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,500
Well, I'm going to put
my best clothes on...the pig.

619
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,100
Simon, no.

620
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,900
- Yeah, the pig!
- Oh, please, don't!

[horses snort]

622
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,600
- Aunt Adelaide, welcome back.
- Where are you?

623
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,100
- Here I am, Aunt Adelaide.
- Oh! Don't crowd me so.

624
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,500
You're looking very peely-wally.
Where's my tea? I must have tea.

625
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,400
Of course. This way. At once.

626
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,500
I smell damp.

627
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
[sniffs] No, no... At least not noticeably.

628
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,200
Damp in the house.
Hence your pallid complexion.

629
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,400
Lovely hat.

630
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,500
A gift from the Duchess of Kent.
She has taste.

631
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,700
- I've always hated this room.
- [chuckles]

632
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,500
- Milk?
- Certainly not.

633
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,000
Filthy stuff. Most unhealthy.

634
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,600
- Sugar?
- Six, if you please.

635
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,300
Six.

636
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,600
Let me not beat about the bush, Cedric.
You have too many children.

637
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,200
- Ah, that.
- Don't interrupt.

638
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,700
Your wife, my poor, weak-minded niece,
had no sense of proportion.

639
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,000
However, I know where my duties lie.
I gave her my word that I would help.

640
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,500
As you know, Cedric, my word is my law.

641
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,100
I now propose to help you further.

642
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,400
- Oh, thank you, Aunt Adelaide. Thank you.
- Don't interrupt. Sit down.

643
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,200
This is my proposal.

644
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,200
I shall relieve you of one of your children...

645
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,300
and give it a home with me at Stitch Manor.

646
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
[thunderclap]

647
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,000
[gasps]

648
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,900
It will require sacrifice on my part.
I realise that.

649
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:54,100
But as my sainted father always said,
"Duty, Adelaide, always duty."

650
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,800
- You mustn't. I can't possibly...
- Thank me enough. I know.

651
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,800
You must feel quite overwhelmed
by the benefits of such a plan.

652
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,700
Your fortunate daughter,

653
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,500
for it must be a girl
and not one of those other things,

654
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,600
will receive private tuition
in literature, history, deportment

655
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,100
and above all, elocution.

656
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,600
If there's one thing I won't stand for,
it's loose vowels.

657
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,500
What did Papa say? He must have
told her not to even think of it.

658
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,100
He didn't say anything.

659
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,400
[Tora sighs]

660
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,100
Come on. Let's find the others.

661
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,800
I must be frank.
There is no question of your taking...

662
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,400
Hush now! I'm used to taking responsibility
for other people's mistakes.

663
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,200
Now, where is the bulk of your offspring?

664
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,700
- Ah. Here we are.
- [oinks]

665
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,900
- Oh!
- Baaagh!

666
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,300
- It was a bee. A big bee. Erm...
- Good heavens!

667
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,600
Gone now. Phew.

668
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,900
- Hm.
- You're not well, Cedric.

669
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,600
The sooner you find a good wife, the better.

670
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,700
- [brays]
- This'll put her off wanting any of you girls.

671
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,800
- [oinks]
- Speak up, girl!

672
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,700
Oh! What an unfortunate face.

673
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,900
All those bristles.

674
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,400
It might be very hard
to get her decently betrothed.

675
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,700
[oinking]

676
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,400
Do you not have a more comely girl?

677
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,900
[panting]

678
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,100
[clucking]

679
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,700
- Erm... perhaps round the front of the house.
- Oh!

680
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,100
[pig oinks]

681
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,900
- [brays]
- Chrissie, hurry up!

682
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,900
- Tie it, Chrissie.
- [braying]

683
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,000
- [shrieks]
- [Simon] Eric, stop her!

684
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,200
- Chrissie, stop! She'll see you!
- Papa!

685
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,800
Cedric, I had no idea
that you had produced such a...

686
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,400
such an unattractive batch of females.

687
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,600
I shall leave directly. Get my hat.

688
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,400
Your hat? So soon?

689
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,500
- Really? No, you can't... I'll get it.
- Hewitt!

690
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,900
No!

691
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,300
- A-ha!
- [gasps]

692
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,500
Oh, yes. You'll do perfectly.

693
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,600
A little timid, perhaps,
but we'll soon knock that out of you.

694
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,100
Come on, come on. It can't do any harm to try.

695
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,200
I can't find your... What are you doing?

696
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,700
- This is the chosen one. Get her ready.
- Papa, help!

697
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,000
- Chrissie? You're not listen...
- Shut up, Cedric, and do as you're told!

698
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,500
Nanny McPhee, we need you.

699
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,300
- Nanny McPhee, please, we need you.
- [magical wind rushes]

700
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,600
- Where is my hat?
- [donkey braying]

701
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
[brays triumphantly]

702
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,300
Hide!

703
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,100
My hat!

704
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,600
- How dare you!
- [creaking]

705
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,700
- [crashing thud]
- [brays]

706
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,100
[chuckles]

707
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,500
- Oh, my, what a merry game.
- Yoo-hoo!

708
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,300
My, my, what a pretty girl you are.

709
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,600
[donkey whistles merry tune]

710
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,400
Oh, this is the girl for me.

711
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,400
Run.

712
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,800
Such poise, such gaiety.

713
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,100
- Ah, there you are, staff.
- Yes, madam.

714
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,400
I'm taking this child with me. Get her ready.

715
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,900
[blows smoochy kiss]

716
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,000
Very well, madam.

717
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,600
Sherry time.

718
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,100
[magical breeze sighs]

719
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,300
Do not forget that someone
has to go with your great-aunt

720
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,000
and it cannot be the donkey, can it?

721
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,400
[birds caw]

722
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,600
[Tora] Well, I'm the eldest girl. I'll go.

723
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,800
[Lily] No. I've always known
I was destined for tragedy. I'll go.

724
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,900
[Aggy] Aggy go.

725
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,600
[Eric] Don't be silly, Aggy.
You're not even a whole girl yet.

726
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,000
[Chrissie] No. She wanted me. I'll go.

727
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,300
[Sebastian] You can't all go.

728
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,500
Well, I am entirely satisfied.

729
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,200
I will keep my word, Cedric,
if you will keep yours.

730
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,000
You must give those children a mother
before the month is out.

731
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,700
No.

732
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,800
What?

733
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,300
You cannot order me around. And you
certainly can't take any of my children.

734
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,100
- l...
- [magical breeze blows]

735
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,000
Your carriage awaits, madam.

736
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,300
Is the chosen one seated?

737
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,700
- lndeed she is.
- Good.

738
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,500
- All is prepared.
- Which chosen one? What's prepared?

739
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,500
Cedric, in view of this afternoon's
happy outcome,

740
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,400
I am willing to overlook
that last unattractive outburst.

741
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,100
- Nanny McPhee.
- Off we go, Hewitt.

742
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,100
- What have you done?
- I have done nothing, sir.

743
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,800
The children have decided
amongst themselves.

744
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,300
Decided what? What do you mean?

745
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,600
[Adelaide] There you are, dear.

746
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,000
- Not little Chrissie.
- [coachman cracks whip] Yah!

747
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,700
Chrissie!

748
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,000
- [coachman] Yah!
- [whinnying]

749
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,600
Chrissie!

750
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,000
Yah!

751
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,100
Chrissie!

752
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,000
Now, then, you'd better
tell me your name, little girl.

753
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,800
[bleating]

754
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,800
- [whip cracks]
- Yah!

755
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
- Christianna!
- Don't be shy, my dear. What is your name?

756
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,600
- [shrill whinny]
- Yah!

757
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,800
Sit up straight and tell me your name.

758
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,200
No!

759
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,500
- Christianna!
- Papa!

760
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,500
Papa! Papa!

761
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,100
Oh! [murmurs]

762
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,500
Then...then who...?

763
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,200
Evangeline. My name's Evangeline.

764
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,800
[crashing thud]

765

- [magical wind blows]
- [chuckles]

766
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,700
And what a pretty name it is, too.

767
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,100
Evangeline...

768
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,300
Oh.

769
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
- [horse whinnies]
- Yah! Yah!

770
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,000
[tinkling breeze blows]

771
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,300
Time for bed.

772
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,300
- Thank you for saving me, Nanny McPhee.
- Hm.

773
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,000
Yes. Thank you.

774
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,400
Thank you.

775
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

776
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,500
[magical breeze blows]

777
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,800
Hm.

778
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,800
Papa was going to let her take me.

779
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
No, Christianna.
Your father would never have allowed it.

780
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,500
- Goodnight, children.
- [children] Goodnight, Nanny McPhee.

781
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,400
[magical breeze sighs]

782
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,300
She hasn't got any warts at all now.

783
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,300
Do you think she's using
some sort of cream?

784
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,000
[clock chimes]

785
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,100
[magical wind rushes]

786
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,000
Thank you, Nanny McPhee.
You were a tremendous help.

787
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,500
Not at all.

788
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,800
You will find that lesson three,

789
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,400
to get dressed when they're told,
is complete.

790
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,900
Just to get dressed when they're told?
They've learned a great deal more than that.

791
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,600
I have five lessons to teach.

792
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,400
What lessons they learn is entirely
up to them. Goodnight, Mr Brown.

793
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,600
- Nanny McPhee...
- Yes, Mr Brown?

794
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,200
She will be all right, won't she?
Evangeline, I mean.

795
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,800
I can't help being concerned.

796
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Aunt Adelaide can be so, erm...
Well, you saw.

797
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,700
She will certainly be all right.

798
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,600
Good.

799
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,600
I suppose she volunteered to go, did she?
Couldn't wait to be shot of us, I imagine.

800
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,700
Not quite.

801
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,500
It was Simon's idea.

802
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,200
He knew Evangeline
might like to educate herself

803
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,600
and that her going would save Christianna.

804
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,500
He's a very clever boy.

805
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:44,400
Good heavens. Simon, eh?
Well, good for him. Quick...quick thinking.

806
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,900
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

807
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,500
[sighs deeply]

808
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,900
So that's it, then.

809
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,000
I shall have to marry...Quickly.

810
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,300
[magical breeze zings and whooshes]

811
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,900
[Sebastian laughs]

812
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,600
[clears throat]

813
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,100
Children, your father has asked me to tell you

814
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,300
there's a Mrs Quickly coming for tea tomorrow.

815
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,300
- Nanny McPhee?
- Yes, sweetheart?

816
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,900
Can you stop Papa
from marrying a horrible stepmother?

817
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,600
I'm afraid not.

818
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:26,300
- Even if you wanted to?
- Even if I wanted to.

819
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,300
I cannot interfere with affairs of the heart.

820
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,300
Perhaps Simon could talk to him about it.

821
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,700
He won't listen.

822
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,100
[seagull cries]

823
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,500
You have a visitor, Mr Brown.

824
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,300
An especially eager visitor, Mr Brown.

825
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,200
Quickly by name...

826
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,600
Oh!

827
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,000
Simon, my boy.

828
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,500
Well, come in.

829
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,600
Come on, I won't bite.

830
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,700
- Father, we want to ask you something.
- Well, of course.

831
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Of course. Anything at all. Ask away.

832
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,900
Who is Mrs Quickly?

833
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,300
[chuckles feebly]
Good heavens, such a face. She's, er...

834
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,200
She's...she's a friend. She's...a friend.

835
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,300
Just a friend?

836
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,900
Well, my boy,
it's not exactly any of your business, is it?

837
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,300
It is if she's to be our new mother.

838
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,400
Who said anything about that?

839
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,600
It is true? You are going to marry her?

840
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,900
You go too far, Simon.

841
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,600
- You must not question...
- I didn't.

842
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,600
- Don't contradict me!
- I'm not!

843
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,700
You do not understand the adult world.

844
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,800
You know, there are certain things that...

845
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,700
certain things...

846
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,400
You will leave me this instant. Go home!

847
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
You never listen!

848
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,000
[door slams]

849
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,700
Nanny McPhee?

850
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,700
Nanny McPhee?

851
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,400
[creaking]

852
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,400
[crystalline tinkling]

[floorboard creaks]

854
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,000
[crashing thud]

855
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,600
Hello, Simon.

856
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,400
Can I help you?

857
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,800
I did knock.

858
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,100
I know. I heard you.

859
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,200
May I be of assistance?

860
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,700
Er...

861
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,000
We need you to, erm...

862
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,800
I mean...you saved Chrissie.

863
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,700
And so...

864
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,700
You're on our side, is what I mean.

865
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,900
Aren't you?

866
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,800
You saved Chrissie, and I do not take sides.

867
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,900
I...we... need you to help us
get rid of this woman, Mrs Quickly.

868
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:54,700
It will not surprise you to hear
that I cannot agree to that, Simon.

869
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,800
Then let us do whatever
we have to do to get rid of her.

870
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,800
Are you prepared to accept
the consequences?

871
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,500
Yes.

872
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,600
- You promise?
- Yes. Yes, absolutely, I promise.

873
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,800
Hm.

874
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Then I will, as you put it,
let you do whatever you have to do.

875
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,100
Thank you.

876
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,400
Thank you.

877
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,600
- [honking]
- [screeches] Aaah!

878
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,200
Look at them! Will you just look at them?

879
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,200
Aw!

880
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,600
The little, small things.

881
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,200
Children, this is, er... Mrs Quickly.

882
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,500
Oh, you mustn't be so formal.

883
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,100
You must call me Auntie Selma.

884
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,100
Oh, dear me, one does work up
such a thirst in this heat.

885
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,800
Oh. Tea, of course. Do go through. I'll...

886
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:00,100
And leave these dear creatures?
How can you ask it of me?

887
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,600
- Oh, the heart of the house.
- Yes, yes.

888
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,900
- The old bachelor's den.
- Mm.

889
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,400
- Well, l...
- lsn't it enchanting?

890
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,900
Ooh! Have you read all those books?

891
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,200
- Well, l, er...
- Clever.

892
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,600
- Take my chair. It's more comfortable.
- Thank you. Ooh!

893
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,600
Well, what have we here?

894
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,600
I see there is already provision for a lady.
How thoughtful you are.

895
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,800
What a gentleman.

896
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,700
Wait! Er...just let me
make it, er...comfy for you.

897
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,500
Too, too precious.

898
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,500
Here in the centre of the male dominion,

899
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,100
- [boing!]
-..an oasis of feminine charm and elegance.

900
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,700
There, just as I thought. It's dusty.
It just needs a good old thump.

901
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,900
There. All thumped and ready to go.

902
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,500
There you go again.
Nothing is too much trouble for you.

903
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,600
I observed that very characteristic
on the sad day we buried Mr Quickly.

904
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,200
Even in my demented grief,
I said to my friend Letitia Carter...

905
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,900
Remember her? A pinker complexion
than my own. She takes too much sun.

906
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,200
I said, "Kindness seems to be
second nature to him."

907
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,400
"He is a perfect gentleman."

908
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,600
"There's something so masculine
and yet retiring in his manner..."

909
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,600
[squeals] Mr Brown!

910
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,000
[she giggles]

911
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,100
- Urgh.
- Un moment, I pray you.

912
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,300
I don't know what came over me.

913
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,800
I do. I understand. I never took you for such.

914
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,800
But now I see it.
Passion is clearly your nature, too.

915
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,100
I feel it. Who would have thought
we were such kindred spirits?

916
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:55,500
Passion is my life.
In fact, Mr Brown, what is life without it?

917
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,300
- Er...
- A grey wheel of habit, spinning idly on.

918
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,300
- Mmm!
- [giggles]

919
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,400
[Mrs Quickly] Mmm!

920
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:13,000
- This is no time for food, Mrs Quickly...
- Selma.

921
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,000
I couldn't possibly swallow it
under the circumstances.

922
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,600
You are tempestuous, Mr Brown.

923
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,000
- Tea?
- Yes, tea.

924
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,900
We must blanket the raw impulse
with that reliable beverage.

925
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,000
[croaks]

926
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,000
That's a nice bit of porcelain. Is that Spode?
I like a bit of Spode. Tasteful.

927
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,800
Anyway, so essential
for upholding the normal...

928
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,400
- You don't want that.
- How right you are.

929
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,300
You see into my inmost self.

930
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:50,300
What is tea when we can drink
from the nectar of our emotions?

931
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,400
Let the common herd drink tea.

932
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,400
Our souls need a more divine libation!

933
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,100
- [wibbling]
- Whoa...whoo-ow!

934
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,100
Oh! You mad fool! I say.

935
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,200
No, no, not here amongst the cutlery.

936
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,700
- I say! [giggles]
- [rattling]

937
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,700
I must go before my reputation
is in tatters on this rug.

938
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,100
Lovely rug. Is it Chinese silk?

939
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,900
Must escape before all is lost.

940
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,500
Wait!

941
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,200
Heavens to Betsy! You are inflamed!

942
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,000
How does a lonely widow best you?
What defences does she have?

943
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,600
All it takes is one question, Cedric,
and I'm yours.

944
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:41,200
- Ask me or you'll lose me forever.
- Oh, no... Absolutely.

945
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,000
[Mrs Quickly] Say it. Say it.

946
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,100
- Say it. Say it.
- No!

947
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:53,300
Oh! No! This is too much, sir!

948
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,700
You are a cad!

949
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,800
A bounder and a cad! [sobs]

950
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,500
- [children giggle]
- Yeah!

951
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,500
[Simon] Papa's coming.

952
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,100
She's gone.

953
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,700
The only person in the whole world
who stands between all of us

954
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,700
and total ruin...

955
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,700
and she's gone.

956
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,500
What's ruin?

957
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:42,500
There's no time to mince words.
I can't support my own family.

958
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,300
I never have been able to.
There are so many of you.

959
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,700
But you're all so delicious.

960
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,300
When Aggy came along
and your mother was so ill, I said,

961
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,900
"We may have to stop now, dear,"
and she said...

962
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,600
She said, "l know."

963
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,400
The fact of the matter is,
your Great-Aunt Adelaide

964
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,500
has been supporting us for years
with a monthly allowance.

965
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,200
A little while ago, she told me

966
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,500
that I had to remarry
or the allowance would stop.

967
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,700
This woman today was my last chance.

968
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,000
Our last chance.

969
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,000
Ours?

970
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,100
When the money stops,
the house will be taken.

971
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,800
Some of you will perhaps
be put into the workhouse.

972
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,600
Some will be put into the care...
into the care of others.

973
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,400
I don't know how many of you
will be allowed to stay together.

974
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,300
I'm sorry to have failed you, children.

975
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,000
You deserve so much better.

976
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
- Do something.
- What would you suggest?

977
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:17,200
Change what happened.
Bang your stick. Make it undo itself.

978
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,600
I cannot. These were your actions.

979
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,400
Simon promised that you would
accept the consequences.

980
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,100
What shall we do?
Help us. Tell us what to do.

981
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:31,900
- You must undo it for yourselves.
- How? How?

982
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,500
Think.

983
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,500
You are very clever, children.

984
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,300
Think.

985
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,700
[women cackle with laughter]

986
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:47,600
- So, 'e was keen?
- Oh, Letty, he was in a maddened condition.

987
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,000
He couldn't keep his hands off me.
But I held firm.

988
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:56,000
I said, "Shedric..." I mean, "Cedric,
I have my reputation to uphold."

989
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,200
"It's marriage or nothing.
What do you take me for?"

990
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,800
- [knocking]
- "Some common...?"

991
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,600
- Tart?
- Not for me. I'm bloated.

992
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,200
- No. "Some common tart." You said...
- [knocking]

993
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,100
- Who's that knocking?
- [lamb bleats]

994
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
- It might be him.
- Ooh!

995
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,600
If you've come to fumble
with my fastenings... Oh.

996
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,900
[rattle jingles]

997
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,200
Mrs Quickly, we're very sorry about the tea
you had with our father.

998
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,200
Typical of a man, sending his little ones
to do the dirty work.

999
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,900
No. He doesn't know we're...

1000
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,600
I mean, he very much wants to marry you.

1001
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,900
I know what he wanted.
No wonder there's so many of you (!)

1002
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,600
Wait. Father wasn't being rude.
No one on earth could be less rude.

1003
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,000
He was protecting you from
the naughty things we were doing.

1004
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,400
- The toad in the teapot.
- And the wormy sandwiches.

1005
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,000
That was my idea! I mean, my fault.

1006
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,200
I have no idea to what you can be referring.

1007
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,600
Don't try to make excuses for him.
He's a flounder and a gad.

1008
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,300
He's not. He's a good man.
He was just trying to save us.

1009
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,400
If he doesn't marry, all the money will go.
We'll be thrown out onto the streets.

1010
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,500
- Money? What money?
- Our Great-Aunt Adelaide's money.

1011
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,200
Lady Adelaide Stitch.

1012
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,100
Lady? Ooh!

1013
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,300
- Mr Brown.
- Mrs Quickly.

1014
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,800
- Your children have explained it all.
- Explained?

1015
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,900
That their tricks during tea was a result
of their motherless condition,

1016
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,900
that they need a woman's presence
to calm them,

1017
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,800
and that you could benefit from that presence,

1018
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,100
pathetic and lonely as you are.

1019
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:42,400
And all it takes is one little question, Cedric.
[clears throat]

1020
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,000
Oh. Oh, y... er...yes, of course.

1021
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,700
Erm...just give me...Yes.

1022
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,900
- Mrs Quickly...
- [whispers] Selma.

1023
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,000
Yes, I mean Selma.

1024
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,300
Would you do me the honour
of becoming my...

1025
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,900
-..of becoming my...
- Wife.

1026
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:11,400
- Exactly. Wife. That's the word.
- Yes. Oh, yes, Cedric.

1027
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,100
Mmm.... mwa!

1028
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,900
Off you go now, dears.

1029
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,900
Let Daddy have a little moment to himself
with your new mummy.

1030
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:34,500
(Nanny McPhee) A bit big for this nightie, aren't
you, sweetheart? We'll have a new one made.

1031
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,400
I'm sorry.

1032
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,300
I should have told you. I can see that now.

1033
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,400
If I'd discussed it with you before,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

1034
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,900
No, it was our fault.

1035
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,300
We should have known you had
a good reason for getting married.

1036
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:13,900
At least this way, we'll all be together.
That's what matters most, isn't it? Hm?

1037
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:17,400
I promise I'll never hide anything
that affects us from you again.

1038
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,800
I see you're more than capable
of understanding it.

1039
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,100
- Papa?
- Yes, my boy?

1040
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,600
Do you think Mama still thinks about us
where she is?

1041
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,700
I'm sure she does.

1042
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,700
I know she does.

1043
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,300
Now, Chrissie,
why don't you choose us a story?

1044
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,000
[woman]  Tiptoe by

1045
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,700
-  Where my babies lie...
- Lesson four is complete.

1046
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,400
 In your tiny silver shoon...

1047
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,100
Lesson four?

1048
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,900
To listen.

1049
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,600
Well done.

1050
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:17,400
 Will you watch over, please

1051
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,800
 My wee ones

1052
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,400
 My lambkins

1053
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,600
 My sweet chick-a-chickadees

1054
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:37,500
 Loola-bye, oh, loola-bye

1055
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:51,100
 In your tiny silver shoon 

1056
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,800
- [church bells ring]
- [lamb bleats]

1057
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,000
[Mrs Quickly] The big day.
I do love my weddings.

1058
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,800
Mr Brown. What's he really like?

1059
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,700
No idea. Keen as mustard
to tie the knot, though.

1060
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:08,700
Had to sort this out quick.
Only got the sheep dipped yesterday.

1061
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,700
But he's easily controlled,
unlike his nasty little brood.

1062
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,400
However will you manage them, Selma?

1063
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,600
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Never you mind.

1064
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,700
I started off by giving them a good clean-up.

1065
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,200
Oh, don't they look lovely?

1066
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,900
Sebastian, your top button is undone.

1067
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:33,500
Lily, you have a little hair caught
in your crook. Eric, help her, please.

1068
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,500
Your father will be down in a moment.

1069
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,400
Now, that is an improvement.
Letty, go and keep a lookout.

1070
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,500
I say, whatever your name is,

1071
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,900
give me a second on my own
with the little darlings?

1072
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:57,800
Now, my dears, there's going to be
some changes made round here.

1073
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,700
I'm in charge of this household now

1074
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,400
and while I'm in charge,
you children will behave.

1075
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,400
Do you hear? Behave.

1076
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:15,000
- [Aggy jingles rattle]
- Behave.

1077
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,500
And we're not having any of that nasty noise
all the way through my nice wedding.

1078
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:27,600
- [grizzles uncertainly, then sobs]
- Shut her up.

1079
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,200
Naughty.

1080
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,700
It's our mother's rattle. Give it back.

1081
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,200
I'm your mother now.

1082
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,900
Time to adapt.

1083
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:49,100
- [magical breeze sighs]
- Hm.

1084
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,000
[footsteps]

1085
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,200
- Papa, Mrs Quickly...
- Sh!

1086
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,600
Yoo-hoo, Cedric.

1087
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,400
I realise the bride and groom
shouldn't meet until the ceremony,

1088
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,500
- but you and I are old hands at this.
- [hoofbeats]

1089
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,800
- [horse whinnies]
- She's here! Lady Stitch!

1090
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,600
Selma, there's footmen.

1091
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:16,400
- [Cook sputters] Oi, make way!
- [Letty squeaks]

1092
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,500
Where's the woman?

1093
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,200
- Aunt Adelaide...
- Shut up! Where's the woman, Cedric?

1094
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,800
May I present my...fiancee, Selma Quickly.
Selma, this is Lady Stitch.

1095
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,900
Your Ladyness. Welcome, if I may be so bold,

1096
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,700
to our humble, nay, lowly festivities.

1097
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,200
You shower glory upon us from above.

1098
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,200
The very air about you shines with...

1099
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:48,600
with...with aboveness.

1100
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,000
A gracious welcome, I must say.
Rise, my dear.

1101
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,000
Here are the children
in their, erm...shepherdess outfits.

1102
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:00,400
Well, that's the girls.
The boys... I'm not sure what they are.

1103
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
But, erm...anyway, you can see.

1104
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,000
Oh, keep up, will you?

1105
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,300
[whispers] Who's that?

1106
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,500
- It's a princess.
- A fairy princess.

1107
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,000
It's Evangeline.

1108
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:41,700
Straight back. Remember your vowels.

1109
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,400
May I present my adopted daughter,
Miss Evangeline Stitch.

1110
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,000
What are we doing milling about
in this dreary vestibule?

1111
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,400
Sherry this instant.

1112
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,100
Might I beg the honour of pouring
the privileged schooners myself?

1113
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,300
[perfectly plummy]
Delectable to see you again, madam.

1114
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,700
Blinkin' hell!

1115
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,900
And how nice to see the young people.

1116
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,200
Welcome back, Evangeline.
You look well. Are you well?

1117
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,400
I am most content.

1118
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,400
You must be very happy
to be marrying again.

1119
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:33,400
Oh, yes, I'm... I'm...
How did you put it? Most content.

1120
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,500
Of course. Good grief.

1121
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,200
I am so glad.

1122
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,600
- [Adelaide] Evangeline!
- [bell jangles]

1123
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,400
Pray excuse me.

1124
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,100
Are you sure it's Evangeline?
It doesn't look anything like her.

1125
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,100
Nonsense. She's always looked like that.

1126
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,100
[they play  Here Comes The Bride]

1127
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,000
[bleating]

1128
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,400
[hums along]

1129
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:30,400
What can we do?
There has to be another way.

1130
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,900
- Behave.
- Beehive.

1131
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,000
You must do as you're told.

1132
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,500
- Behave.
- Beehive.

1133
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,700
Lesson number five, Simon.
You must do exactly as you're told.

1134
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,300
[violins crescendo]

1135
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,400
Beehive.

1136
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,000
Beehive?

1137
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,900
Please be seated.

1138
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,000
There isn't a beehive. What do you mean?

1139
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,800
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together

1140
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,800
in the sight of God
and in the face of this congregation

1141
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:19,400
to join together this man and this woman

1142
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,500
in holy matrimony,

1143
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:28,100
which is an honourable estate
instituted of God

1144
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,200
in the time of man's innocence...

1145
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,300
..and commended of St Paul...

1146
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,900
- [children] Bzzzzzz!
-..to be honoured among all men.

1147
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,700
Get off!

1148
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,600
- And is therefore...
- Get off!

1149
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,300
-.. not by any man to be enterprised...
- There's one on you!

1150
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:54,100
.. nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, wantonly...

1151
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,500
- There's one on your back!
-..to satisfy man's carnal lusts...

1152
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:03,200
It's the flowers on her dress!
They're attracting them!

1153
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,500
- I hate bees. I'm allergic.
- There aren't any bees, you fool!

1154
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:09,400
No, truly, I swell up.

1155
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:13,600
[hisses] They're trying to ruin
my lovely wedding. Nasty, vicious creatures.

1156
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,400
- Do something!
- [children buzz energetically]

1157
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,700
Cedric, look at me. Do you see any bees?

1158
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,500
[other children buzzing]

1159
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,400
I said, look at me!
Do you see any bees? Do you?

1160
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,000
- Do you?
- I do.

1161
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:41,900
- Ooaah!
- It's all right. I've got the little bugger.

1162
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,600
[yelps] It's on me!

1163
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:49,900
- [gasps]
- Lord love a duck! I'm so dreadfully sorry!

1164
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,400
[children giggle]

1165
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,200
No, no, no, no, no...

1166
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:01,100
- [children laugh]
- Oh, my Lord. Your Higherness!

1167
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,500
[gasps]

1168
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,400
[both laugh uproariously]

1169
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,700
- [Cook] Don't touch the cake!
- Get the tarts!

1170
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,400
- Not me good ones!
- [Lily] Ow, he hit me!

1171
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,600
- [Lily] Attack!
- Aaargh!

1172
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,700
Not the cake! Not the cake!

1173
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,300
Right! I'll have the lot of you!

1174
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,300
Simon, bowling practice.

1175
01:22:56,900 --> 01:23:00,600
- [gasps]
- [whooping and shouting]

1176
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,100
Evangeline, where are your manners?

1177
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,200
Sod my manners, you old trout.

1178
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,400
This is the first fun I've had in weeks!

1179
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,300
- Oh, Lord.
- Letty, my hair. Where is it?

1180
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:38,700
[as Mrs Quickly]
"Look at them, the little, small things."

1181
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:44,100
That's it! You dreadful, awful,
monstrous creatures!

1182
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,600
Take your hands off my children!

1183
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,100
Cedric, it's over! I won't spend
another minute with this rabble

1184
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,600
and I don't care how much
the old hag is giving you.

1185
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,500
Letty, the lambs!

1186
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,200
- [lambs bleat]
- [Letty whimpers]

1187
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,200
- This dress is ruined!
- Absolute carnage!

1188
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,200
A nice choice for a wife, I must say, Cedric.

1189
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,300
I'm sorry. You gave me no time
to find anyone else.

1190
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:17,000
As for your children, a lengthy spell
in a corrective institution is long overdue.

1191
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:22,900
And you, Evangeline, I can see
that you are as wild as the rest of them.

1192
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,300
And proud to be. I love them, Lady Stitch,
which is more than you do.

1193
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,400
Insolence!

1194
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:34,500
I'd leave you here to rot,
but I gave my word that I would raise you

1195
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,800
and I never, ever, break my word.
Come away now.

1196
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,300
[magical tinkling]

1197
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,600
Wait, Aunt Adelaide! Wait!

1198
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,300
You agreed. You gave your word

1199
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,300
that if our father remarried this month,
you'd support us.

1200
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,100
I did.

1201
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,600
So if he marries today,
you'll have to keep your word.

1202
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,300
- Oh, you're wasting my time!
- No.

1203
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,300
No. No, I'm not.

1204
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,800
- He will marry today.
- What?

1205
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,100
- What?
- What?

1206
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,300
What?

1207
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,100
- Who?
- He'll marry Evangeline.

1208
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,600
Incest?

1209
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,700
No! No, Aunt Adelaide.
Evangeline isn't our sister.

1210
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,400
- Not your sister?
- Of course she's not our sister.

1211
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,100
Well, who is she, then?

1212
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,000
I'm his scullery maid.

1213
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,500
What?

1214
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:08,000
Evangeline, do you love Papa?

1215
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:15,000
Of course not. I know my place.
That wouldn't be right. I mean...

1216
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,500
Yes.

1217
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,100
Papa, do you love Evangeline?

1218
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,500
What? That would be totally improper.

1219
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:34,300
A thing like that could...could never happen.
I mean, obviously...

1220
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,800
Yes.

1221
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,000
He's marrying the scullery maid?

1222
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,400
Oh!

1223
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,900
- [thump]
- [magical tinkling]

1224
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,600
[creaking]

1225
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,300
- [crashing thud]
- [magical wind zings and whistles]

1226
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,800
[child] It's snowing!

1227
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,800
Well, I never! Snow!

1228
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,400
Snow in August!

1229
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,100
- [children laugh]
- I take it, then, Mr Brown,

1230
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,900
that the young lady
is not in fact the fruit of your loins?

1231
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:21,500
Because the Church would have to take
a rather dim view of it if she were.

1232
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,900
No. What happened was my son Simon
is a very clever boy.

1233
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,600
Evangeline...

1234
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,200
for the record,
whatever I may have said about stepmothers,

1235
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,400
that whole "evil breed" moment,

1236
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,100
most emphatically does not apply to you.

1237
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,900
This way.

1238
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:50,100
Jolly good. If I may then invite you all
to join us once more.

1239
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,700
Hallelujah.

1240
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,500
Oh, Nanny McPhee... I'm so nervous.

1241
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,800
Deep breaths.

1242
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,100
I don't look much like a bride, do l?

1243

You will.

[Nanny McPhee] There is something
you should understand about the way I work.

When you need me but do not want me,
then I must stay.

When you want me but no longer need me,

then I have to go.
