1
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>It was in the year of 1933,</i>

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,007
<i>and Grace and her father were</i>
<i>heading southward</i>

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,960
<i>with their army of gangsters.</i>

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,880
<i>After leaving Dogville,</i>
<i>they had returned to Denver</i>

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,160
<i>only to find that the mice</i>
<i>had been well and truly playing</i>

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
<i>while the cat was away,</i>

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>and new forces had taken over</i>
<i>their former possessions.</i>

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,720
<i>The result was a particularly</i>
<i>unappealing retreat that had brought them</i>

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,160
<i>through the state of Alabama</i>
<i>this spring</i>

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,640
<i>in search of new hunting grounds.</i>

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,200
Now, they will not admit it,

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,880
but it's a fact.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,720
Deep down inside,
there isn't a woman alive

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,840
who doesn't nurture
these fantasies...

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,320
whether they involve harems,
being hunted through the jungle

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,320
by torch-bearing natives.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,280
However much they go on and on
about civilization and democracy,

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,400
sexy it ain't.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,160
<i>Grace and her father</i>
<i>had resumed their legendary discord</i>

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,120
<i>even as they pulled out of Dogville,</i>

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,720
<i>and although Grace</i>
<i>had been employing the technique</i>

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,280
<i>of letting things go in</i>
<i>one ear and out the other</i>

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,920
<i>for a pretty long time now,</i>

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,160
<i>she was, to be frank, somewhat weary</i>
<i>of her unbearably overweening daddy</i>

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,200
<i>who still believed any nagging woman</i>
<i>could be pacified</i>

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,240
<i>with a good old</i>
<i>bouquet of carnations.</i>

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,840
I bet you wouldn't have had
the guts to talk like that

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,080
if Mother had been alive.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,120
No. You're right, my girl.
I would not.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,200
We're goins', boss.

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,120
Miss? Lady?

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,760
Can I talk to you?

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,200
Can I talk to you?

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,440
Miss?

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,920
They gonna whip him.
I knew they would.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It just ain't true;
he ain't stole nothin'

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,080
They put that Rhenish wine
from Mam's bedside table in his cabin

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,520
just to give 'em
something to whip him for.

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,320
That's the law...
one bottle and it's a whippin'

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,640
That's Mam's law.

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,320
What are you talking about?
Who? Who are they gonna whip?

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Timothy.

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,600
Why?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,280
That's how they do us slaves.

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,440
- Slaves?
- Yes, ma'am.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
Surely you heard of slaves.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,120
It's what we is at Manderlay.

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,280
This godforsaken place.

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,040
That's how I got out.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,960
When a whippin's in the offin',
they take out a section of the fence.

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,000
Listen, Grace,
it's a local matter.

52
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,240
It's not for us to poke our noses in.

53
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,280
Why should we not
poke our noses in

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,120
- just because it's a local matter?
- It's certainly not our responsibility.

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,880
You think the Negroes
wanted to leave their homes in Africa?

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,600
Wasn't it us who brought them
to America?

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,440
We have done them
a great wrong.

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
It's our abuse that has
made them what they are.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Untie him.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
Stop!

61
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
'Fraid not, lady.

62
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,480
Slavery was abolished
70 years ago.

63
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
If you won't obey that law
of your own accord,

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,080
we will compel you to do so.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
Help me get her inside.

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,440
Get water for Mam.
Act quickly, Rose.

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
Spare me your hypocrisy.

68
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,800
You dumb old slave.

69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Get out!

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,640
Leave us alone.

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,160
If you're looking for sympathy,
don't expect any from me.

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,360
Listen...

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,400
I'm very old...

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,800
...unfortunately dying.

75
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,960
I should like to ask you
for a favor.

76
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,760
If it involves allowing you to go on
exploiting these people like slaves,

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,320
I'm sorry, I'll just have to say no,

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,040
no matter how dying you are.

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,400
Slavery's over now.
I can see that.

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,760
It had to come one day.

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
All right.

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
I'll probably refuse you,
but you might as well ask.

83
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
There's a book
under my mattress.

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,360
I should like you to retrieve it...

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,680
...and burn it for me.

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,040
- It would be best for everyone.
- I'm sure you think so.

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,280
But it's my view that anything,
no matter what,

88
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,240
is best served by being
brought out into the open.

89
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,440
I beg you,
one woman to another.

90
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,560
Woman to woman...
makes no difference to me.

91
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,560
The sins of the past are sins
I cannot and do not wish to help you erase.

92
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Now I must leave you.

93
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,640
I believe my father's men
have unlocked the gates.

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,560
Now everybody can come
and go as they please.

95
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,720
Please let everyone else know
on the plantation

96
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,360
that from now on, they can
all enjoy the same freedoms

97
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,040
as any other citizen
of this country.

98
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,800
The Constitution can be found
at any courthouse.

99
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,480
And here's a tip
for when you sue the family.

100
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,400
There's a weighty written evidence
concealed in this very room.

101
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
She's dead.

102
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,440
The old devil.

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

104
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,880
I didn't mean it, Missy.

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
No, no, if any of us
deserves an apology, it's not me.

106
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm afraid.

107
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,640
There's nothing to be afraid of.

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,400
We've taken
all the family's weapons.

109
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
No.

110
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I'm afraid of what will happen now.

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,920
I fear we ain't ready...

112
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,520
...for a completely new way of life.

113
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,120
At Manderlay,

114
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,640
we slaves took supper at 7:00.

115
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,720
When do people take supper
when they're free?

116
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,280
We don't know these things.

117
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,280
Free men eat when they're hungry.

118
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,880
Free women as well.

119
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,360
<i>Considering the times</i>
<i>and the situation,</i>

120
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,880
<i>Grace's words</i>
<i>in the dead woman's room</i>

121
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,280
<i>on mealtimes for free citizens</i>
<i>might have seemed a trifle over-spirited.</i>

122
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,080
<i>We should not believe</i>
<i>that there lay any content in these words</i>

123
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
<i>for the wretched</i>
<i>and starving people of America.</i>

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,640
<i>Grace rejoined the gangsters</i>

125
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
<i>who had indeed</i>
<i>concluded their disarmament</i>

126
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,520
<i>of the plantation's</i>
<i>powers that had been,</i>

127
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,480
<i>though their findings</i>
<i>were meager...</i>

128
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,880
<i>the shotgun</i>
<i>and an old toy pistol.</i>

129
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
All right, we can go.

130
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,440
Let's just wait a moment.

131
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
What are you waiting for?

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
For them to come and thank you?

133
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,760
Or for them to burn
the whole place down

134
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,200
and dance some tribal dance
on the ruins by the glow of the torchlight?

135
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,320
You are a bigot, Daddy,
and you always have been.

136
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,360
We owe these people.

137
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,320
We brought them here,
we abused them,

138
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,200
- we made them what they are.
- I admit I don't do deals with the Japs.

139
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,440
Can't trust 'em
when there's big money at stake.

140
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
But a bigot?

141
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,640
Well... why don't they come out?

142
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,520
That's exactly
what you said last time.

143
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
Last time?

144
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,960
Remember when you were six?

145
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,280
You thought it was so sad
that your beloved Tweety

146
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,360
was all shut up in a cage,

147
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,040
and nobody could persuade you
not to let him out.

148
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,160
Tweety was a proud little bird.

149
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,160
Well, his dignified exit
didn't do Tweety a hell of a lot of good.

150
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,640
We found him the next morning
underneath your window,

151
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
- frozen to death.
- I know!

152
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,960
He'd been bred as an indoor bird.
He really didn't have a chance.

153
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,000
And what do you think
those Negroes in there are?

154
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,200
How many generations do you think
those families made their homes

155
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,320
behind that fence?

156
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,320
I bet you most of them
have taken up employment

157
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,040
in their former jobs
with the family, contracts and all.

158
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,920
Of course, now they'll get
a few dollars for their efforts,

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,840
but they'll soon drink that up,
and maybe they'll borrow a bit more

160
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,760
from their employers,
who have, no doubt,

161
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,280
opened a little store
full of colorful wares just for them.

162
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,800
And of course, they'll never
be able to pay back the money,

163
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
and they'll be trapped yet again.

164
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,400
What you did was all very noble,
my girl, but...

165
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,000
...when push comes to shove,
you've just made everything far worse,

166
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,560
just as you did with Tweety.

167
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
So all we can do...

168
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,920
...is hope there's no frost.

169
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,840
What you said about
contracts and loans...

170
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
- that's fraud.
- Fraud.

171
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,640
See, I've read...

172
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,040
...that...
- Yes?

173
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,440
...freed slaves are given
a mule and a plot of land

174
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,480
so that they can
establish themselves.

175
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,600
Yep, that's true.

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,240
But when it came down to it,
the fella who owned the mule and the land

177
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,760
had rather keep it all
for himself,

178
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,720
so nothing really
ever happened with it.

179
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Anyhow, it may take them a while
to gather the evidence

180
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,880
against the plantation for when
the family goes on trial.

181
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,280
Trial?

182
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,120
Tater-pie, there are times
when you seem even less with it

183
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
than your dear mother.

184
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,720
Oh, I seem to have
underestimated 'em.

185
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,280
We've at least one man
with a genuine thirst for freedom,

186
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,800
and he's gettin' out,
and he's in a hurry.

187
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,960
Yeah, he's hightailin' it, all right.

188
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,320
Yeah, that's Gramps.

189
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,200
- Pardon me.
- Not a lot of dignity there.

190
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,920
He's scared out of his wits.

191
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,840
Would it be possible
to have a word with the young lady?

192
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,360
Yes, yes.

193
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,920
Don't mean to inconvenience you.

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,200
That's exactly what you're doin'

195
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,480
You're not inconveniencing anyone.

196
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,760
This is a grave day
for everyone, I know that.

197
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,040
I just thought we must've seemed
a mite bit ungrateful.

198
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,720
We should like to thank you properly
for what you've done.

199
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,600
It'll only take a moment.

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,240
- Yes, of course.
- Ten minutes.

201
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,880
Then I'm gone.
Not a second longer.

202
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,040
<i>Grace was conducted</i>
<i>through the wretched living quarters</i>

203
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,000
<i>bestowed upon the slaves</i>
<i>with their pitiful leaky cabins.</i>

204
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,600
<i>Her actions would comprise</i>
<i>an unconditional enrichment</i>

205
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,880
<i>of these people's lives.</i>

206
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,840
<i>There was no doubt about that.</i>

207
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,640
<i>Or was there?</i>

208
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,960
<i>Actually, Grace did not see</i>
<i>much of the glow she had hoped for...</i>

209
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,080
<i>the glow that could've</i>
<i>convinced her</i>

210
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,680
<i>that no one would end up</i>
<i>like her little pale yellow canary.</i>

211
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,200
<i>These were human beings,</i>

212
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,560
<i>but of the kind on whom</i>
<i>pain had been inflicted, Grace thought,</i>

213
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,640
<i>as she was suddenly interrupted</i>
<i>by a strangely exotic accent.</i>

214
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,320
When we were slaves,

215
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,120
we were not required
to offer thanks for our supper,

216
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,240
and for the water we drink
and the air we breathed.

217
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,160
Nobody needs to say
thank you, but...

218
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,400
But what?

219
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,360
I mean, there is something
we ought to be thankful for?

220
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,120
I didn't mean "but."
I meant "and."

221
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
And...

222
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
There's no reason
to be grateful for anything

223
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,960
as natural as your freedom.

224
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,640
I'm the first to apologize
for everything...

225
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,640
...you and your people
have been subjected to.

226
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,480
See, those gates should've been
unlocked 70 years ago.

227
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,320
Only 70 years ago?

228
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,520
But before that, of course,
they were completely justified.

229
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,640
No.

230
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,800
No, no, you misunderstand me.

231
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,720
What can I say?

232
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,800
You need say nothing at all.

233
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,640
We've heard of your kind.

234
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,760
You're a society lady
who spends her time

235
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
rescuing wretched niggers.

236
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,000
I should like to say thank you.

237
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,320
Missy done give her time
and effort to helpin' us.

238
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,120
Time I'll bet she could've spent
on all kinds of different things.

239
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,280
'Cause was perfect justice
when God made some of us slaves

240
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,000
and not others.

241
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,680
The nigra is vile by nature.

242
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,880
I know it ain't popular to say so,

243
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,400
and it ain't 'cause of Bert
that I say so. Hmm.

244
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,840
<i>No, Victoria</i>
<i>did not base her perception</i>

245
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,560
<i>exclusively on her experience</i>
<i>of her husband, though God knows,</i>

246
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,920
<i>it weighed heavily.</i>

247
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,160
<i>Bert was a useless eejit</i>

248
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,360
<i>whose character Victoria</i>
<i>regrettably, so far in vain,</i>

249
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>had done her best to improve</i>
<i>by hitting him with any implement</i>

250
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,440
<i>at hand on any given occasion,</i>

251
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,400
<i>no matter how much he had</i>
<i>threatened to take his own life</i>

252
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,720
<i>by throwing himself into</i>
<i>Manderlay's deep well.</i>

253
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,440
<i>Grace looked at Wilhelm,</i>
<i>the old house slave, and understood.</i>

254
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,760
<i>He had not brought her here</i>
<i>for anybody to thank her.</i>

255
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,880
<i>He just wanted her</i>
<i>to see them all...</i>

256
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,560
<i>the unfortunate flock</i>
<i>that he very rightly feared</i>

257
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,480
<i>would have few chances</i>
<i>beyond the perimeter fence.</i>

258
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,560
<i>Living proof of the devastating</i>
<i>power of oppression.</i>

259
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,360
- Listen up.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,960
This has all been put on paper.

261
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,920
I just needed to check
the wording first again

262
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,840
as these things
are legal and binding.

263
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,120
Bingo.

264
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,240
- What are these?
- Don't rightly know, ma'am.

265
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,520
They're the contracts, ma'am.

266
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
The family
has been so considerate

267
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,640
to offer us all employment.

268
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
<i>Grace was not a lawyer,</i>

269
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,960
<i>and unqualified to assess</i>
<i>the validity of the contract</i>

270
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,400
<i>she held in her hand,</i>

271
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,200
<i>but she feared that, unfortunately,</i>

272
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,160
<i>any judge in the county</i>
<i>would deem it fair and proper.</i>

273
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,360
<i>It appeared to Grace</i>
<i>that instead of employee,</i>

274
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,920
<i>they might just as well</i>
<i>have retained the old term of slave.</i>

275
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,960
<i>A body would only sign it</i>

276
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,360
<i>if he or she was utterly ignorant</i>
<i>of life in liberal society,</i>

277
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,800
<i>or if he or she</i>
<i>really had no choice.</i>

278
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,800
Folks, I suppose that
you're in urgent need of cash.

279
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,360
- Mark?
- Cash?

280
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,360
I once knew this fella
from a little township

281
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,560
nobody know the name of,
so there ain't no grounds to mention

282
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,880
what it was called.

283
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,000
He had cash.

284
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,200
Not piles of it.

285
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,920
We are prepared
to lend you some money

286
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,120
as covered by this
other piece of paper,

287
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,920
and we can also set up
a little store here, if you like.

288
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,120
After all, it's a long way to town.

289
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,280
And if you buy enough
for all of us,

290
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,080
I bet you're liable to get
a real nice bulk discount,

291
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,920
and the goods'll be cheaper
than in town.

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,720
Ain't that right, Miss Grace?

293
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,280
I have no idea.

294
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Please sign, everybody.

295
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,600
What this be?
What it is?

296
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,440
All right.

297
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,640
Let's go.

298
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,720
Turn it off.

299
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,040
Damn it.

300
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,640
Daddy, you said that I
didn't have the power to help Tweety.

301
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,800
You were right.

302
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,120
I was a child then.

303
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
So what is it this time?

304
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
This time,
I have the power to act.

305
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,240
You said so back in Dogville,

306
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,120
that your power
would be mine, too,

307
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,080
and that I could use it
in my own way.

308
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,280
That power was to carry on
the family farm.

309
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,480
That I was open to new ideas.

310
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,760
The power you ask for now
will undoubtedly

311
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,480
be applied to something
that's foolish at best...

312
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,520
Daddy, you promised.

313
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,280
Oh.

314
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,120
You were a bastard to Mother,

315
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,640
but when you promised
her something, she got it.

316
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,120
Okay.

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,720
You've been given
what I promised you.

318
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,240
Maybe things haven't been
split right down the middle,

319
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,680
but this is as far
as I'm prepared to go.

320
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,200
I want nothing
to do with your plans.

321
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,880
And you won't be able
to get in touch with me

322
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,800
if anything goes wrong
and you need me, as usual,

323
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,240
to get you out of trouble,
because fortunately, my dear,

324
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,440
you'll have no idea
where I am.

325
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,080
- Daddy, I'd like to take Joseph as well.
- No.

326
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,480
I need a lawyer to sort out
some paperwork.

327
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,080
No. No! Never!

328
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,800
Never!

329
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
I'd never let Joseph go.

330
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,920
He's the only man I know
who can draw up a contract

331
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
so there's only one
possible interpretation,

332
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,200
and though I haven't needed
that talent as of yet,

333
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,000
I still might need it one day.

334
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,280
I'll give you Viggo
and Bruno for him.

335
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,760
Never.

336
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,080
I've given you my best associates,
and you know it!

337
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,200
Daddy, I was meant
to have been given half.

338
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,600
If Mother had been alive...

339
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,520
Oh, damn it, Grace!

340
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,320
<i>So that very day,</i>
<i>and into the early hours,</i>

341
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,960
<i>Joseph employed</i>
<i>the celebrated unambiguous phrases</i>

342
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,960
<i>his previous employer had given him</i>
<i>so wretchedly little opportunity</i>

343
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
<i>to practice.</i>

344
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
<i>New contracts</i>
<i>needed drawing up,</i>

345
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,800
<i>and old ones</i>
<i>needed nullifying...</i>

346
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,640
<i>all with the astonishing good will</i>
<i>that parties always evince</i>

347
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,880
<i>in the company</i>
<i>of rapid-firing machine pistols.</i>

348
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,160
These were the deeds of gift.

349
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,840
You transfer the property
to the former slaves in joint ownership.

350
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,080
The last document
is your contract of employment

351
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
by this community.

352
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,760
Employment? I don't...

353
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,280
...quite get
what you mean by that.

354
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,840
It'll be without pay,

355
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,080
and the right of termination
is rather one-sidedly

356
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,400
in the hands of the employer,
but nevertheless...

357
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,760
Manual labor...

358
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,400
for you and your family
and Mr. Mays.

359
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,360
Hard labor.

360
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,520
Say something, Bingo.

361
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,200
My father's back
ain't so strong.

362
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,720
He climbed up
to reach the chandelier

363
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,520
one Christmas day,
and he fell off the banister

364
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
and struck a table.

365
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
Well, that's what happens
when you've got chandeliers.

366
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,920
When I consider
that your understanding

367
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,560
of the worth of other
human beings

368
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,840
has reached
the desirable stage,

369
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
you and Mr. Mays
and your family

370
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
will be allowed to go.

371
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,040
Go?

372
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
- And leave our home?
- Yes.

373
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,920
And I assure you that
even starting from scratch,

374
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,640
your prospects will be
a lot better than your former labors

375
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,640
would have been.

376
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,280
With regards to
the presence of me and my men,

377
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,560
we'll only act
as your counselors.

378
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,160
The guns are merely a precaution
in case of any threats

379
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,160
to the new community.

380
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,560
We intend to stay here,

381
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,280
but only until
the first harvest is home,

382
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,440
after which, any of the new
shareholders who wishes to do so

383
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
may cash in his or her deed of gift
and receive a dividend.

384
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,120
All right, will you
collect your deeds. Mark?

385
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,240
<i>Nobody</i>
<i>was particularly enthusiastic</i>

386
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,760
<i>or confident about</i>
<i>these late-night legal formalities.</i>

387
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,800
Victoria.

388
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,960
Flora.

389
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,440
<i>But Grace could see</i>
<i>beyond this,</i>

390
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,080
<i>and if she saw little else</i>
<i>than fear and disquiet</i>

391
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,680
<i>in all these eyes,</i>

392
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,680
<i>at least she saw gratitude</i>
<i>in one single pair...</i>

393
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,120
<i>namely, in Wilhelm's</i>
<i>mild old gaze.</i>

394
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,840
Bert.

395
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,040
Got a deed of gift here
that ain't been accepted.

396
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,840
Will Mr. Bert approach forthwith
and take delivery of his deed of gift?

397
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,040
Mr. Bert.

398
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,720
Mr. Berr?

399
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,480
<i>Bert had actually</i>
<i>prepared his escape</i>

400
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
<i>from his ferocious wife.</i>

401
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,240
<i>Despite her lack of faith</i>
<i>in his abilities,</i>

402
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,800
<i>Bert had succeeded</i>
<i>in meeting a woman</i>

403
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,200
<i>through the fence,</i>

404
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,120
<i>and she had agreed</i>
<i>to help him to abscond.</i>

405
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,120
<i>And there he was,</i>
<i>waiting at the agreed place</i>

406
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,200
<i>at the agreed time.</i>

407
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,600
<i>A helping hand,</i>
<i>the woman had said.</i>

408
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,160
<i>What a peculiar coincidence</i>
<i>that two women</i>

409
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,600
<i>should come to the aid</i>
<i>of the Manderlay slaves</i>

410
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,200
<i>at the same time.</i>

411
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,320
<i>Grace and Bert's</i>
<i>"helping hand."</i>

412
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,360
<i>And the similarities between them</i>
<i>were also peculiar.</i>

413
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,480
<i>Young, beautiful, white,</i>
<i>in male company.</i>

414
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,040
<i>Actually, male company</i>
<i>in alarming numbers.</i>

415
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Where's the nigger?

416
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,080
<i>Grace had moved</i>
<i>into the freed plantation</i>

417
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,800
<i>among its new shareholders.</i>

418
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,520
<i>She was there</i>
<i>as a guard, no more.</i>

419
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,560
<i>But no one could stop her</i>
<i>from using this beautiful spring</i>

420
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,400
<i>to make her own little observations</i>
<i>on the people of Manderlay</i>

421
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,720
<i>in the hope of spotting</i>
<i>the burgeoning change in character</i>

422
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,920
<i>that freedom ought to bring.</i>

423
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,640
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>she saw little of just that.</i>

424
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,520
<i>She saw Victoria for the third time</i>
<i>looking down the well</i>

425
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,880
<i>in hope of a glimpse</i>
<i>of the body of Bert.</i>

426
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,960
<i>She saw Flora and Elizabeth</i>
<i>swooning for Timothy as ever.</i>

427
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,680
<i>She saw the men</i>
<i>spending their time on card games</i>

428
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,520
<i>playing for tufts of blue cotton</i>
<i>under their leaky roof.</i>

429
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,960
<i>And she saw how everybody</i>
<i>would ignore the eager Mark</i>

430
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,080
<i>whenever he opened his mouth,</i>
<i>not knowing that he was notorious</i>

431
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,520
<i>for never being able</i>
<i>to give an intelligible answer to anything.</i>

432
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,520
Well, we called him Puddin' Head,
but his real name wasn't Puddin' Head.

433
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,800
<i>Grace saw Victoria</i>
<i>beating her eldest son</i>

434
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,240
<i>for stealing a moldy cookie.</i>

435
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,400
<i>And she saw the unstoppable,</i>
<i>irrevocable hierarchy of the beatings.</i>

436
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,720
<i>Victoria beating Ed,</i>

437
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,760
<i>Ed beating Milton</i>
<i>and Milton, Willie,</i>

438
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,760
<i>who finally vented his frustration</i>
<i>further down the food chain</i>

439
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,760
<i>on Claire,</i>

440
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,040
<i>who far too rarely</i>
<i>managed to make use of the window</i>

441
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,760
<i>with the outside handle</i>
<i>that her loving father Jack</i>

442
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,480
<i>had installed</i>
<i>as an emergency entrance.</i>

443
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,280
<i>Which also allowed her to fall asleep</i>
<i>every night to her favorite view</i>

444
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
<i>of the twinkling stars.</i>

445
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,320
<i>Every noontide,</i>
<i>Grace witnessed with pity</i>

446
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,480
<i>how the former slaves</i>
<i>were arrayed on the parade ground</i>

447
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,320
<i>with mysterious numbers</i>
<i>and marks beneath Mam's balcony,</i>

448
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,440
<i>as if nothing at Manderlay</i>
<i>had changed.</i>

449
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,000
<i>However, one of them</i>
<i>did not submit</i>

450
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,320
<i>to this all-too-soothing</i>
<i>power of habit.</i>

451
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,160
<i>Timothy, of course.</i>

452
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,240
<i>In a flash, his exotic pride</i>
<i>almost took Grace's breath away.</i>

453
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,640
<i>This day, Grace walked on</i>
<i>past the old peach house</i>

454
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>where the whites</i>
<i>were now detained,</i>

455
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,080
<i>put to work on sundry,</i>
<i>more or less needless little repairs,</i>

456
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,560
<i>on her way to the barn</i>
<i>housing her gangsters.</i>

457
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,960
So how's everyone doing?

458
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,120
I'm afraid the men
got nothing to do,

459
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,560
and it's not so good
for the morale.

460
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,760
In situations like that, your father
always came up with something.

461
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,360
I bet he did.

462
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
But it's patience that's required.

463
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,680
Not this much patience,
Niels says.

464
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,440
Niels' grandpa
was a cotton grower,

465
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,680
and he says the cotton
should have been sown ages ago.

466
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,200
The soil doesn't look ready.

467
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,200
Might be because
nobody's plowed it.

468
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,440
Maybe things are different here
from where your grandpa lived.

469
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,680
No, ma'am.
Don't reckon so.

470
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,160
Well, if... if it should've
been sown,

471
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,040
surely the people here
would be the first to know.

472
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,000
<i>As she did not</i>
<i>want to impose,</i>

473
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,160
<i>Grace's intercourse</i>
<i>with the former slaves</i>

474
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,680
<i>had been limited</i>
<i>to brief greetings and the like.</i>

475
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,600
<i>But now it was time for a talk</i>
<i>with some meat to it.</i>

476
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,880
Excuse me. Sir?

477
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,880
Mark? May I ask you something?

478
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,280
It's about planting the cotton.

479
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,920
I've been around
for sowin' and harvestin'

480
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,400
and birth and death.

481
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,600
Right.

482
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,800
So when should the cotton
be planted?

483
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,240
There's strict rules for that.

484
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,160
You can't mess around
with that sort of thing.

485
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,160
Manderlay has always been
renown for the precision of its harvest.

486
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,320
The swallows always migrate
right afterwards.

487
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,600
They settle here for the night
on their way across the marshes.

488
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,800
But the planting?

489
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,080
It's a science, my dear lady,
and the weather,

490
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,440
which you might have expected,
plays a fearsome role.

491
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,040
Yes, yes.

492
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,200
And when will it
be time this year?

493
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,000
Not too soon
and not too late.

494
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,040
Yes, but when?

495
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,520
Should the cotton
have already been planted?

496
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm not the sort of fella
to pass on information

497
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,680
unless I'm damn sure of it.

498
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,000
Unless the facts of the matter
are 100%.

499
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,280
In other words,
the facts need be beyond dispute.

500
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
You know when to plant?

501
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,240
No.

502
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,480
I better ask Wilhelm.
Is he in his cabin?

503
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,160
This mornin', he went down
to the bathhouse.

504
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,960
He'd gotten a little frayed
around the edges, as they say.

505
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
- It's a funny thing...
- I'm sorry.

506
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,840
I'll go find him myself.

507
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Excuse me, Wilhelm.

508
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,240
I've come about the fields.

509
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,120
The fields should've been plowed
and harrowed three weeks ago,

510
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,600
and the cotton planted
two weeks ago.

511
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,160
But does everybody know that?

512
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,320
Oh, yes. But I reckon
they thinkin'

513
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,400
somebody else oughta go out
in the field first.

514
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,640
In the old days,
Overseer Mays

515
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,480
would've driven us out there.

516
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,800
Maybe it's because nobody
really trusts you, Missy.

517
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,280
Yeah. But Wilhelm, they could
be doing something else instead.

518
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,160
Repairs to their homes.

519
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,880
They badly need it.

520
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,360
The cabins have always
been a sore spot.

521
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,520
But Mam said we ain't got
no materials to fix 'em up.

522
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,720
But we're going to need
what we make on the cotton.

523
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,560
How else will people survive
on their own?

524
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:26,320
Yeah, if folks felt
they was given somethin'...

525
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,240
something brought out by this,
these new times...

526
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,640
...that made their lives better
in a convincing way,

527
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,560
right here and now!

528
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,920
I don't know
what that might be, but...

529
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,400
But we don't have time for that.

530
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,360
We've been forced to sow late before.

531
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,320
The harvest might be improved
if we planted a bit late.

532
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,120
Even says that in Mam's Law.

533
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,520
Mam's Law?

534
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Yes, Mam's Law.

535
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,440
It's all the rules
for running the plantation.

536
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,000
But we weren't allowed to read it.

537
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,560
It was just for Mam and the family.

538
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,120
<i>Only for Mam and the family,</i>
<i>Grace thought.</i>

539
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
<i>Certainly no more.</i>

540
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,400
<i>And there on Mam's bed,</i>
<i>skimming through the old book,</i>

541
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,560
<i>well-filled with bizarre</i>
<i>and vicious regulations,</i>

542
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,120
<i>she came upon a page</i>
<i>that looked strangely familiar.</i>

543
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,000
<i>A table with numbers</i>
<i>from one to seven.</i>

544
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,720
<i>Somewhere Grace had seen</i>
<i>something similar, for sure.</i>

545
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,440
<i>Mam's Law revealed it all.</i>

546
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,400
<i>The Manderlay plantation</i>
<i>with its glamorous front mansion</i>

547
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,120
<i>and pitiful rear where the slaves</i>
<i>had their quarters</i>

548
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,920
<i>had been kept in an iron grip</i>
<i>by these very numbers.</i>

549
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,160
<i>They represented the psychological</i>
<i>division of the Manderlay slaves.</i>

550
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,720
<i>Sammy was a Group 5:</i>
<i>a Clownin' Nigger.</i>

551
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,160
<i>The formidable Victoria was of course</i>
<i>a Number 4: a Hittin' Nigger.</i>

552
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,360
<i>No wonder her husband Bert</i>
<i>had found it necessary</i>

553
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,240
<i>to accept "a helping hand"</i>

554
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,800
<i>even if it was</i>
<i>another color from his own.</i>

555
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,400
<i>Wilma and Mark</i>
<i>were Losin' Niggers.</i>

556
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,760
<i>Wilhelm was a 2: a Talkin' Nigger.</i>

557
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,720
<i>Flora was a Weepin' Nigger.</i>

558
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,640
<i>Et cetera et cetera.</i>

559
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,600
<i>There were Pleasin' Niggers</i>
<i>and Crazy Niggers by the dozen.</i>

560
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,920
<i>The final category,</i>
<i>Number 1: Proudy Niggers</i>

561
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,760
<i>consisted nowadays</i>
<i>of Timothy, as expected,</i>

562
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,200
<i>who was of course not there.</i>

563
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,560
<i>And Elizabeth.</i>

564
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,600
<i>No. It said 7, not 1.</i>

565
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,480
<i>She was a Pleasin' Nigger,</i>
<i>also known as a chameleon...</i>

566
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,400
<i>a person of the kind</i>
<i>who could transform herself</i>

567
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,920
<i>into exactly the type</i>
<i>the beholder wanted to see.</i>

568
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,280
<i>This was how the slave system had</i>
<i>been kept alive for so long at Manderlay:</i>

569
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,680
<i>bondage,</i>
<i>even through psychology.</i>

570
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,120
<i>As Grace, in deep thought, gazed</i>
<i>across the fields of Manderlay,</i>

571
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,480
<i>she recalled</i>
<i>another page in Mam's Law,</i>

572
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,720
<i>dealing exclusively with</i>
<i>the weeding of the paths</i>

573
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,760
<i>in the romantic</i>
<i>"Old Lady's Garden,"</i>

574
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,600
<i>the name of the narrow band</i>
<i>of woodland that skirted the plantation.</i>

575
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,120
<i>"Trees and tree trunks,"</i>
<i>Grace thought.</i>

576
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,960
<i>So there were materials</i>
<i>at Manderlay, after all.</i>

577
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,920
Excuse me.

578
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,920
May I ask you all something?

579
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,560
Isn't it true that somebody
who's even poor and colored...

580
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,560
...can still take the trouble
to maintain their home?

581
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,600
How dare you?

582
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,520
You think colored folks prefer holes
in their roofs and wallowing in mud?

583
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,800
Then all you need to do
is to mend those holes.

584
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,440
But I told you.

585
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,480
There ain't never been no materials
for that kind of thing at Manderlay.

586
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,120
No materials?
That's not true.

587
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,560
When I'm in the fields,
I see timber wherever I look,

588
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,480
just waiting to be turned
into boards for a roof,

589
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,040
or an extension
or maybe even a whole new cabin.

590
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,640
That be Mam's garden.

591
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,120
You can't cut that down.

592
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,360
Then why can't we cut down
The Old Lady's Garden?

593
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,320
Have you really spent that many
happy hours up there on your knees

594
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
weeding her romantic paths?

595
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,640
That's true.
There's loads of timber.

596
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,160
We ain't seen it as anything
but The Old Lady's Garden.

597
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,040
I don't know what you think,

598
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,040
but to me, it sounds like
a splendid idea.

599
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,800
<i>And at a stroke, these seated,</i>
<i>reclining, resting people</i>

600
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,360
<i>had turned into people</i>
<i>going full tilt...</i>

601
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,680
<i>walking,</i>
<i>running, working people...</i>

602
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,520
<i>without anyone having to threaten</i>
<i>them in the slightest</i>

603
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,240
<i>with "The Lady's Hand,"</i>

604
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,080
<i>as Grace had been told</i>
<i>the great whip was called.</i>

605
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,360
<i>And Grace had won</i>
<i>a kind of victory.</i>

606
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,800
<i>A small beginning of something</i>
<i>that would one day erase</i>

607
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,040
<i>all the negative, inherited</i>
<i>behavior patterns of Manderlay.</i>

608
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,200
<i>But as Grace had suspected,</i>

609
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,720
<i>the appetite for</i>
<i>improving the living quarters</i>

610
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,880
<i>unfortunately exceeded that</i>
<i>for preparing the fields.</i>

611
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,000
<i>A few of the former slaves</i>
<i>had volunteered,</i>

612
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,440
<i>and with the white family</i>
<i>and Grace herself,</i>

613
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,480
<i>they made up a sort of gang</i>
<i>to prepare the soil for the seeds</i>

614
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,920
<i>under the gaze of</i>
<i>a demonstratively hostile Timothy</i>

615
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,160
<i>with his mysterious</i>
<i>white handkerchief.</i>

616
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,920
- He wasn't born here?
- He's a Munsi.

617
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,040
It's a line of African royalty.
It's a very proud line.

618
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,520
He don't drink either,

619
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,720
or gamble like the others be doin'
with their little blue tufts of cotton money.

620
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,480
It was Mam's Law.

621
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,680
We weren't allowed no real money.

622
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,600
<i>Grace knew about the clever system</i>
<i>of currency in Mam's Law.</i>

623
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,480
<i>Not real money that you</i>
<i>could use in the outside world.</i>

624
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,040
The Munsi don't gamble 'cause
they don't believe in winnings.

625
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,080
They believe you have to be
humble to your crops

626
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,640
and only take
what's absolutely necessary.

627
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,720
I've never heard
of these Munsi before,

628
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,560
but I do believe
I once heard of the Mansi.

629
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,480
They different.
They was slaves of African kings.

630
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
They gamble.

631
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,080
They is true mischief, Timothy say.

632
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,800
So Timothy has
prejudices, as well.

633
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,120
What?

634
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,320
Oh, nothing.
I was just thinking aloud.

635
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So you find company, Flora.

636
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,600
No, no. I was on
my way out, anyway.

637
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,720
Timothy?

638
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,240
Let me tell you one thing.

639
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,560
I know you don't like me
and don't trust me,

640
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,560
and I can see why.

641
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,520
Although our ideals differ,
you have a pride within you,

642
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,600
that I believe will one day be
the salvation of everybody at Manderlay.

643
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,080
Let me tell you one thing, too.

644
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,160
You got fine words, a posse
of gangsters, and your white skin...

645
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,560
somethin' folks here seem to fall for,
but I ain't fooled.

646
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,720
You're not interested in us,
not as human beings.

647
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,400
After all, it's tough telling people apart
when they're from another race.

648
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,720
We whites have committed
an irreparable crime

649
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
against an entire people.

650
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,840
Manderlay is a moral obligation,

651
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,280
because we made you.

652
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,160
Luckily, I'm just a nigger
who don't understand such words.

653
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,280
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've come
here for the company of my girl,

654
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,400
and that ain't nothing
for you to see.

655
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,480
Black hides meeting.

656
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,600
And if I were you, I would leave now
before things get too nasty.

657
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,640
<i>Grace regarded Timothy's hostility</i>
<i>as a challenge,</i>

658
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,520
<i>and the very next day,</i>
<i>she took a step to dispel his claim</i>

659
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,680
<i>that as a white, she was incapable</i>
<i>of caring for blacks as individuals.</i>

660
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,960
<i>She'd had a chat with Venus about</i>
<i>her somewhat maladjusted son Jim.</i>

661
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,920
<i>Venus had revealed</i>
<i>that Jim's behavior</i>

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,920
<i>was merely that of</i>
<i>a budding, but frustrated, artist.</i>

663
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,000
Tell me, have you seen Venus?

664
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,720
Nobody here wants your charity.

665
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,760
I have something for Jim.

666
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,000
I've had a really good look
at his face since our little chat,

667
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,360
and you're right.

668
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,640
It does possess an artist's sensitivity.

669
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,920
This is far too much.

670
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,320
No, no, no!

671
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,640
Go on, call him.
These are for him.

672
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,480
Jim, come on out here
with me and Miss Grace, baby.

673
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,720
These are for you,
because we believe in you.

674
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,560
Now run along
and paint your fantastic pictures.

675
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,480
Never mind those close-minded folks
who think they know

676
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,320
what art is meant to look like.

677
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,080
Give them hell from me, Jim!

678
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,120
Excuse me, but I ain't Jim.
I'm Jack.

679
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,400
That's Jim.

680
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,680
It is tricky.

681
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,120
As a matter of fact, I've never
been able to tell them apart, either.

682
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,200
They're both colored,
and they both got curly hair.

683
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,200
Why look any deeper than that?

684
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,760
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>Grace had never been quite sure</i>

685
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,360
<i>which was Jim</i>
<i>and which was Jack...</i>

686
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,280
<i>a blunder that would, in her former</i>
<i>life among her fellow whites,</i>

687
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,440
<i>merely have occasioned</i>
<i>a little laughter.</i>

688
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,200
Thank you, ma'am.

689
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,200
<i>In her life at Manderlay,</i>
<i>it was disastrous.</i>

690
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,920
<i>But like her father, she did not take</i>
<i>long to transform a defeat into anger,</i>

691
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,680
<i>energy and a counterattack.</i>

692
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,520
This... this is what has created
all this resistance.

693
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,640
Even you regard it
as almost sacred, don't you?

694
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,640
I must admit it's played
a right important part in my life.

695
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,120
That will be my next move.

696
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,840
They shall be allowed to see it...

697
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,360
...and understand
that it can't do them any more harm.

698
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,040
I wouldn't advise it, Missy.

699
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,800
Presenting it to them would
be like showing the child the rod

700
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,760
with which it's been beaten.

701
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,640
I agree it must be made public,
but we ain't all ripe for it.

702
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,480
All right.

703
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,800
Then we shall have to see about
ripening you, and quickly.

704
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm not talking about the couple
of cozy meetings I've organized

705
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,840
to which hardly anybody turned up.

706
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
I mean teaching with a timetable...

707
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,920
old-fashioned,
hands-on schooling.

708
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,560
All right, I've got
something for you to do at last.

709
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,840
It even involves
bossing people about.

710
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,160
At noon tomorrow,

711
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm going to give my first lesson
to all of the former slaves of Manderlay.

712
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,880
It'll be your job
to make sure they're there.

713
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,560
No excuse for not showing up.

714
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,000
And the family?

715
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,520
No, they're pretty well
teaching themselves.

716
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,080
Are you listening to me?

717
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,920
It's 'cause Niels
just got a great hand.

718
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,680
What?

719
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,080
Who are you?

720
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,880
My name is Dr. Hector.

721
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,640
Do excuse me a moment.

722
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,600
I'll have to pay my way
out of this round.

723
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,440
God knows, I don't believe you possess
any cards of real significance.

724
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,800
You have a poker player's face.

725
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,800
You can see here
my entire enterprise.

726
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,440
I must say, I've never gained access
to Manderlay before.

727
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,800
So when I drove by today
and saw the gates were open,

728
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,360
I took it as a sign of new times.

729
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,880
What exactly do you do?

730
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,920
I entertain.

731
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,520
Party games, card games,
and the like.

732
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,000
Well, nowadays,
mainly the latter.

733
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,040
You play for money.

734
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,240
But I do more than play.

735
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,840
I cheat.

736
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:55,360
And you have no objections to revealing
this... business secret of yours?

737
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,240
Oh, to some people,
but not to you.

738
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,400
No, no, you see,

739
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,160
if you and I establish the business
relationship I'm anticipating,

740
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,400
you'll be happy to know
exactly what to expect.

741
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,160
And what can I expect?

742
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,920
Eighty percent.

743
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,920
You certainly know
all the problems that arose

744
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,640
when our beloved New Deal
was imposed in '65.

745
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,280
Plantation owners had plenty
of land, but nobody to work it.

746
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,320
So they contracted
with the former slaves.

747
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,600
But they just didn't have
the same hold on the rascals

748
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,800
that they had in the old days.

749
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,240
Of course they lent them money.

750
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,800
But quite a few
of the nigras actually saved up

751
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,120
and paid off their debts.

752
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,680
So the plantation owners got worried.

753
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,240
- I bet they did.
- Oh, yeah.

754
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,600
That's where my idea came in.

755
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,920
I went from plantation
to plantation

756
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,680
with the full backing
of the plantation owners

757
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,080
to entertain their employees, and
they were sorely in need of diversion,

758
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,440
let me tell ya.

759
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,280
We just had a little game of cards.

760
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,160
If anyone was close
to repaying his debt,

761
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,680
I would take the shirt off their back.

762
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,400
And I am prepared to offer you
that very same service today, ma'am.

763
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,360
You are not convinced.

764
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,560
Let me give you another token
of my profound loyalty.

765
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,760
I have here a letter from
a man by the name of Stanley.

766
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,520
He asked me to smuggle it out.

767
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,040
Thought perhaps you'd like to see it
before it's mailed.

768
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,800
Listen, Mr. Hector...

769
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,320
Let me just say
that I have never met a man

770
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,760
whom I have instantly despised

771
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,440
so wholeheartedly, both for
his personality and his occupation.

772
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,360
Does that mean you're
turning down my offer?

773
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,280
I never want
to see you here again.

774
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,080
All right.

775
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,400
Well, I am disappointed.

776
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,000
I shall nevertheless bestow
upon you my thought for the day.

777
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,800
I indulge in word games.

778
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:26,200
I like to give my clients something
to laugh or think about when I leave.

779
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,840
The best technique
for a card sharp...

780
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,920
...is dealing from the bottom.

781
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,640
Look as if you're dealing
from the top of the deck...

782
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,800
...but instead you just take
the bottom card... one that you know.

783
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,840
Taking from the bottom
means something else entirely

784
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,760
in social terms.

785
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,560
But it is what I do.
I take from the bottom.

786
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,360
It won't be hard to find me
if you change your mind.

787
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,840
<i>The letter was aimed</i>
<i>at a Mr. Miller,</i>

788
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,240
<i>one of the truckers who</i>
<i>picked up cotton from Manderlay,</i>

789
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,000
<i>and the plantation's only</i>
<i>real contact with the outside world.</i>

790
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,240
<i>It was short and to the point:</i>

791
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,240
<i>"We are being held prisoner by</i>
<i>gangsters and coloreds at Manderlay.</i>

792
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,960
<i>Inform the police and please come</i>
<i>to our aid with all due dispatch."</i>

793
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,840
<i>Indignation</i>
<i>is a rare emotion for a gangster,</i>

794
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,480
<i>but a state of just that was</i>
<i>what Grace's men experienced</i>

795
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,120
<i>while they herded the colored people</i>
<i>in for their lesson that day,</i>

796
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,640
<i>as Grace had reported on Dr. Hector's</i>
<i>cheap trick of taking from the bottom.</i>

797
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,080
<i>It was hardly the sophisticated</i>
<i>ambiguity of the term</i>

798
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,520
<i>that had affected them</i>
<i>so dramatically.</i>

799
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,960
Welcome to our lesson.

800
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,760
Yes, I call it a lesson,
as the term "meeting"

801
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,960
seems to have scared
some people out of attending.

802
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,600
I was comin', but I was late.

803
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,600
Very late.

804
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,040
You hadn't made it
by the time we finished.

805
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,640
In the old days we could hear the bell
from the old clock in the hall.

806
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,920
It was easy to keep up with time,
but we never hear it no more.

807
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,040
Probably because
nobody winds it up.

808
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,360
But now for the topic
of this lesson: Working together.

809
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,680
Only four people from your wing
helped to prepare the fields,

810
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,600
and only five helped to plant.

811
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,840
I'm not a shareholder
in this enterprise,

812
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,880
but if I had been,

813
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,320
and if I'd also been one of the five,
I would have felt cheated.

814
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,520
Democracy means
government by the people.

815
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,480
But, as it's not practical
for everyone to sit in Congress,

816
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,520
a method by which people may
express their views is required.

817
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,520
This method is called a ballot.
All right?

818
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,920
So, let's try it out.

819
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,600
We should choose a problem.

820
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,680
Anything anyone can't decide on?

821
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,000
If I may suggest a small matter...

822
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,800
Please do.

823
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:37,360
I reckon the little broken rake is mine,
but Flora reckons it's hers.

824
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,080
- It's my rake!
- That's an excellent suggestion.

825
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,720
It's a great example.

826
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,720
I assume you all know of this dispute
and all feel able to have an opinion on it.

827
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,120
Who does the community think
owns the rake?

828
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,120
It could turn out to belong
to both parties equally.

829
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,360
That would correspond nicely
with the subject of this lesson:

830
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,800
Working together,
sharing together.

831
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,960
All right, so who thinks
it's Elizabeth's rake?

832
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,000
Sammy?

833
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,720
I think...
I think it's Elizabeth's rake.

834
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,000
All right, all right!

835
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,080
<i>Slowly the point of Grace's edifying</i>
<i>discourse dawned on the majority.</i>

836
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,880
<i>Most of them thought</i>
<i>the rake was definitely Elizabeth's.</i>

837
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,760
<i>A few, that it was Flora's,</i>
<i>and nobody, that it could be shared.</i>

838
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,480
I still remain... undecided...

839
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,320
whether the rake
is Elizabeth's or Flora's.

840
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,160
Right. So, not surprisingly,
neither party receives Mark's vote.

841
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,680
From now on, the little broken rake
belongs to Elizabeth.

842
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,280
That's what ballots are like;
there are winners and there are losers.

843
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,080
But the community has spoken.

844
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,680
<i>And now Grace embarked on</i>
<i>a protracted explanation</i>

845
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,240
<i>of Flora's difficulties</i>
<i>raking without a rake,</i>

846
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,920
<i>and that owning things together</i>
<i>could have its advantages.</i>

847
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,200
<i>To make sure that everyone</i>
<i>understood the democratic principle,</i>

848
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,080
<i>the meeting carried out</i>
<i>another ballot at Jim's suggestion.</i>

849
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,760
I wanna talk about the fact
that Sammy be laughin' so loud

850
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,640
at his own jokes,
and they ain't funny.

851
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,240
And I'm tryin' to get some sleep,
and I can't get no sleep,

852
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,680
'cause he laughs so loud.

853
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,560
Mmmm.

854
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,960
Maybe perhaps there can be a time
when he can stop his jokes

855
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,600
and stop laughin',
so we can get some sleep.

856
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,120
You can't vote
on a man's laughter.

857
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,280
You can't vote on
a man's laughter, surely.

858
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,560
I'm hearing that it's at sundown.

859
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,120
At sundown.

860
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,520
That's what I'm hearing.
So let's do a vote.

861
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,880
All right, so that's settled.

862
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,560
Yeah, it is.
- It is.

863
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,440
That's democracy.

864
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,120
<i>Finally Wilhelm proposed</i>
<i>that it would be practical</i>

865
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,640
<i>if somebody was responsible</i>
<i>for winding up the clock</i>

866
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,160
<i>with its small but penetrating chimes.</i>

867
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,680
<i>And for mysterious reasons,</i>

868
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,400
<i>the probing though fairly passive artist</i>
<i>Jim was appointed,</i>

869
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,040
<i>despite the song and dance</i>
<i>his mother kicked up.</i>

870
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,760
He can't do it!

871
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,720
<i>Grace wound up the lesson</i>

872
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,680
<i>by announcing that the topic</i>
<i>for the next day would be:</i>

873
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,360
<i>Our anger</i>
<i>and how to communicate it.</i>

874
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,680
Maybe somebody would
at least tell me what the time is.

875
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,280
Ask Timothy.
He always know what time it is.

876
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,200
He tell by the sun.
He always do that.

877
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,080
Or we can always ask Wilhelm.

878
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,560
He's so old, he's from
before the clock ever got here.

879
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,880
<i>So Wilhelm and Timothy</i>
<i>each made his own suggestion</i>

880
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,880
<i>as to what the time was,</i>

881
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,960
<i>and they were</i>
<i>astonishingly close.</i>

882
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,520
<i>Wilhelm thought</i>
<i>it was eight minutes to.</i>

883
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,240
<i>Timothy thought</i>
<i>it was five minutes to.</i>

884
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:05,640
<i>Grace rejoiced quietly at this natural</i>
<i>ability they found so straightforward.</i>

885
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,200
<i>But rapidly two factions emerged,</i>

886
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,920
<i>one which insisted</i>
<i>it was eight minutes to,</i>

887
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,880
<i>and the other would not</i>
<i>hear of anything but five minutes to.</i>

888
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,320
<i>They were thus able to draw on</i>
<i>the day's learning and put it to the vote.</i>

889
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,760
<i>The result was five minutes to,</i>
<i>by a small majority.</i>

890
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,560
<i>And so it was decided:</i>

891
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,800
<i>The official time at Manderlay</i>
<i>was five minutes to 2:00...</i>

892
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,800
Five...

893
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,720
<i>Grace's first lesson of the day</i>
<i>took place in relative good humor.</i>

894
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,480
<i>But the second one...the one that</i>
<i>had unfortunately proved unavoidable...</i> -

895
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,760
<i>was severer in character.</i>

896
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,000
Read.

897
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:05,000
" Daily ration of food
for slaves from Category..."

898
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,760
Oh. Oh, no. "1... is..."

899
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,160
"Six ounces of solid food."

900
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,560
And they've always
been given just that,

901
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,600
no matter how little
there was in the stores.

902
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:26,840
That's a lot less
than Category 7, for example.

903
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,200
Why should a "Proudy Nigger"
have less to eat

904
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,440
than an "Eye-Pleasin'" one?

905
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,920
How can the way
your head seems to be arranged

906
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,320
have anything to do whatsoever with
the amount people are given to eat?

907
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,600
I really don't know, either.

908
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,440
Not precisely.

909
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,760
Do you, Mr. Mays?

910
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,440
It could be just to punish them
for their pride.

911
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,960
No, I just did what it said.

912
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:04,600
It mattered a lot to my mother
that we follow these rules.

913
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:11,160
I know of many places where everybody
got quite a bit less than six ounces,

914
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,200
and where
they began to eat dirt.

915
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,680
It's a kind of custom coloreds have
when food's scarce 'round here.

916
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,400
But it was forbidden
under Mam's Law.

917
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,880
That's not
what we're discussing here.

918
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,480
Don't you see what an affront it is,
to divide people up like that?

919
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,760
Folks is different.

920
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,640
Oxen and rabbits don't need
equal shares of fodder neither.

921
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,480
Both parties
would come down with bellyaches.

922
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,640
Stop it! I'm not at all satisfied
with what I've heard here today.

923
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,600
You're all speaking up
for this foolishness.

924
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,160
I'm going
to have to penalize you,

925
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,160
because so little effort
has been made in these lessons.

926
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,680
<i>That evening,</i>
<i>Grace thought that her idea</i>

927
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,840
<i>of making</i>
<i>the whites make up their faces,</i>

928
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,320
<i>which had seemed</i>
<i>so just and edifying</i>

929
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,760
<i>in her flash of anger that afternoon,</i>

930
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,600
<i>was perhaps a tad too much</i>
<i>in the wrong direction.</i>

931
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,720
<i>Even though Philomena herself</i>
<i>in her own childhood</i>

932
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,440
<i>would not have dreamt</i>
<i>of going to the toilet</i>

933
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,680
<i>without the entertainment</i>
<i>of her black nanny.</i>

934
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,760
Look at your Uncle Jim.

935
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,360
He's in the bathtub,
learning how to swim.

936
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,600
Can we clean our faces now?

937
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,400
Yes. Yes, of course.

938
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,600
Well...

939
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,240
Here comes the dust.

940
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,040
Then none of this
will matter anymore.

941
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,400
What do you mean?

942
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,560
There's gonna be a dust storm.

943
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,600
The plants
have only just begun to grow.

944
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,920
It couldn't be worse.

945
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,000
But Manderlay's fields have never
been harmed by a dust storm.

946
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,000
'Cause the windbreak
was still in place.

947
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,960
<i>Grace was not inclined to go into</i>
<i>what the former overseer meant</i>

948
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,960
<i>by these mysterious words.</i>

949
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,600
<i>Soon she had convinced herself</i>
<i>they had no meaning at all</i>

950
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,920
<i>apart from spreading</i>
<i>disquiet and despondency.</i>

951
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,920
<i>The next day's lesson</i>

952
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,240
<i>on the importance</i>
<i>of unleashing one's anger</i>

953
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,640
<i>met little understanding</i>
<i>from the assembly.</i>

954
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,440
<i>It was when they wound up</i>
<i>with a series of ballots</i>

955
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,000
<i>and the community</i>
<i>had rapidly decided</i>

956
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,320
<i>to use Wilma's potatoes for seed</i>

957
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,600
<i>as she was so old</i>
<i>and did not have to eat that much,</i>

958
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,680
<i>that they heard the wind.</i>

959
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,960
Jack, where you goin'

960
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,040
He goin' to get Lucifer.

961
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,000
<i>The dust had come at this time for</i>
<i>as long as anybody could remember.</i>

962
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,120
<i>But every year</i>
<i>from time immemorial,</i>

963
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,080
<i>it had spared</i>
<i>the newly planted cotton</i>

964
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:53,800
<i>as the plantation had been cleverly</i>
<i>shielded by a narrow band of trees</i>

965
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,320
<i>known in common parlance</i>
<i>as "The Old Lady's Garden."</i>

966
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:11,440
<i>In the midst of the almost biblical</i>
<i>darkness that descended on Manderlay,</i>

967
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,360
<i>Grace knew all too well</i>

968
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,560
<i>that even hand in hand</i>
<i>with all the races of the world,</i>

969
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,000
<i>no army of gangsters</i>
<i>could counter this:</i>

970
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,760
<i>Nature's extravagant</i>
<i>demonstration of power.</i>

971
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,160
<i>All she could do was watch</i>

972
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,640
<i>as row upon row</i>
<i>of the seedlings she had so welcomed</i>

973
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,160
<i>disappeared</i>
<i>beneath the devastating dust.</i>

974
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,640
<i>Nobody could do a thing.</i>

975
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,440
<i>But apparently it did not mean</i>
<i>that no one would try,</i>

976
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,000
<i>for now Grace</i>
<i>discerned a rider out there.</i>

977
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,680
<i>He was riding like crazy.</i>

978
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,080
<i>As he progressed</i>
<i>across the fields,</i>

979
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,000
<i>wherever he spotted</i>
<i>a pile of dust beginning to grow,</i>

980
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,080
<i>he would break it up</i>
<i>with his horse's hooves.</i>

981
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,920
<i>Whether it would make the slightest</i>
<i>dent in the grand scale of things</i>

982
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,880
<i>was hard to tell,</i>
<i>but it was a battle,</i>

983
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,720
<i>no matter how senseless</i>
<i>it might</i> be...

984
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,600
<i>heroic and dangerous.</i>

985
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,840
Timothy...

986
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,160
Come back!

987
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,760
Come back! Timothy!

988
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,160
- Timothy!
- Timothy's gonna be all right!

989
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,720
He knows these storms.

990
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,360
Miss Grace,
you's head over heels for him.

991
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,920
You's a fool, Miss Grace.

992
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,120
- Where'd you find him?
- He was behind the house.

993
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,320
Is he alive?

994
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,400
I do believe I know
what you mean by that question.

995
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,240
- But what does it mean, to be alive?
- It means, is he breathing?

996
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,680
Forget it.

997
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,440
Is he dead?

998
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,160
We colored folks can be awfully
hard to kill if we want it that way.

999
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,960
<i>That very afternoon,</i>
<i>strong Timothy was back on his feet</i>

1000
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,080
<i>surveying the buildings</i>
<i>for damage caused by the storm.</i>

1001
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,360
<i>The dust had struck</i>
<i>a devastating blow.</i>

1002
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,600
<i>Unfortunately, hardest hit</i>
<i>were the food stores</i>

1003
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,600
<i>in the dilapidated Peach House</i>
<i>which had lost its roof.</i>

1004
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,600
<i>Almost all of their provisions</i>
<i>were now inedible.</i>
