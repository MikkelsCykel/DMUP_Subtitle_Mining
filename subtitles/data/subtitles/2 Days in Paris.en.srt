1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,592
That is we.

2
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,392
Therefore, he/it and I.

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,597
We are very exhausted

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,194
from the trip.

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,512
We have Palazzos,
Vaporettos and Espressos seen.

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,680
A trip in Italy,
how the title of a film

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,433
with happy endings.

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,472
We were the most time in Venice,

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,269
because that is the city,
into the lover drive.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,151
And it is the city over water,

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,913
she/it will finish under water.

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,754
Green, ochers, pink, blue. Even this

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,799
Gray shines. That is Italy.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,549
And the pasta of course.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,032
Now, we are one right pair.
We are together two years.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,829
That almost is a miracle already today.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,231
Two years of luck with heights

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,595
and depths

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,116
and mostly somewhere between it.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,433
We only must pick up Jean-Luc,

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,118
him/it we between airport and railway station

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,157
with my parents put.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,074
The night train to Venice
my idea was.

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,913
On the way back, we want

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,719
for two days after Paris.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,633
Ah, my God!

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,718
He/it kills him/it!

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,590
That is not the cook,
this me almost stabbed,

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,559
because I Parmesan over them/her/it
Seafood-pasta scattered?

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,558
That is he/it!
- It was not so badly.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
I had 'ne food-poisoning
half of the trip!

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,835
Did you like then it something?
- The bathroom-view!

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,674
Could you call 'n taxi?
It already pours.

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,275
That was a drop.
- Immediately, it pours. Trust me.

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,036
I call one because you are out of sugar.
- I cannot become sick,

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,032
I immediately must work again.

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,112
No reception.
- Not however!

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,353
I get Sinusitis. The diarrhea
weaken the defense-strengths.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,558
A stop is over there.
The bus goes directly... - No!

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,999
No buses or subways in Europe!
Terrorism and so... - You believe,

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,675
New York is surer?
Paris is harmless,

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,469
here, there is not any terrorism.
- Yes, because France

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,237
a secret-agreement with this
fundamentalist terrorists have.

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,791
You damned psychopath!
I try once to get a net.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,158
Forgiveness, I heard you speaking.
You/they are Americans, or?

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,278
Yes, I am.
- We are

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,390
a group
international Code-Entschlüsseler.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,195
We shall ourselves at 10 o'clock with her/it
meet French group at the Louvre.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,436
Do you know whether he/it is in the proximity here?
- Yes, he/it is quite near. - Oh, really?

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,638
So near, that no taxi goes you.
They quite are zickig here.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,951
You/they must down-go only here,

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,591
to the left, then the first right...
- Right, left.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,675
...then 10 minutes always straight ahead,
and you are there. - Certainly? - Yes, yes.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,877
Have thank you!

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,352
Americans are so friendly, and
the French should be so impolite.

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,712
If a cliche admittedly is, but it is correct.
- We Americans must hold together.

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,712
Completely exactly. An enjoyment was for me.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,838
Good luck.
- Reunions, thank you!

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,998
Crack the code!

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,829
No taxi far and wide.
- No problem. - What is free?

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,673
What did they want? - Knowledge, where the Louvre
is and I told them hab's.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,116
Do you know then where he/it is?
- No.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,634
You said that they shall
since goes long, that is wide indefinitely!

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,871
Now, we get along taxi at the beginning of this-
Snake, the strongest things survive!

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,431
They now go directly into the suburbs.
That is your compatriots!

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,434
My compatriots!
They chose Bush!

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,877
They are Vinci-Tour on one there.
They are the embodiment of all,

68
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,874
what cultural and political
in this world incorrectly runs.

69
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,317
Maybe they see besides her/it
Mona Lisa still any riots,

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,670
this her/its/their political consciousness
rouse something.

71
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,437
You are so mean,
but you are right so! I love you.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,156
You are so clever!

73
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,749
Sinusitis!

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,793
Ah, this goes automatically.

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,474
Matter it you something,

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,350
to put the radio more quietly? We are
12 hours of train driven and is tired.

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,275
12 hours? Where do you come then?
- From Venice.

78
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,317
I hate Venice!
There, I was with my two wives.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,079
That is the program about women, this
is beaten. Interest me.

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,871
Why? - I had two women and have
both beaten. - How dreadful!

81
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,115
Yes, yes. of course that was not right.

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,239
Paris. I was born became in the 13.
Arrondissement, grew in the 14. on

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,431
and lived after it
in the 9., 10., 11., 12., 19. and 20.

84
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,159
Until I moved to New York.

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,669
I am called Marion and am a photographer.

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,196
Ironically,
I see not much namely.

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,388
My retina already was
small holes full in my birth.

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,758
How can I describe what I see?

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,388
That is she/it, my world-view.

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,310
Everyone sees the world actually different.

91
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,314
However, I have reached one for her after it,
tell you I!

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,950
That is Jack. He/it is an inner-architect.

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,715
"Children are like rats,
they transfer illnesses."

94
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,678
He/it said this with our third Date.
I found this very sweetly.

95
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,038
Look once, the light!
Looks like 'ne postcard of Paris.

96
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,193
I am the photographer, but
he/it took all photos on the trip.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,036
Every moment was digitized
and perpetuate, from each corner from.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,638
What does lhr actually photograph friend?
- He/it photographs everything. Really everything.

99
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,591
Renewed assassination of the almost-food-chain
Burger King... - Be able to tell by the sound this of you!

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,597
Once again fires in 'nem almost-food!

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,551
Last week waren's two sport-businesses
and last month a supermarket.

102
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,791
That is a globalization-opponent.

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,237
He/it sets almost-food-restaurants on fire?
Something is alleged in their meat.

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,913
It is here right.

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,957
Brawls here?
- Exactly. Straight ahead, in the first floor.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,595
Brawls here?
- Exactly. Straight ahead, in the first floor.

107
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,229
Elevator?

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,114
How?
- Elevator?

109
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,515
It is in the 2. Stick.
You probably create this, however.

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,074
Need long for her!
However, already by 9 arrived Lhr.

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,393
Yes, but jams were everywhere and
Strikes. Chaos always is in France.

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,230
What? The exploited suffering shall-
sisters not once can go on strike?

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,312
We are not in America here!

114
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,429
And once again this giant-suitcase!
You still break the back yourself!

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,717
But you never listen to me!

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,795
Yes, my mother is a proper nerve-
saw, but I turned into her/it through her/it/them,

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,872
this I today is.

118
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,315
Marion!

119
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,440
Mommy, Marion is once again blocked!

120
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,433
Mommy, is Marion feeble-minded?

121
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,990
As I was small,
if I was something particular.

122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,799
But not in the positive sense.

123
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,510
I always too late came, because always I
in my own world stuck.

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,558
For hours, I could matters myself
on the street or in the yard look at.

125
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,791
I believe,
I could hear even voices.

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,317
But none, that told me, I shall
save the world. No, other voices.

127
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,996
We have two skipping little!

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,756
Simply loose! Simply loose!

129
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,710
Some parents
big worries would have made.

130
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,350
The doctor prescribed by barrels
new medications,

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,716
but my mother said "no."

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,749
She/it simply gave me a Polaroidkamera,
and, instead of to look at for hours things,

133
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,832
I photographed her/it/them.

134
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,389
Already as you small was,
you only did what you wanted.

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,633
And we had to turn it towards us.
That is real...

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,189
Ah, good day, Madame.

137
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,874
Good day!

138
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,918
Is it well?
- Yes.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,118
Toot sorrow me that we us on
this go there only so shortly saw.

140
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,238
Yes, a very short idea.
We had to

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,676
an important freight delivers...
Jean-Luc.

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,356
Does this go? - Give me the small kitten!
Miez, miez, miez...

143
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,548
Did you have a good trip?
- Ah yes, very beautiful.

144
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,349
It was good?
- A wonderful trip.

145
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,398
Lhr then loses one to the meal, yes?

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,274
And late don't come.
You know that your father hates this.

147
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,674
Okay. Jean-Luc is well?
- Yes, he/it sleeps. - Reunions!

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,588
Your mother is really sweet. - I know.
- What do you have? - I don't know.

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,675
Do you have 'n problem, treasure?
- No, I need your help.

150
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,958
I need a strong man,
this me the suitcase carries.

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,478
I think that you are strong and independent?
- Yes, I also am!

152
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,395
I am a strong one and...
- Well well, I already do.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,190
That therefore is your big investment?
An apartment directly over your parents?

154
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,750
Is practical, however. - Yes, particularly,
if one is alone gladly once.

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,720
No sarcasm in Paris!
- Okay, I am quiet two days.

156
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,436
Gefällt's you? Or not?

157
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,434
What is?

158
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,238
Gefällt's you not? - However,
it is real... It is whole...

159
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,870
What? - It is urig.
- It is not century-middle. - However,

160
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,077
but 15. Century.

161
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,556
It probably is pariserisch very much.
- Is that a compliment?

162
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,995
Clear.

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,073
It is somehow swampy here.
- Swampy?

164
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,473
Yes, like the water at the Lido.
- No, I... - What smells here so?

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,920
Ah, God!
- What is? - Treasure! Treasure!

166
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,868
Treasure, what this is to the devil?
- That is leaky.

167
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,831
Old houses always are leaky here.
There are not any plumbers in France!

168
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,631
Is that of black mold?
- What is this?

169
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,873
The deadliest fungus, if one
him/it inhales. - Then doesn't inhale.

170
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,272
That is not funny. Honestly not.
- Therefore good.

171
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,750
He/it already was there,
as I was here in January.

172
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,038
He/it is harmless. He/it is not
black but green. See.

173
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,839
He/it is like blue-mold-cheese.
Probably even good for you.

174
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,629
Okay, all out here, all out.
The bathroom is forbidden!

175
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,877
Is good. - A biological risk.
- Okay, we shit into the room-corner.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,877
We shit outdoors.
- Yes, perfect!

177
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,159
Seriously, a Petrischale is this here
for Allergene. - We have allergies,

178
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,993
because we are too clean.

179
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,234
Hundred years ago, we were covered with
Parasites and didn't have any allergies.

180
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,868
Oh, really?
- Yes!

181
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,113
That is the reason,
why the French don't swim? - Yes.

182
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,158
You have my contact-lentils
really found not? - No.

183
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,358
In your bag? - No.
I am not fine. - Which is...

184
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,718
for my father?
- I am not fine!

185
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,157
I don't know,
whether it is migraine or 'ne flu.

186
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,869
Can I use the thermometer?

187
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,078
I don't take this into the mouth.

188
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,839
I don't take this into the mouth!

189
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,835
Ah, man! What is free with you?
- Why?

190
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,871
That is a French thermometer.
- Are you in 5?

191
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,272
Do you still put it into the rear end?
- Only so, one measures right.

192
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,199
How do you can merely?
- I used it no more months.

193
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,228
I first take a shower, yes?
- Well, but earns antibiotics previously!

194
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,756
I try to send the design,
but with the mail, it goes quite faster.

195
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,076
One forgets how slowly modems are.

196
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,357
In two days
if the civilization has us again.

197
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,479
What is?
- This blanket is totally silly.

198
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,757
She/it is beautiful!
- When did you buy them/her/it?

199
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,799
1982 or so?
- '86. I don't know.

200
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,714
Move not!
- What? - Remain so!

201
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,957
Is 'ne spider there?
- I know: Nan Goldin!

202
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,796
Like a photo of Nan Goldin. Remain so!
- No photos, please! No!

203
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,269
Perfect tense.

204
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,033
Lay down!

205
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,113
Take part!
Do so as if you are on drugs.

206
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,748
Which?
- Heroin of course.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,835
Perfect tense.

208
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,154
Look once.

209
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,668
That is beautiful. A beautiful photo.
You really have talent as a photographer.

210
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,479
You can me once!

211
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,398
If you know, why to each other people itself
feel pulled? - Ah, God!

212
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,392
I want to kiss you, and you hold me
'nen lecture! - I my this serious.

213
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,355
Okay, why? - People with
different lmmunsystemen

214
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,353
feel to each other pulled,
so that the descendant, the baby,

215
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,914
through the combination
a stronger lmmunsystem gets.

216
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,110
Stop to snore! That is important.
- Yes, this also says I.

217
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,274
It is interesting! - As if one with him/it
Television would go out! Do you not notice this?

218
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,275
No! Do you not like this?
- This forms immensely.

219
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,874
Really sexy.

220
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,554
That is absolute nonsense.

221
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,837
My parents were verknallt totally, as
she/it me testified, and my lmmunsystem?

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,309
Completely in the bucket.
- I know. But maybe

223
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,756
if it was sooner
an intellectual attraction,

224
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,390
and therefore they have themselves
after your birth separated.

225
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,518
You are so sweet. And you think,

226
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,118
because your parents since 38 years
or what I know, is together,

227
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,433
are you superior genetic for me? - Why
do you do a match from all?

228
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,877
Look at me. I am hardly viable.
- I do a match from all?

229
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,430
See once, I am a photographer,
and you take photos of all.

230
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,037
Recently in Venice, as photos I
it has done from you under the bridge,

231
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,876
you took photos of me, as I
Photos of you did. - What does this shall?

232
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,352
Is a Scheiß-auf-Jack-Tag today?
I want to kiss you, and then, I hear,

233
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,070
that I am genetically inferior.
A Nachäffer without own identity?

234
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,040
This never has said I.
- I know exactly, which you thought.

235
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,398
You would have to have flattered, however,
that I have on interest...

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,758
I love this dispute.
Do we continue a little?

237
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,832
I find fun in it. Really.

238
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,559
It is splendid.

239
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,715
What?

240
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,513
What do you have? - I smell something.
- You frighten me. - I smell something!

241
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,708
What is free? Maybe I have cancer,
you smell a tumor,

242
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,111
how these dogs?
- As a dog...

243
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,671
These dogs, who are trained...
- No, I am no Krebsschnüffelhund.

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,992
I sense that we completely
different lmmunsysteme have,

245
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,960
and I find that we should ourselves
concern therefore. - Really?

246
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,035
Mine is quite different than yours,
and our child becomes very much, very strong.

247
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,750
Yes, immune against everything.
- Well, but in the meantime,

248
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,357
therefore, before we multiply,
would you please get a condom?

249
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,557
Where are those?
- Under the wash-basin.

250
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,278
When did you buy them/her/it? To the same
Time like the Nan-Goldin-Bettdecke?

251
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,238
No, in January.

252
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,156
In January? - Yes.
- Wanted you to deceive me in January?

253
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,751
Actually, I wanted
in January sleep with you,

254
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,438
but you canceled with because of an eyes-
infection. You wanted to come in January.

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,990
Yes, is correct. Chlamydien in the eye.

256
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,549
Very rare.

257
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,359
But so sexy.

258
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,629
What is?

259
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,838
What is free to the devil?
- Then what?

260
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,309
Is that condoms at all?
- Then what otherwise? - I don't know.

261
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,076
Mach's not broken!
If it didn't move so down! From above!

262
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,313
They are smaller than this in Italy,
if this still goes. - If they are not.

263
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,558
I geb's on.
- What then is? Mach's simply so.

264
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,708
However, it is quite easy.
- Be careful!

265
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,032
I didn't touch you!

266
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,228
Hardly. - Is that condoms in child-size?
Do the condoms do for children?

267
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,200
It sits. - Must therefore French
Men so romantic is!

268
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,196
That is the stupidest thing, to which I belonged, has.
- Okay, then once loose. - Well, great! Yes.

269
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,511
Okay. No, my leg is this.

270
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,909
Please!

271
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,153
I don't see you! I also could with
Sleep Gregory Peck or otherwise whom.

272
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,597
How beautifully for you.
- Okay, so much to the prelude.

273
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,714
My mother!
- Do I disturb? - It is only my mother!

274
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,997
Remain! We straighten ourselves about!

275
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,392
I only wanted to know,
whether has to wash her something.

276
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,598
Yes, I later bring it down.
- In order, I wait so long.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,958
But below!
- Yes, of course. - Well, thank you.

278
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,313
Thanks. Reunions.

279
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,554
Your mother has keys?
- Clearly, I am 10 months away in the year.

280
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,838
Do you have to clean something?
She/it wanted to know.

281
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,037
No, I don't have. Ah, God.
- This does the machine.

282
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,750
I must take a shower, sorrow does me. This
if the circulation stops in my brain,

283
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,799
your mother and all this...
- What do you speak there? - I love you.

284
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,316
Ah, nice. Okay, bye!

285
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,839
Dad?
- Yes.

286
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,318
Ah, God! - I want myself exactly
do at the rabbit.

287
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,517
At the rabbit? Everything clear?
- I must cut it open.

288
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,309
Okay.

289
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,509
Everything clear?

290
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,389
Recently, I saw cabbage-titmice.
But they were afraid of Jean-Luc.

291
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,075
Yes, clear.
He/it would have eaten her/it/them also in a flash.

292
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,632
Do you think? But however, he/it is so sweet!
He/it never would do this. - Do you spin?

293
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,830
He/it doesn't eat us, because we 20 times
bigger than he/it is, and him/it feeds.

294
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,434
You always see so black.

295
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,910
However, he/it increased, this tomcat!

296
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,949
We had another couple of cans of geese-
liver, that would have run out, and since...

297
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,591
You gave him/it goose-liver?
However, he/it eats only fodder!

298
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,037
I have for ten years for him/it
only this given!

299
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,271
However, you know that fat harms animals!

300
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,990
He/it is gigantic!
He/it looks like dad! A fat-paunch!

301
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,153
What do you get into the fingers,
it turns into the fat-paunch. Tell him/it by the look of you once!

302
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,597
However, that is no more tomcat! Him/it is allowed to
I not once more into the airplane takes!

303
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,474
Therefore, he/it must remain thin,
5 kilos at most.

304
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,838
Now, they do him/it into the cargo space,
and after, he/it needs medications,

305
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,276
and many animals die on the way.
- How can you say something similar?

306
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,116
For two weeks, I have cared
about him/it, I love this tomcat!

307
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,352
But your father hates him/it, he/it names him/it
"Frisst-scheißt-schläft"...

308
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,433
He/it wanted to abandon him/it, and you say,
he/it is to thick... - Calm down!

309
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,752
...and that she/it him/it into a cage
close! - You frighten him/it.

310
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,993
You/they will kill him/it!
- What then is free here?

311
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,916
My mother always was good in crying
and always pulled her/its/their advantage from all.

312
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,551
My father will immediately rebuke me,
and I will never mention again,

313
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,552
that Jean-Luc gained 10 pounds.

314
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,919
Not once in vacation, we could drive
because of this luxury-doormat!

315
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,472
However, you find Paris madly in the summer,
if all the dirt-slingshots are away.

316
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,793
Something is same free here! See once, like
thickly he/it is! He/it was castrated,

317
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,555
exactly like I. Therefore, I am so thick!

318
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,030
Your mother has me neuter.
- Oh, yes?

319
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,275
You pig!

320
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,511
All okay one there below?
- Yes, why?

321
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,956
Only so.
- Do you come down?

322
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,750
So, there are meals in 30 minutes.
- I have 'n little fear, but good.

323
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,594
Well, then once loose.

324
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,349
Hello! - Hello, as it goes you? - Property.
Beautifully, to meet you finally.

325
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,198
Your other tomcat?
But he/it is not neuter, or?

326
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,118
Ah, no! Already offends.
- Does he/it understand this? - No!

327
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,589
Please!

328
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,514
Is that is! Caution!

329
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,388
Smell well.
- Yes, exquisite! - What is this?

330
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,598
He/it cooks very well.
- Rabbits! - What is rabbit?

331
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,515
Lapin.
- Hare little.

332
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,349
Ah, no!

333
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,150
What?
- Oliver. - Who is Oliver?

334
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,518
My hare, as I was eighth.
The neighbor-dog has him/it tattered.

335
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,551
Only the ears were remaining.
But I eat it.

336
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,917
You don't have to.
- However, I do. - Rabbits, no?

337
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,958
Very well, rabbits.

338
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,994
I want the natives
offend not. - Please!

339
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,589
A club?
- You don't have to! - I know.

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,115
Please, plates!

341
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,397
Please! Thanks.
- Looks like chickens.

342
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,157
Give me the smallest,
I am small scrap accustomed.

343
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,589
Here, Marion!
- One small piece of back.

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,629
The head!
Is good, the head! For the men.

345
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,798
The men eat the head.

346
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,589
Is that not the heart?
- No, the head is this.

347
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,752
He/it likes the head.

348
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,275
Carrots?
- Ah, carrots. Yes, gladly.

349
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,351
We also eat what the hare eats!
Is his/its toy in there also there?

350
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,598
Sauce? Cry black...

351
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,995
Wine... what?

352
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,517
White wine? Ah, Vin blanc.

353
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,109
Yes, white wine.

354
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,716
Anna, your plate, please!
- No, I don't want.

355
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,753
Oh, you spoilsport!

356
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,798
Well, dad, you have yourself completely
serves beautifully. Is that your diet?

357
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,876
Rabbit is quite lean.

358
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,669
Already, but sees once, however,
what do you pure-shovel for yourself there!

359
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,514
And you? You have already once
your fat rear end seen?

360
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,835
Are you sick? I am fat, because I
since 18 months no more smokes.

361
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,438
Jean-need, it is enough!
Stop to be annoying her/it/them, damns!

362
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,310
She/it annoys us! Therefore, however, she/it is
from New York come! - However, I eat!

363
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,235
It is not about you. - Stop,
Asshole! - Please some zuvilisierter!

364
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,029
My friend comes from far.
Talk with him/it!

365
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,510
Well well, then, we now talk to Jack

370
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,474
A small welcome-quiz.

00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,593

Miller, "Sexus", "plexuses."
- Dad, doesn't start merely with it!

378
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,159
Already okay, no worry.

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,914
Rimbaud, very good.

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,548
Rambo?

385
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,476
So, one pronounces this in English!
Dad, you really exaggerate!

386
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,351
Ah, I pronounced him/it incorrectly!
- Ah, Rimbaud. They are stupid!

387
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,752
Please! Dad!

Not bad!

You see!

He/it is a painter!

395
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,995
Property!
- He/it wants to hoodwink me! - I know.

396
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,432
At least not according to 'n full-fools
like otherwise. - Thank you, dad. Very nice!

397
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,957
He/it admittedly is not pretty,

However, you come early. - Have earlier
End done. Hello! - Good day.

Unbelievable!

404
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,869
Also.

405

As on the photos!

Is coffee still there?
- Yes, in the machine. In the kitchen.

409
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,989
If both goes her/it/them a little in Paris

410
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,599
I would like to become for me

The catacombs.
- And still what... Pere Lachaise.

412
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,196
The catacombs, Pere Lachaise...
'ne real mood-cannon, your friend!

413
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,318
In order to see Jim Morrisons grave.

414
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,237
Have I said something ill-mannered?

415
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,596
Did you take photos in Venice?
- Did we take photos in Venice?

416
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,438
Ah yes, many. - We have this.
- Which may you see? - Yes.

Mommy,

418
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,429
No. We asked rose, it us to
explains, but... - If no time had.

419
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,752
You didn't explain anything to them?
And found also nobody for it?

420
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,630
You come with gifts, and then
you drive again and leave her/it/them to me.

421
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,197
Me reicht's! - Really nice! I thought,
you take care of people with educational-problems.

422
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,996
I take care of children psychic as well
Problems, no disabled ones!

423
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,311
It is enough, you both Pissnelken!

424
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,038
Only because can send e-mails her/it/them,
you are not anything better still long.

425
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,153
That is the Markus-place.

426
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,030
Incredibly, like many photos one with him/it
Appliance can do. - Is just digital.

427
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,954
Bravo! Many beautiful photos.
- Ah, thank you.

428
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,194
I have the camera exactly for myself for
the work bought, but it is fun.

429
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,593
But why no balloons on the photos?
- Please? - Rose!

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,788
What? - Why do you say this?
- If 'n was joke. However, he/it doesn't understand anything.

431
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,955
Did you show her/it/them the photos?
- No. - I told her/it/them about it.

432
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,035
You are so stupid!
- Ah, yes! - What? - Property!

433
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,956
Not, dad, this leaves!
- Balloons, photo-balloons. - No, dad!

434
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,193
That cannot be true!
Dad, this please leaves!

435
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,752
Pretty little corner with balloons!

436
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,115
No!

437
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,275
Lhr is insufferably!
- Toot sorrow me. - Oh, yes?

438
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,592
Pretty little corner!
- Mommy!

439
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,310
Really, Anna!
- You probably spin! Lhr is so stupidly.

440
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,110
Okay, my sweeter things, however, you are not...
That should be a joke.

441
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,071
What do you pack then him/it in cotton wool so?
- That is a small bird on her/it...

442
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,835
A bird?
...Hotel-terrace.

443
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,950
Much fun! And go with dad in her/it
Gallery past. He/it has a Vernissage.

444
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,473
These homosexuals,
however, there is not this, therefore really...

445
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,949
Disgusting!

446
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,635
Not, Kiki?
You would not do something similar.

447
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,709
Nice snort.
- You liked it, as I...

448
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,634
I know, but I said...
- After two years, this eases.

449
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,679
This has said I,
because I wanted for you at the laundry.

450
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,594
But this
I now have no more necessary.

451
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,640
Now, it explains you.
- It doesn't explain me.

452
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,634
Explaining something would be,
if I had something to explain.

453
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,554
Excuse me, I speak four languages.
- Ah, yes!

454
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,554
Which was it, that you can well, still?

455
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,279
I don't know, whether your French
good is, it can also be bad.

456
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,033
How should I know this?

457
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,194
I am no fan of the death, but
this place is undeprimierend strangely.

458
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,673
I know. All Parisian here is dead.
- Is it therefore so quiet? - Yes, so beautiful.

459
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,040
I love you.
- Why do you speak this with "Rrr?"

460
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,671
It is French, that is, simple.
No "Rrr." That is no German.

461
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,718
Where is the "Steack fried?"

462
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,753
It sounds so ugly,
if you speak French.

463
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,357
Why are we at all here?
Jim Morrison, why?

464
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,593
You like the "Doors" not once.
- But it is a famous grave.

465
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,797
And I am a deep Val Kilmer-Fan.

466
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,794
You take a photo,
and then, we, okay, go?

467
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,918
Pardon! Ah, pardon!

468
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,429
Ah, no! - Now, the party starts!
- Now take the photo! What does she/it have?

469
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,434
Everything in order, Mademoiselle?

470
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,189
Come!
- Let's go. - I am a freethinker.

471
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,114
It was that.
- Supercool. - Yes, super-cool.

472
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,153
I glaub's not,
that the catacombs are closed!

473
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,915
One of my favorite-places in Paris.

474
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,835
I glaub's not that still we
no one, that I know, met.

475
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,516
What is with the collective dynamics
the little one*-world-networks?

476
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,391
The book "Little one*-world-network" has
It read Jack as we were in Venice.

477
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,110
Where we always went, he/it has
for proof of this theory been looked.

478
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,557
It completely simply is.
Our world is very small, and if you

479
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,679
on the other side of the planet travels,
if it is very likely,

480
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,878
that you meet somebody,
he/it in your street lives.

481
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,272
It is scientifically proved,
that that is no pure coincidence.

482
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,830
We are as total
connected together.

483
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,313
The illusion of the chaos, in him/it
we live, is sorted and connects.

484
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,349
But that is pure theory, and Jack has
2 weeks after indications for it been looked for.

485
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,113
But nothing!

486
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,836
Marion! I don't grasp it! I have
by you spoken and... - Really?

487
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,915
Exactly today! - Oh, yes?
- I don't grasp it! - What do you do so?

488
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,630
My book just came out.
- Oh, great! A novel?

489
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,315
No,
Short stories, but interrelated.

490
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,553
Cool. That is Jack. Manu.

491
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,155
Day. - Please me,
To meet you, Jack.

492
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,120
Do you speak French?
- No, no.

493
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,478
And, what are there new?
Do you remain in the USA now for always?

494
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,759
No notion. But now, I am straight
with Jack together and everything runs well.

495
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,113
What is?

496
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,398
If you come this evening
to the party of Vanessa?

497
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,951
Yes, in any case.
- I also. - We go to the party.

498
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,955
This evening, yes. - Unbelievable,
you have yourself no little changes!

499
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,316
As the time has stood still.

500
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,951
Oh, stops! - You simply don't want
become older! - Stop, such a nonsense!

501
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,318
I am totally ready after so many
Hours in the train. - You look great!

502
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,148
Oh, stops!
- I schwör's!

503
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,118
We must loosely, my father expects us.
- Jean-need, father Jean-need...

504
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,192
Greet him/it from me.
- Until afterward.

505
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,358
Beautifully, to have met you.
- Yes, that was beautiful, Homie.

506
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,754
"That was beautiful, Homie?"
- That is funny!

507
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,357
Let taken taxi 'n from us.
- You want a taxi? Okay.

508
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,953
What runs there? The fellow has you
looked at thick lamb-club like 'ne.

509
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,830
As he/it has knives and fork and...
- I am one! - I know, but my.

510
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,310
From where do you know him/it?
- We have known ourselves for a long time

511
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,633
and had something together once.
I believe that I blew one for him/it.

512
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,713
Nothing further. - Somebody one blows
is nothing further?

513
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,954
Toot sorrow me! Nothing further compared
with that, what happens in the world otherwise.

514
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,035
George Bush,
the war in the Iraq, the bird-flu...

515
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,353
A Blowjob. is on the other hand..
If one considers... - Be correct, is correct.

516
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,828
Beautiful transition.
- A rather unimportant event,

517
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,834
do you not find?
- No, actually not,

518
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,152
if one this in one
bigger political context sees.

519
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,111
After all, chance has a Blowjob America
on a healthy democracy destroyed!

520
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,710
Must we go this evening there?

521
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,116
You don't want? Oh... However, I would become
like to see my friends. - Already good.

522
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,476
You are
with all your Exfreunden made friends?

523
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,433
With some, therefore...

524
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,958
with most. This type is genuinely in one
wonderful author and poets.

525
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,634
A French poet...

526
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,990
You are with no one
your Exfreundinnen made friends?

527
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,435
No!

528
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,149
Really? - No.
- This knew not at all.

529
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,154
As it from was, it was over.
- Then...

530
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,034
...you never would become again me
it wants to see if we separate?

531
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,274
No. I would not avoid you, but
I also would not take the trouble therefore.

532
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,150
I therefore am outside our relationship
no nice person for you.

533
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,154
Yes, so approximately.
- That is interesting.

534
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,269
I would like to be friendly with you.
- When? - If we separate.

535
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,195
No, if we separate.
Then, I also would like you.

536
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,034
Then, you simply are riper than I,
what I know...

537
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,512
So, we make this for France.
Exfreunde remain themselves near.

538
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,311
France influences your behavior
very much. How does the government stand by it?

539
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,269
She/it lets me pay taxes amply.
- Can we hold at a pharmacy?

540
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,433
My head kills me.
I don't have any more migraine-pills.

541
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,719
However, there are Codein without recipe here?
- No! - No? Why not?

542
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,680
We are in France here.
There are opiates not without recipe.

543
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,071
We are not in Afghanistan.

544
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,715
There is not any taxi. Let us go.
Maybe we find heroin over-the-counter.

545
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,677
It was the bridge! - The "last tango"
I as often as no one have seen. Hold!

546
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,792
It was the bridge! - The "last tango"
I as often as no one have seen. Hold!

547
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,510
Where? - There.
You play Brando in the entrance-scene.

548
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,718
Brando doesn't play I!
- Be careful. - Play him/it you!

549
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,839
No, you see much more similarly for him/it.

550
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,596
Fingers at the ears and then back,
you have pains, okay?

551
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,275
You are total besides yourself.

552
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,831
Fingers at the ears! Okay, enough.

553
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,753
Do you know something?
- What?

554
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,277
To constantly photograph
make one to the observer.

555
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,433
It brings one automatically
from the moment out.

556
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,952
On our trip to Venice
I wanted to experience the moment with Jack,

557
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,395
but...

558
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,790
instead of to kiss me,
Jack took 48 photos in the gondola.

559
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,509
Instead of little hands stationary
over the Markus-place, to run,

560
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,754
Jack took 72 photos of the Markus-place.
And so on...

561
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,555
Which looks more like Godard?

562
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,277
Godard... or Godard?

563
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,669
Black.

564
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,113
How look I?
- The question is...

565
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,359
How do I look?

566
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,319
Wonderful! You look really good.
- Not to fat or to...

567
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,837
No, you look thickly, but good.
You look good.

568
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,159
Really, without glasses...
I have completely forgotten, how well...

569
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,678
Yes, I found the contact-lentils.
- You put in effort right. - How?

570
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,833
Lm contrast to Venice.
Do you make this for Manu?

571
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,556
On the way, we go with my father
in the gallery past, in agreement?

572
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,748
I think that this could fallen for you.
- Do you read the Bible?

573
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,958
I have a Bible?
I knew this not at all.

574
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,796
Does this belong into the Bible?

575
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,311
Ah, that is... Ah, yes.

576
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,115
No, but...

577
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,477
That is funny! You found it!
This just has sought I recently.

578
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,429
That is... What is his name still?
- I don't know. With the many...

579
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,510
My friend's friend,
as I was small.

580
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,397
Jean-Philippe... Jean-Louis!

581
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,789
Jean-Francois!

582
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,829
That is ten years ago!

583
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,708
That is no Exfreund or so,
only a friend.

584
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,192
That was at the 14. July. We were
both gotten drunk, all were drunk.

585
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,512
Look once, wie's there looks! There
approximately 20 people, all with balloons, were.

586
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,309
You don't find this something beside it,
the same photo?

587
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,354
What?
- What? That is the same photo precisely!

588
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,149
Like what?

589
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,396
Like what?
- Yes. - That of me! - If it is not!

590
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,950
It is quite different.
Blue, red and white balloons are there.

591
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,753
That is...
- The 14. July!

592
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,675
That is something similar like the heads
your Exfreunde at the wall to pegs,

593
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,719
only that instead photos you
from truancy with balloons at it does?

594
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,633
Do you have even more from it? A catalog
full of men with balloons at the tail?

595
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,715
Does tails with balloons rain immediately?
- No, pure coincidence is this!

596
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,632
Oh, comes! However, that is not anything! - No,
I feel only completely particularly.

597
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,477
You are something particular for me.
And your photo also. Not like this here.

598
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,589
There, I was drunk,
and all others also.

599
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,794
You are sour. - Yes.
- You are something particular.

600
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,397
Yes, as a disabled one. He/it is well
Reason, that I am together with you.

601
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,079
All okay one, sweet?

602
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,034
Are you Americans? - He/it yes, I am
Frenchwoman, we live in New York.

603
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,876
Cool! I love New York.
I was there last year.

604
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,794
I love Downtown, Soho... Cool, man.

605
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,076
Are you married?
- No.

606
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,913
Do you have children?
- No.

607
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,912
No? How old are you then?

608
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,709
Now, where we know ourselves,
if I can address you informally.

609
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,713
I am 35.

610
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,475
Attendants not too long. Does he/it not want?

611
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,156
I don't want.
- No, no, doesn't believe this I.

612
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,552
All women want children.
The nature wants it so.

613
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,791
If he/it doesn't want,

614
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,031
I like to make one for you,
if you want.

615
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,159
I do beautiful children.
If you want a Brad Pitt

616
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,597
or a George Clooney,
if you know to whom you must turn.

617
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,514
He/it says how beautifully his/its children are.

618
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,794
Very funny.

619
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,754
I only say this...
honestly, you don't look bad.

620
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,073
Blond like the Tusse of the fellow
into "ominous affair." Douglas.

621
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,871
He/it says that I look like...
Catherine Zeta-Jones? - Yes, exactly.

622
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,796
Great! A blind cab driver. - I am
but blond and sees hardly similar for her/it/them.

623
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,988
Lhr has the same face, the eyes,
they glisten. If I look at you so...

624
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,909
how twin-sisters,

625
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,118
only, that you are a little more beautiful.

626
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,351
Sisinsky. Sisinsky.

627
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,320
Jack. Please me.

628
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,994
Ah, fickende angels!

629
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,431
De Gaulle fickt the rear end...
a French from the middle class.

630
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,996
'68, the barricades!

631
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,476
That is Anna.

632
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,509
Micha was together with Anna.
You/they divided...

633
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,071
my mother a while.
You/they had both sex with her.

634
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,472
Lovers, lovers...
- Lovers,

635
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,359
the lover.

636
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,275
Girls... - Girls, that each other
touches, that is... - Chickens.

637
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,240
Clearly, one needs chickens.
Yes, chickens, sex...

638
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,078
Jean-need!
- Jean-need! - No, no, no.

639
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,909
I... - French!
- I get migraine from it.

640
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,595
Maigren? Of what does he/it speak?
- He/it gets headaches

641
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,918
from red wine.
- Speak gefälligst French!

642
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,515
Do you spin? However, you frighten him/it!

643
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,470
He/it doesn't tolerate any red wine!

644
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,111
She/it is beautiful, dad. Quite wonderful.
- Do you like her/it? - Yes, very much.

645
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,030
A man, who gets a baby.
- As in the Schwarzenegger-Film!

646
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,839
A hermaphrodite.

647
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,397
Dad,
show him/it my favorite-pictures once!

648
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,113
I leave Jack with you,
take care a little of him/it!

649
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,954
But however, we understand each other not at all!

650
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,195
Pigs. - Ah. Pigs
with a type Salami. - Yes.

651
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,716
Yes. What is, sweet?
- Your father is... - Cunnilingus.

652
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,680
Cunnilingus in French.

653
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,435
Excuse me, treasure.
- Ah, no! - Excuse me.

654
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,672
Where do you go?
- How does it go? - Property. And you? - It goes.

655
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,753
Reunions, Jack!
- Reunions. - Until soon.

656
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,953
Where do you want to? - I am ready here.
Do we find ourselves with Vanessa?

657
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,956
I wanted to tell you that I it
finds incorrectly which Marion did.

658
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,033
All the photo of you
with the balloons, to show.

659
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,793
That is not in order.

660
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,115
This testifies respect to zero
before your intimacy as pair.

661
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,512
Intimacy? - Your...
- Oh, private life. Yes, I know.

662
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,838
I... I am displaces!
- No. - No!

663
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,314
This picture there...

664
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,399
Whether therefore one in the expression of the force...

665
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,757
...everything, which happens there,
if one can say, the force...

666
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,909
Mach's good.

667
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,476
What do you do here? - I needed air,
it is so stifling indoors there.

668
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,678
Yes, it is hot. Want you to go?
- Yes, you are ready?

669
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,959
You have yourself from my father
give a farewell? - Yes, yes. - All okay one?

670
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,437
I find that it is not correct,
that you showed all this photo.

671
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,957
This testifies respect to zero
before our private life.

672
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,598
Ah, the photo of you!
But that is so funny!

673
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,956
Oh, comes!
- That is completely inappropriate.

674
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,510
My father found this hilarious!

675
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,911
No miracle
with the pictures in his/its gallery,

676
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,754
but me may not be laughed at.

677
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,029
Come!
- In New York, I never drive subway.

678
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,151
Of the moment, no occasion consists
for a terror-attack.

679
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,192
All are happy.
- They don't look happy.

680
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,750
Ahem?
- They don't look happy.

681
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,514
Is good.

682
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,959
I already do this.

683
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,873
Didn't work.

684
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,394
Jack, my friend.
Vanessa, my friend. - Please me.

685
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,239
Are you the new friend? - What is your name?
- Sandra. - The new friend?

686
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,232
Not quite again, but already okay.
Something worn out.

687
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,149
And Marion?

688
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,514
Everything clear? - Yes, yes. I eat Hot-Dog-
Ball little, I have a beer... - Property!

689
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,790
Would you like to still eat something?
- Already okay, I am 35. - Well good.

690
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,510
She/it still gives me the breast.
But sag's not further!

691
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,276
Little one elves, that helped me,
if I had a problem.

692
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,151
That found, for what I have looked.
- Such a nonsense! - I schwör's!

693
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,591
You noticed it once incidentally that
the Muschi with most women...

694
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,516
They have this dreadful cut,
this subway-ticket.

695
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,630
Subway-ticks? - Yes, she/it is...
Metro-Ticket name this we here.

696
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,759
A narrow rectangle.
- Ah, the runway!

697
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,118
I hate this. I find's dreadful.

698
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,029
I call "Hitler's handlebar mustache" this.
- Wow! You really hate it!

699
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,874
You look there, and the thing is...

700
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,872
Dreadful!

701
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,269
Then, my tail startles
immediately back.

702
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,356
Is that the wrong expression?
- No, why?

703
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,672
I pubertiere exactly.
- This probably should be called...

704
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,196
If he/it is afraid or becomes cold...

705
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,478
Yes, if he/it is afraid. But cold?

706
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,190
Americans
probably have not the problem.

707
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,434
Lhr never has fear,
to step on hostile area.

708
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,754
I am Mathieu incidentally. Please me.
- Jack. Completely on my part.

709
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,837
Everything clearly, sweet? - Yes, the type
speak of fascist vaginas.

710
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,472
How does it go? - And you?
I already saw you of wide.

711
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,271
You prepare 'ne exhibition? Photos?
- Somewhat more conceptual. - Ah, yes.

712
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,079
In the type of Bill Viola,

713
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,631
but with much more sex.
You will definitely like it.

714
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,993
He/it does an exhibition, he/it is
really an interesting artist.

715
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,113
An Exfreund?
- No! - Are you sure?

716
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,037
That would be a record.
- No. - Ah, Manu!

717
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,750
You don't have to talk to him/it.
- However, I want that I like Manu.

718
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,672
I always thought, a small lie,
this no effects

719
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,958
on igendwas or anybody has,
be no correct lie.

720
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,873
A small diagram of the brain

721
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,551
if the pros and cons must
appraise the possible consequences,

722
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,552
particularly, if it could be,

723
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,234
that the lie is discovered.

724
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,518
You are there yes, man!
- How does it go? - How are you?

725
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,273
What is free?
- Not much. How does it go? - Property.

726
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,155
She/it told you,
that we were together, or? - Yes.

727
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,196
That is approximately 15 years ago,
therefore no more reason for the excitement.

728
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,195
She/it was 19.
- Ah, still a child.

729
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,478
She/it had her/its/their first orgasm with me
through intercourse.

730
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,597
That was impolite. I know,
when I am impolite. Toot sorrow me.

731
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,356
Ah, no, no.
You paved the way for others us.

732
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,149
I drink to it.
- Clearly, we drink to it!

733
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,074
Furthermore, it was not once
'ne big romance.

734
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,155
Sooner like... Brother and sister.
- Brother and sister, whom sex has?

735
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,073
No big matter.

736
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,035
I now must this... Hire gets.
- I love the bloke. If it gets!

737
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,477
What is? - A Blowjob?
You had sex with the type!

738
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,713
With whom?
- Manu. - No. Well...

739
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,159
Yes... so approximately.
- Approximately? Only in the base?

740
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,678
I don't know, why therefore one
have to lie. - I didn't lie.

741
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,236
However! Furthermore, he/it told me,
that you the first orgasm with him/it

742
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,438
through intercourse had.
Does this seem to you familiar? - No.

743
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,751
Has maybe... - Does something ring there?
- He/it should feel good.

744
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,470
Be correct. You said exactly this to me.
- Do I have this?

745
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,758
But it was correct with you.
- Is that amnesia? I versteh's not.

746
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,833
No, you fools. Be not so!
Be not jealous!

747
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,152
However, you knew that I
no virgin more was, I was 33!

748
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,394
Therefore, it doesn't go. It is about lying.
You clearly are no more virgin...

749
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,028
I get 'nen Dip for myself.

750
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,638
I am a child-psychologist.
I work with problem-children

751
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,033
from the 16. Arrondissement,
Neuilly sur being, children of empires

752
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,749
with many problems.
- Yes, something similar occurs.

753
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,832
This sounds really fascinating.

754
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,234
One day, as I with a child
in my office worked,

755
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,916
if I had to on the toilet.

756
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,557
As I returned,
my chair was quite wet.

757
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,353
This small one... Rat
had peed after it.

758
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,592
I was so... so furious!

759
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,912
The only one, of what I could think,
it was that I wanted to sever this.

760
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,992
Only simply sever.

761
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,313
The job quits, or what?
- No, the small penis cuts off!

762
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,836
Oh so, his/its small penis.
- Yes.

763
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,993
I like him/it totally gladly.
Mussels are in the salad. Oh, exactly!

764
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,277
I hab's so full. We only argue.

765
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,151
Do you go into the temple sometimes?
- No, I am not really Jewish.

766
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,471
My mother was educated Catholic.
I admittedly have a Jewish name,

767
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,400
but I am strictly speaking
gentile. - But your father.

768
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,751
And consequently also you. You are one
happy, hairy, Jewish man!

769
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,278
You think that Hitler would have spared you,
because your mother is gentile?

770
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,752
This would not have altered anything. These types
would have put you into a camp.

771
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,675
Be correct. You are right.
I never liked camps.

772
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,516
Incidentally, I remain a few days
with you. Marion invited me.

773
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,469
We have sleep only a quite small one-
do carpentry. - I bring goose-liver.

774
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,869
I feel like your brother,
and what mine is is also yours, man.

775
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,674
Is this called that mine is also yours?

776
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,516
If you give it to me, it takes me.
- Real? Does this refer to everything?

777
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,599
I explain something to you once.

778
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,798
I am American, yes?
And in America, mine is mine.

779
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,268
My religion is "private-property":
Entered not, my stuff doesn't touch!

780
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,353
Or I kill you!

781
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,235
That is good.

782
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,638
I like the man. We find ourselves
in August. I love your humor!

783
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,276
You told this paranoid person,
he/it can live in August with us?

784
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,240
No, that he/it can live there,
if we are away. - Speech with him/it,

785
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,433
he/it, our apartment, thinks
if the Promised land is!

786
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,038
I have a little with your bloke
talked, super-nice. - Yes, he/it is.

787
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,511
Don't jam, not according to 'n Ami, not
arrogantly, quite different than expected.

788
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,957
He/it is admittedly tattooed everywhere,
but you seem this to like.

789
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,998
That is normal, he/it was in the clink.

790
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,029
Stock exchange-histories or so? ENRON-Affäre?
- No, he/it sat eight years.

791
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,352
Murder. Willful killing. Was there

792
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,150
such a type, that with him/it and his/its
Friend lived, and he/it was only 19...

793
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,310
He/it can curb his/its fury only heavily.

794
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,518
He/it invited me to you
in August,

795
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,037
but I was not sure whether I can.
- How stupid!

796
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,954
I get to still drink something for me.
- Yes, only does.

797
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,989
I want the most unromantic day of this
Keep awake Parisian history in me.

798
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,996
The whole ones of some strange project
and everything could not do I here.

799
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,953
I had to... no notion.
Everywhere only perverts,

800
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,069
those I one should blow...
- That is disgusting, or?

801
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,869
You had to blow no one one,
to manage therefore?

802
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,831
In the art, one doesn't have to this?
- No, that not, but one must...

803
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,671
One must leak.
- Yes, exactly. One must leak.

804
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,038
She/it looks totally empty anyway.
- Totally empty.

805
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,276
Ah, shit,
I lost my contact-lentil!

806
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,708
She/it is there.

807
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,189
Do you have her/it/them?
- Yes. - Super.

808
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,311
I do her/it/them again purely.
- Yes.

809
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,598
All okay one? - Yes, already goes.
- Don't fall!

810
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,669
Marion?

811
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,709
Marion!

812
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,233
Is good. Ah, darling.
- What is free?

813
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,756
I don't thrive.

814
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,116
What is free?
- The mussels.

815
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,832
I thought of it that I allergic
is. However, we had mussels?

816
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,391
No, last month
on Long Iceland, we had mussels.

817
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,553
Maybe I tolerate
French mussels not.

818
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,316
Call somebody "911!"
- I am allergic against mussels!

819
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,711
Call somebody "I is allergic!

820
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,476
Attendants! - What is?
- I don't have any pulse. - However.

821
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,270
I don't have any pulse. - However.
- I die! - No.

822
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,875
I die!
- No, no!

823
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,070
Them/you were only dizzy.
- My pulse! - Breathe deeply through.

824
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,598
It felt as I have
something in the neck. Here, something hairy.

825
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,197
That is an allergic reaction.
Give me a shot, fast!

826
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,390
You/they ate simply too much.
Drink something. - I am afraid.

827
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,429
Go at the fresh air.
130 to 60, lhr blood pressure is perfect.

828
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,795
Jack!

829
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,519
I am alive! - Yes, I know.
Otherwise, you would have spoken not so much.

830
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,909
Yes.

831
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,230
Do you have something for the sinuses?
Antihistamine?

832
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,952
No, but she don't lack anything.
- Yes, I know.

833
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:38,059
That certainly is an Arab.
The last one cleared off at a traffic light.

834
00:52:38,466 --> 00:52:40,263
Recently, I had a few Germans.

835
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:43,578
Never again!
They had sausages in the luggage,

836
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:48,980
this stinks still today! - You have yourself
well entertains with my sister?

837
00:52:50,106 --> 00:52:52,301
You talked almost only to her.

838
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:57,496
Why, however, I have with Matthew
and Manu and Sandra spoken...

839
00:52:57,906 --> 00:52:59,817
Very nice.

840
00:53:00,226 --> 00:53:03,980
Really, or do you mean this ironically?
- No, they were very nice.

841
00:53:04,386 --> 00:53:05,785
One never knows with you.

842
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:09,701
Hey, where does lhr come friend?
He/it doesn't speak any French.

843
00:53:10,106 --> 00:53:12,939
He/it is American.
- Americans?

844
00:53:13,346 --> 00:53:16,019
You/they don't speak any English?
- No.

845
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:21,295
You/they probably cannot many languages?
- What? However, French is enough, or?

846
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:26,905
Didn't you therefore want to take us?
Because we speak another language?

847
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:31,094
Whom do you take at all then?
You/they don't like any Germans...

848
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:33,462
Arabs? They don't like you either.

849
00:53:33,866 --> 00:53:37,984
Whom do you like then? One should Romanians
sends home and Jews into the KZ.

850
00:53:38,386 --> 00:53:42,902
I never have said this. And the camps
they invented so that we pay.

851
00:53:43,306 --> 00:53:45,945
Are you totally stupid?
You should hear yourself once!

852
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:49,577
Does it still go, Blondi?
Do you address now me informally, or what?

853
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:54,377
I give you Blondi!
It is all okay one, darling.

854
00:53:54,786 --> 00:53:59,541
The type is an abgefucktes psycho-
pathisches Nazi-racist-asshole!

855
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:04,258
And that is okay, because here this
France is. We are in France.

856
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:08,223
Welcomes in France!
Welcomes in France!

857
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:10,662
This is enough!
- Fascist!

858
00:54:11,066 --> 00:54:12,465
We get out here!

859
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:17,064
You pay before you get out,
otherwise, we go directly to the police!

860
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,583
Of course, we, idiot, pay! We have
Coal, however, we are Americans!

861
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:23,500
Finally hold the muzzle!
- I step into them/her/it for you...

862
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:26,295
I step into them/her/it for you...
- You step for me where?

863
00:54:26,706 --> 00:54:30,381
And you just the muzzle back there!
- We are there, you hold here.

864
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:33,300
I look for a place to holding.

865
00:54:33,706 --> 00:54:37,745
Then, I hold, and we talk
from man to woman. - Okay.

866
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:40,421
We speak of your wife?
- No, from man to woman!

867
00:54:40,826 --> 00:54:43,340
I thought that you wanted with me
talk about your wife.

868
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:46,385
Your wife has an Arab namely.
- What?

869
00:54:47,426 --> 00:54:50,816
Thank you,
that was a very instructive trip.

870
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:52,944
I thank you you.

871
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:56,379
Good night.
- Clear off! - Thank you.

872
00:54:56,786 --> 00:55:01,302
Slut! Part yourself from the Amis ficken!
- What then was free with him/it?

873
00:55:01,706 --> 00:55:03,776
The type was a racist.

874
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:07,618
If we come back to America,
you go into one...

875
00:55:08,026 --> 00:55:10,699
Anger-overcoming-clinic.

876
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:15,384
However, I was not at all angry.
Is it approximately okay to be a racist?

877
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:18,416
At least, rose still is alive.

878
00:55:21,346 --> 00:55:25,658
Here, it smells of lamb.
The whole city smells of lamb.

879
00:55:28,146 --> 00:55:32,298
What is this? Was that your mother?
- Our laundry.

880
00:55:32,706 --> 00:55:33,900
How sweet!

881
00:55:34,306 --> 00:55:38,219
I always tell her/it/them that she/it shouldn't this,
but she/it cannot leave do it.

882
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,015
She/it irons jeans?
Who then does something similar?

883
00:55:41,426 --> 00:55:45,214
That is her/its/their favorite-activity.
It is beautiful.

884
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:48,817
If you know...
- I thought that she/it is a hippie.

885
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:52,980
But then, the habits have
her/its/their mother pushed through.

886
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,819
Exactly this my I.
- What?

887
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:05,219
Above, I try to lie. - I
knows. - Why do you fight against it?

888
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:09,744
Because you always want upward.
- So, I simply like it.

889
00:56:10,146 --> 00:56:14,139
Yes, you like this, but I also am
still there. However, I am no Dildo!

890
00:56:14,546 --> 00:56:16,377
Not?
- I my it serious.

891
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:19,823
All talk about it,
that women are made to objects,

892
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:23,377
that she/it only one piece of meat,
only birthing-machines are...

893
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:27,461
But we is men the meat-pieces!
The female orgasm

894
00:56:27,866 --> 00:56:31,825
so much meaning is attributed!
It is Lmmer about the woman!

895
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:34,581
One should be received compromises by it.

896
00:56:34,986 --> 00:56:38,103
You poor things! It must be dreadful,
to be a man

897
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:40,337
and, to be abused so!

898
00:56:40,746 --> 00:56:44,739
You should turn to Amnesty.
I don't have any more desire. - No!

899
00:56:45,146 --> 00:56:49,185
How should I have now sex with you?
- Please, I... - I don't want.

900
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:52,464
Okay, then, we do it from the back.
- No! - Okay!

901
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:55,778
I want on you on it and you...
Okay, listens.

902
00:56:56,186 --> 00:56:58,381
That was traumatic.
I feel rejected.

903
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:02,495
If you know as that is for a woman,
if she/it is rejected with the sex?

904
00:57:02,906 --> 00:57:07,058
I will never again eat, I have
now certainly anorexia! - No, no.

905
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,538
Leave me alone!
- We don't have yet the whole trip.

906
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:13,016
Well, and because of whom this probably was?

907
00:57:13,426 --> 00:57:16,975
I was on the toilet! You wanted me
climb when shiting?

908
00:57:17,386 --> 00:57:20,856
Say the no more! I can
the word "shits" no more hears.

909
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:23,336
I am tired. Do we argue tomorrow?

910
00:57:23,746 --> 00:57:28,342
Thanks. I sleep with the tomcat,
he/it is much more erotic anyway.

911
00:57:59,506 --> 00:58:01,895
Jean-need, here water is everywhere!

912
00:58:02,066 --> 00:58:05,661
What? - O God!
I don't know, they yell rum!

913
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,624
What do you do?

914
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,905
The carpet!
- Jean-need, the fire brigade calls!

915
00:58:12,306 --> 00:58:15,025
What happened?
- A water-tube-break is in the bath.

916
00:58:15,426 --> 00:58:17,496
I stop the stream.

917
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:21,785
You/they are on the way.
I should turn off the main-cock.

918
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:26,020
Where is the main-cock? - What do I know?
Ask Madame Schindling,

919
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:29,145
she/it must know it.
- Yes? - Already go!

920
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:33,937
Below, they have a water-tube-break.
They already are on the way!

921
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:38,260
Who?
- The fire brigade.

922
00:58:39,466 --> 00:58:42,663
Ah God! - Have 'nen tomcats I!
- I help you.

923
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:46,581
Mommy, should I help you?
- Dung! - Okay.

924
00:58:47,706 --> 00:58:51,335
Ah, good day. - Toot sorrow for us,
we are firefighters, no plumbers.

925
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:55,102
Dung!
- Toot sorrow me, my mother...

926
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:59,943
Do you live above? - Yes,
but actually I live in New York.

927
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:03,419
They have super-fire engines there.
- Yes.

928
00:59:04,826 --> 00:59:07,545
You have beautiful sweaters there!
Can one buy them/her/it?

929
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:11,905
They belong to the uniform.
- But one gets her/it/them over the internet.

930
00:59:12,306 --> 00:59:13,534
Oh yes?
- Yes.

931
00:59:17,026 --> 00:59:19,620
That is good wool.
- Yes, you feel once.

932
00:59:20,026 --> 00:59:23,063
She/it is from the finest things.
- No, no... - Well loose!

933
00:59:23,866 --> 00:59:26,858
Ah yes! - Not bad, which?
- That is good quality.

934
00:59:27,826 --> 00:59:30,056
That is Scottish wool.

935
00:59:33,306 --> 00:59:37,424
What do they still do then here?
Flirt not and rather helps me.

936
00:59:37,826 --> 00:59:40,056
Yes, we must loosely. Thanks.

937
00:59:40,466 --> 00:59:42,457
Very pleases.
- Yes.

938
00:59:42,866 --> 00:59:46,700
Next time, we call a plumber,
not the fire brigade. Thanks.

939
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:50,143
A beautiful day still.
- Thank you, likewise. - Reunions.

940
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:52,184
Ah! Hello, boys.

941
00:59:52,586 --> 00:59:56,499
Jack, very pleases. - Hello.
- Good day. How does it go?

942
00:59:57,146 --> 01:00:00,297
Can I touch also once?
- What? - Muscles.

943
01:00:00,706 --> 01:00:04,255
Ah, English. - What does he/it say?
- Already well, already good. - Okay.

944
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:05,735
Ah!

945
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:09,422
A beautiful day still.
- Ah, yes. - Okay.

946
01:00:09,826 --> 01:00:10,815
Okay.

947
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:14,015
He/it probably is not quite dense!
- Beautiful!

948
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:25,176
Managed, finally. I am sopping wet.
- This believes I.

949
01:00:27,746 --> 01:00:31,455
We come! - Bring your Ami.
We show him/it correct meal once!

950
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:35,939
I go to fast still take a shower.
Do you come along on the market?

951
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:39,941
I have a terrible tomcat...
Go with your father alone once.

952
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:44,134
He/it wants that you come along.
- However, he/it speaks only French.

953
01:00:44,546 --> 01:00:49,381
I would like that you divide this with me.
Please! - Well good.

954
01:00:49,786 --> 01:00:51,777
Thanks.
- Okay.

955
01:00:52,826 --> 01:00:55,943
We go to the brunch, okay, after it?
- I am bad.

956
01:00:57,226 --> 01:00:59,137
Be called..."Chaute."

957
01:01:00,106 --> 01:01:02,461
Chaud!
- Ah yes, it is hot.

958
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,615
Muggy!

959
01:01:05,026 --> 01:01:08,701
"Chochotte"... gay!
- How did he/it like Paris yesterday?

960
01:01:09,106 --> 01:01:12,416
Do you like Paris?
- Ah yes. Very beautiful.

961
01:01:12,826 --> 01:01:14,817
And he/it likes Jim Morrison?

962
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:18,015
Do you like Jim Morrison?
- Actually not.

963
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:21,384
Why was he/it at his/its grave then?
- Because that is something for tourists.

964
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:26,462
That is for tourists. - Does he/it know it?
- No, I didn't tell it to him/it.

965
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:29,141
I wanted to tell you incidentally,

966
01:01:29,546 --> 01:01:32,697
that you the next time,
if you are in dream-vacation,

967
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,904
have to leave your tomcat elsewhere.
- Why?

968
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:40,060
Was he/it not good? - Every morning
by five, he/it scratches at the bathroom-door

969
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:43,458
and wants to drink at the faucet.
- He/it likes just flowing water.

970
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,334
I said you,
you should leave open the cock in the evening.

971
01:01:47,346 --> 01:01:51,259
This tomcat is very good.
- He/it is worse than a child.

972
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:55,215
Want you to do children?
- Don't annoy me with it, I have for you...

973
01:01:55,626 --> 01:01:58,538
See once, as that parked!
- He/it does it once again!

974
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:02,939
He/it scars the cars on the footpath.
- Is that of the tickets here?

975
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:05,382
Is it legal to scar cars?

976
01:02:05,786 --> 01:02:08,141
He/it only scars her/it/them,
if they stand on the footpath.

977
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:12,785
Ah, it tells you by the look of this! Ah, la-la!
- Yes, he/it will also scar him/it.

978
01:02:13,186 --> 01:02:16,895
Now, however, something does!
- What do you mean? I cannot do anything.

979
01:02:17,306 --> 01:02:20,696
What... - Dad, stops.
Do it at least at night.

980
01:02:21,106 --> 01:02:23,700
Jack doesn't thrive on that occasion,
he/it doesn't like this.

981
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:27,257
Could we go somewhat faster?
- Car angry! - Car badly, yes.

982
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:30,544
Yes. He/it doesn't like cars.
- Looks completely so.

983
01:02:30,946 --> 01:02:35,303
Air pollution.
- What? Yes. You/they should be a candidate.

984
01:02:41,746 --> 01:02:46,501
Cornflowers. - Cornflowers, yes.
I later get her/it/them, because...

985
01:02:46,906 --> 01:02:50,501
Today, I don't pay in natural produce.
My daughter participates.

986
01:02:50,906 --> 01:02:53,579
"No sleep." No sleep.
Was at 'ner party...

987
01:02:53,986 --> 01:02:57,535
No panties? - Party... - No panties?
- No sleep... No sleep.

988
01:02:57,946 --> 01:03:01,939
No panties? - No, "sleep" is called sleeps,
not "panties." - Ah, okay.

989
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:05,617
Ah, la-la... - Ah, Jack!
- Ah God! - Pig!

990
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:08,780
Ah God!
- A small milk-pig.

991
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:12,781
Ah God, like terrible.
- The French Babe did this.

992
01:03:13,186 --> 01:03:14,938
Oh, that is sad!

993
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:21,139
What is this for a tongue?
- Calf-tongue. - What? - Tongue.

994
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:25,824
Calf-tongue.
- Yes, I already see. - O God!

995
01:03:26,226 --> 01:03:27,739
Okay, ähm...

996
01:03:29,746 --> 01:03:32,897
Lamb. Milk-lamb?
- What? - Milk-lamb!

997
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:40,142
Baby-lamb. - Sweetly, as he/it
the skinned animal-babies imitates!

998
01:03:40,546 --> 01:03:42,901
We take this and then a lamb-club.

999
01:03:43,306 --> 01:03:45,945
It goes me not particularly.
- Really? - Yes.

1000
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:51,374
I would go gladly home.
- You are bad? Okay.

1001
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,856
I looked until four "M",

1002
01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:58,259
and all the people and skinned animals
make me quite crazy.

1003
01:03:58,946 --> 01:04:00,937
I am sick...

1004
01:04:01,986 --> 01:04:05,615
He/it doesn't feel good that he/it must
lay down. - Did he/it guzzle?

1005
01:04:06,186 --> 01:04:09,303
Toot sorrow me. But I like it
very well here, really!

1006
01:04:09,706 --> 01:04:11,503
Pay attention to you.

1007
01:04:12,066 --> 01:04:16,139
You certainly do better soon.
You have the keys, or? - Yes.

1008
01:04:16,546 --> 01:04:20,300
Good-by. Is he/it sick?
- He/it is caught cold. Nothing bad.

1009
01:04:20,706 --> 01:04:23,743
Well, then, we now go
to the Biogemüsestand.

1010
01:04:32,226 --> 01:04:34,376
1 NEW MESSAGES

1011
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:58,376
Does nothing say your mother about it, yes?

1012
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:03,255
Mathieu:

1013
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,497
I am your salami for ever and ever.

1014
01:05:11,786 --> 01:05:15,222
Good day, Madame!
- Ah, I believed you on the market.

1015
01:05:15,626 --> 01:05:18,265
The others still are there.
I wanted to take a shower.

1016
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:22,375
I washed shirts lhre.
However, this doesn't disturb you? - Thank you.

1017
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:25,700
You really do something very nice.

1018
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:29,143
Jean-need... very badly with me...

1019
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:33,735
Badly with me because of... Jim Morrison.

1020
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:36,945
He/it doesn't like the "Doors?"
- Because of me

1021
01:05:37,346 --> 01:05:38,825
with Jim, ugh...

1022
01:05:40,826 --> 01:05:41,815
Yes.

1023
01:05:42,466 --> 01:05:43,455
You/they?

1024
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:47,295
Yes.
- You/they and Jim... Ah!

1025
01:05:47,706 --> 01:05:50,061
A quite small affair.

1026
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:52,582
1969.

1027
01:05:52,986 --> 01:05:54,658
Many people

1028
01:05:55,066 --> 01:05:57,261
was very happy with her/its/their body.

1029
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:59,258
No Aids, no death...

1030
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:02,100
Sex, fun, everyone with everyone.

1031
01:06:03,386 --> 01:06:06,503
The mother is also 'ne slut!
Ah, understands.

1032
01:06:06,906 --> 01:06:10,376
No, really,
that is a beautiful history.

1033
01:06:10,786 --> 01:06:15,701
And know, after it the movement
for abortion, for women?

1034
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:18,017
Ah, the women-movement, yes.

1035
01:06:18,426 --> 01:06:21,384
Yes, "the 343 sluts",
I was one of them. Did you know this?

1036
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:25,699
Ah, you... - I was a slut!
- Ah, understands. - You could...

1037
01:06:26,266 --> 01:06:29,338
me please the tomcat gives?
- Ah, Jean-Luc...

1038
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:33,501
Jean-Luc? - I believe that he/it is...
- He/it is there. - Okay. Good-by.

1039
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,898
Reunions!
- Good-by. Thanks.

1040
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:41,015
Do you create the door?

1041
01:06:42,826 --> 01:06:44,145
Unbelievable.

1042
01:06:51,066 --> 01:06:53,580
What kind of beautiful flowers, Mademoiselle.

1043
01:06:53,706 --> 01:06:56,584
Stop to excavate, dad!

1044
01:06:56,986 --> 01:06:59,625
Excavate?
- You turn on everything, which moves!

1045
01:07:00,026 --> 01:07:02,017
Is beautiful for what moves, however.

1046
01:07:04,306 --> 01:07:07,616
How loved lhr it very much,
if I licked you the Muschi. Mathieu

1047
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:17,937
I am your salami for ever and ever.

1048
01:07:28,826 --> 01:07:33,946
What want you to hear? - What do you have?
- Brel, Ferre, Trenet,

1049
01:07:34,586 --> 01:07:35,575
Barbara...

1050
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:39,940
What do you want. - I play for you
something before. - In agreement.

1051
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:44,577
Today, is day of the music.

1052
01:07:46,226 --> 01:07:49,980
The people play everywhere,
they do music everywhere.

1053
01:07:50,386 --> 01:07:54,345
It is one particular day.
We should walk, not?

1054
01:07:59,626 --> 01:08:00,854
Grizzly?

1055
01:08:11,986 --> 01:08:15,945
You have your camera on that occasion.
- Maybe I take a few photos.

1056
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:21,665
...and pie-lifters.

1057
01:08:22,066 --> 01:08:24,421
A Rasensprenger,

1058
01:08:24,826 --> 01:08:27,056
the Vinaigrette does.

1059
01:08:27,746 --> 01:08:29,896
A beautiful Belüfter...

1060
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:33,380
eats the smells.

1061
01:08:33,786 --> 01:08:36,619
Sheets, that heat,
a waffle-pistol,

1062
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:40,416
an airplane for two,
then, we are happy!

1063
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:41,144
What do you take? - I don't have any hunger.
- Want you to eat nothing at all?

1064
01:08:41,186 --> 01:08:45,464
What do you take? - I don't have any hunger.
- Want you to eat nothing at all?

1065
01:08:47,386 --> 01:08:48,580
Certainly?

1066
01:08:55,106 --> 01:08:56,983
Hello.
- Hello.

1067
01:09:02,386 --> 01:09:05,059
You still work
for your technocrat-newspaper?

1068
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,342
What?
- Nothing. I only said hello.

1069
01:09:08,746 --> 01:09:11,863
Do you know these types?
- Only fleeting. How does it, Edouard, go?

1070
01:09:13,026 --> 01:09:16,985
At least, you are your friends
loyal remained. - Want you to go?

1071
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:22,701
Did you choose? - I would have gladly
a peel of rubbed glasses. - Please?

1072
01:09:23,866 --> 01:09:25,424
Ah, a beer.
- A beer.

1073
01:09:25,826 --> 01:09:29,296
For me an omelet, please.
- An omelet, immediately comes.

1074
01:09:29,706 --> 01:09:31,105
Thanks.

1075
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:35,496
Was it beautiful on the Philippines?

1076
01:09:37,146 --> 01:09:38,545
I am Jack.
- Gael.

1077
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:43,744
Edouard. - Very pleases.
If you see, so we make this for America.

1078
01:09:44,266 --> 01:09:46,302
A moment.
- Okay.

1079
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:51,177
You left me before the trip,
so that you are free. - Let's go.

1080
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:54,384
The emigrants never recover
from these countries.

1081
01:09:54,786 --> 01:09:58,222
How at that time the colonial-men:
The life is so beautiful, the women

1082
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:00,901
so softly, so young.

1083
01:10:01,306 --> 01:10:04,855
Ready? - You can speak?
Are eggs adequate for you approximately meanwhile?

1084
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:08,019
Interesting.
- You never have wounded the separation.

1085
01:10:08,426 --> 01:10:11,816
I didn't wound something else.
But this doesn't belong here.

1086
01:10:12,226 --> 01:10:14,615
Should I go?
- Toot sorrow, darling, me.

1087
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:19,577
Why you simply don't tell me,
about what it goes? No? This is fun.

1088
01:10:19,986 --> 01:10:22,864
You were not at all so desolate,
as I thought.

1089
01:10:23,266 --> 01:10:27,225
You simply were not my type, point.
- Want you to know on what he/it stands?

1090
01:10:27,626 --> 01:10:30,015
Hold the mouth!
- No, already good.

1091
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,779
Everything in order.

1092
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:35,462
I am not his/its type!
The man was in Thailand for a NGO

1093
01:10:35,866 --> 01:10:38,426
and slept twelve-year as well.

1094
01:10:38,826 --> 01:10:42,182
A thirty year old is there of course
less sexy, not true?

1095
01:10:42,346 --> 01:10:45,782
However, that is fantasies!
- Oh, and still something:

1096
01:10:46,186 --> 01:10:50,259
He/it said that we were not allowed to
judge by western standards.

1097
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,857
All different one is there.

1098
01:10:53,226 --> 01:10:57,504
Women, girls, children prostitute
itself, part of her/its/their culture is this.

1099
01:10:57,906 --> 01:11:00,374
One could not feel guilty,
if one fickt she/it.

1100
01:11:00,786 --> 01:11:05,143
Outside, you help the third world,
but actually fickst you she/it.

1101
01:11:05,546 --> 01:11:07,582
You only want to take revenge.

1102
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:11,184
I wanted a Tussi, that the tab
be able to hold. - Oh so.

1103
01:11:11,586 --> 01:11:14,339
With 12, one holds the tab, clear.
But I not!

1104
01:11:14,746 --> 01:11:19,058
Edouard, you know that he/it has your big one(s)
Dear gefickt, as you waited in the vacation.

1105
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,898
Ah... ah, no!

1106
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:27,618
Ah, he/it never has told this to you?
However, this does me sorrow, really.

1107
01:11:28,026 --> 01:11:30,017
Finally hold the tab, you slut!

1108
01:11:33,906 --> 01:11:36,784
What proceeds here? - Already okay.
- What do you do? - I am okay!

1109
01:11:37,546 --> 01:11:39,343
I am okay!
- She/it is sick.

1110
01:11:39,746 --> 01:11:43,898
Already good. I am quite quiet.
All okay one, darling.

1111
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:46,297
I am completely quiet.

1112
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,424
Everything under control!

1113
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:50,295
This is enough!

1114
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,662
Well hears you once!
- Out!

1115
01:11:53,066 --> 01:11:56,502
We didn't break anything.
- Vanish! - Thanks.

1116
01:11:56,906 --> 01:12:00,785
This tosses a great light
on France! - Vanish!

1117
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:03,575
Lot!
- Tourists!

1118
01:12:04,466 --> 01:12:08,300
What? - What then was free with you?
- Does sorrow, okay, do me?

1119
01:12:08,706 --> 01:12:12,142
You wander!
- Don't say this. - The insane gaze!

1120
01:12:12,546 --> 01:12:17,176
What are you? Mike Tyson?
- No, I am not.

1121
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:23,135
I was together with the fellow once,
and he/it did something dreadful!

1122
01:12:23,546 --> 01:12:27,255
No, listens. It was terrible.
That was not normal.

1123
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:31,022
When? When?
- Seven years ago.

1124
01:12:31,426 --> 01:12:35,385
Seven years ago?
And you still are sour?

1125
01:12:35,786 --> 01:12:38,425
He/it did something repulsive.

1126
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:42,102
He/it is a bourgeois
and did something, that...

1127
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:46,340
There, we have it! - He/it lied
and terrible things... - It doesn't matter to me!

1128
01:12:46,746 --> 01:12:50,022
So'n post-colonial shit...
- That doesn't matter to me!

1129
01:12:50,426 --> 01:12:52,417
This doesn't justify your behavior!

1130
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:57,297
You don't have yourself under control.
This must be treated.

1131
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:01,176
But I had myself under control.
I only was...

1132
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:06,102
I was... Okay, I was furious.
But I will never become more furious.

1133
01:13:06,506 --> 01:13:10,897
I lost the mastery,
because he/it had sex with children.

1134
01:13:12,586 --> 01:13:16,181
However, you choose also types!
- That they simply out-toss us!

1135
01:13:16,586 --> 01:13:20,499
They should not have done this? One
Luck, that no one shot us.

1136
01:13:20,906 --> 01:13:23,943
Therefore honest.
- Here, one is not shot.

1137
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:28,544
That is also such a fallacy,
but no matter! Therefore...

1138
01:13:29,346 --> 01:13:32,065
That therefore was another ex?
- Yes.

1139
01:13:32,466 --> 01:13:36,345
Simply another couple of exes.
No big matter, stimmt's?

1140
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,101
Why does it should?
- Is an affair a big matter?

1141
01:13:39,506 --> 01:13:43,818
Is an affair a big matter?
- Yes, of course. - Okay. - What?

1142
01:13:44,226 --> 01:13:48,663
Is the affair with this bloke one?
- With whom? - With Mathieu?

1143
01:13:51,946 --> 01:13:52,935
What?

1144
01:13:54,706 --> 01:13:56,662
I left my cell phone in Paris.

1145
01:13:57,106 --> 01:14:00,701
I got it,
as we brought here the cat.

1146
01:14:01,106 --> 01:14:04,985
It gave my mother to my sister,
and she/it had an affair with him/it.

1147
01:14:05,386 --> 01:14:08,537
He/it has the news
my sister written. - Ah.

1148
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:10,777
Okay, not bad.

1149
01:14:11,186 --> 01:14:15,020
Versuch's now once
with a little more feeling.

1150
01:14:15,426 --> 01:14:18,862
Paint seriously, you must me
hold for the biggest idiot.

1151
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:22,576
I should believe that we victims
is a type of French farce?

1152
01:14:22,986 --> 01:14:25,056
And your poor small sister

1153
01:14:25,466 --> 01:14:27,934
you do to the scapegoat.
She/it has already enough problems.

1154
01:14:28,346 --> 01:14:31,895
She/it works roughly on it, dozens children
to serial killers, to do.

1155
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:36,504
Okay, you are right. I had something
with Mathieu, two years ago,

1156
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:41,184
but it was not anything of seriousness, and it was,
before I met you.

1157
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:45,261
Do you know what I believe slowly?
The little one*-world-theory

1158
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:49,295
refer to your sexual-life.
And it was not two years ago!

1159
01:14:49,706 --> 01:14:52,778
I don't know what he/it writes there,
but it was in January

1160
01:14:53,186 --> 01:14:54,585
and it spoiled.

1161
01:14:55,186 --> 01:14:58,701
Monsieur, what does "Muschi mean leaks?"
- No!

1162
01:14:59,106 --> 01:15:03,463
Verpiss you! - You see: Spoiled!
He/it also found this.

1163
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,536
He/it wrote me on and on,
also as it already...

1164
01:15:07,946 --> 01:15:11,177
Nothing was there,
and actually it is funny.

1165
01:15:11,586 --> 01:15:14,862
Some are really funny.
I translate for you what he/it writes.

1166
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:19,225
That is no serious sex-news.
- You therefore lied.

1167
01:15:19,626 --> 01:15:23,665
I don't lie! I wanted
your feelings don't hurt.

1168
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:26,102
Okay, I lied.

1169
01:15:27,026 --> 01:15:31,463
But that was the single lie.
I didn't do anything bad.

1170
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:33,857
I didn't deceive you!

1171
01:15:34,266 --> 01:15:37,861
How can I trust you? From where
do I know what is "bad" for you?

1172
01:15:38,266 --> 01:15:41,463
In France apparently is
a little anal-sex now and then

1173
01:15:41,866 --> 01:15:44,221
just like fishing rods or Scrabble play.

1174
01:15:44,626 --> 01:15:46,901
Okay, I am sorry. Trust me,

1175
01:15:47,306 --> 01:15:50,343
this doesn't mean me anything.
I didn't do anything bad.

1176
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,943
Please, we are in Paris.
- No, not in Paris.

1177
01:15:54,026 --> 01:15:55,300
In the hell!

1178
01:15:57,426 --> 01:16:00,065
Say it!
- Does something say? - Say: I am a whore.

1179
01:16:00,426 --> 01:16:03,259
I am a whore. - I am a whore.
- I am a whore.

1180
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:07,341
No, I am a whore. Say it!
- No, I am a whore. - Oh so!

1181
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:10,260
You want the friendly one
John-Wayne-Typ, stimmt's, remain?

1182
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:14,898
John Wayne... - You always are the good,
and I am the angry Native American!

1183
01:16:17,626 --> 01:16:19,378
Yes! I am this!

1184
01:16:19,786 --> 01:16:23,904
And do you know something? Not your tail
is to big for French condoms.

1185
01:16:24,306 --> 01:16:27,742
Your ego is too big
for French condoms. And...

1186
01:16:28,146 --> 01:16:30,216
for Italian also!

1187
01:16:32,226 --> 01:16:33,659
Not bad!

1188
01:16:50,066 --> 01:16:53,297
Why said this I?
I am so stupid!

1189
01:16:57,466 --> 01:17:01,220
The next song is for you.
It is called "Who is with you!"

1190
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:05,579
Good day.
- Good day. - Okay...

1191
01:17:05,986 --> 01:17:09,979
I would like a double cheeseburger,
a deep chip and a Pepsi.

1192
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:14,015
Monsieur, I don't speak any English.
- No English? - No.

1193
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:17,736
Okay, one... ähem... one... Moo!

1194
01:17:20,146 --> 01:17:21,625
Okay? Double... two...

1195
01:17:22,026 --> 01:17:23,345
do you know?

1196
01:17:23,746 --> 01:17:29,264
And a deep chip and... Pepsi.
However, Pepsi immediately is called everywhere, or?

1197
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:33,818
We have four menus:
Vegetables, salad, Burger and Doppel-Burger.

1198
01:17:34,226 --> 01:17:38,344
Simply select one.
- Yes, this here. This!

1199
01:17:38,746 --> 01:17:42,295
This? - I don't want the paper,
but the meal on the paper.

1200
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:45,743
This there?
- The meal on the paper, yes.

1201
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:49,655
Thanks.
- This does 5,30 Euro.

1202
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:53,945
Yes! Here, European money!
- Thanks.

1203
01:17:54,346 --> 01:17:58,021
Was she/it/they sour because of the franc?
This certainly annoyed you, however, or?

1204
01:17:59,706 --> 01:18:03,176
Madly, thank you! I hate Paris.
- Thanks. Good-by.

1205
01:18:11,906 --> 01:18:13,942
Hello, Mathieu. Marion is here.

1206
01:18:17,586 --> 01:18:21,625
Hello! - Hello!
- Can I join you?

1207
01:18:24,106 --> 01:18:25,095
Okay.

1208
01:18:33,866 --> 01:18:38,144
This almost-food-chain leaves the animals
with alive body skin.

1209
01:18:39,546 --> 01:18:43,778
Everything is towards-manipulated.
And moths are in the roll.

1210
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:47,496
Moths are in the roll?
- Yes. - Understand.

1211
01:18:51,826 --> 01:18:56,138
Is not so easy here, what? With her/it
Language? - The language, the meal...

1212
01:18:56,546 --> 01:19:00,141
No, no problem, everything clear!
- You seem something harnessed.

1213
01:19:02,306 --> 01:19:06,299
Since just, I know that my friend
a slut is. - How do you mean this?

1214
01:19:06,866 --> 01:19:10,097
She/it has sex with many men,
again and again!

1215
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:14,376
Over long time away.
Probably for money.

1216
01:19:15,386 --> 01:19:16,865
She/it doesn't get enough.

1217
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:21,415
Yes.
- One strong piece, what? - Yes.

1218
01:19:22,826 --> 01:19:27,217
Strangely, that you now called.
I got it exactly from the studio

1219
01:19:27,626 --> 01:19:29,856
and will now accomplish it.

1220
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,094
Voila!

1221
01:19:34,306 --> 01:19:38,185
And... what is this?
I think who is this? - You!

1222
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:42,657
Not badly, or?

1223
01:19:44,266 --> 01:19:47,781
That is really beautiful.
Your style developed very much!

1224
01:19:48,186 --> 01:19:50,256
Yes. Yes, this is correct.

1225
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:56,900
Thanks.
- No, I thank you you.

1226
01:19:57,906 --> 01:19:59,942
You really are this. Unbelievable.

1227
01:20:00,346 --> 01:20:03,816
Maybe I have pushed her/it/them to it
with all my accusations...

1228
01:20:04,226 --> 01:20:06,740
Someday, this leads that...

1229
01:20:07,146 --> 01:20:10,775
Maybe I can myself for her/it/them
absolutely don't open,

1230
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:15,020
because I am afraid to hear, what she/it
would say about her/its/their past.

1231
01:20:15,426 --> 01:20:18,862
So or so, there is not any exchange,
no honesty.

1232
01:20:19,266 --> 01:20:22,702
Sound stupidly, but I still have
never, it admitted that I masturbate.

1233
01:20:23,106 --> 01:20:24,983
Do you understand?

1234
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:28,183
I understand you.

1235
01:20:28,586 --> 01:20:31,703
But the love is the only one,
what is still left for us.

1236
01:20:32,106 --> 01:20:36,702
The world goes the brook down,
and we only have ourselves.

1237
01:20:37,106 --> 01:20:38,175
Yes.

1238
01:20:39,026 --> 01:20:43,577
I am a fairy, do you know?
- Ah, yes. Now... I...

1239
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:47,456
No, no. A real fairy.
- Ah... a real one? - Yes.

1240
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:50,380
You must come back to her.
She/it is no slut.

1241
01:20:50,786 --> 01:20:54,415
You must take care more of her/it/them.
For her/it/them provides, you concerns.

1242
01:20:54,826 --> 01:20:56,578
If you look back someday,

1243
01:20:56,986 --> 01:21:01,298
of what will you think then? Whether you this
or that job got? No.

1244
01:21:01,706 --> 01:21:04,903
You will think of the people,
this you loved, and above all...

1245
01:21:05,306 --> 01:21:10,380
at them/her/it a woman, whom you loved.
And even better: She/it will be there...

1246
01:21:11,986 --> 01:21:13,704
and your hand holds.

1247
01:21:14,106 --> 01:21:15,095
Ah.

1248
01:21:16,826 --> 01:21:19,215
I am immediately again there.
- Okay.

1249
01:22:16,466 --> 01:22:18,855
You must run.
- Run to her back?

1250
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:23,225
No, runs, if the alarm starts.
We fight for a better world.

1251
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:26,982
My number is here. I am Lukas.
- Jack.

1252
01:22:27,386 --> 01:22:30,025
The toilet is full smoke.
The door is locked.

1253
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:46,539
I will explain your friend of all.

1254
01:22:46,946 --> 01:22:48,982
What will you tell then to him/it?

1255
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:53,425
That that was a joke,
that I am totally stupid

1256
01:22:53,826 --> 01:22:56,294
and I you doesn't love. So!

1257
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:01,339
Nobody wants me.
I endure the no more!

1258
01:23:02,466 --> 01:23:03,581
However, this is not allowed to...

1259
01:23:03,826 --> 01:23:05,942
Well loosely, comes out there!

1260
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:10,736
What do you do then?
Does nothing broken or dirty do, yes?

1261
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,019
I call your sister.

1262
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,463
I landed in the Iraq!

1263
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:34,503
Ah, forgiveness!
- From the way, you bottle!

1264
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:39,303
Theft! My bag! That is he/it!
- What is free?

1265
01:23:39,706 --> 01:23:42,425
My bag! Thief!
- No, I am American. - However!

1266
01:23:42,826 --> 01:23:44,942
No, I speak English!
- No! No!

1267
01:23:45,346 --> 01:23:48,577
Ah, the type... He/it is long there!
- Americans, bah! Dirt-Arabs!

1268
01:23:48,986 --> 01:23:50,419
My bag!

1269
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:53,499
Police! Police!
- No, no!

1270
01:23:53,906 --> 01:23:55,305
My bag!

1271
01:23:55,706 --> 01:23:58,459
Thanks. No, an error is this!

1272
01:23:58,866 --> 01:24:01,460
No, lets go! The double!

1273
01:24:01,866 --> 01:24:05,063
I am an inner-architect, damns!
Marion!

1274
01:24:05,466 --> 01:24:07,661
Marion, now comes out there, yes?

1275
01:24:08,066 --> 01:24:11,536
Mathieu doesn't want to touch me.
All men are disgust by me!

1276
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:16,098
What does she/it say there? - I wanted her/it/them
kisses, but she/it howls the whole time.

1277
01:24:16,506 --> 01:24:21,341
Impossible. - Of course, because she/it
her/its/their friend loves. You don't understand anything!

1278
01:24:21,746 --> 01:24:25,625
Marion, what got only into you,
with this fool, to want to sleep?

1279
01:24:26,026 --> 01:24:27,903
I leave you alone.

1280
01:24:28,306 --> 01:24:30,900
Forgiveness, we were mistaken.
Toot sorrow for us.

1281
01:24:31,306 --> 01:24:33,103
Lhr boys was great. Thanks.

1282
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:35,781
Are you sure that it was not he/it?
- Yes, Madame.

1283
01:24:36,186 --> 01:24:39,622
I don't know what you say,
but you have a great voice.

1284
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:47,903
A tea? - Really toot sorrow me,
this with your soap-holder. - Me also.

1285
01:24:48,306 --> 01:24:50,058
What do you have done?

1286
01:24:50,466 --> 01:24:54,095
I dropped him/it, from mistakes.
- Did he/it shatter?

1287
01:24:55,426 --> 01:24:58,463
The arms. You appear here...
- I know that I am terrible.

1288
01:24:58,866 --> 01:25:00,743
The classic stopgap.

1289
01:25:01,146 --> 01:25:05,139
We participate madly in ourselves
Eifersüchteleien, we everything have on that occasion.

1290
01:25:05,546 --> 01:25:09,425
We are crappy bourgeois,
mommy would say.

1291
01:25:09,826 --> 01:25:12,624
If I keep it in mind,
that people die through bombs...

1292
01:25:13,026 --> 01:25:14,903
Don't start again with it!

1293
01:25:15,306 --> 01:25:19,299
Recently, I have an article
read that... - Over what?

1294
01:25:19,706 --> 01:25:23,415
We need four times more toilet-paper than
Men, because we always wipe ourselves off.

1295
01:25:23,826 --> 01:25:27,614
Now, I must keep every time it in mind,
if I go to pee. - At what?

1296
01:25:28,026 --> 01:25:30,142
At everything, which we destroy.

1297
01:25:39,706 --> 01:25:43,255
My sister, I love you.
Although you are annoying totally.

1298
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:47,705
Is that your Schmusetier?
- But no, you. I my however you!

1299
01:25:48,106 --> 01:25:50,336
Thank you, my sister!
- You are really dumb!

1300
01:25:51,826 --> 01:25:55,296
I now go.
- Do you go to your type? - Doesn't know.

1301
01:26:06,626 --> 01:26:07,615
Hello.

1302
01:28:14,186 --> 01:28:15,175
Hey!

1303
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:22,338
I don't know you.

1304
01:28:23,346 --> 01:28:26,179
What do you speak there? Are you drunk?

1305
01:28:29,426 --> 01:28:31,701
I was in an almost-food-restaurant

1306
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:35,223
and have held little hands with a fairy,
this then a bomb put.

1307
01:28:35,626 --> 01:28:40,416
With a fairy? - No, but it was,
as the heaven has sent him/it.

1308
01:28:40,826 --> 01:28:44,182
Maybe a schizophrenic Veganer.
He/it hated fast food.

1309
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:48,420
There, I have something
completely fundamental understood.

1310
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:53,385
I don't know you.
- You don't know me? - No!

1311
01:28:54,466 --> 01:28:58,379
The result of our four-hour one(s)
Discussion: It is not easy,

1312
01:28:58,786 --> 01:29:01,778
to accept the partner so,
as he/it is,

1313
01:29:02,186 --> 01:29:04,177
with all mistakes and weaknesses.

1314
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:06,463
Marion!
- You shaved one "M?"

1315
01:29:06,866 --> 01:29:10,063
Jack confessed me his/its fear,
rejected, to become,

1316
01:29:10,466 --> 01:29:13,458
if he/it revealed me his/its heart.

1317
01:29:13,866 --> 01:29:15,424
Jack noticed after two years with me,

1318
01:29:15,826 --> 01:29:18,420
that he/it didn't know me,
and I him/it also not.

1319
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:22,341
In order to truly love us,
we everything had to know of each other.

1320
01:29:22,746 --> 01:29:24,896
Even if that is not easy.

1321
01:29:26,346 --> 01:29:29,497
Therefore, I told him/it the truth,
that I never had deceived him/it.

1322
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:32,704
I also told him/it,
that I was with Mathieu.

1323
01:29:33,106 --> 01:29:36,496
He/it didn't become angry,
because nothing had happened of course.

1324
01:29:37,746 --> 01:29:42,137
I confessed Jack that it heavy for
me is to for always be established me.

1325
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:44,980
The idea, with this man

1326
01:29:45,386 --> 01:29:48,856
to spend the rest of my life,
To solve problems

1327
01:29:49,266 --> 01:29:53,498
and not with the first difficulty
to give up, falls very heavily for me.

1328
01:29:53,906 --> 01:29:58,024
I told him/it that I can't the rest
spend my life with a man.

1329
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:01,304
It was lied, but I said it.

1330
01:30:01,706 --> 01:30:05,824
He/it asked me, whether I a squirrel
be that collects men like nuts,

1331
01:30:06,226 --> 01:30:09,184
for cold winters.
I found this merrily.

1332
01:30:10,306 --> 01:30:13,059
Then, he/it said something, that hurt me.

1333
01:30:14,026 --> 01:30:16,586
The sound changed drastically.

1334
01:30:16,986 --> 01:30:18,977
Then, I misunderstood him/it.

1335
01:30:19,386 --> 01:30:23,061
I thought that he/it loved me no more
and wanted to separate.

1336
01:30:24,146 --> 01:30:27,343
It always fascinates me, like people
love one only like madly,

1337
01:30:27,746 --> 01:30:29,782
and then nothing more. Nothing.

1338
01:30:30,706 --> 01:30:32,776
This does so sore.

1339
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:37,295
If I have the feeling, somebody wants
left me, I first finish it,

1340
01:30:37,386 --> 01:30:39,297
still before I listened to everything.

1341
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:45,134
It is so.

1342
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:49,060
One more, one few.
Another wasted romance.

1343
01:30:49,466 --> 01:30:51,058
I really loved him/it.

1344
01:30:52,306 --> 01:30:56,094
If I keep it in mind that it is past
and I him/it never again will see...

1345
01:30:56,386 --> 01:30:59,822
Maybe we meet ourselves once,
with new friend or new friend,

1346
01:30:59,946 --> 01:31:02,221
do so,
as we never have been together.

1347
01:31:02,866 --> 01:31:05,426
We then become
more rarely think together,

1348
01:31:06,906 --> 01:31:10,899
until we us completely forgotten...
or almost.

1349
01:31:11,826 --> 01:31:15,819
It always is the same: Separation,
Breakdown, gets drunk,

1350
01:31:16,706 --> 01:31:20,301
meet a fellow, herumficken,
in order to forget him/it only maintaining.

1351
01:31:20,626 --> 01:31:23,220
Then,
after a few months of total emptiness,

1352
01:31:23,306 --> 01:31:27,015
if one looks again for true love.
One seeks desperately everywhere,

1353
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:31,782
and after two years of loneliness
if one meets a new love

1354
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:36,098
and swear that he/it is the right.
Until he/it then is also again away.

1355
01:32:02,906 --> 01:32:04,419
And then, a moment is in the life there,

1356
01:32:04,506 --> 01:32:07,066
from him/it one none
further separation come to terms with.

1357
01:32:09,986 --> 01:32:12,659
And even, if one this human being

1358
01:32:12,946 --> 01:32:14,743
60 percent of the time annoys,

1359
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:17,415
if one can live no more without him/it.

1360
01:32:18,306 --> 01:32:20,820
And even if he/it one
every day awakens,

1361
01:32:20,906 --> 01:32:23,022
because he/it sneezes one into the face,

1362
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:27,259
well, then, one loves his/its sneezing

1363
01:32:27,826 --> 01:32:30,215
more than the kisses an each other.
