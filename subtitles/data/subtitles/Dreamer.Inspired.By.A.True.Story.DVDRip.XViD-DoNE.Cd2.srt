1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Third place. So, what'd she get?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,800
$1,100.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,800
- Sonador. Ben Crane?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,700
Claimed.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,900
- What? You got to be kidding me.
- Claimed?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,100
- Wait a second. Hang on.
- You said she wouldn't get claimed.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,100
- Cale, listen to me.
- What was the tag?

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,300
How much did you get for her?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,800
15,000.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,400
You just sold Sonador.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,900
I don't believe this.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,800
Cale...

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I wasn't trying to sell Sonya.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Out of 100 horses
that could have been claimed,

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,400
you know how many got claimed?
Two.

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,800
Do you understand
that you got to claim the horse

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,300
before the race is even run?

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,900
I figured there's no way
anybody'd take a chance

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,000
on a filly that'd already
broken her leg.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,500
I guess there was some chance.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,000
She's gone.

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,300
She was a good horse, Cale.
I'm going to miss her, too.

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,600
Please don't treat me
like a little kid.

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,000
You were trying to get
some of your money back.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,900
I get it. It's business.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
That's right, it is.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,900
But I wasn't trying to sell Sonya, OK?

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,400
You lied to me.

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,700
You said I'd always have Sonador.
You stood right there and said it.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,700
You raced her and she got claimed.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Well, everything doesn't end up
the way you want it to.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,000
She wasn't for sale.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,700
Every racehorse everywhere
in the world, right now, is for sale.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Get that.

35
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,800
She wasn’t just some racehorse.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
She was our horse.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,100
I told Pat I would work
the dinner shift tonight.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
You said you'd go
to Cale's school for Parents' Night.

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Eight o'clock. I got it.

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,100
All right.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Have a good time.

42
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,400
"My shirt was wet
and it smelled like French toast."

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,600
"So even though I threw up, I was happy
my dad took me to the firehouse."

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,700
"The end."

45
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Thank you, Miss Richardson.
Thank you.

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,300
- Ben Crane.
- Yes, ma'am.

47
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,600
I'd love you to read Cale's story.
It's very inventive.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
It's right there in the blue folder.

49
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Come on up.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,400
"Once upon a time
there was a noble king."

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,600
"He lived in a beautiful castle
overlooking green fields."

52
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,300
"An evil storm cast darkness
over his castle."

53
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,700
"And before he knew it,

54
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,600
dark knights had begun
to take away his kingdom

55
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,500
one piece at a time."

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,000
"But our king was a warrior and he knew
that if he could find his magic horse,

57
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,500
he could restore the kingdom
to greatness."

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,200
"He was not like most kings.
He was quiet and kind."

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
"Everyone loved the king,
which he may not have known."

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,200
"He searched and searched and finally
rescued his horse from a raging river."

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,500
"But by the time
he'd freed his horse,

62
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,200
his kingdom was gone
and he had given up."

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,300
"But the horse knew better than he."

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,000
"The horse took him over mountain ranges
and across raging rivers."

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,400
"When it finally looked like they would
die, the horse asked him to trust him."

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,000
"The king didn't know if the horse
had really spoken to him

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
or he just hadn't had anything to eat
in a few days."

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
"Not soon after, the horse attempted
to climb a mountain so steep

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
the king was sure
it would be their deaths."

70
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,300
"But the horse reached the top."

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,000
"And at the top,
they found his kingdom restored."

72
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,300
"All those who loved him
greeted the king with pie and coffee."

73
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,800
"By Cale Crane."

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,700
- Can we keep these?
- Yes.

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,100
I read your story tonight at school.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The stupid one about the king?

77
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Yeah, the stupid king.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,900
I made mistakes, Cale.

79
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,300
So you like the stupid king?

81
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,800
Yeah, I like the stupid king.

82
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,200
I love the stupid king.

83
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,200
He loves you, too.

84
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,400
Ben, there's some guy here
to see you.

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Cale.

86
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,200
I got Pop a new goat.
Want to pull him out of the trailer?

87
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,700
Thanks a lot.

88
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,200
Sonya! Sonya!

89
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
You came home!

90
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,100
I'm so glad you're back.
How'd you get her back?

91
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,800
It wasn’t just me.
Pops helped out. Too.

92
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I did?

93
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,500
We're both out of coffee for a while.

94
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,200
All right,
I got all the paperwork here.

95
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Cale, we put 51 percent
of Sonador in your name.

96
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,900
So from here on out,
you make all the decisions.

97
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Don't worry, you'll have 39 percent.

98
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,600
Balon, you and Manny
can split the other ten, huh?

99
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
What are you saying, Ben?

100
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,300
Well, I'm saying as soon
as she signs this paper,

101
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,200
the new owner of Sonador
is Cale Crane.

102
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,900
Welcome to the race business.
Congratulations.

103
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,100
You work for her now.

104
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,500
OK, boss...

105
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
- Me?
...what's it going to be?

106
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,300
- Come on.
- Let's go, señorita. Come on.

107
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,900
Should I warm her up and then push her
a little for three furlongs? Maybe four?

108
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,600
You want us to blow her out, right?
Then we can start to build her up.

109
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah. Let's just blow her out.

110
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,300
Appreciate it, Bob.

111
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,400
If anything comes up,
you let me know, huh? All right. 'Night.

112
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Hey...

113
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,600
- You're up kind of late.
- Been reading all of Sonya's records.

114
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,800
She won over 200,000
in graded company.

115
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Oh, yeah, I know.

116
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,000
Qualifies her for a lot of stakes races.
I looked through the conditions book.

117
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Well, I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

118
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
I want you to help me.

119
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,300
I want you to help me train her.

120
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
I see.

121
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,300
Well, you'd be getting a trainer.
What is it I'd be getting?

122
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Ten percent.

123
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,300
- 20.
- 15.

124
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,200
- Done.
- Sign here.

125
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Straight across. Not too tight.

126
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,700
That's it. There you go.

127
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,700
Come on, girl. Come on.

128
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,700
Get up. Let's go.

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
She look good?

130
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
- All right, here we go.
- Hello.

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
I want to thank everyone for coming.

132
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,800
I've scouted all of Sonador's
possible races

133
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
and picked one I know she can win.

134
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,100
Really?

135
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,300
And when is this race?

136
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Saturday, October 29th.

137
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,100
Gotten the best jockey.
His name is Manolin Vallarta.

138
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
Well, I'm Manolin Vallarta.

139
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,500
Great idea.

140
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,500
You once told me you were the greatest
jockey in the world and I believe you.

141
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,700
Thank you, Cale.
Thank you, but I can't. I'm not ready.

142
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
I'm...

143
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,700
Fat and I got to slim down.
Right, Manny?

144
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
October 29th is the same day

145
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,700
as the Breeders' Cup Championship,
isn't it?

146
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,400
Biggest day in racing.

147
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Breeders' Cup is eight races
worth 14 million dollars?

148
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,100
I don't think you want to run in a race
on the same day as the Breeders' Cup.

149
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,700
You're right. We shouldn't run in a race
the same day as the Breeders' Cup.

150
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,500
That's why we're going to run
in the Breeders' Cup.

151
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,200
That's ambitious.

152
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,500
You can’t just show up
with your horse at the Breeders' Cup

153
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
and say "I'm here.
I want to run in the Classic."

154
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,900
- It doesn't work that way.
- Be nice if it did.

155
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Do you know
what the selection process is?

156
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Fourteen horses.

157
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
First seven are graded stakes wins,
points, I don't know.

158
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,200
Last seven are...

159
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
No. No, I don't, really.

160
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,400
The last seven they base on
performance during the year.

161
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,800
But they can make a judgment call.

162
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,300
I'm going to take a shot.

163
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,200
It's a long shot
but why not Sonador?

164
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,500
Why not us?

165
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,200
- Why not Sonador?
- That's right.

166
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,100
We going to the Breeders' Cup.

167
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,200
Did you really not know
how the last horses were chosen?

168
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
No, I didn't. Why would I?
I never been there.

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But if Sonya does get in, there'll be
huge fees for a race like that.

170
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,500
So, you know, this is a pipe dream.

171
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Remember dreams, Ben?

172
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,700
Well, this one's Cale's.
Help her live it.

173
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,200
I want to, Lil. I do.

174
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm just saying, it isn't going
to happen. That's all, honey.

175
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
So what? So what?

176
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,000
Just let it take her as far as it can.

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
All right.

178
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,400
Five furlongs in 1.01 and change.

179
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,500
That's better, but...

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,700
She was breezing, Dad. Don't worry.

181
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,400
They're good. They look good.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,700
Hey, guys.

183
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,100
You guys got my favorite.

184
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,400
Balon, where's mine?

185
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Yummy.

186
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,200
This is an orange?

187
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,400
It looks like a painted golf ball.

188
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,000
Manny, run her
closer to the rail, will you?

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,300
The donuts aren't that good.

190
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
- Oh no!
- Give me another jelly.

191
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
Back up.

192
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,600
Are we lucky?

193
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,200
Good girl. Yes. Come on.
Come on, Sonya.

194
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Cale?

195
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm up. I'm up.

196
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,200
But, my horse Rapid Cat, is the son of
Storm Cat, the best sire in the world.

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,200
He deserves to run
in the Breeders' Cup.

198
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Mr. Sadir Abal,
Rapid Cat is 18th on the point list.

199
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,900
We've got 14 spots.

200
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,200
There's not much hope
for Rapid Cat. Next.

201
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
Is Mr. Cale Crane here?

202
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm Cale Crane.

203
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,400
Why don't you stand up?

204
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Miss Cale Crane.

205
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,700
Your horse Sonador has 20 points
and that puts her 16th on the list.

206
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,600
Though I see that last year
she had 42 points.

207
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,200
Yes, sir. She'd have that many points
this year, but she was injured.

208
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,000
She was injured? Well, do you have
a vet's report says she's sound?

209
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,700
Right here, sir.

210
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,900
Thank you.

211
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,600
Now, you know there are
14 horses that get to run.

212
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,100
And your horse got a shot.

213
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,100
But to enter this horse in this race,
there'll be a fee of $40,000.

214
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,300
Did you bring a check?

215
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I mailed it.

216
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Today.

217
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,100
Let's say that the panel determines
that Sonador belongs in this race.

218
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,400
Now, there's another
80,000 dollars in fees

219
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,100
that's going to be due
on October 26th.

220
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,200
You prepared for that?

221
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
She'll mail it to you.

222
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,300
Yes, sir, I am.

223
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,800
Final selection
will be at 11am tomorrow.

224
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,700
- We got a deal?
- You got a deal. Congratulations.

225
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,400
My knight in shining armor's
come to rescue me?

226
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,400
Bye. I'm going to take off.
I'll see you tomorrow.

227
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,700
See you later.

228
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Is Cale with Pop?

229
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Yeah, they're going over
race strategies.

230
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
- She going to get in?
- Selection's in the morning.

231
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,000
How did Cale do
in front of the committee?

232
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,400
Truth? It was rough.
She got kicked around pretty good.

233
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,200
- Why are you smiling?
- Because she kicked right back.

234
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,400
Yeah, she reminds me of somebody.

235
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,900
You were right, Lil.
It was great just letting her try.

236
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,500
So you're saying that I'm smart?

237
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm saying you're smart and beautiful.

238
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,800
You think she has a chance
of getting in.

239
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,400
There's a chance.

240
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,700
And the entry fees
are $120,000. OK?

241
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Did you hear me?

242
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,800
Why are you smiling?

243
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,100
I feel like I'm on a date.

244
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Cale?

245
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
Time for bed, honey.

246
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, that works a little better
than a bucket now, doesn't it?

247
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes.

248
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,400
So how much will you bet
on Sonador to win the Classic?

249
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Don't you think she can win?

250
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,300
You got to think she can win.
What's the harm in that?

251
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,200
- Say "I think she can win."
- I think she can win.

252
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,000
Good.

253
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,300
She needs to hear you say that.

254
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,200
I would like to see you
run against those boys.

255
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,200
May I have your attention, please?

256
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,800
I am proud to announce the field

257
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,100
for the 22nd running
of the Breeders' Cup Classic.

258
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,200
We start in alphabetical order.

259
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
A.P. Flyer.

260
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Argus.

261
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Bicycleman.

262
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Bijoco.

263
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Chief Balaz.

264
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Full Of Flight.

265
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,600
Goliath's Boy.

266
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,100
Grand Duke.

267
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,200
Icondoit.

268
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,600
In The Rooms.

269
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Note's Weasel.

270
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
On The Hops.

271
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,100
And our last two runners are:

272
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,500
Point Twice...

273
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
...and...

274
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
...Sonador.

275
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Yes!

276
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
Way to go!

277
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,300
No. No.

278
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,000
I gave it away.

279
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,600
You gave it away.
You don't even know the joke.

280
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,500
I can't believe I just did that.

281
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,700
Well, I had to see for myself.

282
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,200
It's amazing.

283
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Well, it's good to see the Cranes
all in one spot.

284
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,900
Pop Crane.
The famous Pop Crane.

285
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Evening, fellas.

286
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,300
How can we help you?

287
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,900
Well, you have to ask yourselves
how much it's worth to you

288
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,900
to have this broken filly
finish 14th in a field of 14.

289
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,500
How much you want
to embarrass yourselves.

290
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,100
Because we all know that this horse
has got no business in that race.

291
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,300
Ben, I feel bad about
what happened between us.

292
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,400
No, look, honestly, I do.
And I'd like to make it right.

293
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
I'll give you...

294
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,700
...20,000 in cash for her.

295
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,000
- 20 grand?
- Yeah.

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,600
Let's see. Manny,
that's $1,000 for you.

297
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,000
$1,000 for you, Balon.

298
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,800
A whole 1,000 for me?

299
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,200
I guess I could get me
a couple of steak dinners now.

300
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,400
Maybe some wine,
maybe some tube socks.

301
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,200
$1,000 for me, too?

302
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,400
I could buy me a thousand pair
of dollar underwears.

303
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,800
Wait, my share's
about eight grand.

304
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,600
I've only got 20 invested.
Where do I sign?

305
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
$40,000.

306
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,700
All right?

307
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,600
I brought my guys and a trailer with me.
So your luck is changing.

308
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,700
I know what you paid for that horse.

309
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,200
- Are we done here?
- Not my horse, Everett.

310
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,700
Well, what do you say, honey?

311
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm not selling her.

312
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,800
OK, I found my other pocket.
All right?

313
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,500
And you listen to me.
This is your last chance.

314
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,400
I have a certified check for $100,000.

315
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,800
And if you take this offer

316
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
I'll give your dad his job back.

317
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,300
I can't believe it.
The Cranes have finally won one.

318
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,900
Dad?

319
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
If it was me...

320
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
...I’d tell him to take his money
and his empty trailer

321
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,000
and get the hell off our farm.

322
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
But...

323
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,300
...that's just me.

324
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,100
You're running Goliath's Boy
in the Classic?

325
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,500
That's right. He is the favorite.

326
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,200
And when he wins the Cup,
it'll be my fifth horse of the year.

327
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,100
Do you think Goliath's Boy remembers
what Sonya's butt looks like?

328
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Why?

329
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,900
Because it's all it will be
seeing of her on race day.

330
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,600
That's a good one, kid.
That's funny, ain't it? That's funny.

331
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,600
Suit yourself.

332
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Dad.

333
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,000
Any luck?

334
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,300
I can't find a sponsor for this race.
Nobody wants to take a chance on her.

335
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,200
Called everybody I can think of.

336
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,100
You ever seen a kid
so happy with a horse?

337
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,700
Yeah. I have.

338
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,500
Pick it up.

339
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,700
Come on. Pick it up.

340
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
Good girl.

341
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,400
There's other races, darling,
that don't cost so much to enter.

342
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I've lost 15 pounds in three weeks.

343
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,100
You should stop training.
We don't have the money to run.

344
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,500
Going down to the Breeders' Cup to tell
them we're dropping out of the race.

345
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,900
I had a dream last night, Cale.

346
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
I was on a horse.

347
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,800
A fast horse. That horse and me...
We're flying like angels.

348
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,000
How'd it end?

349
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,700
I woke up and my hunger was gone.

350
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,600
It was God telling me to race again.

351
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,000
Thank you, Cale.

352
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,800
May God bless you.

353
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,900
Nobody ever thought we'd get in.

354
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
No, they didn't. But you did it.

355
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Cale. Pop. Come on.
Get in the truck.

356
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,200
Come on, let's go.

357
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,800
- Great idea, Dad.
- He said he'd talk to us.

358
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,600
- What are you going to say?
- I'm not. You are.

359
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,700
I'm here to see Prince Sadir.

360
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,300
The prince is expecting you.
Please join him.

361
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,200
Prince Sadir, I'm Cale Crane.

362
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,300
- I remember you.
- This is my dad and my granddad.

363
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,600
- Morning.
- Appreciate you taking my call.

364
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,800
120,000?

365
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,300
40,000 for the nomination fee
and 80,000 for the entrance fee.

366
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,800
Prince Tariq is sure he's going to win.

367
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,600
Goliath's Boy is a big, big horse.

368
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,900
Goliath's Boy is a bully.

369
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,900
He's a bluffer and her horse knows it.

370
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Cale, you look me in the eye
and you tell me

371
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
you think your horse has a chance
of beating my brother's horse.

372
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,300
My horse will beat every horse
that shows up.

373
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,500
Yeah, we're in!

374
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,000
We are in the Breeder's Cup!
I can't believe it!

375
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,500
"You are a great champion."

376
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,600
"When you ran, the ground shook,

377
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,500
the sky opened
and mere mortals parted."

378
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,300
"Parted the way to victory, where
you'll meet me in the winner's circle

379
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,700
and I'll put a blanket
of flowers on your back."

380
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Run hard tomorrow.

381
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Run hard for my dad.

382
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
He deserves a good run.

383
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,700
Pop?

384
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Just a minute.

385
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,200
- What?
- In 21 Breeders' Cup Classics,

386
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,700
you know how many fillies
have ever won it?

387
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,700
None. Only four fillies ever ran.

388
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,600
She's not even ready.
Palmer's right.

389
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,200
This is going to be an embarrassment.

390
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,200
What am I doing here, Pop?

391
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,500
You're taking your kid and your horse
to the Breeders' Cup tomorrow.

392
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,000
Because that's the dream
of every real horseman.

393
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,900
It's the dream of every father.

394
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,500
Dream damn few ever get to see.

395
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,400
Damn few, trust me on that one.

396
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,200
Listen, Lilly and Cale
are driving down in the morning

397
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,600
and Lilly doesn't really know
where to go so...

398
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I want you to come to the race.

399
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,600
Pop, as your son,
I'm asking you to come.

400
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,400
Be with me and Cale.

401
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
OK.

402
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,400
OK. Good.

403
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Good.

404
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,100
OK, Sonya. Here you go, mama.
You are done. You are ready, mama.

405
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,600
OK, Manolin, looking good.

406
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,100
Good job. Good job.

407
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,900
Good job, sweetie.
Good job. Good job.

408
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,100
- You got her?
- Yeah, I got her.

409
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
You look muy bella.

410
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,700
Well, thank you, Balon.

411
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,800
I was talking to her.

412
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,900
Here you go, Manny.

413
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,400
Here's the original silks
of the Crane Race Farm.

414
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,300
I'm taking this good-looking thing to
the owners' box and show off that hat.

415
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,900
- Have a great race, Manny.
- Thank you, Mrs. Crane.

416
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,200
Sure wish we had
another couple of weeks.

417
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
She's ready to run.

418
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
You saved her life.

419
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,500
She's just returning the favor.

420
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
She's here to run for you.

421
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,300
Mr. Palmer. So, what do you expect
from Goliath's Boy today?

422
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
What do I expect
from Goliath's Boy?

423
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,700
I expect that Goliath's Boy's
going to have some fun today.

424
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,300
There's Ben Crane and Sonador.
80-1 shot.

425
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,900
Hey, Ben.
How about we get a picture here

426
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,500
with Sonador and Goliath's Boy.

427
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,200
Just a little photo opportunity.

428
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,600
No.

429
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
- Get him away!
- Control your horse!

430
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,100
Sonya! No, no, no!

431
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,600
Get him away!

432
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,700
Easy, easy, easy!

433
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
It's all right. I got him.

434
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,900
- Will you control your horse?
- I got him.

435
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,100
Easy, boy. It's OK.

436
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,500
- Grab a hold of her.
- Easy.

437
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,200
Going to be OK.

438
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,200
I don't believe it.
I'm feeling heat in that leg.

439
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,800
I don't know if it's me or...

440
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,700
What do you want to do?
What do you want to do, boss?

441
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,800
- What do you want to do?
- Bring her in here.

442
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,100
Dad...

443
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,700
What are the chances
she's cut on the same leg

444
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,800
we've healed for over 6 months?

445
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,600
This is beyond bad luck.

446
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,300
Are you afraid?

447
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,000
Are you afraid that we're going
to come in dead last?

448
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,800
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Bring her in here.

449
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
- Sir, it's Sonya.
- Just bring her in here.

450
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,300
She won't come in!

451
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,600
Manny. Manny. Hang on.

452
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,700
- She doesn't want to move.
- Hold on. Come here.

453
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,600
She tried to kick me
when I tried to bring her in.

454
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Come here, girl. Come on, now.
Hold on. Come here, girl.

455
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,100
Easy now.

456
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,200
What do you want?

457
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Easy.

458
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What's she telling you?

459
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,700
I don't know.

460
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
Something about...

461
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,500
...the ground shaking.

462
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,500
Sky parting.

463
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,500
She wants to run.

464
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,900
Let's go.

465
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,100
Balon, take Cale to our seats.

466
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Good luck.

467
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Come on, girl.

468
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,400
I got a special package here.

469
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,900
This is going to be great.

470
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,200
- I'm very excited, ain't you?
- Hello.

471
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,200
This is just for owners.

472
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,900
I know. That'd be us.

473
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,000
That would be us. Yeah.

474
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,000
- Thank you very much.
- Good luck.

475
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,200
Here we go.
Are we down this way?

476
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,600
This way, yeah. That's it.

477
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,300
- Do you know anyone here? I don't.
- No, I don't.

478
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,900
Horses coming out onto the track

479
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,100
for the Grade 1
$4,000,000 Breeders' Cup Classic:

480
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,600
The biggest race in North America.

481
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,600
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

482
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,300
Eighth race.
20 to win on the seven.

483
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,300
Seven? That's Sonador.

484
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,700
That horse is 80-1.

485
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
You know what?

486
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
You're right.

487
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,800
$257 on Sonador to win.

488
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,500
You like that?

489
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Good luck.

490
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,800
A reminder
of two jockey changes here.

491
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,700
Number 11, Grand Duke
will now be ridden by Alan Reid.

492
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Well, you ready?

493
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Pop.

494
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,400
257 to win?

495
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
You're crazy.

496
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,900
That's for you.

497
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Here's the moment
we've been waiting for.

498
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,400
They're ready to load into the gate
for the Breeders' Cup Classic.

499
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,000
And here's Goliath's Boy.
Is he full of himself this afternoon.

500
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,200
Goliath's Boy is good
and he knows he's good.

501
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Very aggressive this afternoon.

502
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,000
Goliath's Boy looks like he's going
to run a huge race.

503
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,100
He's loaded in the gate now,
joined by Bijoco and Note's Weasel.

504
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,500
Icondoit and Point Twice coming up.
Now, here's the filly, Sonador.

505
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,900
Only the fifth filly
to even run in this race.

506
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,100
Sonador joined now by Bicycleman.

507
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,100
And here's young Manny Vallarta,
the rider of Sonador.

508
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,500
Certainly never been in a race this big
in his entire career.

509
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,600
Grand Duke and Full Of Flight
are going in. Almost all set now.

510
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Chief Balaz to come to the outside gate
and they'll all be set for a start.

511
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,700
They're all set.

512
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,700
And away they go.

513
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,400
Broke in a perfect line.
In The Rooms on the inside.

514
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,800
The favorite, Goliath's Boy, comes away
beautifully and joins the leaders.

515
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,600
Note's Weasel is right there.
Bijoco in the middle of the pack.

516
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,400
Icondoit towards the outside.
Then it's Point Twice and Bicycleman,

517
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,700
setting a very fast pace early on.

518
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,400
A.P. Flyer behind that.
On the Hops as they go wide.

519
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,600
Then back to Grand Duke
and Full Of Flight.

520
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,700
Sonador is second last at the back.

521
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,700
In The Rooms on the inside

522
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,700
but the favorite, Goliath's Boy,
right there with them.

523
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,800
Hold on, Manny!

524
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,300
It looks like the rider's foot
has come out the irons on Sonador.

525
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,300
Get back up.

526
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,800
Make her settle.

527
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,000
- She's last.
- There's a lot of race left.

528
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,800
First quarter, 22 and one.

529
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,000
Go, Sonya!

530
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,300
Go, Sonya!

531
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,300
Sonador's passing a horse
with each and every stride

532
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,600
as they come to the top of the lane.

533
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,200
In The Room's the leader.

534
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,800
The filly Sonador
moving into the picture.

535
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,200
- This big long shot, Sonador...
- Come on, Sonya.

536
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,000
And Sonador could be a danger
to the favorite, Goliath's Boy.

537
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
And Goliath's Boy goes on for home.

538
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,100
Come on, Sonya. Take him out.

539
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,400
The filly Sonador is up
alongside of Goliath's Boy.

540
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,600
They come down to the wire,
Goliath's Boy and Sonador.

541
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
And it's Sonador!

542
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,300
Unbelievable. The filly Sonador
has come from last.

543
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,400
And look at this, the odds 80-1.
The biggest stunning upset...

544
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,200
Oh, baby, I had a dream.

545
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,100
It was a dream and I didn't know
the end of it till today!

546
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Yeah!

547
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,800
Thanks, Pop. Thanks for everything.

548
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,000
Thank you.

549
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,400
257 at 80-1?

550
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,900
That's $20,000. I'm back.

551
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,700
"You are a great champion."

552
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,000
"When you ran, the ground shook,

553
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,400
the sky opened
and mere mortals parted."

554
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,800
"Parted the way to victory where
you'll meet me in the winner's circle

555
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,100
where I'll put a blanket
of flowers on your back."

556
