00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:04,173
My name is Benjamin Keynes.

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:06,248
I work for the directorat
of operations within the...

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:08,948
Central Intelligence Agency.

4
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:11,869
Three days after 9/11,

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,197
reconnaissance satellites picked up
a radioactive heat signature...

6
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:17,854
in a remote tribal region
of Afghanistan.

7
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:22,796
The Agency feared Al-Qaeda may finally
got their hands on a nuclear weapon.

8
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:27,707
However, I was told by a local source
with a high degree of confidence...

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,476
that it was maybe something
much more powerful...

10
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,958
It has been more than ten years,
since I left this place.

11
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,911
I forgot how brutal it could be.

12
00:00:57,137 --> 00:01:01,376
I feel like every time we enter this country,
it tries to spit us back out.

13
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,794
Almost everyone here at the TO
is too busy fighting a war,

14
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:13,545
to pay much attention to me.
Which is a good thing.

15
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:19,015
Sir, Agent Keynes.

16
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,900
I finally met the CO
and the teamleader,

17
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,528
Sergeant Wallis Hamer.

18
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:28,892
I gave them the official line, as if
I read it from the memo back at Langley.

19
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:34,752
Major Keynes, this may be your show,
but these are my boys, understand?

20
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:37,150
Absolutely.

21
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:40,779
No doubt they assumed I was lying.

22
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:56,722
My first order of business was to recconect
with my local source, Mohammed Aban.

23
00:01:56,723 --> 00:02:02,649
He asked me come, therefore I hope that
he is there, when we knock at his door.

24
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,545
Sir, the men are ready for you now.

25
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:15,168
Major Keynes, let me introduce
you to the guys.

26
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:19,008
This is my team daddy, Master-Sergeant Tanner,
he's also our fox, intel.

27
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,763
He helped me put the group together
back in the day.

28
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:26,019
- Our senior medic, Sergeant Degetau.
- What's up, man.

29
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,485
Demolitions, Sergeant Trinoski.
The on the floor there is Sergeant Cole.

30
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:38,355
And last but not least, Sergeant Sadler,
he's weapons and resident Afghan expert.

31
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,502
392 is a shit-hot team.
You won't find any better.

32
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:43,580
That's why I'm here.

33
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:48,965
Gentlemen, thankyou for
coming together on such short notice.

34
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:54,629
My orders are to make contact
with an HVT called Mohammed Aban.

35
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,536
A cleric, living in
the Southern provinces.

36
00:02:57,556 --> 00:03:00,056
We're to get his
recorded statement,

37
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:03,257
in which he supports
the American mission here.

38
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,397
This is our man.

39
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,861
Everybody take a look.

40
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,894
Aban is highly respected
by the local population.

41
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:19,810
He's considered the spiritual force,
that helped the Mujahadin defeat the Soviets.

42
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:24,411
I thought the CIA was the spiritual force
that helped them defeat the Soviets.

43
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:32,438
That depends of your definition
of spiritual, sergeant.

44
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:35,366
Aban has kept a very low profile
under the Taliban,

45
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,015
so it is crucial
that we make contact,

46
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,866
as soon as we have
a fix on his position.

47
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:42,614
Remember, when we hit the ground,
this is a meet and greet.

48
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,225
To smile at the locals,
we hand out pens,

49
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:48,490
we win hearts and minds.
No kicking in doors, okay?

50
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,168
The mission starts at 1400 hours.

51
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:54,791
0130 inspections.

52
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:58,142
- 0230 we are wheels up.
- Let's move out.

53
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:04,416
Remember nothing's routine.

54
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:12,058
Special Forces Team 392.
I'd actually heard of them.

55
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:18,481
They worked with the Zagran.
Smart men, men good with secrets.

56
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,833
But that goes without saying.

57
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,681
Nice camera.

58
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:29,219
I gave my wife one for our anniversary.
Still don't know how to use the damn thing.

59
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,012
That's because
you never let her use it, Ski.

60
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:36,895
What kind of a man gives his wife a
video camera for their anniversary?

61
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:42,246
- Very romantic, ski.
- I'll use it to film the baby when it comes.

62
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:45,268
Your wife's gonna
spread her legs,

63
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,917
let you put the camera right here
and film the head coming out?

64
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,585
My sister's gonna
do the recording,

65
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,634
I still don't know how to
use the damn thing.

66
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:57,492
All I'm saying is don't be surprised
if your baby's born with a suntan.

67
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,944
Two minutes!

68
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,670
Get ready!

69
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:48,547
When I stepped off the chopper,
I had an overwhelming sense of relief.

70
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,153
The time for second-guessing is over.

71
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,490
The objective is all that matters.

72
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:57,640
I have no choice now but to find it.

73
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:07,142
- It's pretty quiet from here.
- Those are the ones I worry about most.

74
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:12,253
I say we set an overwatch.

75
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,437
Yeah, you and Pete set up
down there on that hill.

76
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:20,838
Let us know
when it's good to go.

77
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:25,500
Everyone else, Keynes and I are the
welcome wagon. We go in first.

78
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:29,901
- Keynes, are you ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

79
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:35,932
Everybody keep your eyes open.
The place could be crawlin' with bad guys.

80
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,465
Hello.

81
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,771
Let me talk to her.

82
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:05,336
Nothing has changed
since I was here last.

83
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,415
The only way you can tell
which decade you're in...

84
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,216
is the colour
of the soldiers' uniforms.

85
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:30,649
Aban contacted me a week before I
received orders to come out here.

86
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:36,019
He was barely coherent at the time and
I thought he'd finally lost his mind.

87
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,892
That was until
we saw it for ourselves.

88
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:50,623
My grandfather says, he has gone because
the Taliban would have murdered him.

89
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:08,842
What d'you want?.
You want some chocolate?

90
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,960
Got some special stuff.
I got that from New York. For you.

91
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:15,810
You're a smart, little kid.

92
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:18,480
Looks like we're gonna be
ghostbustin' again.

93
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,640
Yeah, well,
that's what Spooks do, isn't it?

94
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,624
Hey, any of you guys get a close
look at that camera?

95
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,475
No, what's wrong with it?

96
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:28,176
He didn't pick that shit up at the PX,
I'll tell you that much.

97
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:32,210
Need to use the radio.

98
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:38,950
Serpent 76. Serpent 76.
This is Beast 92, over.

99
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,032
Serpent 76, we're at the location.
The package is not here.

100
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:47,333
Request immediate
extraction, over.

101
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,820
We found Aban's house,
but we can't tell...

102
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:52,821
if we're finding clues
or breadcrumbs.

103
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,718
I wonder what these people
would do...

104
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,856
if they had suddenly the power
to destroy nations.

105
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:29,056
The rest of us can only pray that
they have become weary of fighting.

106
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:21,126
My grandfather says that no-one
can liberate Afghanistan.

107
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:23,106
Only Allah can free us
from the Taliban.

108
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,268
Yes, I know. My father took me
there a few years ago...

109
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,687
He showed me the place
where he wanted to be buried,

110
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,936
But it's too late now.

111
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:48,087
He was kidnapped by the Taliban
last year. I fear he's dead now.

112
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,783
How did you know this?

113
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:07,884
What'd he say?

114
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:10,519
I think he can help us.

115
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,920
You have up to 0300, then we're
moving out for extraction.

116
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:18,474
- I have to make a call.
- Cole, the sat-phone.

117
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:23,175
- I have my own.
- Got his own.

118
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,656
- Fuckin' James Bond.
- You know James Bond?

119
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:31,149
Yeah, I know James Bind.
He washed out of basic training.

120
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,924
I told headquarters
I was moving on to phase two.

121
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,711
They told me
that our footprint was fading.

122
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:46,291
That's what they called the heat
trace that was seen by the satellite.

123
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,779
Chief.

124
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:59,829
- Good way to get killed.
- We need to talk. A change of plan.

125
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,712
This had better be good!

126
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,163
I have new orders to continue
searching for Aban...

127
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:12,190
now that we have updated intel
on his whereabouts.

128
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:15,480
Intel? What, that crap
Obi-Wan told us?

129
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,079
We suspected that Aban was in the mountains
by now... We had to check here first.

130
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,548
We're talking two days, three max. All we
need to do is get our hands on a vehicle.

131
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:30,543
Well, excuse me if I wanna
check with the TOC...

132
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:35,689
Little does he know,
we don't have much of a choice.

133
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:44,552
Man, there's no place
to shit around here.

134
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:47,872
Any of you guys
got any more chocolate?

135
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:53,037
- No man, I gave you all I had yesterday.
- I got some stale cigars.

136
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:57,588
- Hearts and minds, man.
- Whatever. Get in the truck.

137
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,675
Sorry, kids.

138
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,613
What's he doing here?

139
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:06,838
- He offered to be our guide.
- We have a full boat.

140
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,691
Someone who knows the area can
get us in and out much faster.

141
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:12,292
I understand that, but this
place is crawling with bad guys.

142
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:15,186
Any time we gain, is gonna be
lost by our having to babysit him.

143
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:18,987
I fought with my father.
I can take care of myself.

144
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:23,330
Good. You can feed him
your rations.

145
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,722
Go.

146
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,979
She is just my mother.
Keep going.

147
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:25,332
Where we're going,
technology means very little.

148
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,822
50 bucks to a local guide can render
a multi-million dollar GPS obsolete,

149
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:32,142
as soon as you lose your connection
or your batteries go dead.

150
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,728
The stakes were too high
to take that chance.

151
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:45,430
Chief, I know that we have our orders, but
we are pretty fuckin' exposed out here.

152
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,680
I don't like it any more than you do,
but I ain't the one in charge right now.

153
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:52,283
As far as we're concerned you are.

154
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:06,933
Everything looks the same
to me out here.

155
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:10,361
At least back home, you had a
Quick-Stop every now and again.

156
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:15,262
- Where're you from, Cole?
- Tampa, Florida, born and raised.

157
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:18,496
- How about you?
- Chicago.

158
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,886
Cole, Stop the truck.

159
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:39,447
- What's he stopped the truck for?
- No idea.

160
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,107
What the hell's he doin'?

161
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,638
Why in the hell are we stopping?

162
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,498
- That's why,
- Son-of-a-bitch.

163
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:04,235
- Fox said this road was clear.
- It probably was...

164
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:07,331
Look, see that hole?

165
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:11,908
Looks like somebody's been doing
some transplanting..

166
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,209
Guess so.

167
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:22,113
Good call, Keynes. You may have just
saved us from having a very bad day.

168
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:29,599
Let me guess, we're gonna be
going through that canyon.

169
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,896
Yes, we are.

170
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:38,158
There are few places on Earth,
that are as unforgiving as this desert.

171
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:41,580
Whole armies,
from Alexander to the Soviets...

172
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,046
have paid the price for wanting
to make it their own...

173
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,797
I can only hope
we aren't as foolish.

174
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,448
Ah shit. Not good.

175
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:37,040
- Gotta be booby-trapped.
- Cole, back us the fuck outa here.

176
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,981
- Hold on, I'll go check it out.
- No, hold on.

177
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,482
RPG!

178
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,421
Ski's down.

179
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:27,114
Let me look at this. Chief,
Ski's bleedin' pretty bad.

180
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,334
Hold that right there, okay?

181
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:37,402
Chief, keep firing
on that ridge, man!

182
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,743
Cole, get your ass over here!.

183
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:46,516
When he's reloading, you're gonna
go and take those fuckers out!

184
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,329
Let's go!

185
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,697
Reload.

186
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,318
- Pete, Keynes, cover them.
- Okay.

187
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,154
Let's go.

188
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,405
I gotta bag you, baby.

189
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,588
You guys okay?

190
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,656
Let's go check the RPG position,
see who these guys are.

191
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,745
Are you sure
this is the spot, Pete?

192
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:19,794
Yes, I sighted the first one
just left of the gully here.

193
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:23,297
- Maybe you just wounded him.
- No way.

194
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:25,939
I saw him pop one
right in the melon.

195
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:28,678
One was a headshot,
the other was in the chest.

196
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,786
I saw 'em go down.

197
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:34,637
- Then where are the bodies?
- That's a good question.

198
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:38,337
These guys aren't known
for carrying off their dead.

199
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:41,884
I got you, okay..

200
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,541
I got you.

201
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,761
Fuck!

202
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:23,544
He took a frag to the heart,
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

203
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,420
You did everything you could.
We need to get him in the truck.

204
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:59,452
The only body from that entire
firefight was one of our own.

205
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,530
It doesn't make sense.

206
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:05,808
As far as I know, ghosts don't
shoot real rounds.

207
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:10,144
Serpent 76, slang 76.
Beast 92, over.

208
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:17,753
I say again Beast 92
requesting extract, break.

209
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:21,067
Reporting KIA, break.

210
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:25,389
How's it look?

211
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,282
Not good. Radiator took some hits.

212
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,301
- Can you fix it?
- Small holes maybe, but not these big ones.

213
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:35,674
This took a hit as well.

214
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:43,929
Okay, Abdul says that there's a road
that will take us round this mountain.

215
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,479
So it should be about half a day's
drive to our next checkpoint.

216
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:52,237
Checkpoint? Maybe you haven't heard,
Keynes, but we need to extract.

217
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:59,896
Okay, look, I'm sorry about Trinoski,
but cancelling this mission is not an option.

218
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:02,881
We have more than enough assets
to reach our objective.

219
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:05,582
- Assets?
- Hey, Wally.

220
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:09,086
I think Ski would have wanted
us to finish.

221
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:12,037
If we don't complete this mission,
then Ski died for nothing.

222
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:20,695
Cole, change it to a resupply.

223
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:26,772
Serpent 76, Serpent 76,
Beast 92, over.

224
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:32,805
Morale is low. Understandable.

225
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:38,224
We just have to stay focused, that's
what these guys are trained to do.

226
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:40,934
Any one of them would
tell you that they would...

227
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:44,335
rather die than be the last one
picked for a mission..

228
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,349
Where the hell
is that bloody chopper?

229
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,250
I don't know. They should've
called in by now.

230
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:57,148
I hope they didn't get taken down
on the other side of that canyon...

231
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:01,099
- by that ratpack we ran into.
- That would be a pile of suck.

232
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:04,779
Hold up. I think I hear it.

233
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,733
I don't hear anything.

234
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,226
I know I didn't just imagine it.

235
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,930
Hey, we got headlights.
Two o'clock.

236
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:34,296
Looks like a single vehicle.
And he's headed this way.

237
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:36,528
It can't be one of ours.
It wouldn't have the headlights on.

238
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,185
- It's probably enemy reinforcements.
- Alright, we need to get outta here.

239
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:44,274
- Hold on, wait. They're splitting up.
- What?

240
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,400
God-damn!

241
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:53,277
What just happened?

242
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:55,870
Must be Taliban ordnance
or something.

243
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:59,849
- Rockets maybe.
- I don't give a rat's ass what it was,

244
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,443
because in an hour or two
it's gonna be light,

245
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,292
and we need to be on the other
side of that mountain.

246
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:05,496
When we're there, we can recon
for an alternate LZ...

247
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:07,797
and try and figure
where the hell the bird is.

248
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:10,671
Come on. Let's mount up..

249
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,590
Those must have been the intelligent lights
Aban mentioned when he contacted me.

250
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:20,372
At least I know we're headed
in the right direction

251
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:35,737
- We should have taken horses.
- It's a little late for that now.

252
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:42,886
Goddammit.
We're overheating again.

253
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:47,166
This mountain is making the engine work
about 10 times harder than it's supposed to.

254
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:51,168
Pull off up here
and we'll let it cool down.

255
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,967
- We're overheating again.
- I'll pop the hood. Let it ventilate.

256
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,967
How are we doing on time?

257
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:13,637
We have to pick it up if we want to
make it off this mountain by dark.

258
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:18,928
- Look, we still have a ways to go.
- My kingdom for some donkeys.

259
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,399
What's wrong with him?

260
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:31,199
You see something?

261
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:35,376
We shouldn't have driven
across the valley.

262
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:43,448
- Our tracks are erased.
- What's up with our trusty guide?

263
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,432
Must be car sick.

264
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:52,057
Hey, Chief. I'm getting
no satellite reception.

265
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,306
The mountains are blocking us.

266
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:56,767
I can try again
once we get through the pass.

267
00:29:57,432 --> 00:30:00,868
Wally, if you want this bitch to go any place,
you're gonna have to put some water in it.

268
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,268
How are we doing on water?

269
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,486
Jug and a half.

270
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:16,454
Twin dust devils.
Unusual, but not an Act of God.

271
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:21,048
Superstition is the real enemy.

272
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,749
It obscures the truth and that's
what we need right now.

273
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,067
Our water supply is low.

274
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:50,831
What was left after the firefight went
into the truck to get us this far.

275
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:54,866
I didn't count on having to wait for
a resupply, but we have no choice.

276
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:03,436
Serpent 76, Serpent 76,
Beast 92, come in.

277
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,436
Serpent 76, Serpent 76,
Beast 92, come in.

278
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:11,832
It must be these rock walls or something.
I'm not getting a damn thing on the radio.

279
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:18,207
Shouldn't be too much longer now.
The weather's good.

280
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:22,648
When's his wife due?

281
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:30,594
I think sometime in January.

282
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:38,474
What's he up to?

283
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:45,882
Picked a strange time
to be stargazing.

284
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:50,296
Maybe he wants to show the boys back home
what a full moon in Afghanistan looks like.

285
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:02,997
Hey...

286
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:05,375
You guys hear that?

287
00:32:11,301 --> 00:32:13,011
Yeah...

288
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,885
- Looks like it's showtime.
- Let's go.

289
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:37,002
See anything, chief?

290
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,937
No, not yet.

291
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:47,432
It sounds pretty close.

292
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:50,955
Get on the horn, Cole.

293
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:57,608
Dust-off 01, Dust-off 01,
Beast 92, radio check.

294
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:04,849
Dust-off 01, be advised.
You're coming in broken...

295
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,550
I think it's behind that ridge.

296
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,992
- I think he's over there.
- These canyon walls.

297
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,271
Dust-off 01, be advised.
You're coming in broken...

298
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:21,372
and unreadable.
Say again your last, over.

299
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,721
Goddamn!

300
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:30,021
I'm getting some kind
of interference.

301
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,288
Sounds like he's right above us.

302
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:46,521
KT, pop a flare.

303
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,006
What the fuck just happened?

304
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:16,618
Dust-off 01, Dust-off 01,
Beast 92.

305
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,581
Hey, he couldn't have crashed,
we'd have seen a fireball or heard something.

306
00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:25,030
Dust-off 01, Dust-off 01,
Beast 92, are you guys okay?

307
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:27,779
Dammit!

308
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,413
Why the hell
are they on our frequency?

309
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:34,540
- I don't know.
- Hey! What's he sayin'? What'd he say?

310
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:38,598
- Abdul, do you understand this?
- No, I do not know.

311
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,993
It doesn't really matter at the moment,
that chopper has compromised our position.

312
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:46,935
- Yeah? He fuckin' disappeared.
- Cole, we don't know that.

313
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:49,900
We gotta keep moving.
We can set up camp up the mountain.

314
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,835
I don't think so. How're we supposed to
carry Ski's body up the mountain in the dark?

315
00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:55,949
We don't. We cache his body and
call the TOC with another report.

316
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,464
- We can check on him in the morning.
- I don't know about that.

317
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,350
What would you like to do then, Degs?

318
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:03,936
We can't exactly sit here
and wait for the bus, can we?

319
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,940
We need to get up that hill and
set up a good, defensive position..

320
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:11,991
And if we have to engage these pricks,
I wanna be shooting down, not up.

321
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:30,924
The team is rattled,
though they don't admit it.

322
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:36,144
No point talking about,
what you can't control.

323
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,248
It's not possible, chief.
It's not fucking possible.

324
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,022
I've never given
a bad grid in my life.

325
00:35:52,023 --> 00:35:54,471
Then why would they say they were
there and we were a no-show?

326
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:56,211
I don't know why
they'd say that, chief.

327
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,460
I checked and double-checked and
tripled-checked those numbers.

328
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:00,947
Well, someone fucked up.

329
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:02,634
Fuck!

330
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:06,634
Jesus Fuckin' Christ!

331
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:11,516
Guys get up here, check this out!

332
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:21,517
- Who was on first watch?
- I was.

333
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,791
- You see anything, hear anything?
- No, nothing.

334
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,547
I was on second.
I didn't see or hear anything either.

335
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:31,565
- This is some messed-up shit, chief.
- Somebody's trying to fuck with us.

336
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:35,153
Degs, Cole, I want you down that site.
See if you can find Ski's body.

337
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:38,354
Watch your asses
and get back here ASAP.

338
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:41,236
KT, I want us out of here in 15 mikes.

339
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:43,332
Abdul, you know where
there's water around here?

340
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,081
Now would be the time.

341
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:48,587
Because if we don't get some in the next
24 hours, we're gonna be in deep shit.

342
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,896
Fuck!

343
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:09,196
Fuckin' savages.

344
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,037
Sydney, Sydney, this is Bucks.

345
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:29,485
Sydney, Sydney, this is Bucks.

346
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:46,858
Chief! KT!

347
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:58,151
- Take a look at that.
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

348
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:02,768
- What'd you think that is?
- I have no idea.

349
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,588
I don't think we wanna
stick around to find out...

350
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:11,789
what's behind door number one.
Let's get outta here.

351
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:16,823
I get the feeling they knew
we would be coming.

352
00:38:16,824 --> 00:38:18,647
Keynes, let's go.

353
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:34,506
The longer I'm out here,
the more I'm convinced that...

354
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:37,207
I won't find the loose nuke
when this is all over.

355
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:42,078
That little voice in my head is
just waiting to say I told you so.

356
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,690
Everybody hydrate.
Don't try saving that shit.

357
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:49,007
How far is this watering hole?

358
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:55,705
Using those two peaks
as a refence...

359
00:38:55,706 --> 00:39:00,054
I would say about... 10 or
12 miles according to the map.

360
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:03,923
- I hope you're sure about this, Abdul.
- I'm sure.

361
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:07,459
It is a small oasis.
Farmers water their animals...

362
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,555
when taking them to the highlands.

363
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,555
Chief, you better have a look at this.

364
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:20,892
My compass is telling me
that that's north,

365
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:24,241
but unless the Sun started rising in
the south and nobody told me about it...

366
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:27,188
I'd say we're being hit by some pretty
heavy magnetic interference here.

367
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:29,833
Must be the iron in these rocks.

368
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:33,118
- How about the sat-phone?
- Still nothing.

369
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,504
Pete, you got anything on the GPS?

370
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:40,707
Got nothing.

371
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:46,386
Well, Abdul,
I guess you're driving.

372
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:50,710
- Pete,
- Yep.

373
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:51,770
- Point.
- Okay.

374
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:55,357
Move out.

375
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,508
These guys don't wanna admit it but Abdul
is the most valuable man on our team right now

376
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,215
We might as well be on another planet.

377
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,632
Any movement?

378
00:40:25,692 --> 00:40:30,063
- No.
- Alright. We're gonna clear it.

379
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:34,179
Chief, we may be best advised
not to engage.

380
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,330
Our mission here is to kill terrorists.
Anything else is fuckin' paperwork.

381
00:41:32,778 --> 00:41:33,958
Hello?

382
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,958
He can't speak.

383
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:38,791
Hello!

384
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:03,958
What'd he say?

385
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:07,965
I think something about being
a warrior, like you, it's hard...

386
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,868
some of the words I can
make out, not others...

387
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:14,180
Does he know Mohammed Aban?

388
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:19,409
No he don't.

389
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,960
Try and thank him for the water.
For filling our canteens.

390
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:33,563
You see what he's wearing
under his robe?

391
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:39,488
Looks like some kind
of uniform... Soviet?

392
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:45,937
It's British... from the
44th Regiment a Foot.

393
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:50,809
- I wonder where he got that?
- More like when.

394
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:53,953
The 44th Regiment no longer exists.

395
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:57,402
- The "Hill of Bone".
- What's the "Hill of Bone"?

396
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,588
In 1842 the British decided...

397
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:03,288
to move four and half thousend
troops through a pass near here,

398
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,846
along with 1000's of women and children and
any merchant that was willing to go along.

399
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:10,218
The 44th week out...

400
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:15,218
Legend has it that 16,000 people
went into that pass.

401
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:17,491
Only one man came back.

402
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:20,791
He claimed to have witnessed
Satan's Miracle.

403
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:24,807
It's just a legend.

404
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:28,771
So you're saying...
that uniform is from that unit?

405
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:33,891
- I don't see how that's possible.
- Is the insignia of that period?

406
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,196
They certainly match.

407
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:41,541
I'm gonna have a look
inside that cave.

408
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:56,012
Aban told me about a guardian.
Could this be him?

409
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:59,611
If so, who is he guarding?
Or what?

410
00:44:01,258 --> 00:44:03,935
He's sitting right
in the middle of a hotspot.

411
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:07,906
Low levels of the signature
radiation everywhere.

412
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:21,506
He's been near it,
that I know for sure.

413
00:44:22,504 --> 00:44:25,373
The boys back at home,
gonna want to see this.

414
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:03,642
Old bastard.

415
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:10,697
Jesus Christ!

416
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:16,807
Contact. Contact!

417
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:19,207
Contact. Contact!

418
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:40,636
Holy shit... Jesus, Cole,
you ripped this guy up.

419
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:44,699
Cole... Cole! What happened?

420
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,565
I saw fighters.

421
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:53,818
5... maybe 6... He was
talking to 'em right here.

422
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:58,111
Fuckin' swords and black pyjamas.
They're fuckin' comin' right at me.

423
00:45:58,112 --> 00:46:04,657
- Cole, tell me exactly what you saw.
- When I put my goggles on, I could see'm.

424
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:08,460
He was talking to a group of them... and
they were right here and they were armed.

425
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:11,809
They were armed...
I swear.

426
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,428
There's nothing we can do now.

427
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:16,380
We need to beat feet. If he's got any friends,
we need to be gone when they get here.

428
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:19,559
Come on, let's shake it up!
Let's go!

429
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:23,383
Cole, let's go.

430
00:46:24,297 --> 00:46:26,527
You believe me right?

431
00:46:26,528 --> 00:46:29,397
- You believe me right?
- Yeah.

432
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:49,463
What are you doing?
You can't let him there.

433
00:46:49,464 --> 00:46:52,386
Keynes, take care of that.

434
00:46:53,886 --> 00:46:55,992
Abdul we have to go.
It's too dangerous.

435
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:58,088
- Come on.
- How can you do this?

436
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:01,088
You Americans just kill him,
for no reason.

437
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:02,902
We didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

438
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,613
We have to bury him.
It is a bad luck for us...

439
00:47:05,648 --> 00:47:06,913
we have to bury him.

440
00:47:06,914 --> 00:47:10,801
Abdul, please listen, we have to go.
There could be enemies around, oaky?

441
00:47:10,802 --> 00:47:13,262
Please, let's leave, come on.

442
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:24,223
An unsettled silence has fallen
over the group since we broke camp,

443
00:47:26,063 --> 00:47:28,613
It's hard to determine
if the guys are more concerned...

444
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:32,214
about what Cole did...
or what he saw.

445
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:52,896
Hey... Pete! Take five.

446
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:02,370
Oh fuck. My stomach
feels like shit right now.

447
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:06,979
Wipe your face, there you go,
wipe your face.

448
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,579
You're just dehydrated.

449
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:12,563
- Here, start drinking this.
- Don't worry about it, Degs.

450
00:48:20,215 --> 00:48:23,240
What the fuck? What're you doin'?
That's not funny, man.

451
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:27,440
I didn't do anything, man, I filled
this thing up with water last night.

452
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,254
Fuck, man.

453
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:39,860
What the hell's going on here?

454
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:43,883
- What the fuck?
- We filled this shit up.

455
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:53,123
- We have been cursed. I tell you.
- Abdul take us to the oasis, now.

456
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:03,538
No one likes to admit that they
may be losing control.

457
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:07,124
But it's even harder when you feel
that everyone around you, is too.

458
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:11,602
Fuck, this thing is worthless.
It's not even tracking.

459
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:14,858
That's fucked up, man?

460
00:49:14,859 --> 00:49:17,007
We should be getting really
a good reading up here, right?

461
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:19,606
Maybe that thing
got shook to dead?

462
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,447
- Something is wrong.
- What? What is it, Abdul?

463
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:49,014
This is wrong.
I don't remember this valley.

464
00:49:49,015 --> 00:49:54,162
Don't fuck with us, Abdul.
You said there was a spring up here.

465
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:57,204
Yes, but the terrain has changed.

466
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:03,502
So what's the deal?

467
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:09,134
- Abdul here is lost.
- Why am I not surprised?

468
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:14,998
This is... that peak...
which puts us on...

469
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,924
- on this ledge.
- Okay... okay, I'll buy that.

470
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:26,282
So, where is that?

471
00:50:29,616 --> 00:50:33,344
- You got a bad map?
- It may not be 100 %.

472
00:50:33,345 --> 00:50:36,812
But I find it hard to believe,
they lost an entire terrain feature.

473
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:41,174
This is... it makes no sense.
I'm sorry.

474
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:42,571
You shouldn't have paid this
guy up front, Keynes?

475
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,882
- No shit, man.
- He's going off memory, okay?

476
00:50:44,883 --> 00:50:48,217
Yeah, I know, but we're paying
this guy to be our guide...

477
00:50:48,218 --> 00:50:49,479
and we end up
on the fuckin' moon.

478
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,570
Chief, we may be dealing with some sunspot
interference or something like that.

479
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,271
It could take a day
or two to clear up.

480
00:50:58,272 --> 00:51:00,920
Sunspots don't explain
sand in the canteens, man.

481
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,761
Alright. We're gonna find
somewhere to hunker down.

482
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:10,518
We got no business humping around
here in the daytime anyway. Let's go.

483
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:16,494
Maybe this is what it takes.

484
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:21,237
Getting completely lost first, before
you can find what you're looking for.

485
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:41,345
- You alright, man?
- No, man.

486
00:51:42,495 --> 00:51:45,979
My stomach feels like it's eating
itself from the inside out.

487
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:51,169
Can you hand me my Cipro?
In the front bottom pocket in my bag.

488
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,919
- These?
- Yeah, thank you, man.

489
00:51:55,473 --> 00:51:57,960
You think we're cursed?

490
00:51:58,273 --> 00:51:59,960
No problem.

491
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,414
How'd you smoke that shit
with no water, man?

492
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:10,115
Easy... it's one of those
new-fangled waterwick cigars.

493
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:19,148
What're you doing, documenting
our demise, Agent Keynes?

494
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:24,270
Why, sergeant?
Do you plan on dying out here?

495
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:31,565
No soldier plans on dying.

496
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:38,882
Ain't this the shit?
Stuck out here in the middle...

497
00:52:38,883 --> 00:52:42,383
of the Devil's Asshole,
working for the CIA.

498
00:52:45,751 --> 00:52:49,140
So, what exactly is our objective,
Agent Keynes, huh?

499
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:51,256
Or should I say,
was our objective?

500
00:52:52,106 --> 00:52:55,407
I explained this to you at the
briefing, sergeant.

501
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:59,057
Alright... Top secret.

502
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:04,446
Must be pretty fuckin' top secret for the
CIA to send one of their own out here, huh?

503
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:08,068
I mean, usually you boys just phone
in these clusterfuck operations...

504
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:11,614
and we come in afterwards and
clean up your mess.

505
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:15,953
I know a cover story
when I see one.

506
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:20,938
So whatever the real mission is here,
it had better damn well be worth it.

507
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:23,355
Because you don't wanna know
what I'm gonna do to you...

508
00:53:23,356 --> 00:53:27,156
if I find out, Ski died just
to make you a better pay grade.

509
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:30,991
He died for his country,
not for me.

510
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:36,332
Kenny... lighten up, mate.
We're all in this shit together.

511
00:53:36,782 --> 00:53:42,282
How d'you like that? You can always
count on an Aussie to watch your back.

512
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:28,964
Degs.

513
00:54:29,914 --> 00:54:31,364
Degs, wake up.

514
00:54:31,714 --> 00:54:35,664
- Degs!
- Let me go! Let me go! No!

515
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:39,944
No! Let go! Get off me!
Get off of me!

516
00:54:41,674 --> 00:54:43,017
He's dreaming!

517
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:45,017
You're dreamin'!

518
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:48,732
- Jesus.
- Yeah, you alright?

519
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:50,732
Yeah?

520
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,086
Sit up.

521
00:54:59,586 --> 00:55:01,047
- I'm okay... okay.
- You alright?

522
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,559
- Yeah, I'm okay... I'm okay.
- Cole, take care of him.

523
00:55:06,925 --> 00:55:13,090
- Think it's dysentery?
- No, I'm shitting all by myself right now.

524
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:16,951
If you've got anything up
your sleeve, now would be the time.

525
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:20,162
I'm as thirsty as you are, chief.

526
00:55:22,037 --> 00:55:24,727
Maybe this place is cursed.

527
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:28,940
Cover!

528
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:33,952
Go, go, go!

529
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:40,762
What the fuck is that?

530
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:49,592
- Too high to be a truck.
- Too quiet to be a helo.

531
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:53,927
Where's he going?

532
00:55:53,928 --> 00:55:57,536
I don't see any bad guys.
KT, take Cole...

533
00:55:57,537 --> 00:56:01,085
flank around these guys,
and see what's going on.

534
00:56:01,086 --> 00:56:02,886
Check.

535
00:56:08,043 --> 00:56:10,224
Pete, watch on six, to make
sure this isn't a diversion.

536
00:56:10,225 --> 00:56:12,259
We don't want anybody
coming up our ass.

537
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,825
Okay, got it.

538
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:19,504
Stand by.
Go.

539
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:29,849
Motherfuckers!

540
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:54,080
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

541
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,338
Everybody stay down.
Stay down!

542
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:01,180
Did you see that shit, chief?

543
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:13,419
That voice in my head
just cashed in.

544
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,063
Now, it's more important
than ever to document everything.

545
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:20,713
The Hill of Bones only had
one man's story.

546
00:57:20,879 --> 00:57:23,515
But we'll have verifiable proof.

547
00:57:23,516 --> 00:57:25,216
Look.

548
00:57:26,136 --> 00:57:27,916
O-ring.

549
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:32,964
Jesus... is that all
that's left?

550
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:40,067
What'd you think it was?

551
00:57:40,077 --> 00:57:42,367
I'm not sure.

552
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:45,841
It's definitely something
we haven't seen before.

553
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:50,174
The Taliban, they don't have
anything like that.

554
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:54,475
Had to be the Soviets.
Some experiment.

555
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:03,436
Chief, it's not a good place to be.
We should break camp.

556
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:06,885
Who knows when this thing's
coming back.

557
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,466
If we don't find water soon,
it ain't gonna matter...

558
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,382
- Hey, Degs
- Hey, Wally.

559
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:49,079
- We gotta move. You gonna be good to walk?
- Yeah, I'm good.

560
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:55,971
- What about him, though?
- Abdul, let's go. We're movin' out.

561
00:58:58,396 --> 00:59:00,459
God dammit!

562
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:07,687
Abdul, did you not hear,me?
I said we're leaving.

563
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:12,823
We are going to die.
My grandfather was right.

564
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:16,640
- We should not have come here.
- Well, it's a little late for that now.

565
00:59:16,641 --> 00:59:20,365
- Get your shit and let's go.
- I'm not going with you.

566
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:24,572
Don't be an idiot, Abdul, you break
with us now, you'll die out here.

567
00:59:24,573 --> 00:59:28,061
- We are already dead.
- I'm so sick and tired of this shit.

568
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:30,374
Nihilism may be a way of life
for you people, but...

569
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,808
I'm not gonna put up with it,
when your with my team.

570
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:38,538
- Hamer!... What's wrong?
- You need to talk to your man, Keynes.

571
00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:40,724
- He said he was...
- Abdul, no!

572
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:52,085
Crazy son-of-a-bitch

573
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:57,141
- It's not like he was doing us much good.
- We needed him!

574
00:59:57,142 --> 00:59:59,105
For what? he's been leading us
on a wild goose chase...

575
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:00,954
- I'm telling you, we needed him.
- Oh, really?

576
01:00:00,955 --> 01:00:02,828
Well it certainly
wasn't to find water.

577
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:04,277
Or Aban for that matter.

578
01:00:04,278 --> 01:00:05,828
It's more than that.

579
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:08,065
Why don't you tell us just what
the fuck 'more' means.

580
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:11,782
- It's on a need-to-know basis, chief.
- You gotta be fucking joking me.

581
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:13,814
Who needs to know more than we do?

582
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:18,669
Hey, motherfucker! I just lost three men
on this goddamned goose chase of yours!

583
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:21,285
I wanna know what the fuck is going on.

584
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:24,980
Tell us what's happening.
What was that thing last night?

585
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:27,559
- We don't know.
- We?

586
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,709
- What, you and those pinheads at Langley?
- Look... chief...

587
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:38,206
all I can tell you is that I'm working
for a special group inside the Company.

588
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:41,617
That's fuckin' beautiful.
If I find out we're out here dying,

589
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:45,749
while you go on a little ghost hunt,
I'll put a round in you myself.

590
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:49,659
- We all have our orders to follow, chief.
- Well, maybe you haven't heard...

591
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,456
dead men don't follow orders.

592
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:16,714
I wanna tell them.
In a way, I need to tell them.

593
01:01:17,214 --> 01:01:20,453
I search my mind through all
the protocol, all the secrets...

594
01:01:20,454 --> 01:01:25,745
and ask myself, what good does it do
to die with this locked in my head?

595
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:30,195
What will the powers that be do
with the information I'm sending them?

596
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,416
Mohammed Aban knows.
He's always known.

597
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:37,672
And is he alive?

598
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:17,899
Keynes, what is it?

599
01:02:20,522 --> 01:02:22,022
Stand by.

600
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:53,561
What is it?
You see something?

601
01:02:56,585 --> 01:02:59,608
- I saw Mohammed Aban.
- You kidding me?

602
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,454
Look.

603
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,632
- What the hell is that thing?
- I don't know.

604
01:03:07,182 --> 01:03:12,367
But I think it's what killed your men, chief.
It's what I've been looking for.

605
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:15,066
It's why I'm here.

606
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:17,701
I don't understand.
Is it some kind of weapon?

607
01:03:17,702 --> 01:03:19,702
We don't know.

608
01:03:20,001 --> 01:03:22,112
Something Soviet?

609
01:03:22,113 --> 01:03:26,471
Hey... we can't fight this thing
if you don't tell us what it is.

610
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:37,984
Okay, sergeant.
Get your guys.

611
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:47,128
How long have you been keeping
an eye out for this thing?

612
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:52,059
Since we were here in the Eighties,
when we were training the Mujahideen.

613
01:03:52,060 --> 01:04:00,031
We... huh, tried to use this area,
to... set up training camps.

614
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:02,983
But we found
that most of it was dead.

615
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:06,525
- What d'you mean, dead?
- Nothing worked.

616
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:12,198
Radios, compasses, anything with
an electromagnetic transmission.

617
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:18,683
So my group began to study it.
But we couldn't figure it out.

618
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:25,003
Then in 2000... we saw...
something, an image...

619
01:04:25,004 --> 01:04:29,678
- a satellite image.
- What did you see?

620
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:37,101
- Have you ever heard of the Vimaanas?
- No, I haven't.

621
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:43,902
I have. Quite common in East Asian
folklore... especially in India.

622
01:04:45,072 --> 01:04:51,085
It's kinda like a... UFO,
but in the shape of a triangle.

623
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:55,053
Alexander the Great even documented
seeing them attacking his troops here.

624
01:04:55,054 --> 01:04:59,984
- He referred to them as Flaming Shields.
- So this is a fuckin' UFO hunt!

625
01:04:59,985 --> 01:05:05,898
No, no, chief. This was identified.
There is evidence.

626
01:05:06,248 --> 01:05:09,423
We believe it to be a weapon
of unimaginable power...

627
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:11,903
and that is why you and
your men were recruited.

628
01:05:11,904 --> 01:05:15,421
What good is it going to do if we find
the thing and get killed in the process?

629
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:19,187
Not exactly a stellar recon, is it?

630
01:05:20,402 --> 01:05:25,797
Okay, look... this is my
connection to the outside world.

631
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:31,106
What?... Your camera?
What are you talking about, Keynes?

632
01:05:31,606 --> 01:05:38,080
I've been relaying video optically during
our mission, using this laser uplink.

633
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,819
Terrific.
Now you tell us.

634
01:05:42,669 --> 01:05:45,600
So you people have been following
us through this entire thing.

635
01:05:45,601 --> 01:05:48,499
You probably know
where we are right now.

636
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,567
Chief, it's the only way we
can obtain verifiable evidence.

637
01:05:52,568 --> 01:05:56,232
We had no way of knowing
if any of us would return.

638
01:05:56,532 --> 01:06:00,132
- This is insane.
- This is a fuckin' suicide mission!

639
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:04,320
There's a big difference
between suicide and sacrifice.

640
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,967
Truth! That's the fuckin'
difference, you piece of shit!

641
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:11,947
This is bigger than
you and me, okay? Just relax.

642
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:15,232
I should put a fuckin' round in you
for what you've done to my men!

643
01:06:15,233 --> 01:06:19,288
- Your men were patriots, chief.
- They were my friends!

644
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,893
Fuck!

645
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,865
That's enough!

646
01:06:57,195 --> 01:07:01,474
It doesn't have to be like this, chief.
I'm not the enemy.

647
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:04,974
You might as well be..

648
01:07:11,551 --> 01:07:14,125
I'm sorry, sergeant.
I'm sorry.

649
01:07:24,351 --> 01:07:27,344
I'm willing to die for my country,
but this...

650
01:07:27,345 --> 01:07:29,941
I don't know if this is
life or death.

651
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:33,501
Maybe it's something in-between.

652
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:46,098
- Keynes? Keynes, get up!
- What is it?

653
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:50,922
- The chief... he's gone.
- How long?

654
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:55,984
I don't know. He left his rifle.
I don't know why he'd do that.

655
01:08:55,985 --> 01:08:58,785
Well, we have to assume
he's not coming back.

656
01:08:59,012 --> 01:09:03,987
- How's Degetau?
- He's not good.

657
01:09:04,237 --> 01:09:06,745
Look, can you at least
use your uplink...

658
01:09:06,746 --> 01:09:09,746
to tell whoever's at the
other end to come and get him?

659
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:13,725
- They won't come.
- Take a look at him!

660
01:09:13,726 --> 01:09:16,645
It's not like he's of any use
on this mission.

661
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,111
We are the mission, sergeant.

662
01:09:19,146 --> 01:09:22,961
Don't you see that? Our objective
is to find these Vimaanas...

663
01:09:22,962 --> 01:09:26,474
their objective, is to see what
happens when we do.

664
01:09:26,475 --> 01:09:30,425
- The end justifies the means.
- Yeah? Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

665
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:33,399
Is that we never
seem to reach the end.

666
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,849
We gotta keep going.

667
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:39,662
- Is that what I think it is?
- It's the Hill of Bones.

668
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:43,222
Unbelievable.

669
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:47,563
- Feels like we're in Hell out here.
- Close enough.

670
01:10:56,642 --> 01:11:00,133
I have no doubt that this is the
footprint we saw from space.

671
01:11:00,134 --> 01:11:03,845
Man's fate piled up in an
ancient heap in front of us.

672
01:11:04,095 --> 01:11:09,465
Is this a message, a warning?
Am I the messenger?

673
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:21,352
- What's wrong?
- Look.

674
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:31,646
My God...
It's them!

675
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:43,145
Oh God! Oh, fuck!

676
01:11:43,146 --> 01:11:45,945
We gotta get outta here.

677
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,252
How are we supposed to fight
something like that?

678
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:11,005
Well, we don't.

679
01:12:33,527 --> 01:12:36,103
I gotta go, okay?

680
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:38,753
Before it gets too dark.

681
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,356
You late for a meeting?

682
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:05,084
Motherfucker.

683
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:12,460
- I can't carry you, Vince.
- you better get goin' then.

684
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:21,514
You're a good soldier.
Your country will be proud.

685
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,695
My country
will never know who I am.

686
01:13:28,942 --> 01:13:30,898
Goodbye.

687
01:13:56,156 --> 01:13:58,952
Something is telling me
to keep walking.

688
01:13:58,953 --> 01:14:01,819
The search for water,
or something else.

689
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:04,447
I really don't know any more.

690
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:09,477
I seem to know the direction,
but not the destination.

691
01:14:10,515 --> 01:14:16,160
Am I being led here, or is it a
pitiful attempt to die with dignity?

692
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:20,207
Is there even
such a thing any more?

693
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:58,276
Go to your God like a soldier.

694
01:21:42,615 --> 01:21:45,021
He will save us all.

695
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:02,254
Okay, Stacey, let's start with
when your husband left.

696
01:22:02,255 --> 01:22:06,142
Can you tell us anything about
this mission he was on?

697
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:07,932
Um...

698
01:22:08,204 --> 01:22:15,132
It was a just little over
a year ago... last November.

699
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:21,740
He didn't tell me much about his
missions, as he was in the CIA.

700
01:22:21,841 --> 01:22:26,978
But... um, I do know
that he was in Afghanistan...

701
01:22:26,979 --> 01:22:30,478
and he was looking
for one person in particular.

702
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:34,866
Your husband was part of a special
group within the CIA, correct?

703
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,820
Yes, that's what he told me.

704
01:22:37,821 --> 01:22:41,891
Do you know of anyone
else who is part of that group?

705
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:47,154
Well, I know he was meeting
a... a team out there...

706
01:22:47,155 --> 01:22:51,405
and... that they were going
to help him look for Mohammed.

707
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:54,918
But I don't know who they are.

708
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,782
Nobody seems to know anything.

709
01:22:59,086 --> 01:23:03,502
I don't get it. How can they
just forget about him like this?

710
01:23:03,503 --> 01:23:07,165
He dedicated his life
to his country.

711
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:08,518
That journal you're holding...

712
01:23:08,519 --> 01:23:12,688
is that the only evidence
you have of him during this time?

713
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:20,595
Yes... It was sent to me
a few weeks after he left.

714
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:26,620
I know it's his. Even though most of
it's in code, I recognose his writing.

715
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:31,970
I just wanna know
if he's still alive.

716
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:42,970
