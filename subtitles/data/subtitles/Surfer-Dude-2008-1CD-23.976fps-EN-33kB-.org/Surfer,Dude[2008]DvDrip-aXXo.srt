00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,758
# Doobie doobie doobie #

2
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,164
# Doo doo doo doobie doo doo #

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,601
# Doobie doo doobie
doobie doobie dee-doo #

4
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,403
# Doobie doo doo
doobie doo doo #

5
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,567
# Ah. #

6
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,007
Guess who's coming back?

7
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,703
That's right... legendary
soul surfer Steve Addington...

8
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,745
- "The Nature Boy."

9
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,651
After six months of surfing
around the world

10
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,212
on the biggest and
most famous breaks...

11
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,007
Teahupoo, Raglan,
J-Bay,

12
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,454
Mundaka, Frigates...

13
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,122
he's surfed it all.

14
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:41,395
Malibu's own Steve Addington
is coming home.

15
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,231
The Ben and Barry poster-boy

16
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,500
is now signed with surfing icon
and television producer

17
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,700
Eddie Zarno.

18
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,800
Malibu, California,

19
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,904
is now hosting the coolest
reality show of the summer.

20
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,245
The best surfers
from around the globe

21
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,807
will be living in this house...

22
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,288
and partying with
these girls.

23
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,483
Welcome back, Add-Man.

24
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,355
We'll see you soon.

25
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,508
Next.

26
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,380
Occupation?

27
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,483
Surfer.

28
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,486
Is that a job: surfer?

29
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,967
Not really.

30
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,126
What were you doing in Fiji?

31
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,130
Surfing epic lefts at Frigates.

32
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,811
Where'd the cash come from?

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,712
That's from Ben and Barry.

34
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,979
Who's Ben and Barry?

35
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,476
I wear Ben's shorts, right?
Surf Barry's boards.

36
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,614
Those dudes send me checks.

37
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,147
How long you staying stateside?

38
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,183
Long enough to catch
some buglass,

39
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,422
check in with my brothers,
keep the stoke. You know?

40
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,022
Stoke?

41
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,828
Stoke.

42
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,061
You know.

43
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,229
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,807
Welcome home.

45
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,672
Cool.

46
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,014
Check this out, man.

47
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,753
- # Do you feel it in the sunshine? #
- This fucking asshole.

48
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,255
- # Do you feel it in the rain? #
- Fuck off, man.

49
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,985
# Do you feel it in the ocean #

50
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,823
# When the waves are clean? #

51
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:52,024
# Do you feel it in the evening #

52
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,966
# When the moon is up? #

53
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,731
# Do you feel it in your bones #

54
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,603
# When she fills you up? #

55
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,169
# Ooh yeah yeah #

56
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,405
# She breathes good luck #

57
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,108
# Mother Earth, Mother Earth... #

58
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,615
- Hello?
- Dude.

59
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,709
Addington!

60
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,955
It's the muffler you wanted.
It's classic.

61
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,087
No, I like it.
It's just...

62
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,290
I'm looking for something with
a little more boom,

63
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,322
you know?

64
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,766
# Do you feel it when you... #

65
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,497
Get the fuck out of my shop.

66
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,338
# Do you feel it on the mountains? #

67
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,309
- I love your hose.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,971
- # Do you feel it on the water? #
- Excuse me.

69
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,109
- What?
- # Ooh yeah yeah... #

70
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,951
Yeah!

71
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,991
Long time! Long time!

72
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,828
# Ooh yeah yeah #

73
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,462
# She's breathes good luck,
Mother Earth, Mother Earth #

74
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,934
# She breathes good luck #

75
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,881
# Ooh yeah yeah #

76
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,414
# She breathes good luck #

77
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,893
# Mother Earth, Mother Earth #

78
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,591
# She breathes good luck... #

79
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,765
Man, Addy's home.

80
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,776
- Jacko, man!
- Jack.

81
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,607
Hey!

82
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,840
- Hey, mate.
- Yeah.

83
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,815
Where's Luanne and
the kids? You bring 'em?

84
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,444
Oh, no, changing diapers,
wiping spit...

85
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,047
Beware of what you love, brother,
because it can drive you mad.

86
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,616
Listen... hey, you talk
to Ben and Barry?

87
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,388
No. They stoked?

88
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,521
Stoked? No.
They're gone.

89
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,724
- They die?
- No no.

90
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,996
They sold out
to Eddie Zarno.

91
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,697
They're poolside at
the Four Seasons in Bali

92
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,069
getting their grendals twisted...

93
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,870
Eddie Zarno... surfer, Eddie Zarno?
He's cool, right?

94
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,377
Well, you know what?
We hope he's cool

95
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,607
because, dude,
as your manager,

96
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,137
I'm telling you,

97
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,515
we got worries.
We got financial worries, bro.

98
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,452
Not today we don't, brother.

99
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,250
I just got back in town.
I got no...

100
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,258
- We got worries, dude.
- Let's talk business tomorrow.

101
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,226
Definitely tomorrow, bro.

102
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,695
No worries, brother.
Come here, give me a hug.

103
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,198
- Here we are.
- Okay, bro.

104
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,927
- Mmmm!
- Okay.

105
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,696
- No worries.
- You're right.

106
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,261
I don't know why I'm stressing.
Everything's gonna be okay.

107
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,772
Everything's gonna be cool, man.

108
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,275
# Ooh yeah yeah #

109
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,437
# She breathes good luck #

110
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,674
# Mother Earth, Mother Earth. #

111
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,345
Hey, Charlie.
How's it going?

112
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,051
Hello, Danielle.

113
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,218
I thought we'd talk
about your decision

114
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,490
to work in Los Angeles.

115
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,895
What's the joke?

116
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,095
California, like "granola"?

117
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,036
What ain't nuts and fruits
is flakes.

118
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,232
You could use
a little granola, Dad.

119
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,299
When's the last time
you wore a pair of shorts out?

120
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,709
Honey, I just think
that you're being rash.

121
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,646
Anything that you can learn there,
you can learn at one of my companies.

122
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,207
I mean, Malibu and
reality television?

123
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,186
That's... that's your decision?

124
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,348
Exactly.

125
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,158
Well, I give you one week
with those weirdos.

126
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,254
I don't want to be unreasonable,
bro, but there's waves.

127
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,130
Okay, but, dude,
you have completely tarnished

128
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,998
the California work ethic.

129
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,368
Bro, I know you're trying to run
a mowing business and all,

130
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,499
- but there's swell.
- I just want you to know, dude,

131
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,375
you just harshed
my morning mellow, okay?

132
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,572
Jack, please, don't be
unreasonable.

133
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,809
I'll mow the fucking lawn later.
What's going on...

134
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,511
Page 35, "Killer Surf."
Well, so,

135
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,783
if you get time, why don't you
come on in and do your job?

136
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,084
It's going off in Leo, Jack...

137
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,259
Dude, when's the last time
you had a wave?

138
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,626
There's no telling, bro.

139
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,622
I mean, these guys are not exactly
committed to lawn care.

140
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,862
Most of these machines
are on the fritz.

141
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,804
I got bills up to my crack.

142
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,205
And Luanne is pissed at me.

143
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,574
And just, this Ben and Barry situation...
I'm gonna lose my mind.

144
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,341
- I'm gonna lose my mind.
- Let's blow through this, bro.

145
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,815
10 minutes, we're into
some decent swell.

146
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,116
Dude, let's take a moment
and assess the situation.

147
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,885
You have no assets,
you have no savings,

148
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,487
you rent your Malibu pad and you're
way too generous with your cash.

149
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,020
Stuff's like manure, bro:
you don't spread it around,

150
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,726
- it starts to...
...stink up the place.

151
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,964
But, dude,
we need fertilizer.

152
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,996
We gotta, like, fertilize
the money tree so it can keep growing.

153
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,805
About that, bro, could you
float me a few bills, man?

154
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,980
Yeah. Yeah, sure, dude,
but look...

155
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,505
Ah, you know,

156
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,246
Zarno... we gotta go see him.

157
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,881
And... and... and if we
don't make a deal,

158
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,824
then we're gonna
be wiped out.

159
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,326
Wiped out?
Come on, Jacko.

160
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,386
Well... ooh! No.

161
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,694
But, like, you know,

162
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,793
you... you have got to
go shake Zarno's hand.

163
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,396
Okay.
Just spendthrifty, okay?

164
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,633
Listen, bro...

165
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,078
Brother, I got no trouble
shaking a surfer's hand.

166
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,670
Ha ha ha!

167
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,749
Mmm.

168
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,110
This is Zarno's pad, dude?

169
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,021
- You cool?
- Yeah.

170
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,524
Anyway, it's his reality house.

171
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,552
Dude, the gray on gray...

172
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,463
I mean, like, gray does...

173
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,899
Something's wrong
with these fish, dude.

174
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,171
Gentlemen.

175
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,902
Eddie Zarno.
My apologies.

176
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,637
Conference call
with the board...

177
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,612
launch details,
marketing emergencies.

178
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,875
- It happens.
- Yeah.

179
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,815
I told them to stick it
for a minute 'cause Steve Addington

180
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,614
and his representation
were in my den.

181
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,486
- And hey, dude, this place rocks.
- Yeah.

182
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,481
Man, I was telling Jack,
I saw footage of you in Sardinia

183
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,017
crushing Porto Ferro, bro.
Man, killer cutback.

184
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,825
Cool, yeah.
Now I cut deals.

185
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,094
That's what I'm talking about.

186
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,398
Jack Mayweather.
God damn!

187
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,631
Only Steve Addington
could have a manager so cool.

188
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,232
- I don't know...
- Mr. Zarno?

189
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,333
Excuse me. Yeah?

190
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,435
- Mr. La Rosa's asking for evidence.
- Good, right?

191
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,776
Oh, God. All right.
Guys, I'm sorry.

192
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,442
I got some more hand-holding to do.
Margaret, my assistant,

193
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,610
will show you around,
show you the house,

194
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,780
show you the game... you.
Guys, we'll talk soon.

195
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,050
All right?

196
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,421
Cool guy.

197
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,982
Gentlemen?

198
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,755
Follow me.

199
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,729
This is our nerve center.

200
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,425
You can see the entire home here
on our monitors...

201
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,835
weight room, kitchen,
our spacious grounds.

202
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,031
Ah, that's your room,
Steven.

203
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:51,567
You have a perfect view of Malibu's Point
Dume from both windows.

204
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,873
The house is early
Klaus Woo.

205
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,848
- Who?
- Woo.

206
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,112
- Oh.
- Post-post-modernist revival.

207
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,915
- Oh.
- Notice the strong lines

208
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,615
and the perfect circles,

209
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:07,888
as if to conjure the line of
the horizon and the molecules.

210
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,727
The house used to belong to
a very distinguished porn star...

211
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,790
This place is so...

212
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,029
- so...
- Okay?

213
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,593
Gentlemen.

214
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,105
This place is so...

215
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,600
Have you ever experienced
a first-person-emersion video game?

216
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,807
I've dropped a few quarters
into Donkey Kong.

217
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,783
This place is so...

218
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,751
pretty.

219
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,253
Follow me.

220
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,551
We're calling it "Free Surfer."

221
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,959
It's in beta,
available next Christmas.

222
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,757
Catchy title.

223
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,094
Put them on your head.

224
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,691
I don't want to
put them on my head.

225
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,134
It's the future.

226
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,105
It's the future, bro.
Take a peek.

227
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,998
All right.

228
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,408
Welcome to the digital revolution.

229
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,677
Right.

230
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,740
Whoa.

231
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,124
April May.

232
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,494
It's going off.

233
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,653
Whoa, bro.

234
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,349
You all right?

235
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,550
Ahh.

236
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,958
I don't mean to be complaining
'cause we're not complainers,

237
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,427
but I was curious...

238
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,863
what exactly do you need
Add here for?

239
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,888
Ahh.

240
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,834
We can simulate surfing,

241
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,532
but we can't simulate great surfing
without great surfers.

242
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,063
Oh. Oh.

243
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,166
Now that makes sense.

244
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,973
Please.

245
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,174
- Whoo.
- Ho ho ho ho ho.

246
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,149
- Nice. Nice.
- Hey,

247
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,515
Zarno went all out, huh?

248
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,782
Look at this...
that's La Rosa.

249
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,188
He's finishing
a sequencing session.

250
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,456
That's how we capture your
personal surfing style.

251
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,088
That's how we'll create
the Addington avatar.

252
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,325
He's a good surfer, man.

253
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,800
Hard charger.

254
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,495
What's happenin', bro?

255
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,035
Thought you'd be better looking,

256
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,238
have longer arms
or something.

257
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,907
I can't hear you, bro.

258
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,347
Gracias, mamá.

259
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,549
It's my world now, mamao.

260
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,954
We need you in hair and makeup.

261
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,049
Wow.

262
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,220
- Dude looks upset.
- Truly.

263
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,197
Okay, people, let's reset the rig...

264
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,631
Looks cold in there, bro.

265
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,100
- Frigid.
- Uh, sorry,

266
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,330
there's no smoking in here.

267
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,409
Brill, shut it.
Baker, please.

268
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,036
Addington, continue.

269
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,982
Ben and Barry
wouldn't digitize me.

270
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,485
That's Steve Addington.

271
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,384
- Brillo, please...
- The surfer.

272
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,547
...I will come over there.

273
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,523
I'll tell you something else, man:

274
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,694
Video games,
reality TV,

275
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,821
Free Surfer...

276
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,424
I mean, what the fuck is that, man?

277
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,195
I'm not some ass-clown
in a green room.

278
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,795
- I'm a surfer, dude.
- Yes.

279
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,136
Hi.

280
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,472
- I'm Stacey.
- Good day.

281
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,671
- This is my friend Danni.
- Hello.

282
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,872
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey.

283
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,938
We're working for the reality show.

284
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,179
- East Coast?
- New York.

285
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,743
Do you mind if we shoot you?

286
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,517
No, roll away.

287
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,087
So you're not going
to do Free Surfer?

288
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,429
I hear La Rosa's getting over
$100,000 in residuals...

289
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,367
- What?
- $100,000?

290
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,496
...and exposure worth twice that.
- Yeah!

291
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,632
It's like getting a map
to buried treasure.

292
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,268
Except it's not buried.
It's dangling there

293
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,006
like a big fat grape.

294
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,606
- I love grapes.
- But who picked that grape, bro?

295
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,813
Seriously, migrants, you know?
Exploited farmers, man.

296
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,981
La Rosa's little niece probably had
to pick that grape, man,

297
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,650
- in Oxnard.
- Dude.

298
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,056
Wow.

299
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,255
- Not feeling it.
- Yeah.

300
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,456
Not into it.

301
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,866
I just want to surf,
keep the stoke day to day.

302
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,892
Quality thinking, man.

303
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,962
You get all that?

304
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,463
Got it.

305
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,941
Later, East Coast.

306
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,536
- See ya.
- Bye.

307
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,571
Nice meeting you.
Blowing it.

308
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,912
Blowin' it.

309
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,179
- Add-Man.
- Farmer Bob.

310
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,093
Get in this house.

311
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,758
- From my garden, brother.
- Homegrown.

312
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,426
Thank you very much.

313
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,935
Speaking of homegrown...

314
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,097
"au naturale."

315
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,232
Under the sun...

316
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,866
Topanga Gold.

317
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,342
Bless the flowers...

318
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,902
- Bless the weed. Amen to that, brother.
...bless the weed.

319
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,811
How long we got you for?

320
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,941
I'm gonna chill
local-style for awhile...

321
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,248
the summer, at least.
Yeah.

322
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,686
The usual for the goats.

323
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,351
Keep 'em on
the farm roaming free.

324
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,950
You're way too generous.

325
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,690
They call it "courtesy"
for a reason, brother.

326
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,130
Wanna paddle out?

327
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,690
It's been a while.

328
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,396
I best be about
my father's business.

329
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,133
Cool.

330
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,903
Me too, brother.
Me too.

331
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,770
- What goes down...
...gotta come up!

332
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,965
April May, look at you.

333
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,796
- Look at you.
- Ahh.

334
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,931
Did you feel that wind kick up?

335
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,135
El Niño may be paying us
an early visit.

336
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,837
I heard you're gonna be one of
the surfers on the reality show.

337
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,607
Nn-nnh.

338
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,673
Nah, I'm gonna stay here,
surf and work the garden.

339
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,810
Just picture it, okay?

340
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,321
You and me,
the stars of it,

341
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,084
- just rulin' it.
- Mmm.

342
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,592
Promise me you'll think about it.

343
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,333
Aha ha ha.

344
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,309
- To the waves.
- Jesus.

345
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,210
She hurts me, bro.

346
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,045
I don't know about her, dudes.

347
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,983
She's the siren, bro.

348
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,953
I want to mark her with
my scent like a lemur.

349
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,324
This helps.

350
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,727
I'm not some ass-clown...

351
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,560
...l'm a surfer, dude.

352
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,658
- That's excellent footage.
- Thanks.

353
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,864
It's really useful stuff.

354
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,896
Kind of a scoop there, isn't it?

355
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,705
Which one of you was behind
the camera here at the end?

356
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,008
- Um, you did.
- Me.

357
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,241
I was actually
interviewing and she was...

358
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,649
- Would you excuse us a minute?
...video games, reality TV...

359
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,356
- So... Danni, is that right?
- Yeah.

360
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,091
You're obviously educated, smart...

361
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,190
cultured perhaps.

362
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,292
I did my thesis on
vertical integration:

363
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,599
owning production through
distribution and retail.

364
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,696
Yeah, well, lesson one:

365
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,004
get the content.
Well, you know that already,

366
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,738
don't you?

367
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,236
So did Addy say anything else?
Anything off-camera?

368
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,341
No, except what he said
which was pretty much "No."

369
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,217
Right, well, he's playing hard to get.
He'll come around.

370
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,518
They all come around eventually.

371
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,419
Looked like you two
had a little moment.

372
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,487
I'm sorry?

373
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,396
I saw the tape,

374
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,698
the way he looked at you.
Are you gonna deny it?

375
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,533
Yeah, I deny it.

376
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,571
You can go now.

377
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,742
Wave that money!
You look so beautiful. Mira.

378
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,312
Ay, coño, mamá,
you ever taste La Rosa, baby?

379
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,756
It's like Sabritos, but better.
That's right!

380
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,258
Pa', Eddie, díla.

381
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,460
- Hey, ladies.
- Chocolate y Snowflake.

382
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,859
Surfers living and partying...

383
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,835
- Hey! Hey hey!
...under one roof,

384
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,065
- fighting for waves on one beach.
- Addington, Addington!

385
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,336
- Addington!
- 24 hours a day,

386
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,206
it's one sizzling summer.

387
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,268
It's gonna be hot.

388
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,544
Australia's big-wave rider,
Johnny Doran...

389
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,608
I like huge waves,

390
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,281
Catholic sheilas
and beets on my burger.

391
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,550
I love that guy.

392
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,252
...Lupe La Rosa:
shredder sensation

393
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,284
from Puerto Rico...

394
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,125
Hey, kids, how you doin'?

395
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,893
You want my autograph?
Who wants some Red Bull, huh?

396
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:41,921
Yeah!

397
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,367
Just business.
That's "Lupe."

398
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,702
...and Malibu's own legendary
soul surfer,

399
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,434
Steve Addington.

400
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,907
Who?

401
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,069
He's scared I outsurf him.

402
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,908
Hey, Steve!

403
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,380
- It's...
...going...

404
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,405
...off.

405
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,444
Premiering this summer,
from the mind of surf icon,

406
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,681
Eddie Zarno.

407
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,350
What! Watching that.

408
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,552
Thought you passed on
the wave porn, bro.

409
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,151
I did.

410
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,789
Dude, we saw it
and we loved it

411
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,131
and, you know, I'm still not sure
why you're down on this show.

412
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,228
I said no, dude.

413
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,296
I know, bro, but, like...

414
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,865
he's pissed, you know?

415
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,843
Zarno apparently got ahold
of some video

416
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,072
of you passing on his project

417
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,445
in a way that
didn't sit too well with him.

418
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,111
Yeah, I said "No dice" in no
uncertain terms, and I meant it.

419
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:38,919
Why do you want to discriminate
against all those poor landlocked kids

420
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,859
like in Kansas who are gonna
watch you on this thing

421
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,590
and realize that there is something
cooler in the world

422
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,428
than a house made of corn?

423
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,627
What?

424
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,001
Dude, how are you
sitting for cash?

425
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,004
A handful.

426
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,408
Well, then why don't you just
stroll on down the hill

427
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,969
and smile and be charming
and be cool

428
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,846
and be Addington, you know?

429
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,046
Maybe something cool will happen.

430
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,419
Man, like I said, I got no problem
shaking a surfer's hand,

431
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,357
brother, but I'm not living there.
Cool?

432
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,557
Okay, dude, but remember:
mind open, heart enlarged,

433
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,895
soul receptive.

434
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,163
- I love you.
- You too, brother.

435
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,274
Please. Please.
You're killing me, man.

436
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,071
- Let's go.
- Boom!

437
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,270
Ho ho ho!

438
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,281
# You see me? #

439
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,559
- Whoa!
- I love America.

440
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,565
I had no idea.

441
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,396
Yes!

442
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,134
Excuse me?

443
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,059
You put the green pepper,
red pepper, garlic, onion,

444
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,824
y mucho amor... you need
the loving in your life, papi, right?

445
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,027
Anybody know where Eddie is?

446
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,126
Oye, mamao, can't you
see I'm cooking?

447
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,603
What's up, La Rosa, bro?

448
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,369
Man, I saw you talking trash
on TV the other day.

449
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,603
What gives?

450
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,941
"What gives"?
I'll tell you what gives.

451
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,779
You and your free-surfing-country-soul
vibe, that's what gives.

452
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,183
It's about 30 years late, papi.
That shit can't compete.

453
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,819
I'm not competing, bro.

454
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,325
Well, I'm not buying it, bro.

455
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,826
I ain't selling it.

456
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:59,854
Oh, whoa whoa.
I need all cameras in the kitchen.

457
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,729
You got nothing I need.

458
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,359
Hey.

459
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,302
I thought about
what you said

460
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,829
and we're just not
gonna work out.

461
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,398
- Ooh.
- What?

462
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,967
I'm with Lupe now.
I'm sorry.

463
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,479
I'm just looking for Eddie, man.

464
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,142
You can go home
and cry now, Steven.

465
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,603
- Hey, dude.
- Aw, man.

466
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,038
- It's good to see you again, Steven.
- Likewise.

467
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,335
It really is.

468
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,071
We're excited to have you...
the coolest surfer in the world.

469
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,476
Yeah.

470
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,979
- Hard work, fella!
- That's right, fella!

471
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,542
Come on.

472
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,953
Grass is perfect
and we cut it, man.

473
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,047
Why?

474
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,362
You used to walk everywhere
yourself, huh?

475
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,531
- You stopped, man. Why'd you stop?
- Oh, no.

476
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,968
Was it that reef bounce
at Mavs, man?

477
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,568
Oh, you heard about that.

478
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,308
Saw that.
It was heavy, man.

479
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,045
Steven, Ben and Barry asked me
to personally take care of you.

480
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,350
Not that they had to,
'cause numbers don't lie.

481
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,719
- Numbers?
- Numbers, Steven.

482
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,919
It's all about the, numbers.
And yours, my friend, add up.

483
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,291
- Margaret?
- Yep?

484
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,388
Just need your signature on these
saying you'll participate fully

485
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,331
in my projects.

486
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,498
Dude, we were just chilling,
surfer to surfer.

487
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,565
There are times in life
when years of preparation

488
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,077
meet the moment
of opportunity.

489
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,841
This is that moment for you.

490
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,515
Checks.

491
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,816
This is actually stoked, bro.

492
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,757
What up, bro?
Those are for me, aren't they?

493
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,782
They're for you, yes,
as soon as you sign,

494
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,692
saying you'll participate
in Free Surfer

495
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,027
and live in my house.

496
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,233
I told you, man,
I'm not signing.

497
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,962
I'm not participating, you know?

498
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,441
It's not personal, Eddie.

499
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,138
I'm trying to tell you, I'm...

500
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,306
I surf.
All right, I'm a surfer...

501
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,781
out there.

502
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,112
Steven, I want you
to remember something here,

503
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,883
and don't forget this, huh?

504
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,288
You're in advertising.

505
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,759
Ben and Barry
never paid you to surf.

506
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,565
Jack's got my number.

507
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,832
You tell him to call
when you start "feeling it."

508
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,648
Heeeeey.

509
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,852
Wait a minute.

510
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,542
What about that?

511
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,407
What about that?

512
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,539
I was acting.

513
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,880
They told me to play
like I wanted him.

514
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,145
But I want you there.

515
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,951
You do?

516
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,389
What do you want?

517
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,261
That's good there.

518
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,476
Truly epic night, brothers.

519
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,378
I just want to go on record...

520
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,543
Report said "surf."
That's a lake.

521
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,524
Oh, bro.

522
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,160
Something's off, dudes.

523
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,211
No bueno, mate. No bueno.

524
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,093
Música, música. Come on,
party, people.

525
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,428
Follow me.

526
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,064
Lupe's so cool. Aww!

527
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,143
Back to the sofrito, mi gente,
because I did not forget about you.

528
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,338
We got 20 cameras outside.
We can cut to anything we want.

529
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,347
We edit as we go.
There's hardly any post.

530
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,315
It's sexy, it's happening,
it's fast. We got...

531
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,114
I mean, we can...
if anything gets old,

532
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,280
like... like this. Hello?

533
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,381
Come on, I don't want shots
of girls talking.

534
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,789
Is this better?

535
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,656
Good.

536
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,561
That shit goes across
demographics, huh?

537
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,589
And next week, Addington drops in.
Boom... it's fantastic.

538
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,877
What the fuck?

539
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,855
Hey, man, look... Socrates
recommended the dialectic

540
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,085
when faced with
such an impasse, man.

541
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,685
You know?
You ask me a question,

542
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,162
I respond with
something to build on

543
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:43,327
and a conversation is formed,
out of which answers are revealed.

544
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,632
Mm-hmm.
Where are the waves?

545
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,695
I don't know, man.

546
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,832
Something's bogus, dudes.

547
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,473
B-O-G-U-S.

548
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,412
I gotta compensate.

549
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,846
"No entiendo," dude.

550
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,249
No no no, he speaks
of reciprocity, bros...

551
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,153
balance in the energy
that binds us, man.

552
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:07,214
There are no separate deeds, man.

553
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,488
You know, read Heisenberg, man.

554
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,987
You know, we affect... by looking
at that tree, you affect that tree, man.

555
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,465
You make it real, man.

556
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,365
Yeah yeah, thanks.
You've been really helpful.

557
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,563
Sacrifices, bro.

558
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,334
Measure for measure.

559
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,273
I gotta take action.

560
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,769
Whoa whoa whoa,
what kind of action?

561
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,611
No more women
till we get waves.

562
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,116
Yeah, good one.

563
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,053
No more weed, either,
not till we get waves.

564
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,887
Hey, you know, let's not
take it too far, man.

565
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,757
First off, fuck that.
And second off, yeah, fuck that.

566
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,631
There's philosophy and then there,
you know, there's life, man...

567
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,294
Why don't you just blow
my fucking balls off?

568
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,134
- and physics, man.
Butterfly effect, man.

569
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,164
Mate, you're the ass-cutting
chosen one.

570
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,267
Hey, stone crab...

571
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,768
you love stone crab, huh?

572
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,714
You could stop eating
stone crab.

573
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,239
- Right.
- Give it up.

574
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,514
No, bros.

575
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,453
I'm fasting.

576
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,715
- I got nothing.
- I got nothing.

577
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,590
Ah, we gotta vacate.

578
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,528
Indo, Gold Coast...
wherever it's going off...

579
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,293
I'm taking us.

580
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,027
- That means we're gonna surf?
- That means we're gonna surf.

581
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,636
- Did Jack Mayweather call?
- No, sir.

582
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,806
Okay,

583
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,279
tell Perez to prep
the Addington tape.

584
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,372
Yes, sir.

585
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,246
And tell him to cancel
his plans for the evening.

586
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,443
Yes, sir.

587
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,385
And put a hold on
his expense accounts.

588
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,684
Whose?

589
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,717
- Addington's.
- Oh, yes, of course. Sorry.

590
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,561
Um, which ones?

591
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,327
All of them.

592
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,636
Went to Surf Liquor.

593
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,765
Fucknut must have frozen
your tab there too.

594
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,833
Really upset Baker.

595
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,812
That tab was the one
pure thing in my life.

596
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,940
Herb will get you through
times with no money

597
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,475
better than money will get you
through times with no herb.

598
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,183
I tried. I looked. I called. I met.

599
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,556
No one can touch you with Zarno
owning your contracts.

600
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:26,256
I need waves, Jack.

601
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,060
Waves.

602
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,301
Hey, what about
that sticker thing?

603
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,000
You know?
The logo idea.

604
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,703
Oh, that's kinda...

605
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,212
personal, isn't it?

606
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,238
Exactly. Great.
Man, he loves you.

607
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,741
It's just... it's probably
just a communication problem.

608
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,950
Tell him that you will
push the product. That's money to him.

609
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:58,286
I mean, it's all we got.
I don't know what else to do.

610
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,197
Hey!

611
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,264
- Mmm.
- Hey.

612
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,066
- "Under the sun."
- Yeah.

613
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,836
Everything is under it, right?

614
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,072
The surf, chicks,
good loving, good times...

615
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,741
anything you're into,
happening "au naturale"

616
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,682
- under...
...the sun.

617
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,082
- The sun!
- The sun!

618
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,418
Yeah.
And it's something that Addington

619
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,789
has been so mad passionate about
for, like, ever.

620
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,987
Stickers.

621
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,791
You can put it on anything.

622
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,663
- You know, your television...
- Surfboard.

623
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,362
- Your wall.
- Your laptop.

624
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,767
Your dog.

625
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,303
If you shave it.

626
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,467
Okay. Okay, all right.

627
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,670
Look... wow.

628
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,306
Well, I've listened,
I've considered,

629
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:54,148
and the answer's no.

630
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,643
Not feelin' it.

631
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,248
Now are you ready
to come to work or what?

632
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,418
- Dude...
- Excuse me.

633
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,052
...be cool.

634
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,290
What's it gonna be?

635
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,356
Fun under my sun
or Fuck City?

636
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,301
Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa, dude.

637
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,964
Wait a minute, man.
I'm seriously about to pound you.

638
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,839
Man, do you understand that?

639
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,408
Are you gonna turn
my travel card back on

640
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,004
- or what?
- Okay. Whoa whoa.

641
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,482
Mama! Here we go!
Here we go.

642
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,815
This is the anger
I've been looking for.

643
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,413
This is the big-wave passion
I need for the show.

644
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,116
Huh? Oh, it's beautiful.

645
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,920
It's beautiful, anger.
Am I right?

646
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,018
Yeah, fantastic anger.
Really good stuff.

647
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,858
- What the fuck?
- You're gonna love this.

648
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,955
- Roll the tape.
- I'll tell you something else:

649
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,831
Surfing's lame, dude.

650
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,167
- Surfers... they're ass-clowns.
- Enjoy.

651
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,196
And I'm not feeling it.

652
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,373
Not into it.

653
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,004
Into video games,
reality TV.

654
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,948
Lying cocksucker fascist
bastard asshole

655
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,747
- son of a crooked fuck.
- They're ass-clowns.

656
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,253
I'm gonna kill him!

657
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,187
And I'm not feeling it.

658
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,852
Not into it.
Into video games...

659
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,088
Oh my God.

660
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:14,564
Oh, baby,
the magic of montage.

661
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,066
How was that for a moment, huh?

662
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,897
You cannot do this,

663
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,233
- you unethical, unprincipled...
- Careful.

664
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,239
...scumbag asshole.

665
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,537
- Fired.
- No shit.

666
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,476
Those with the gold
make the rules, sweetpea.

667
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,945
- Remember that.
...surfing's lame...

668
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,915
Cut to three here.
I want to see it.

669
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,109
Going to three.

670
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,119
- Hello, Steven.
...not feeling it.

671
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,148
Jack?

672
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,125
Hey, we got some Free Surfer hoodies
for you at the end of the hall there,

673
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,992
if you're getting cold.

674
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,429
...video games and reality TV.

675
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,092
Look, it's King Shit.

676
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,998
...surfing's lame.

677
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,402
Whuh-oh!
It's macho man.

678
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,233
You got cajones, papi.

679
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,505
- Here we go.
- Addington,

680
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,033
this has got to stop.

681
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,945
- You're sort of stalking me.
- What?

682
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,609
You messing around
with my bitch, mamao?

683
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,585
Nothing happened.

684
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,280
Believe me, he tried.

685
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,982
Hi, East Coast,
you seen Jack?

686
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,653
Whoa whoa whoa!

687
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,753
Yeah, baby!

688
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,356
Coño!
That's the one-hitter quitter, papi.

689
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,889
How you like that?

690
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,924
Good night, Steven.

691
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,802
Addington? Steve?

692
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,565
I can't believe this is happening.
This is so great.

693
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,374
Please, I feel awful.

694
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,646
- Jack?
- He's with the police.

695
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,244
He threw a brick
at Zarno's car.

696
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,050
His car?
He threw it at Zarno.

697
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,681
A brick?

698
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,659
And a bottle.
They took him to jail.

699
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,061
- Addington?
- Danni?

700
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,328
Steve Addington just said
your name with his dying breath.

701
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,863
This is so romantic.
It's like a Jane Austen novel.

702
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,792
Hey.

703
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,647
Welcome to Breakline.

704
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,852
To check for surf, press one.

705
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,058
Those breaks are flat flat flat

706
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,497
and flat.

707
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,877
- Hey.
- Oh.

708
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,675
Ah, hi.

709
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,739
Um, good morning.

710
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,115
Excuse me, who are you?

711
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,881
I'm Stacey.

712
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,616
- Right.
- You're in my apartment...

713
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,123
me and Danni's.

714
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,056
Oh.

715
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,529
Hey, Stacey, did...

716
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:34,963
did we...

717
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,264
Oh, um, yeah... no.

718
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,568
But you're up now.

719
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,743
Juice?

720
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,046
No.

721
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,445
Thank you, though.

722
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,442
- Muffin?
- I'm fasting.

723
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,145
No.

724
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,654
Hey, Luanne.

725
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,326
Why are those dudes driving off
with Jack's mowers?

726
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,667
We have many lawns
but no one to push them.

727
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,333
I don't know what else to do.
Business is bad.

728
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,671
We need the money.

729
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,677
I have to go, Addington.

730
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,736
I have to visit Jack
in jail now.

731
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,781
Oh, it's all right, baby.

732
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,551
Oh, Jack.

733
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,252
That's fucking Steve Addington
right there, man.

734
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,556
That long-haired hippie
was talking shit on YouTube.

735
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,495
Throw your fucking
burrito at him.

736
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,794
Eat that, ass-clown.

737
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,071
Enjoy the breakfast!

738
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,754
Hello?

739
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,925
Hello?

740
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,934
It's Danni.

741
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,994
Hello?

742
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,036
Steve?

743
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,907
You okay?

744
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,607
Quick,

745
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:34,015
don't just do something;
stand there.

746
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,019
What?

747
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,317
I'm waiting.

748
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,653
but I'm trying not
to even do that.

749
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,285
What is that, like,
Zen or something?

750
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,992
It's whatever waiting
without waiting is.

751
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,725
What are you waiting for?

752
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,397
Waves.

753
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,305
Well, I'm sorry, Steve...

754
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,571
- but, you know, I was just
listening to the radio

755
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,874
and they said there isn't gonna be
a rideable wave

756
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,437
on the California coast
for days, at least.

757
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,972
South, maybe, in Mexico.

758
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,548
Mexico.

759
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,258
- You got wheels?
- Um, do... do...

760
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:22,755
Uh, I got Stacey's...
Stacey's truck.

761
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,791
Yeah yeah yeah.
I know a cat.

762
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,928
If it's breaking in Baja,

763
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,734
it's breaking at Greenbough's.

764
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,637
Go to Mexico!

765
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,733
Mexico!

766
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,275
Ahem.

767
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,578
Can I just say something?

768
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,919
I feel I need to apologize
for what happened with Zarno

769
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,516
and my footage.
I did not...

770
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:49,992
No, I know, I know.
It's cool.

771
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,688
You don't want an explanation?

772
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,526
I didn't say what
they had me saying,

773
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,293
so I don't need that
explained to me.

774
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,197
Check that glovebox.

775
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,096
Go on.

776
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,971
Yeah.

777
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,966
Mr. Zarno,
there are three guys at the gate

778
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,400
looking for Addington.
I think they're friends of his.

779
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,199
- Shall I let them in?
- Yes.

780
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,297
Are you kidding me?
Yes, let them in, definitely.

781
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,967
And ask them
where the fuck is Addington?

782
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,101
Of course, ladies, you can lick Lupe.

783
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,307
Anytime... Oh, mira!
The three mamaos.

784
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,314
Yeah, let them in.
It's okay.

785
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,149
Ladies, continue licking.
Don't stop.

786
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,845
Ahhhh!

787
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,923
- Ahhh!
- Oh!

788
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,290
Hi.

789
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,420
You scared me.

790
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,398
Best to breathe, then... deeply.

791
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,765
There's nothing
we can do for him, Chip.

792
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:45,070
The transplant didn't take.
We're lifeguards, not lawyers.

793
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,074
Hello?

794
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,310
- Hi.
- Where's my truck?

795
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,545
I am so sorry.

796
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,884
I took it to Mexico
with Steve Addington.

797
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,721
- Stacey?
- You disgusting slut!

798
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,127
Okay, um, I can't really
talk right now,

799
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:09,155
but I will be back
as soon as I can.

800
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,496
I promise.
Is that okay?

801
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,094
Not without details, it isn't.
And I mean right now.

802
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,934
- I gotta go.
- No no no no no no...

803
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,667
No!

804
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,716
Americano?

805
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,482
What you do in tree?

806
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,450
Looking for waves, buddy.

807
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,653
Waves are in ocean,

808
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,187
not tree.

809
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:45,633
No, waves are not
in ocean, buddy...

810
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:48,137
so I'm in tree.

811
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,847
Hey, americano,

812
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,645
We make big crazy fire.

813
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:01,912
Look at him...

814
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,513
it would break my heart
if he didn't look so pathetic.

815
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,016
When he was yea high,

816
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,551
he'd hitch rides down
from Topanga,

817
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,258
watching us surf
till the last wave.

818
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,699
His mom left him up there
with some far-out folks

819
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,827
who let him grow up outside,

820
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,202
follow what he loved.

821
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,697
- And he loved to surf.
- Is crazy.

822
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,342
Like it answered all his questions.

823
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,937
Americano?

824
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,944
Until now.

825
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,480
So there's never been
a drought like this before?

826
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,388
Nah... not for him.

827
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:41,982
No! No no no no...

828
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,959
So how come you're not
going crazy then?

829
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,791
I mean, you're a surfer too.

830
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,592
I fish.

831
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,397
Add's got nothing but waves.

832
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,435
Whoa!

833
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,065
¿Qué pasó? Are you okay?

834
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,576
I think I put
too much gas on it.

835
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,982
Mi corazon's...

836
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,113
it's muy heavy.

837
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,355
I know, amigo.

838
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,088
I know.

839
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,552
Americano, ¡no hay nada allí!

840
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,581
There is nothing there!

841
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,328
- Yes, a huge show.
- Right.

842
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,057
- A hit show; it'll go through the roof.
- Yes, I know...

843
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,962
- Huge ad buy...
- Eddie, I know, I know!

844
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,297
Listen, where is this guy,
Steve Addington?

845
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,326
Addington?

846
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,930
Yeah, Addington!
Listen, Simons says...

847
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,440
- Yeah.
...you promised him Addington.

848
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,465
He's seeing La Rosa on the tape.
He's not seeing Addington.

849
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,741
Listen, I will have Steve Addington
under control very soon.

850
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,270
Under control!
What the fuck does that mean?

851
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,260
Dressed from head to foot

852
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,464
in black.

853
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,372
# Break it up, wind it up,
one, two, three #

854
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,844
# Now you're ready
to roll with me... #

855
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,274
Hurry up, Brillo.

856
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,147
Guapa, mi gente, huh?

857
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,085
Fuck if you're cutting, La Rosa.

858
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,146
Yeah, "da da da da da da da!"
Don't think so, "papi."

859
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,556
Pero, amigos,
we're friends, right?

860
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:57,617
¿Familia?

861
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,531
How is he?

862
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,462
Not very good.

863
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,996
He hasn't eaten anything
and he's pacing.

864
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,941
Pacing? That's bad.

865
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,809
- This was good.
- What's that?

866
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,746
Well...

867
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:21,615
this is a big, fucking monster bud.

868
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:24,484
That's what it is.

869
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,414
Hey, Add?

870
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,651
Yeah?

871
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,654
I scored this for you, son.

872
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,163
Sweet.

873
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,223
Let's thread up some
morning earth and burn.

874
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,266
All right, I'm gonna
go thread it up,

875
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,795
but I gotta pass
on the weed, though.

876
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,673
I'm fasting.

877
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,802
Yeah.

878
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,355
What's so special about surfing?

879
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,859
What's so special about the wind?

880
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,667
Surfing is to...

881
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,401
be with that mystery,

882
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,173
to ride that mystery
for as long as you can.

883
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,614
And when it's over, that's cool,
'cause you know you were there...

884
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,517
in line and on time.

885
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:43,731
# Why she does #

886
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,826
# What she does... #

887
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,769
- Feel that?
- What?

888
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,273
See that?

889
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,606
No.

890
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,508
They're coming.

891
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,376
They're coming.

892
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,348
Waves are coming.
We're surfing.

893
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,782
We are surfing tomorrow.

894
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:06,551
Yeah!

895
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:18,100
# Right now
a ripple would be fine #

896
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:27,735
# She make me fall
so in love #

897
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:37,912
# She got me riding
so high #

898
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:47,220
# Test my patience
just because #

899
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,699
# She knows that she's
the only one #

900
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:01,072
# That's on my side, yeah #

901
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:07,172
# Why she does #

902
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,549
# What she does. #

903
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,935
Good morning.

904
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,270
'Morning.

905
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,918
Sorry.

906
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,388
Think we could
head back soon?

907
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,555
I feel bad about Stacey's truck.

908
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,274
Slow, wide turns, brother.

909
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,521
Espero que encuentras lo que buscas.
Later, bro!

910
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,930
We've gone from a low-pressure system

911
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,457
to a no-pressure system
in the Northern Hemisphere.

912
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,801
There is nothing new to report but
a possible record-breaking amount

913
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,239
of days without waves.
Once again, folks,

914
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,243
pray for surf.

915
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,160
Hey, you know how to get
a dude to go surfing?

916
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,684
Not a clue.

917
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,993
You just say, "Dude, it's going off."

918
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,863
It's going off.

919
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,801
You can't forget
the "dude" part.

920
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:11,205
Lets someone know what kind of dude
is asking them to go surfing.

921
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,172
Dude. Okay.

922
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,507
Got it.

923
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,807
Later, East Coast.

924
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,806
Was he good?

925
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,115
I'm serious.

926
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,153
Then what are you talking about?

927
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,658
Why are you here?

928
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,593
It's Steve Addington.

929
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:09,622
You've got to get on that again
at least once.

930
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,395
Shut up.

931
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,925
No, seriously,

932
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,963
you gotta keep on hitting that
until the hitting is done.

933
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,669
Whoa, a dustbowl.

934
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,108
Addington?

935
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,206
- Yoo-hoo!
- Yo, Add?

936
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,616
Me, I sweat like a bear in Panama.

937
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,821
What kind of world, right,

938
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:36,849
that kicks a...
kicks a man out of his house?

939
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,622
Are you cool?

940
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,289
I'm really moved...

941
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,198
you dudes came over.

942
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,499
Love and waves...

943
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,028
that's what we need
in these dark days, man,

944
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,563
is love...

945
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,905
and waves.

946
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,108
And some hairy buds, bro.

947
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,346
And some hairy bud, man.

948
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,520
Uh, cops behind us.

949
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:11,391
- Be cool, man.
- Be cool.

950
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,123
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

951
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:14,391
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

952
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,540
Be cool.

953
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:31,274
Fuck!
Uh... uh, I'm pulling over.

954
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,872
- Somebody bail with the weed.
- Hey!

955
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,883
Too fast... too fast, dude.
Too fast, too fast.

956
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:43,017
- They'll deport me.
- Dude.

957
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,822
On three, we scatter.

958
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,352
One, two, three!

959
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,439
Ahh.

960
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,919
Hey, litterbug, found your marijuana.

961
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,648
Is it yours?

962
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:15,013
Technically, no.

963
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,850
Freeze, hippie!

964
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,419
- Don't you lie to us.
- All right, all right, man.

965
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,988
You're right.
It is mine.

966
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,125
I was holding it.

967
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,365
I tossed it.
Yeah, it's mine.

968
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,463
Aren't you Steve Addington?

969
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,441
- What?
- That famous surfer?

970
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:33,533
Yeah.

971
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,806
You suck, bitch!

972
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,880
That's right, mamao!
It's Lupe!

973
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,714
I pimped you, bitch!

974
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,686
Someone tell me what the fuck
is going on.

975
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,416
Come on, bro, I need you to
pick it up a little bit here.

976
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,083
All right? We're gonna
make some money with this shit.

977
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,092
Call me a "beaner" or something.
Liven up, dude. Come on.

978
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,531
You dudes are in on this?

979
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,932
- Waves, man.
- Nothing but waves.

980
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:01,334
- In a game, man.
- Free Surfer, dude.

981
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,236
All the time, all day.

982
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,605
Man, it's some kind
of digital alchemy.

983
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:07,974
Yeah yeah yeah! Barrels of love, baby.

984
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,344
- Where you wanna go, man?
- Aw, dudes.

985
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,111
It is Lupe time!

986
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,118
Where you going, papi?

987
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,916
It's okay...
grass grows, birds fly

988
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,946
and Addington runs from my beauty.

989
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,584
It's okay. It's an easy thing to
run from 'cause I'm so gorgeous!

990
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:48,641
A little rain, storm clouds, low front...
you know, perfect.

991
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,949
So it's a great
business opportunity,

992
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,421
but the guy's a real
wheeler-dealer, right?

993
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:56,516
Yes, he's a scumbag,
but his business model is strong.

994
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,424
He's perfectly positioned, really.

995
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,789
Oh, Addington, Addington...

996
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:08,232
- Are you shitting me?
- Yes, he says he wants to talk.

997
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,535
- He's at the main gate now.
- Ha!

998
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,598
All right, all right.
Get the contracts ready.

999
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,236
- Get the cameras ready too.
- Okay.

1000
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,905
Yes!

1001
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,675
Addington... I love this guy.

1002
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:25,516
Okay, we're gonna need you to
sign here, here and here.

1003
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,356
And I do this, you...

1004
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,421
turn it all back on, right?

1005
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,866
I mean, the travel card,
the checks?

1006
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,131
You live in my house
for the last two weeks,

1007
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,138
you let me digitize you
for Free Surfer, dude,

1008
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,039
I will put you back on
your throne of cool.

1009
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,449
Pick a break,
anywhere in the world,

1010
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,314
you're on a plane
the day we wrap.

1011
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,444
What about my brothers?
They come too?

1012
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,045
On the house.

1013
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,147
How about Jack?

1014
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,886
I'm not signing shit
until I know he's out.

1015
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,656
Good. He just left processing...
all the charges have been dropped.

1016
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,494
- Jacko?
- Hey, Add.

1017
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,060
Man, you free?

1018
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:18,596
Ha ha, yeah, bro!
I'm free. Thank you.

1019
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,940
I don't know what you did,
but, boom... they let me out.

1020
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,503
I'm gonna sign
these contracts, Jack.

1021
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,983
Dude... dude, don't sign anything.

1022
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,453
Don't sign...
I would rather go back to jail, Add.

1023
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:35,218
If I beg you on my knees... I'm not
on my knees 'cause it's concrete, dude,

1024
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:38,125
but do not... do not sign
those contract...

1025
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,594
Add? Add?

1026
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,495
You're doing the right thing,
my friend.

1027
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,267
Mm-hmm.

1028
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,639
Yeah.

1029
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,271
Let's do it, man.

1030
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,148
Come in.

1031
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,676
Danni?

1032
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,923
Okay, Mr. Addington,

1033
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,329
you have a favorite break?
Any break in the world.

1034
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,732
Oh, yeah.

1035
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,759
Uh, and what is it?

1036
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,001
I'm not telling you, dude.

1037
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,337
Oh.

1038
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,808
Okay.

1039
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,777
I'll just pick one.

1040
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,077
So act naturally

1041
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:42,278
and if you feel any nausea,
dizziness or pain in the chest,

1042
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,717
let us know.

1043
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,152
Here we go.

1044
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,897
# Whooo! #

1045
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:06,465
He sees it. You ready?

1046
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,938
Come on, pop it, man.

1047
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,712
# Whoo! #

1048
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,379
Come on. Come on.

1049
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,523
What the fuck is he doing?

1050
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,926
- # Whooo! #
- Addington?

1051
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,894
No no, Addington...

1052
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,595
What...

1053
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,228
Addington?

1054
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,034
God damn it.

1055
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,270
Addington!

1056
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,870
God damn it!

1057
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,182
- Fuck.
- Ahhh!

1058
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,453
He fucking bailed.

1059
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,389
# Whooo! #

1060
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,863
No no no no!
Where is he going?

1061
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,930
God damn it!

1062
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,402
Come on, get a camera.
Find his fucking ass now.

1063
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,775
# Whooo! #

1064
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,504
Farmer Bob?

1065
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,129
How many are there?

1066
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,226
300 or more.

1067
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,863
You wanted them roaming free,
so there they are...

1068
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:51,532
roaming free.

1069
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,836
Dude...

1070
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,282
- who mows your grass?
- Hmm?

1071
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,650
They do.

1072
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,464
At ease, at ease.
Carry on.

1073
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:26,873
So where's Addington, huh?

1074
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,210
Besides his nuts, I mean,
which I got right here.

1075
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,442
Mr. Simons is here...

1076
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,677
with another gentleman.

1077
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,050
- Mr. Sim...
- Mm-hmm.

1078
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:39,748
Wait.

1079
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,952
- New York Simons?
- Mm-hmm.

1080
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,017
- He's here?
- Mm-hmm.

1081
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,790
We were as surprised
as anybody,

1082
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,324
but Mr. Martin made the offer
and they jumped at it.

1083
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,997
- Happened just like that.
- All... all right.

1084
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,199
Well, what happens now?

1085
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,641
Your company falls under
Mercer's DSK Enterprises.

1086
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:04,612
Yeah, this is good.
This is very good.

1087
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,411
Growth is good. You got
the muscle to move some product here.

1088
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,509
That's what
I've been talking about. Huh?

1089
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,782
What do you know about
the surfing industry, Mr. Martin?

1090
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,483
- Not much. Nn-nnh.
- Nnn?

1091
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,549
Tell me about Steve Addington.

1092
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,922
Steve Addington?

1093
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:23,830
Well, he's a big-name surfer.
Little difficult to work with,

1094
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:27,267
but I own...
well, we own his image

1095
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,930
and image is reality,
so we own his reality.

1096
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,529
Just gotta squeeze it
a bit harder, that's all.

1097
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:35,101
From what I hear,
Mr. Addington is surfing.

1098
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,841
And more importantly,
he's cool and cool sells.

1099
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:42,681
And when you defame and
slander Mr. Cool,

1100
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,620
well, that's bad for business.

1101
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:51,083
I don't... I don't...
I agree, I guess.

1102
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,857
Of course I do, but, um...

1103
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,865
I would dispute that we...

1104
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,493
I would dispute... I would dispute
that it came from us.

1105
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:04,067
Eddie, how about
you show us around?

1106
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,232
Yes, please.

1107
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,972
And why don't we start
at the front door?

1108
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:12,173
Okay, sure.

1109
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,648
Yeah, fine, let's...

1110
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,880
I'm a surfer, dude.

1111
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:23,517
Video games, reality TV,
Free Surfer...

1112
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,494
I mean, what the fuck
is that, man?

1113
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:32,831
I'm not some ass-clown in a green room.
I'm a surfer, dude.

1114
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,267
Yes.

1115
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,328
Look at it this way, Eddie.

1116
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:39,773
You have been relieved,
but with all this free time,

1117
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,504
maybe you can pick up
surfing again.

1118
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,481
Oh, and you've met
my daughter Danni.

1119
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,279
Your...

1120
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,513
Wait, that was...

1121
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,249
Oh my God.

1122
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,553
Ah, that's so...

1123
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,286
You can go now.

1124
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:02,196
Security will show you out.

1125
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,858
You know what?

1126
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,357
All of you... you can all
just take a flying fuck.

1127
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,735
- I'm a surfer, dude.
- Good girl.

1128
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,747
# Come, my brother, come slowly #

1129
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,375
# Come easy, my friend #

1130
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,180
# Come, my friend #

1131
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,520
# Come, my sister #

1132
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,286
# Come easy,
come busy... #

1133
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,381
He's here.

1134
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,289
Oh!

1135
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,851
The worm has turned, bro.

1136
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,797
# Take your heart out, let go,
come let go #

1137
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,596
# Come, my sister,
can I hold you... #

1138
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,466
Goats?

1139
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:43,937
Those are your new mowers, bro.

1140
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,442
No, bro...

1141
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:51,412
I think I need more than two.

1142
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,905
Well, more than two,
you got, brother.

1143
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:58,579
They cut, they fertilize,
they cut, they fertilize,

1144
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:01,522
- they cut and...
- And they fertilize.

1145
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,620
# Come let go #

1146
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,928
- # Come the winter, come summer... #
- Addington!

1147
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:18,201
# Come autumn, come spring,
do your thing... #

1148
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,674
That clip was bullshit, man.

1149
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,139
I threw a breakfast burrito
at you, bro.

1150
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,409
Sorry, dude.

1151
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:30,648
- It's cool.
- Right on, man.

1152
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,558
# Whooo! #

1153
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,823
Waves, bro!

1154
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,163
- # Whooo! #
- Waves?

1155
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,292
- Waves.
- Waves.

1156
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:52,264
# Whooo! #

1157
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:58,205
# Hey! #

1158
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,715
# Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo #

1159
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,587
# Come, my brother,
put your hands up #

1160
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,525
# Take your heart out,
let go #

1161
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,822
# Come let go #

1162
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,421
# Come, my sister, can I hold you? #

1163
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,159
# Can I squeeze you? #

1164
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,759
# Let go, come let go... #

1165
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:26,205
These contracts,
they're not binding,

1166
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:27,674
but my offer still stands.

1167
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,144
I say, I dig your vibe,
Mr. Martin, I do,

1168
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,204
and I appreciate your offer.

1169
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:35,910
But me and Jack over there... we let him
handle all the business deals.

1170
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,043
Understood.

1171
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,817
I gotta tell you, though,
bro to bro...

1172
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,847
if it wasn't for this chick...

1173
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,950
- What? A girl?
- Oh, yeah.

1174
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:48,429
Yeah, charged and peaceful
all at the same time,

1175
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,557
- kind of like the ocean.
- Ha.

1176
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:54,195
Speaking of, there she is right now,

1177
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:55,703
on time.

1178
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,672
Ah...

1179
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:01,107
That's...
that's my daughter, Steve.

1180
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,941
- She's your daughter?
- Mm-hmm.

1181
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,307
Dude,

1182
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:08,873
you're stoked.

1183
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,783
It's going off, dude.

1184
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,051
- Later, dude.
- Yeah.

1185
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,387
Yeah.

1186
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,301
Oh, boy.

1187
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,472
- Mr. Mayweather?
- Oh, Mr. Martin.

1188
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:39,276
I've been going over
these contracts

1189
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,578
and... who are Ben and Barry?

1190
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:45,383
Well, step into my office.
Let's have a little conversation.

1191
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,956
# Whooo! #

1192
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,867
# Whooo! #

1193
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,965
# Whooo! #

1194
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,988
# Can you feel it?
It's coming up again #

1195
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:25,755
# And I can feel it
coming up again #

1196
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:29,025
# I can feel it
coming through the wind #

1197
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,897
# Can you feel it?
She get me smilin' again #

1198
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:35,335
# Can you feel it
coming up again? #

1199
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,498
# I can feel it,
she givin' up again #

1200
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,737
# Can you feel it
coming through the wind? #

1201
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:45,440
# I can feel it,
she get me smilin' again #

1202
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,445
# Oh ooh #

1203
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:53,478
# Oh, she get me
smilin' again #

1204
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,851
# Whooo! #

1205
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:00,623
# Say, can you feel it,
she comin' up again? #

1206
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,927
# I can feel it
coming through the wind #

1207
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:07,197
# Can you feel it?
She givin' up again #

1208
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:11,002
# I can feel it,
she came in strong again #

1209
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,066
# I can feel it #

1210
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,874
# I can feel it #

1211
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,910
# I can feel it, ehhh #

1212
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,415
# Waiting #

1213
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,945
# So long, it seems,
that I've been waiting #

1214
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,424
# Whoo! #

1215
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:36,893
# So long, it seems #

1216
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,335
# So long, it seems,
that I've been waiting #

1217
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,535
# Whoo! #

1218
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,237
# Hey #

1219
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:00,449
# Can you feel it? #

1220
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:03,352
# Can you feel it? #

1221
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,855
Ah, barrel.

1222
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,168
What's the barrel?

1223
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:25,313
There's nothing we can do for him, Chip.
The transplant didn't take.

1224
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:28,180
We're lifeguards, not lawyers.

1225
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:29,581
That was good.

1226
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:32,314
Okay. Ay gy gy gy gy gy gy...

1227
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:35,414
La Rosa... you want to see
my beautiful face.

1228
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,549
Ah ka ka ka ka!

1229
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:44,727
Okay. Hello, is anybody there?

1230
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,666
What is this shit?

1231
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:50,069
# Fuk it #

1232
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,266
# Fuk it #

1233
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,539
# It's all good again, my friends #

1234
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,513
# My friends, my friends... #

1235
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,140
You wanna get high?

1236
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:04,016
Oh, yeah, bro.
I'm right behind you.

1237
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:07,681
I just got a little business
to take care of.

1238
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:11,420
# Waiting #

1239
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,826
# Ha! Can you feel it? #

1240
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,695
# She's coming up again #

1241
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,725
# I can feel it
coming through the wind... #

1242
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:22,566
Ah ha ha ha ha.

1243
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,469
# Koo koo koo koo koo. #

1244
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,774
# Whoo hoo hoo #

1245
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:39,446
# Yeah yeah yeah yeah #

1246
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,980
# Heard you saying
it won't make a difference #

1247
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:47,621
# It's only you and
it's just this once, yeah #

1248
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,996
# It's only this time #

1249
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:54,491
# Don't you think that
it all adds up? #

1250
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:58,529
# There's a reaction
for each action, man #

1251
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:02,942
# And where do you
draw the line? #

1252
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:06,641
# Know thyself and
to thine own self be true #

1253
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,516
# Any other way is
gonna make you feel blue #

1254
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:14,613
# Yeah, you got
a reason to be #

1255
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:18,820
# Maybe if we focus and
we get it together #

1256
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,762
# We could raise the human
consciousness and make things better #

1257
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,757
# Yeah, I know you think
I'm a dreamer #

1258
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:33,765
# But I know that you're also
seeking peace of mind #

1259
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:38,542
# Wonder why
you feel so tired #

1260
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,981
# Why your third eye's blind #

1261
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,713
# And I know that
you're also trying #

1262
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:50,851
# To find your place #

1263
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,360
# You're somewhere all the time #

1264
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:58,856
# And somewhere out in space #

1265
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,996
# Get so exhausted
for money exhausts #

1266
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:06,667
# Living in fear from
living in a box #

1267
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,610
# Yeah, how come we
always have to try? #

1268
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:14,775
# I keep wishing corporations
and the politicians #

1269
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:18,946
# Would make tighter restrictions
on the fossil-fuel emissions #

1270
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:22,184
# And meanwhile,
why don't we walk? #

1271
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:26,957
# If we all did a little
then a lot would be done #

1272
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:30,761
# Clean up the mess
and try to have some fun #

1273
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:34,530
# Yeah, I'm off to
plant a tree now #

1274
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:38,733
# 'Cause if everybody takes
and nobody gives #

1275
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:42,870
# There'll soon be nowhere to breathe,
nowhere to live #

1276
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:46,403
# But you can't stop
Mother Nature #

1277
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:51,215
# But I know that
you're also seeking #

1278
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,279
# Peace of mind #

1279
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,657
# Wondering why
you feel so tired #

1280
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:02,288
# Why your third eye's blind #

1281
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,961
# I know that you're
also trying #

1282
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:10,938
# To find your place #

1283
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:13,497
# You're somewhere all the time #

1284
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:18,241
# And somewhere out in space #

1285
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:23,081
# Did you remember to
give thanks for the food #

1286
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,952
# The earth and the water
and everything good? Yeah #

1287
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:31,149
# The fire's still burning #

1288
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:35,061
# Talk to yourself 'cause
no one knows you better #

1289
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:38,827
# Even take the time
to write yourself a letter #

1290
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,497
# Don't you know
the wheels are still turning? #

1291
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:46,940
# There's no better time than now
to stand up straight #

1292
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:50,638
# Take a deep breath,
Lord, it's never too late #

1293
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,672
# To expell your confusion #

1294
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:58,948
# Say it's all been done
and there's no sense trying #

1295
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:03,083
# They don't really know you
and they're probably lying #

1296
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:06,491
# You've got to see
for yourself, yeah #

1297
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:10,897
# But I know that
you're also seeking #

1298
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:14,459
# Peace of mind #

1299
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:18,768
# Wondering why
you feel so tired #

1300
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:22,106
# Why your third eye's blind #

1301
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:26,636
# And I know that you're
also trying #

1302
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:30,344
# To find your place #

1303
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,411
# You're somewhere all the time #

1304
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:38,154
# And somewhere out in space #

1305
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:43,028
# I know that
you're also seeking #

1306
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:51,101
# I know that you're
also out there #

1307
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,707
# Oh, yeah
oh, yeah #

1308
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:03,445
# Oh, yeah-eah #

1309
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:07,319
# Oh, yeah, oh, yeah #

1310
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:10,483
# Oh, yeah-eah #

1311
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:15,657
# I know that you're
also seeking #

1312
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:23,134
# I know that you're also
out there #

1313
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:31,303
# Oh, yeah, oh, yeah #

1314
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:35,077
# Oh, yeah-eah-eah #

1315
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,811
# Uh-huh #

1316
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,819
# Uh-huuh #

1317
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:42,755
# Uh-huuuuh. #

1318
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:50,987
Yes yes.
And that is why we want him to...

1319
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,762
represent our board.

1320
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,532
Of course. Well, that's what
he's doing here, of course.

1321
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:57,833
- Yes yes.
- And you know what?

1322
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:00,466
Maybe we'll all go to dinner after
or something, maybe.

1323
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:02,772
- Korean barbeque.
- Ah, Korean barbeque.

1324
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:06,144
That's what I was thinking.
Okay, we'll get him in the water...

1325
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,809
Okay, it's time for you
to do your thing.

1326
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,216
Things are looking
good over here.

1327
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:14,915
I thought you said it was
made by some soulful dudes.

1328
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:18,722
No no no, I said
"dudes from Seoul," bro.

1329
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,490
Yeah. It's a hacked bomber, man.

1330
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,895
It's got a bee on it, man.

1331
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,524
You know?

1332
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,195
Nine skegs.

1333
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:32,400
Look, bro, do me a favor... get on that
damn thing and ride it, all right?

1334
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,874
We're one wave away
from a payday

1335
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:37,139
and, like,
we're check-light, okay?

1336
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,646
We need some checks
coming in.

1337
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,979
Yeah?

1338
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,577
Party. Get stoned!

1339
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:45,916
Respect.

1340
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:48,422
Ha! Respect.

1341
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,684
Yeah.

1342
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:50,782
Ha ha!

1343
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,316
Yeah, respect.
Re... respect.

1344
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,023
Okay, ladies, he doesn't
go in for that.

1345
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,656
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool.

1346
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,300
All right.

1347
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,634
All right. Ahh.

1348
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:41,898
Dude, outside!

1349
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:45,138
Outside!

1350
01:24:57,659 --> 01:24:59,251
What happened?

1351
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:02,491
Addington's supposed to be good.
Addington sucks.

1352
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,498
Mr. Addington's all big talk.

1353
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,660
Look at my man over here.

1354
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:11,937
He go out there and he break it.

1355
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:13,907
It's broken!
It is our only board.

1356
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:17,503
How were you gonna sell the boards
if you only have one of 'em?

1357
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:29,545
