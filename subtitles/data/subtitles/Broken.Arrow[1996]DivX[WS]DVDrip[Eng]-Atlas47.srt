1
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:51,884
- You see what happened there?
- I'm pretty sure you hit me.

2
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:54,850
I gave you left, left.
You think it'll be another left...

3
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:56,888
..and I gave you a right.

4
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:02,404
I'm just telling ya
that's what boxing's all about. Okay?

5
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:04,483
You show your opponent one thing.

6
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,483
You do something else.

7
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:09,081
That's how Ali took the title from Foreman.

8
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,402
He beat him with a rope-a-dope. Remember?

9
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,562
I don't remember what day it is!

10
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:18,687
Everyone thought Ali's arms had run out.

11
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,491
But he was just setting Foreman up.

12
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:23,449
He let him burn himself out.

13
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:27,406
And then in the eighth round, in he comes!

14
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:35,361
Poor George has got nothin' left.

15
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,888
I always liked Bruce Lee movies.

16
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,769
Hey, you're learning!

17
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,286
Don't look at my hands.
Look at my shoulder!

18
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,169
Where the punch comes from! See?

19
00:02:58,372 --> 00:03:01,205
You're still looking at my hands!
Let's try it again.

20
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:04,724
Come on! Focus.

21
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:05,722
Shoulders!

22
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,683
- Here.
- No, you keep it.

23
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,000
Come on, you won.

24
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:15,607
Yeah, but I always win.
I mean, I'm starting to feel guilty.

25
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,489
Shut up and take it!

26
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:27,407
You know why
you didn't beat me today, Hale?

27
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:31,121
Could it be you've been boxing
for 20 years and you're better than me?

28
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:34,047
No.

29
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,202
You don't have the will to win.

30
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:38,528
Well,... your insight is shattering.

31
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,250
You had me today.

32
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,971
You coulda shut me down,
but you blinked. Mm?

33
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,647
Well, we were only sparring, buddy.

34
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,682
Thinking like that
is exactly why you lost. Take this.

35
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,964
No, it's yours.

36
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:58,443
No, take it. Ifyou didn't give it everything
you've got, I don't want it.

37
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,807
- Go ahead.
- No, it really is yours.

38
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:04,123
I took it out ofyour wallet
while you were in the shower.

39
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,802
- General.
- General.

40
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:27,532
Major, were you recently promoted past me?

41
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:28,601
No, sir.

42
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:30,967
Then, why are you smoking
in my briefing room?

43
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:35,207
Uh... Sorry about that, sir.
That'll never happen again.

44
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,846
Sit.

45
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:44,047
You take off in the Stealth at 0-dark.30.

46
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:48,410
Fly a simulated low-level border penetration.
Nap ofthe earth.

47
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:50,960
Usual... Scare the cows, wake the farmers.

48
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:52,610
Not tonight, buddy.

49
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,762
We're flying the B-3 with two live nukes.

50
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:57,843
Palmdale's concerned about...

51
00:05:57,932 --> 00:06:01,004
..low-level gamma and x-ray diffusion
on the peripherals.

52
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:04,402
They want to send up a couple pre-dawn.
See if anything glows.

53
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:05,686
61s?

54
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:08,161
Big ones. 83s.

55
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:10,527
Phew! Crowd pleasers.

56
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,090
(chuckles)

57
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:36,002
- How's your head?
- It's all right. I'll be fine.

58
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:39,641
- I'm sorry about that.
- Don't worry. I'll get you back.

59
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,723
Ah! Now you're dreaming!

60
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,723
After you, Major.

61
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:09,651
You know, these exercises are fantastic.

62
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:13,645
When we have to go to war against Utah,
we are really gonna kick ass!

63
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:23,163
Ground control. Ready for roll-out.

64
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,284
Park ranger!

65
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:07,681
I'd like to speak to you about this campfire!

66
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:10,240
- I'll go.
- No, Wanda, you stay put.

67
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:12,725
Yeah, I know...

68
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:15,007
No wood fires in the park.

69
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:17,208
But Wanda has a cold
and I want to keep her warm.

70
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:21,410
Sir, have you seen any other hikers
or campers in this area?

71
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:24,882
Not this time ofyear.
Say, what's the fine for this?

72
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,690
Pretty steep.

73
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,650
- Aargh!
- (woman) Oh!

74
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:32,207
Aagh!

75
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:38,965
Secured.

76
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,930
Jesus Christ!

77
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,128
Drag him outta there!

78
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:01,567
We'll be smelling that all night.

79
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:13,129
(Hale) Climb heading 2-8-7.
Flight level 2-0-0.

80
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:15,601
That's 2-8-7. 2-0-0.

81
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:20,043
(Hale) I don't think that Aurora project
will happen for me.

82
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:24,250
Your buddy Taylor said
I don't have enough fighter time to qualify.

83
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:25,765
What did you say to him?

84
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:29,447
- "Thank you, sir. Goodbye."
- You'll never change, will you?

85
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:32,251
And that, my friend, will be your downfall.

86
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:36,322
- You know what your problem is?
- Yeah. I'm always right.

87
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:39,245
- You thinkyou're always right.
- That's deep.

88
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,846
You said yourself
you should have made colonel.

89
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:44,048
But you're always pushing at everybody.

90
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:45,531
Well...

91
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:48,331
That's an awesome responsibility, isn't it?

92
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,692
McMurran Control, this is Ghost-7.

93
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:59,161
Colonel! You boys in Utah stillawake?

94
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:02,164
Copy, Major Deakins.
We're ready and waiting.

95
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:06,245
Be advised we're gonna catch your butts
this morning and bite down hard!

96
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:09,722
You may pass that along
to Captain Hale with my compliments.

97
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:13,088
Ooh! Wilkins is giving us attitude!
You wanna take it through?

98
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:16,289
Tell him I'm gonna fly this thing
in one ear and out the other.

99
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:18,363
He won't even know we were there!

100
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,012
Copy, Colonel.
Hale says if anyone can catch us,...

101
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,083
..you can.

102
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:25,163
And everyone get a fix!

103
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,482
They're about to turn out the lights!

104
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,883
Ready, Captain?

105
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,883
On your command, Major.

106
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:44,246
Go to war.

107
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,883
Initiating Stealth mode.

108
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,651
River valley approach, here we go.

109
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:59,762
Colonel, they've gone to Stealth mode.

110
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:03,603
We lost them on the radar!
Anybody still holding? Anybody?

111
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:06,252
- Capture on their heat signature, sir.
- Good.

112
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,846
They may be running cold,
but the air is colder.

113
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:10,923
Good man, Frenchy. I like that.

114
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:15,324
(Deakins) Descend to 400 feet AGL.
Altimeter setting 3-0-0-1.

115
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:18,563
(Hale) Airspeed .7 Mach.
3-0-0-1. 400 feet.

116
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:20,847
Nap ofthe earth, here we go.

117
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,882
(radio) Terry? You been through
the Needles entrance tonight?

118
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:43,122
- No. Why?
- Mrs Parkerjust called.

119
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:46,204
Oh, God! What is it this time?
Another UFO?

120
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:50,207
- Or did Elvis drop by for dinner?
- She didn'tmention him,...

121
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:54,046
..but she saidsome trucks went through
the Needles entrance an hourago.

122
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:56,123
She thought theylookedsuspicious.

123
00:11:56,212 --> 00:12:00,125
Clyde, what exactly
does a suspicious truck look like?

124
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:02,328
I don'tknowandlhave no idea!

125
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,083
Me neither!

126
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:08,403
Yeah, the thing is though,
she said one ofthe trucks was ours.

127
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:12,201
You're the only one out there tonight,
so ifit wasn'tyou...

128
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:16,843
She was probablyjust hallucinating.
Don't worry, I'll check it out.

129
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,170
(bleeping)

130
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:28,563
- Lost 'em.
- Damn!

131
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,847
Come on, keep hunting. Keep hunting!

132
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:36,605
We're below their eyes and ears.
Proceed to primary target.

133
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,683
Descending to 200 feet.

134
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,967
Ridge coming up in six seconds.

135
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,690
I got it.

136
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:53,482
Whoo! Very nicely done!

137
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,561
Excellent.

138
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:57,166
- Switching to autopilot.
- Almost as good as me.

139
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:00,324
I left a few trees behind.
I'll try to do better next time.

140
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,209
You love this shit, don't you?

141
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,567
Where else can you fly a $2 billion plane...

142
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:07,086
..800 miles per hour
100 feet offthe ground?

143
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,766
Well, that is a fact. That is a fact.

144
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,483
You're in for life, huh?

145
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,722
As long as they'll have me. Aren't you?

146
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:18,326
No, no, no, no. I don't think so.

147
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:20,403
I mean, come on...

148
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:23,363
You even said it yourself.

149
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,363
I should be colonel by now.

150
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:27,886
Instead, idiots like Boone become general.

151
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,281
- Boone is not such a bad guy.
- Oh, come on!

152
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,728
If a thought goes through his head,
it's the quickest trip in America!

153
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,530
(both chuckle)

154
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:36,601
Nah...

155
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:39,932
Flying doesn't mean
what it used to mean to me.

156
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,526
No, not the flying. Carrying the nukes.

157
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:46,843
I know you love
having the power of God at your fingertips.

158
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:48,923
You get off on it.

159
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:03,844
Look out your window.

160
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,810
There's something wrong
with the terrain following.

161
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:10,089
Shouldn't that starboard ridge
be on our port side?

162
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,449
(alarm buzzing)

163
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,363
Here she comes.

164
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:48,408
(Hale) No!

165
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:51,365
What are you doing?

166
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:26,484
Clyde, I'm looking at halfthe valley
and nothing's going...

167
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,604
Holy shit!

168
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:13,366
- I got 'em!
- (cheering)

169
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,245
McMurran!

170
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:20,120
This is Deakins!
Hale's lost it! I'm punching out!

171
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:48,089
Oh, shit!

172
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,685
Get me Search and Rescue!
We got pilots down!

173
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,203
The plane crashed 18 minutes ago.

174
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:04,125
The White House Chief of Staff
is on his way up.

175
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,643
Good morning, gentlemen!

176
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,723
So, do I wake the President?

177
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:15,211
- Bill.
- Jack.

178
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,523
Well, what have we got?

179
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,923
We're going out with this.

180
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:25,003
Rick's team prepared it.

181
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,851
The United States AirForce
regrets to announce that early this morning...

182
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:33,321
..a C-141 heavy-lift cargo plane went down...

183
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:37,451
..over the Utah desert. Crewstatus
has yet to be determined. Yadda yadda...

184
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:40,807
Well, that's very nice bullshit, Rick.

185
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:43,122
- Thank you, sir.
- We'll go with that.

186
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:44,486
Wait!

187
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,323
We're making a mistake.

188
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,763
Giles?

189
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:55,525
You have some input
you wish to share with us?

190
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:57,125
Yes, sir.

191
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:03,083
Aviation Week...

192
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:06,164
..has been following the development
of the B-3 for years.

193
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,890
They have stringers,...

194
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:11,203
..guys camping in lawn chairs
by the Whiteman perimeter fence...

195
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,726
..watching for one ofthese things to take off.

196
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,530
They're gonna know...

197
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:18,763
..that one took off last night
and they're gonna know...

198
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,649
..that it didn't come back.

199
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,610
When our press release says
a C-141 went down in Utah,...

200
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,603
..they'll put two and two together.

201
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:27,523
Aviation Weekwill run a story.

202
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:29,842
Everyone will know what really happened...

203
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:32,571
..and we're all gonna look extremely stupid.

204
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,205
(murmuring)

205
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:36,681
We're better offjust telling the truth.

206
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:38,285
The truth?

207
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,840
- How did you get this job?
- (laughter)

208
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:51,361
- Rewrite it, like Giles said.
- Yes, sir.

209
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:56,931
I want you to go to Utah.
I'll have my C-21 standing by.

210
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,003
It was good work in there.

211
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:01,483
Guys in lawn chairs...

212
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:05,408
I don't know, Giles...
Sometimes you scare me.

213
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,164
Hell, sir,...

214
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:09,129
..sometimes I scare myself!

215
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,289
Go! Move! Move!

216
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:25,084
Thomas, over there!

217
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:27,128
Reed, check over there!

218
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:29,203
Kelly, check over there!

219
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,603
(bleeping)

220
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:44,724
Anything?

221
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:46,689
Not a goddamn thing!

222
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,803
Colonel! This is Rhodes!

223
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:50,881
Go, Max.

224
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:54,044
Aircraft disintegrated.
Negative survivors on site.

225
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:55,360
Checking payload!

226
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,967
You watch your needles there, Chief!

227
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:02,251
Over here!

228
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:04,571
(whistles)

229
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:06,324
Over here!

230
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,608
Take that end!

231
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,403
The nukes are gone.

232
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:47,526
Colonel!

233
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:51,522
We got ourselves a Broken Arrow.

234
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:56,483
You find those nukes, Chief.

235
00:20:56,572 --> 00:21:01,043
If your Geigers pick up more rads
than you get off a toaster, I want you out!

236
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:04,886
A broken what?

237
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,928
Broken Arrow.

238
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:09,480
It's a Class 4 Strategic Theatre Emergency.

239
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,484
It's what we call it
when we lose a nuclear weapon.

240
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,528
I don't know what's scarier.

241
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:16,523
Losing nuclear weapons,...

242
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:19,410
..or that it happens so often
there's a term for it!

243
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:23,485
They found the wreckage
about 90 miles outside of McMurran.

244
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,563
No bombs on board.

245
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,643
This is a real nightmare.

246
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:30,371
We don't know where the hell
the damn things are.

247
00:21:30,452 --> 00:21:31,931
- Captain.
- Sir?

248
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:35,288
Put two more teams in the air.
I want Chief Rhodes backed up.

249
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,888
Why didn't they go off?

250
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,963
They have to be armed to detonate.

251
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:47,566
They're designed to survive crashes intact.

252
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:51,167
They could lie in burning jet fuel
for five hours, no problem.

253
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:53,368
So what the hell happened?

254
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:57,730
In his last transmission, Major Deakins
said that Captain Hale lost control.

255
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:02,567
It's possible one ofthem may have hit
weapons release during the confusion.

256
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:13,571
Agh!

257
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:49,809
Deakins...

258
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,363
You won that round.

259
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,163
Sir! Please turn around.

260
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:50,488
Who the hell are you?

261
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:52,770
Park ranger.

262
00:23:55,412 --> 00:23:58,324
Just put it down and I won't have to kill you.

263
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,162
This isn't a standoff. I've got the gun.

264
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,083
I never keep it loaded.

265
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:17,682
I thought you said it wasn't loaded.

266
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:21,047
I lied. Now, who the hell are you?

267
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:23,646
I'm a captain in the United States Air Force.

268
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:26,166
Well, Captain, you're under arrest.

269
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:29,050
Lady, you're missing the bigger picture here.

270
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:35,403
Hold still.

271
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,968
All right?
I have already had a hell of a morning, lady.

272
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:42,328
Now, I can't tell you what's going on,
but I need your help.

273
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,687
This is a good way to convince me.

274
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,808
We both know the gun is loaded,...

275
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,645
..so if I wanted,
I could blow your head off. Right?

276
00:24:58,052 --> 00:24:59,371
Yeah.

277
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:02,769
But I'm not going to.

278
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:07,366
Come on.

279
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,129
I got a radio in my truck.

280
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:28,323
It's this way.

281
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,763
Got 'em!

282
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:07,044
(rapid bleeping)

283
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:09,449
We got one.

284
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:16,084
(truck)

285
00:26:34,852 --> 00:26:37,161
- How are you doing?
- Hey!

286
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:39,482
You guys need any help?

287
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:41,449
Air Force training exercise, sir.

288
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:44,442
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

289
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:46,727
Hey, no problem. We just, uh...

290
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:49,964
Oh, Jeez...

291
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:54,286
Argh!

292
00:27:16,772 --> 00:27:18,763
Any sign of Deakins?

293
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:21,610
Maybe the son of a bitch is dead.

294
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:24,525
(Deakins) What a terrible thing to say!

295
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,685
Get 'em.

296
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:38,286
You assured me
everything would go smoothly!

297
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:40,328
It is going smoothly, I assure you.

298
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:43,324
Our merchandise
is not where it's supposed to be!

299
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,687
It's right down there, Mr Pritchett.

300
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:47,763
Everything's on schedule.

301
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,049
(rapid bleeping)

302
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:02,487
Sir? We got one intact.

303
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:06,202
Let's go find the other one!
Move! Let's go!

304
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:08,603
Care for a Coke or something?

305
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:11,445
Two gunships just left McMurran,
headed this way.

306
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:12,760
Oh, wonderful!

307
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:14,843
- Don't worry about them.
- I worry.

308
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:17,366
What about the other pilot?
We saw him eject.

309
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:19,249
Hah!

310
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:23,048
Captain Hale...
Well, I seriously doubt he's alive.

311
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:26,204
I punched him out
when we were scraping the valley floor.

312
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:28,283
A park ranger called in a report.

313
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:30,681
She saw a pilot come down
and was gonna look for him.

314
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:35,931
Find her.

315
00:28:42,892 --> 00:28:45,122
- I got it!
- (rapidbleeping)

316
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:51,483
Hello! McMurran, come in!

317
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:52,721
Go, Max.

318
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:54,530
McMurran, come in. Over.

319
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:55,840
- (static)
- McMurran!

320
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,888
Max, are you there?

321
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:00,281
- McMurran?
- Max!

322
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,649
McMurran, come in!

323
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:04,965
(machine-gun fire)

324
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:27,527
Move!

325
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:31,288
Gonna open up the access panels.

326
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,647
Gonna drop in a couple of grenades.

327
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:36,804
It won't go nuclear,
but it will destroy the bomb.

328
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:40,883
And who's ever trying to steal it.

329
00:29:40,972 --> 00:29:43,532
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Chief.

330
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:46,730
And why not?

331
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:56,490
All clear!

332
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:30,361
- Where is this truck ofyours?
- Just around the bend.

333
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:32,807
- How did you find me?
- Saw your chute.

334
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:34,564
Don't step on that stuff!

335
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:36,643
There, on that black stuff!

336
00:30:36,732 --> 00:30:39,769
- What is it?
- It's cryptogamic soil. Very fragile.

337
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:43,049
One footprint takes centuries to repair.

338
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,123
- Oh...
- Come on, jump.

339
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:47,601
I thought it was a mine or something.

340
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,567
Endangered dirt. That's a new one.

341
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:53,571
(buzzing)

342
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:59,688
Colonel Wilkins! This is Airman Kelly, sir!

343
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:02,286
- Go.
- ChiefRhodes is dead!

344
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:03,691
They're all dead!

345
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:06,844
What the hell happened?
What the hell happened!

346
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,968
(razor buzzes)

347
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:12,323
It's the nuke! It's open!

348
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,403
It's wide open!

349
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:15,527
Kelly! Come in!

350
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,489
What happened?

351
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,523
Oh, God!

352
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:23,648
What am I gonna do!

353
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,724
- Whoo!
- (laughs)

354
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:32,523
Recall Search and Rescue.

355
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:34,523
Get me Washington.

356
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,568
I want NEST on this right now.

357
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:40,361
- You missed your calling, boy!
- Hell, Deak! leven bought it!

358
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:43,842
Make sure you get Hale! Go!

359
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:47,049
There are still two attack helicopters
headed this way!

360
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:49,692
Not any more!
They've just been recalled!

361
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:52,969
I'll check further ahead!
That's where they're headed!

362
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:55,043
Get to work!

363
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:04,728
You see, Mr Pritchett,
they believe they've got an exposed core...

364
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:07,531
..and that changes things remarkably.

365
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:11,969
Cos it wouldn't be right to just send people
into an active radiation area.

366
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:14,964
First you have to take a picture
from a satellite.

367
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:17,805
It takes about an hour and a half
just to change orbit.

368
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:20,201
Then they gotta send in a NEST.

369
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,726
That's a Nuclear Emergency Search Team.

370
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:25,531
Closest one is about two hours from here.

371
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,842
So, by the time they find us, we'll be gone!

372
00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:29,331
So relax!

373
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:41,201
- Think your radio can reach McMurran?
- Clyde will patch us through.

374
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,524
We can get your people in here,
then I can go home and feed my dog.

375
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:50,972
Clyde, this is Terry. Do you read me?

376
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:13,364
Hello, Clyde. This is Terry.

377
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,249
Do you read me?

378
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:58,001
- Why are they shooting at us?
- No time to discuss it right now.

379
00:33:58,092 --> 00:33:59,889
Come on!

380
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,883
Let's have some fun!

381
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,363
(machine-gun fire)

382
00:34:18,532 --> 00:34:20,648
- You okay?
- Yeah.

383
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:21,767
Gimme your gun.

384
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,451
Come on!

385
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:42,720
(gun clicks)

386
00:34:52,972 --> 00:34:55,202
- You have any more bullets?
- Yeah.

387
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,803
We need to get out ofthis canyon.

388
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:02,643
We can get out up that way.

389
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:06,162
If that bastard would just hold still...

390
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:07,924
I have an idea!

391
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:09,491
Wait! I didn't mean...

392
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:24,481
Oh, shit...

393
00:35:29,612 --> 00:35:30,647
Don't shoot!

394
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:35,365
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

395
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:58,041
Oh, no!

396
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:13,925
Go, go, go!

397
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:25,483
(Pritchett) Holy shit!

398
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:30,292
Novacek must have hit a canyon wall.

399
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,848
- Do you think?
- Maybe.

400
00:36:32,932 --> 00:36:34,923
Maybe?

401
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:38,049
You said you'd planned this thing carefully!

402
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:40,726
How are we going to move those things now?

403
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,245
(Deakins) Use the trucks.

404
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:44,488
The trucks now!

405
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,802
You listen to me...

406
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:50,521
I've spent a lot of money underwriting this,
and frankly,...

407
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:54,082
..you're beginning to shake my confidence!

408
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:00,328
Mm-hm... mm-hm... Well...

409
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:01,970
Yeah, well, I uh...

410
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:03,883
I do appreciate the money...

411
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,328
..that you and your associates
have invested in this operation.

412
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:10,449
But it is an operation,
a military operation,...

413
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,682
..and you don't know dick about that.

414
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,002
I've been in the military for 20 years.

415
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:18,289
I planned and flew
over 100 missions in the Gulf.

416
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:21,921
These boys are motivated
and they are highly trained, like me.

417
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:24,048
This is what I do, Mr Pritchett.

418
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:28,125
This is battle,
and battle is a highly fluid situation.

419
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,965
You... plan on your contingencies, and I have.

420
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:33,088
You keep your initiative, and I will.

421
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:36,562
But you don't share command.
It's never a good idea.

422
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:39,607
It's still my money.

423
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:45,409
And ifwe succeed,
you and your friends will get a ton of it.

424
00:37:45,492 --> 00:37:46,811
Ifwe're successful?

425
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:50,885
Look, Mr Pritchett, I will deliver
the weapons to the destination.

426
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:52,769
But I can't guarantee...

427
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:56,208
..that the assholes in Washington
won't do something stupid,...

428
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:58,123
..like... not pay.

429
00:37:58,412 --> 00:38:00,403
What ifthey don't?

430
00:38:00,492 --> 00:38:02,483
Well, ifthey don't,...

431
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,245
..the Southwest
will be a quiet neighbourhood...

432
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:08,323
..for about 10,000 years.

433
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,966
- (phone)
- Wilkins.

434
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:20,169
Fax me their last transmission.
How much radiation is out there?

435
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:24,209
- Fax that to Mr Prentice.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:28,251
- So far we're not picking up any.
- Well, that's strange, isn't it?

437
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:30,368
I mean,... with an exposed core?

438
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:33,364
Well, I'd call it good news.
The breach may not be so bad.

439
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,571
Colonel,...

440
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:51,927
What ifthis wasn'tan accident?

441
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,363
What are you saying, Giles?

442
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:58,161
In his final transmission,
Major Deakins said Captain Hale lostit.

443
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,163
We allassume that to mean...

444
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:02,288
..pilot error or equipment failure.

445
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:03,691
But...

446
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:06,570
..what if he meant...

447
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:09,803
- ..Hale intentionallylost the plane?
- Why would he do that?

448
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,406
Two nuclear weapons
would be worth a lot ofmoney.

449
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:13,481
To who, son?

450
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:16,291
There are easier ways
to buy nuclear weapons.

451
00:39:16,372 --> 00:39:20,365
The old Soviet republics will sell you
a couple for the price of a BMW.

452
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:22,249
Sir,...

453
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:25,642
..l meant how much
would they be worth to us.

454
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:27,962
How much would we pay
to get them back?

455
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:29,849
Hold on.

456
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:35,328
These nukes have codes or something
to stop people using them.

457
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:36,401
Of course.

458
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:40,246
And no-one knows these codes,
except for the President and you guys?

459
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:43,005
Access to codes
requires the highest security.

460
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:46,129
Yeah, but not even the pilots
have these codes, right?

461
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:48,123
Where's that NEST team?

462
00:39:48,212 --> 00:39:52,171
They just took off, sir.
The ETA in Utah is 96 minutes.

463
00:39:58,212 --> 00:40:00,248
- Left ten, left.
- Ten-four.

464
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:14,166
- It's okay...
- It's not okay!

465
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:18,530
I wanna know what's going on,
and I wanna know right now!

466
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:30,925
We were carrying nuclear weapons
on our plane last night.

467
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:35,405
My former commander
is trying to steal them.

468
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,885
- Oh, my God!
- That's why I need your help.

469
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:45,289
But without the helicopter
he won't be able to move them.

470
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:49,809
No, no. Deak'll have a backup plan.
He'll be prepared for that.

471
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,045
Trucks!

472
00:40:53,132 --> 00:40:56,329
He's got trucks! Last night...

473
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,768
..Clyde told me someone came through
the Needles Gate with trucks!

474
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:04,442
He won't take 'em towards town.
What else is around here?

475
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,924
The river.

476
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:20,203
(coughs) Do you mind?

477
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:23,443
No, I don't mind at all.

478
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:27,163
Care for one?

479
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:30,170
(chuckling)

480
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:48,042
The one in the front has got the nukes in.

481
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,247
How do you know?

482
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:52,324
There's only a driver.
They're keeping the weight down.

483
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:55,848
- Give me your gun again, will ya?
- What are you gonna do?

484
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:58,765
Well,... I'll think of something.

485
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:01,764
Wait... We know where they are.
Let's phone for help.

486
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,525
If they make it to the river,
I'm gonna lose 'em again.

487
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:06,961
But you get to the phone, okay?

488
00:42:08,052 --> 00:42:10,361
- Then I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

489
00:42:10,452 --> 00:42:14,081
- You're gonna need help!
- Lady, I don't have time to argue.

490
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:16,481
The nuclear weapons are my responsibility.

491
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:18,881
You're a park ranger. I'm a military officer.

492
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:20,291
Go to the phone.

493
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:38,248
(Terry) Oh, this is a bad idea!

494
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:49,126
- Hi!
- Hi.

495
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,880
Hale! Goddamn!

496
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:11,688
Run him down.

497
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,645
Get him! Get him!

498
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:19,407
Get him, goddammit!

499
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:30,243
Fuck!

500
00:43:33,732 --> 00:43:36,166
Don't panic. Bulletproof glass.

501
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,691
You can get out now.

502
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:43,042
It looks like we got ourselves a standoff!

503
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,168
Aargh!

504
00:43:45,252 --> 00:43:47,049
No... we... don't!

505
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:54,971
Go! Go!

506
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:01,723
Okay... You can come.

507
00:44:08,332 --> 00:44:09,321
Goddamn!

508
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:15,928
Would you mind not shooting
at the thermonuclear weapons?

509
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:29,324
- Where's St Jude's Hospital from here?
- Salt Lake City, I think.

510
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:40,803
- Shit!
- What?

511
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:44,089
- We're losing gas!
- They must have hit the tank.

512
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:46,766
We have to find some place
to hide these things.

513
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,683
I know a place.

514
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:08,246
What are you up to, Hale?

515
00:45:17,852 --> 00:45:19,001
Don't even...

516
00:45:24,612 --> 00:45:25,601
Stop!

517
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:33,050
Oh, fuck!

518
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:41,641
You learn that in survival school?

519
00:45:41,732 --> 00:45:43,324
New Jersey.

520
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:45,403
Trenton, New Jersey.

521
00:46:15,452 --> 00:46:17,920
What is this place?

522
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:21,448
It used to be a copper mine.
They shut it down a couple ofyears ago.

523
00:46:24,772 --> 00:46:26,888
Why would they have a new lock?

524
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:34,251
(Hale) All right!

525
00:46:36,892 --> 00:46:39,884
Good move, Hale. I didn't see it coming.

526
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:43,046
But you're definitely gonna pay for it.

527
00:46:43,132 --> 00:46:44,929
Saddle up, boys!

528
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:20,123
This place has been prepped.

529
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,203
Deak's been here.

530
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:25,683
You think he's coming back?

531
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:29,005
That'd be my guess.
We may not have a lot oftime.

532
00:47:29,092 --> 00:47:30,571
What are we gonna do?

533
00:47:31,372 --> 00:47:33,363
(sighs)

534
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:41,324
We just take away
his reason for being here.

535
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,160
Wanna help me unload these things?

536
00:47:49,772 --> 00:47:51,728
Where do you think they're going?

537
00:47:51,812 --> 00:47:54,690
Same place we were.
It's the only thing on this road.

538
00:48:05,612 --> 00:48:07,125
My God!

539
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:15,921
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

540
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:18,810
When you fly with nuclear weapons,
you're trained...

541
00:48:18,892 --> 00:48:22,646
..to retrieve if possible,
disable if necessary, destroy if essential.

542
00:48:22,732 --> 00:48:24,245
What are we doing?

543
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,323
I'm gonna disable it.

544
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:32,201
You have to arm these things with a code.

545
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:35,568
If you enter the wrong code three times,
the nuke goes dead.

546
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:38,724
All the circuitry shuts down and shorts out.

547
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:43,363
Pretty soon these things'll be
nothing more than paperweights.

548
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:44,601
(bleeping)

549
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,123
Hale! Pick up!

550
00:48:51,772 --> 00:48:53,444
Pick up!

551
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:56,601
Come on, buddy. Pick up the phone.

552
00:48:57,132 --> 00:48:59,123
Buddy, huh?

553
00:48:59,212 --> 00:49:02,409
Son of a bitch!
You tried to kill me! Friendship is over.

554
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:04,448
That doesn't mean I don't like you.

555
00:49:04,532 --> 00:49:06,284
Hell, I'm impressed!

556
00:49:06,372 --> 00:49:09,250
I figured you'd have packed up
and walked off by now.

557
00:49:09,332 --> 00:49:11,892
Well, you figured wrong.
Now I get the nukes.

558
00:49:11,972 --> 00:49:14,361
Guess what, Deak?
I'm gonna deactivate 'em.

559
00:49:14,812 --> 00:49:17,804
- (buttons bleep)
- I'm punching in the wrong codes.

560
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:21,407
Pretty soon these things
are gonna be absolutely useless.

561
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:23,130
You might as well drive away.

562
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,772
Outstanding, Hale! That's the spirit!

563
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,487
Damn! I'm totallyscrewednow!

564
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:32,046
Unless, of course,
I'd already thought ofthat.

565
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:39,010
What?

566
00:49:39,772 --> 00:49:41,763
You're kidding!

567
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,403
Didn't work, did it?

568
00:49:44,492 --> 00:49:46,642
I used uncoded circuit boards.

569
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:50,202
Youjustactivateda nuclear warhead,
my friend.

570
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:53,921
Setting offa nuke in this mine
has been in the plan from day one.

571
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:58,164
Otherwise, some DC civilian
might saylhaven'tgot the guts.

572
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:01,647
Fuck!

573
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,283
He's insane!

574
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:07,408
Hale, I considered bringing you in on this.

575
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:10,689
- You know whyl didn't?
- Because I would've said no?

576
00:50:10,772 --> 00:50:12,763
Nah. Then I'dhavejustkilledyou.

577
00:50:12,852 --> 00:50:14,968
I was afraid that you would say yes.

578
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:18,169
Because you don't have the balls
to go through with this.

579
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:19,367
We both know that.

580
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,085
- How deep is this mine?
- Uh...

581
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:27,643
About 2,000 feet.

582
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,444
That's plenty.

583
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:34,650
I'm gonna be there in a few minutes.
My advice to you is to get out now.

584
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:36,688
It's your last move, buddy.

585
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:41,004
I can think of another move, Deak.
I'm gonna keep these things together.

586
00:50:41,092 --> 00:50:44,562
If one goes off, the other gets buried
under a billion tons of rock.

587
00:50:44,652 --> 00:50:48,611
- How's thatsound, huh?
- You wouldn't do that.

588
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:51,843
Are you sure about that,... buddy?

589
00:50:52,732 --> 00:50:54,609
Shit! Fuck! He's gonna do it!

590
00:50:54,692 --> 00:50:56,125
Let's get 'em!

591
00:50:56,212 --> 00:50:59,488
All right.
We gotta be gone before he gets here.

592
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:08,723
I can't do this!

593
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:11,565
Listen, you told me
this is a copper mine, right?

594
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,051
- Right?
- Right.

595
00:51:13,412 --> 00:51:17,291
The blast will fuse this place
into one big, solid, copper pot.

596
00:51:17,372 --> 00:51:18,930
- But they're coming!
- That's right.

597
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:22,448
If I don't get these things
down to a safe level first,...

598
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:24,648
..God knows where he'll use them.

599
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,687
Just keep an eye on the timer, okay?

600
00:51:52,732 --> 00:51:54,245
All right.

601
00:52:29,492 --> 00:52:31,483
(low rumbling)

602
00:52:38,212 --> 00:52:40,203
What is that noise?

603
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:44,887
Water. There's an underground river
beneath this place.

604
00:52:44,972 --> 00:52:47,361
All right, let's get these unloaded.

605
00:53:14,212 --> 00:53:16,123
I understand, sir.

606
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:20,205
I'll advise NEST and as soon as they confirm
the ground is clean,...

607
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:23,489
..l'll send in a dozen gunships.
We'll secure the area.

608
00:53:23,572 --> 00:53:25,369
Yes, sir.

609
00:53:26,772 --> 00:53:29,286
Giles Prentice, sir.
I got here as soon as I could.

610
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,647
- Wilkins. Good to meet you.
- Likewise, sir.

611
00:53:31,732 --> 00:53:34,530
That was the chairman, Mr Prentice.

612
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:38,364
According to an NSA radio intercept,
you were right.

613
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:41,603
But it's Deakins stealing the nukes.
Not Hale.

614
00:53:58,812 --> 00:54:00,689
(Terry) Now what?

615
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:03,570
Now we get outta here before he shows up.

616
00:54:20,652 --> 00:54:22,643
How many times do I have to say it?

617
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:25,485
Please don't shoot the nuclear weapons.

618
00:55:07,532 --> 00:55:11,445
Kelly! We've found the nuke.
We're at the end oftunnel A.

619
00:55:11,532 --> 00:55:14,365
Put the cold one on the elevator.
We'll be right along.

620
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:24,323
A service tunnel! Come on!

621
00:55:25,412 --> 00:55:27,767
Make sure Hale doesn't get back to the bomb.

622
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:29,771
And, Johnson...

623
00:55:29,852 --> 00:55:31,808
The clock is ticking.

624
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:39,081
Hm...

625
00:55:56,932 --> 00:55:59,924
- Where are you taking us?
- Back to the elevator.

626
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:02,970
These service tunnels
run between the main shafts.

627
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:05,407
Now, ifwe take the next right...

628
00:56:06,132 --> 00:56:07,167
(Terry screams)

629
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:20,285
Hey, Hale!

630
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,444
Nice move with the nukes!
Shows initiative,...

631
00:56:23,532 --> 00:56:25,921
..determination. Proud ofya!

632
00:56:26,572 --> 00:56:28,722
But I think I gave us all too much time.

633
00:56:28,812 --> 00:56:31,201
30 whole minutes? I don't know...

634
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:34,170
Shows a lack oftotal commitment,
don't you think?

635
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:35,890
I took it down to 13.

636
00:56:39,652 --> 00:56:41,643
I'll be right back.

637
00:56:53,572 --> 00:56:55,563
(gun clicks)

638
00:57:57,012 --> 00:57:58,081
All set.

639
00:57:58,172 --> 00:58:00,163
We'll be right along.

640
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,523
(Terry) Are you okay?

641
00:59:11,892 --> 00:59:14,008
(Deakins) Well,... I gotta go.

642
00:59:14,812 --> 00:59:17,406
You two have a nice time down here.

643
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:23,446
And, uh... don't forget to say hi
to Johnson for me when you see him.

644
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:26,524
I got 20 bucks that says
you're gonna see him first.

645
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:28,603
- Really?
- Yeah.

646
00:59:28,692 --> 00:59:31,809
You're gonna ransom Salt Lake City,
aren't you?

647
00:59:31,892 --> 00:59:35,089
- Well, why do you say that?
- St Jude's Hospital?

648
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:37,527
You'll hide the warheads in Radiology...

649
00:59:37,612 --> 00:59:40,570
..so they don't show up
on any satellite scans. Right?

650
00:59:40,652 --> 00:59:44,042
- Huh! Well, I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

651
00:59:44,532 --> 00:59:47,205
- So how much will you ask for?
- Lots.

652
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,967
I got a broker in Stockholm
who's gonna buy me 5% ofVolvo.

653
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:54,442
For the rest of my years,
I'm gonna live offthe dividends,...

654
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:56,523
..happy in the knowledge...

655
00:59:56,612 --> 01:00:00,207
..that I'm helping to make
the safest automobiles in the world.

656
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,601
So that's what this is all about?
The money?

657
01:00:02,692 --> 01:00:04,171
(chuckles) Yeah.

658
01:00:04,252 --> 01:00:05,810
Bullshit.

659
01:00:05,892 --> 01:00:08,531
Well, look, you tell me why. Go ahead.

660
01:00:09,052 --> 01:00:10,610
You tell me why.

661
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:13,684
Because you've been passed over
for promotion so often...

662
01:00:13,772 --> 01:00:16,002
..you wanna show the bastards you're right!

663
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:19,721
Maybe it's because
everybody's cashing out, so why not you?

664
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:20,961
Fuck...

665
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:23,566
Or your mother dropped you
on your head as a baby.

666
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:25,210
Who the hell cares, Deak?

667
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:29,251
There's no difference between you
and a guy who shoots up a school yard.

668
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:31,562
You both got a head full of bad wiring!

669
01:00:31,652 --> 01:00:34,644
- What was that?
- You're fucked in the head, Deak!

670
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:37,645
Hah!

671
01:00:38,532 --> 01:00:40,523
I pissed him off.

672
01:00:52,092 --> 01:00:54,083
It's this way!

673
01:01:04,012 --> 01:01:06,731
Hey, hey, hey!
Where the hell's the other one?

674
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:08,609
Shut up!

675
01:01:14,852 --> 01:01:16,285
Help us. Come on!

676
01:01:21,972 --> 01:01:23,963
(clattering)

677
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:38,605
(Pritchett) Get the goddamn thing in!
Let's get outta here!

678
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,723
That was the only way out.

679
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:47,769
Man...

680
01:01:48,332 --> 01:01:50,448
Well, that's it, then, isn't it?

681
01:02:08,772 --> 01:02:10,763
You have any family?

682
01:02:12,972 --> 01:02:15,042
No... Just me and Fred.

683
01:02:16,572 --> 01:02:19,370
Fred... Who's Fred, your boyfriend?

684
01:02:19,972 --> 01:02:21,610
No, my dog.

685
01:02:24,652 --> 01:02:26,165
The river!

686
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:28,963
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

687
01:02:29,052 --> 01:02:32,328
They... they... hit it,
uh... digging a tunnel!

688
01:02:32,412 --> 01:02:34,880
That's why they shut down the mine!

689
01:02:34,972 --> 01:02:36,405
Come on!

690
01:02:57,052 --> 01:02:59,612
Hang on! Four minutes to detonation.

691
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,126
You stupid bastard! We'll all be killed!

692
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,009
We'll be fine, Mr Pritchett.

693
01:03:04,092 --> 01:03:07,607
And will you please keep your voice down?
I'm concentrating.

694
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,363
This should be it!

695
01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:37,602
This thing doesn't go anywhere.

696
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:39,649
Ohh!

697
01:03:48,012 --> 01:03:49,809
One o'clock! On the road!

698
01:03:53,772 --> 01:03:55,763
(gasping)

699
01:04:08,332 --> 01:04:10,800
Attention! We are federalagents!

700
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:12,769
Stop your vehicle immediately!

701
01:04:12,852 --> 01:04:14,444
Oh, God! Oh, God!

702
01:04:14,532 --> 01:04:17,968
How does that gunship
fit into your grand strategy?

703
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:20,202
You don't know what you're doing.

704
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:23,364
This is out of control! I must have been...

705
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:26,283
(gagging)

706
01:04:27,132 --> 01:04:28,645
Hush! Hush!

707
01:04:29,172 --> 01:04:30,890
Stop your vehicle!

708
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:33,486
I repeat!
Stop your vehicle immediately!

709
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:45,250
Swing around in front of 'em!

710
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:54,406
Do notmove oryou willbe fired upon!

711
01:04:55,412 --> 01:04:56,322
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

712
01:04:56,412 --> 01:04:58,562
We are federalagents!

713
01:04:58,652 --> 01:05:00,608
Throw down your weapons...

714
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,683
..and keep yourhands in sight!

715
01:05:24,052 --> 01:05:26,122
I just realised something.

716
01:05:26,212 --> 01:05:28,680
I never actually killed anyone before.

717
01:05:28,772 --> 01:05:32,447
I mean, I dropped bombs on Baghdad,...

718
01:05:32,532 --> 01:05:34,682
..but... never face to face.

719
01:05:35,052 --> 01:05:38,965
I don't know what the big deal is.
I really don't.

720
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:45,286
Turn your electronic equipment off now.

721
01:05:45,372 --> 01:05:46,691
Throw down your weapons!

722
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:27,136
All right!

723
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:30,303
We're losing power!

724
01:06:30,385 --> 01:06:31,579
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

725
01:06:40,945 --> 01:06:42,901
We've gone red! Triple red! All out!

726
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,543
Wahoo!

727
01:06:57,465 --> 01:06:59,296
I say, goddamn! What a rush!

728
01:07:02,945 --> 01:07:03,934
Whoo!

729
01:07:04,025 --> 01:07:07,574
Son of a bitch!
Shock wave took down the damn chopper!

730
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:11,863
That's EMP. Electromagnetic pulse.
A nuclear blast sends it out for miles.

731
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:15,301
Anything electronic shuts down
including choppers and radios.

732
01:07:15,385 --> 01:07:18,058
We just shut down
McMurran's field communications!

733
01:07:18,145 --> 01:07:21,979
That'll put a pretty little dent
in their response time, huh?

734
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:24,499
- Deak, you the man!
- I'm the man!

735
01:07:24,585 --> 01:07:27,258
Colonel Wilkins, sir?
Shouldn't we be evacuating?

736
01:07:27,345 --> 01:07:29,222
We're fine. It was underground.

737
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:32,263
- Colonel Wilkins for General Creely.
- How do you know?

738
01:07:32,345 --> 01:07:36,338
With a surface detonation we'd have
felt a different kind of ground tremor.

739
01:07:36,425 --> 01:07:38,985
We'd also be burned, blind, and dying.

740
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:43,577
We're ten minutes behind.

741
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:45,895
Mr Pritchett,
would you mind stepping outside?

742
01:07:58,225 --> 01:08:00,295
It went off underground, thank God!

743
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:02,376
What do we do now?

744
01:08:02,465 --> 01:08:05,775
First, we nail a huge goddamn lid
on this thing.

745
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:08,538
And with all due respect to your boy Giles...

746
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:11,617
..and his belief
that honesty is the best policy,...

747
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:14,299
..from now until the end ofthe world,...

748
01:08:14,385 --> 01:08:17,695
..what happened in Utah today
was an earthquake.

749
01:08:51,905 --> 01:08:54,135
Hey! It's okay...

750
01:08:54,225 --> 01:08:57,422
- My God! We set off a nuclear bomb!
- The walls shielded the blast.

751
01:08:57,545 --> 01:09:00,105
None ofthe radiation leaked out.
We're all right!

752
01:09:00,185 --> 01:09:02,301
Look at my hands! Why are they shaking?

753
01:09:02,385 --> 01:09:04,376
Because the water was freezing.

754
01:09:04,465 --> 01:09:07,935
- No, that's not normal!
- It's okay. You're just cold.

755
01:09:08,785 --> 01:09:10,980
You just need to get warm, okay?

756
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,217
All right?

757
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:19,143
Hey, look!
You see the butterflies there?

758
01:09:19,865 --> 01:09:23,653
If there was radiation around,
they wouldn't survive, would they?

759
01:09:23,745 --> 01:09:25,019
No.

760
01:09:25,105 --> 01:09:27,096
Well...

761
01:09:27,665 --> 01:09:29,860
- Right?
- I guess not.

762
01:09:33,505 --> 01:09:36,019
It says in the, uh... detonation manual...

763
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:40,417
..that ifyou see butterflies after detonation,
you're gonna be fine.

764
01:09:41,425 --> 01:09:42,778
Okay?

765
01:09:45,065 --> 01:09:47,056
It doesn't say that!

766
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:50,061
I promise you that we're fine.

767
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,578
How far down the riverbank
does this path go?

768
01:09:58,665 --> 01:10:00,178
Three or four miles.

769
01:10:00,585 --> 01:10:04,260
We should be able to get to Deakins
before he gets outta here.

770
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:19,384
Wait!

771
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,744
Hey!

772
01:10:25,825 --> 01:10:28,385
- There's just two ofthem.
- (man) Running late!

773
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:32,253
- (truck)
- There's more coming.

774
01:10:32,345 --> 01:10:34,142
(tyres screech)

775
01:10:40,145 --> 01:10:43,376
Hey! I thought you said
Hale wouldn't be a problem.

776
01:10:43,465 --> 01:10:47,458
Yeah, well, he surprised me, too,
but he's dead, so let's go.

777
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:37,504
Sink it?

778
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:39,143
Steal it.

779
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:53,300
(man) Let's move it!

780
01:11:53,385 --> 01:11:55,853
- They're coming!
- Get out ofthe boat!

781
01:11:55,945 --> 01:11:57,344
Get out ofthe boat!

782
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:30,898
Your friends in Washington
should be getting the package about now.

783
01:12:30,985 --> 01:12:34,898
Yep. I'm sure we got
their full and complete attention.

784
01:12:34,985 --> 01:12:36,259
Let's move it!

785
01:12:36,345 --> 01:12:39,257
- We're on a tight schedule!
- (engine starts)

786
01:13:12,345 --> 01:13:15,417
$250 million by 14:00, Utah time.

787
01:13:15,505 --> 01:13:17,735
This deadline is notnegotiable.

788
01:13:17,825 --> 01:13:19,816
The second device is on a timer.

789
01:13:19,905 --> 01:13:23,375
Shortly afteryou receive this,
the timer willbe activated.

790
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,296
At 14:01, I willmake a call.

791
01:13:25,385 --> 01:13:27,945
Iflfindyou've complied,
I willstop the timer.

792
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:29,936
Ifyou have not...

793
01:13:56,825 --> 01:14:00,056
- Yes. Yes, sir, I understand.
- (phone rings)

794
01:14:00,985 --> 01:14:03,135
- Creely.
- Please hold the line, sir.

795
01:14:04,265 --> 01:14:07,940
The President is asking
if we know where the device is headed.

796
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:11,574
If Deakins had a plane,
it could be anywhere. We just don't know.

797
01:14:11,665 --> 01:14:12,654
I do.

798
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:14,898
One moment, sir.

799
01:14:14,985 --> 01:14:18,978
General, they've found Captain Hale.
He's atLake Powell.

800
01:14:37,225 --> 01:14:39,500
This is a really bad idea!

801
01:15:14,065 --> 01:15:16,579
- Sir! The prisoner is secure!
- Good job, Tom!

802
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:19,133
You gentlemen can RTB.
I'll take it from here.

803
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:21,181
Roger, sir. Returning to base!

804
01:15:21,265 --> 01:15:23,654
They found the raft
on the other side ofthe lake.

805
01:15:23,745 --> 01:15:27,420
Tracks from a heavy truck
ran out when they hit the paved road.

806
01:15:28,345 --> 01:15:30,984
- What about the girl?
- What about her?

807
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:33,579
What about her!
She's an innocent victim in this.

808
01:15:33,665 --> 01:15:36,463
I got her involved.
When you guys find that truck,...

809
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:38,376
..you'll hit it with everything!

810
01:15:38,465 --> 01:15:40,774
I don't want her becoming a casualty.

811
01:15:40,865 --> 01:15:43,504
Maybe it's okay with you,
but we're military officers.

812
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,382
We took an oath.

813
01:15:45,465 --> 01:15:49,060
As officers, we have a responsibility
to save that woman's life...

814
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:51,136
..and get back the weapon.

815
01:15:51,225 --> 01:15:54,934
I have a responsibility to follow orders
and return you to McMurran.

816
01:15:55,025 --> 01:15:58,734
- Do you understand orders, Captain?
- Yes, sir. I do.

817
01:15:59,185 --> 01:16:00,379
Good.

818
01:16:05,825 --> 01:16:07,816
Because I'm about to break them.

819
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:13,695
Any argument, Mr Prentice?

820
01:16:13,785 --> 01:16:15,696
No, sir.

821
01:16:17,185 --> 01:16:20,063
Just for the record,
I'm not entirely a civilian.

822
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:24,218
I was actually a lieutenant
in the ROTC at Yale.

823
01:16:26,825 --> 01:16:28,816
Good for you, Lieutenant.

824
01:16:32,305 --> 01:16:34,296
(Wilkins) ls the radio still down?

825
01:16:34,385 --> 01:16:37,616
Afraid so. Your chopper
will be refuelled in two minutes.

826
01:16:37,705 --> 01:16:39,696
I wish I were going with you.

827
01:16:39,785 --> 01:16:42,140
Captain, what exactly are you looking for?

828
01:16:42,225 --> 01:16:43,738
Tracks.

829
01:16:43,825 --> 01:16:45,895
As in railroad tracks.

830
01:16:45,985 --> 01:16:48,977
Deak knows you'll cover
every inch of asphalt north of here.

831
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:51,499
I'll bet 20 bucks that nuke is on a train.

832
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:53,822
Let's see the map.

833
01:16:53,905 --> 01:16:57,739
All right. Salt Lake is northwest of here.
These tracks curve east first.

834
01:16:57,825 --> 01:17:00,339
- Why would he do that?
- He's not going to Salt Lake.

835
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:05,224
But you found the radiology tag
from the hospital.

836
01:17:05,305 --> 01:17:08,422
That's what's been bothering me.
I think he planted it.

837
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:12,293
He wanted whoever found it
to think that's where he was heading.

838
01:17:12,385 --> 01:17:14,899
- He's doing a rope-a-dope!
- He's doing a what?

839
01:17:14,985 --> 01:17:17,374
Rope-a-dope.
You know? It's a boxing term.

840
01:17:17,465 --> 01:17:19,456
Ali and Foreman in Zaire?

841
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:22,218
Captain, I know what it is.
What's your point?

842
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:26,696
If everything he shows us says west,
he's actually heading east.

843
01:17:28,305 --> 01:17:30,023
Denver.

844
01:17:31,505 --> 01:17:34,417
You said you had Salt Lake
sealed up pretty tight.

845
01:17:34,505 --> 01:17:36,973
What's gonna hurt
if we check out Denver?

846
01:17:55,385 --> 01:17:56,898
- Shepherd!
- Hey, Deak!

847
01:17:56,985 --> 01:18:00,022
- Any trouble with the train crew?
- They went like lambs.

848
01:18:00,105 --> 01:18:02,460
Good. Let's get that satellite dish wired in.

849
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:04,900
- Already done.
- Excellent!

850
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:08,136
With this remote
you can shut the bomb down face to face,...

851
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,375
..or you can dial it in over the link.

852
01:18:10,465 --> 01:18:12,421
All right, let's close this deal.

853
01:18:12,505 --> 01:18:15,019
Shepherd, I want to be airborne
in five minutes.

854
01:18:15,105 --> 01:18:18,575
Kelly, contact Washington
and tell them the bomb's going to Denver.

855
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:22,294
Then contact Geneva. When the money's
there, I'll shut down our puppy.

856
01:18:22,385 --> 01:18:25,457
Smile, boys! We're about to retire!

857
01:18:25,545 --> 01:18:27,581
Let's get this bird unwrapped!

858
01:19:01,265 --> 01:19:03,256
We haven't met. I'm Max!

859
01:19:12,385 --> 01:19:14,945
You probably thought
I was a computer nerd.

860
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:17,141
(laughs) Wrong!

861
01:19:17,225 --> 01:19:18,897
I was a Navy SEAL, lady.

862
01:19:18,985 --> 01:19:22,102
You should see what I can do...
with just my thumb.

863
01:19:56,865 --> 01:19:57,980
(gun cocked)

864
01:20:14,825 --> 01:20:17,703
You just saved me $3 million.
I owe you one.

865
01:20:17,785 --> 01:20:19,980
Shoot yourself. We'll call it square.

866
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,056
Whoa! Attitude!

867
01:20:24,385 --> 01:20:26,819
Now, where's my little buddy Hale?

868
01:20:27,545 --> 01:20:29,536
He left you alone, didn't he?

869
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:33,015
Well, that's his speed - 100% pussy.

870
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:35,980
He's got more guts than you think.

871
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:37,817
(chuckles)

872
01:20:37,905 --> 01:20:40,738
But would he have enough guts
to eat a bullet...

873
01:20:40,825 --> 01:20:44,022
..before he'd help someone
vaporise a whole city?

874
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:46,741
I think he'd fold. But not you.

875
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:49,899
I think you've got more guts than he does.

876
01:20:49,985 --> 01:20:52,215
I think you'd eat a bullet.

877
01:20:57,505 --> 01:20:59,496
Let's find out!

878
01:21:01,105 --> 01:21:03,061
Now, press four...

879
01:21:03,945 --> 01:21:05,936
Ooh!

880
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:13,056
I said push four.

881
01:21:15,665 --> 01:21:17,576
Go ahead.

882
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:19,656
Push four!

883
01:21:24,745 --> 01:21:26,576
Ah...

884
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:27,734
Four.

885
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,576
Eight.

886
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:35,698
Seven.

887
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:38,944
Go ahead.

888
01:21:39,025 --> 01:21:41,016
- Please...
- Seven.

889
01:21:44,225 --> 01:21:47,740
Starting at ground zero
and moving out in concentric circles,...

890
01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:50,293
..we have, in terms of immediate effect,...

891
01:21:50,385 --> 01:21:52,660
..100% fatalities to 30 miles,...

892
01:21:52,745 --> 01:21:57,660
..90% at 40 miles, dropping roughly 10%
for every 10 miles after that.

893
01:21:58,225 --> 01:22:00,022
Two.

894
01:22:01,785 --> 01:22:03,457
One.

895
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:08,501
Enter.

896
01:22:09,465 --> 01:22:11,456
Enter...

897
01:22:11,905 --> 01:22:13,896
We estimate...

898
01:22:14,345 --> 01:22:16,939
..250,000 dead on impact,...

899
01:22:17,025 --> 01:22:20,734
..with another quarter million
projected within the year.

900
01:22:25,185 --> 01:22:26,777
Enter.

901
01:22:26,865 --> 01:22:28,981
Come on. Just push Enter and it's done.

902
01:22:32,825 --> 01:22:34,816
Which is it gonna be, hm?

903
01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:40,576
Ah! Mm...

904
01:22:41,705 --> 01:22:45,175
You know, to tell the truth,
I thought you were gonna fold.

905
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:47,984
Well, I'm dead either way,...

906
01:22:48,065 --> 01:22:50,738
..so do it yourself, asshole.

907
01:22:53,945 --> 01:22:55,742
Open the door!

908
01:22:59,505 --> 01:23:01,143
Night-night, honey!

909
01:23:44,465 --> 01:23:46,979
- Cover me!
- Good luck!

910
01:23:52,745 --> 01:23:54,736
Bring it in!

911
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:18,737
Gimme your hand!

912
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:33,060
Okay! You can come!

913
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:40,139
Get me down there now!

914
01:24:53,065 --> 01:24:55,420
Let's give those guys a haircut!

915
01:25:01,065 --> 01:25:01,941
Shit!

916
01:25:02,025 --> 01:25:03,140
Get down!

917
01:25:14,105 --> 01:25:15,299
Freeze!

918
01:25:42,985 --> 01:25:44,418
Wow!

919
01:25:44,505 --> 01:25:46,461
That was a first for me, too!

920
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:55,182
This is where you two get off!

921
01:27:06,865 --> 01:27:07,980
No!

922
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,500
- We're leaving now!
- Yes, sir!

923
01:27:52,065 --> 01:27:53,817
- Where's Shepherd?
- He should be here.

924
01:27:53,905 --> 01:27:54,860
Find him!

925
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:11,893
Cut the power!

926
01:28:28,065 --> 01:28:30,056
Goddamn you, Hale!

927
01:28:34,905 --> 01:28:38,693
We'll never get clear in time.
We need to shut down the nuke.

928
01:28:38,785 --> 01:28:41,094
You hear me? You need to disarm it!

929
01:28:41,185 --> 01:28:43,176
Find Hale!

930
01:29:07,225 --> 01:29:09,102
Oh, God! Your shoulder...

931
01:29:09,185 --> 01:29:11,096
Help me offwith this!

932
01:29:11,505 --> 01:29:12,984
Oh, God!

933
01:29:30,185 --> 01:29:34,463
No matter what happens,
this train can't make it to the city.

934
01:29:34,545 --> 01:29:38,618
You stay here and uncouple the car.
I'm gonna go after Deakins.

935
01:29:40,905 --> 01:29:42,736
I'll see you soon.

936
01:29:42,825 --> 01:29:44,304
You promise?

937
01:30:01,465 --> 01:30:03,535
Fuck 'em ifthey can't take ajoke.

938
01:30:13,385 --> 01:30:14,977
What the fuck are you doin'!

939
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:41,980
Shut that son of a bitch down! Now!

940
01:30:42,065 --> 01:30:44,021
This ain't what I signed on for!

941
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,300
I'm not ready to die! Not for you!

942
01:30:47,265 --> 01:30:50,780
Everybody dies, Kelly.
I'm as good a reason as any.

943
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:56,934
Come on! Come on!

944
01:30:59,545 --> 01:31:00,580
Hale!

945
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:05,096
Incoming!

946
01:31:11,425 --> 01:31:13,939
(screams)

947
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:35,140
Come on out, Deak! It's over!

948
01:31:50,745 --> 01:31:52,736
(Deakins laughs)

949
01:31:55,305 --> 01:31:57,102
You lose.

950
01:31:57,185 --> 01:31:59,221
I've still got my finger on the trigger.

951
01:32:00,425 --> 01:32:04,259
That's the remote trigger.
You see, if I press this button here,...

952
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:05,744
..you lose.

953
01:32:07,145 --> 01:32:09,181
And if I push this button,...

954
01:32:09,665 --> 01:32:12,133
..the weapon is disarmed.

955
01:32:12,385 --> 01:32:14,376
Why don't you disarm it, then?

956
01:32:14,945 --> 01:32:16,856
I'm not in the mood.

957
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:18,583
Now, get rid ofyour weapon.

958
01:32:19,065 --> 01:32:21,056
Get rid ofyour weapon!

959
01:32:23,145 --> 01:32:24,578
Come on!

960
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:29,899
Attaboy!

961
01:32:29,985 --> 01:32:33,136
You can shut it down.
You just have to come and get it.

962
01:32:33,225 --> 01:32:36,103
And $20 that I took from you last night...

963
01:32:36,865 --> 01:32:38,856
..says that you won't.

964
01:32:42,065 --> 01:32:44,056
You're out ofyour mind!

965
01:32:44,145 --> 01:32:46,420
Yeah! Ain't it cool?

966
01:32:46,505 --> 01:32:48,860
I'm serious, Deak.
Your mind has gone offthe map.

967
01:32:48,945 --> 01:32:52,335
Maybe, but I'm still gonna kick your ass.

968
01:33:05,025 --> 01:33:07,823
You're bleeding, aren't ya?
Well, that's good!

969
01:33:07,905 --> 01:33:10,817
Let's see ifwe can't get any more out,
all righty?

970
01:33:32,345 --> 01:33:33,539
(presses buttons)

971
01:34:00,345 --> 01:34:02,734
Used to be, every fight went to a knockout.

972
01:34:02,825 --> 01:34:04,941
You know what a knockout feels like?

973
01:34:24,505 --> 01:34:28,054
Your brain presses against your skull
and it feels like this!

974
01:35:16,785 --> 01:35:18,264
Does it feel like that?

975
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:56,694
(bleep)

976
01:37:21,465 --> 01:37:23,342
I win.

977
01:37:23,425 --> 01:37:25,700
Sir, please turn around.

978
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:50,896
My name's Riley Hale.

979
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:53,816
Terry Carmichael.

980
01:37:54,225 --> 01:37:56,022
(Hale) Pleased to meet you.

981
01:37:56,105 --> 01:37:58,573
(Terry) You know,
you're still under arrest, Captain.

982
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:01,657
Oh, yeah?
I guess you'd better take me in.

983
01:38:02,345 --> 01:38:04,540
