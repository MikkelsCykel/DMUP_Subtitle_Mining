1
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,451
Give me more!

2
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,704
Come on, honey, get it all off!

3
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,124
Come on, let me stand up
for queen and country.

4
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,379
Come on, show us what you got!

5
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,381
Come on, honey, all of it!

6
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,466
There you go, all of it!

7
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,051
And the dress!

8
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,430
Come on, babe!

9
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,777
If one more person calls me "babe"...

10
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,081
Mr. Santos, your package has arrived.

11
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,501
-My special order?
-Under lock and key.

12
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,004
-What about the new dancer?
-Who?

13
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,882
The blonde with the guns.

14
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,926
If she's more to your pleasing,

15
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,097
it's her first night, and I
haven't had a chance to feel her out.

16
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,142
But you'll be very pleased
with the special order.

17
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,644
She's as tender as Tuscan veal.

18
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,783
How's the crowd, honey?

19
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,746
Wet!

20
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,876
-Come again?
-She's Chinese.

21
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,346
Very well done.

22
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,473
They loved you.

23
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,185
I'd like to talk to you...
about coming back.

24
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,687
In my office.

25
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,273
I'll be waiting for you.

26
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,192
Sure thing, big boy.

27
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,937
What are you doing here?

28
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,106
Looking for a light.

29
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,278
Got one?

30
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,032
I don't smoke.

31
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,415
Neither do I.

32
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,552
Who are you?

33
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,929
I'm the one who's getting you
out of here. Trust me.

34
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,558
-Right this way, Mr. Santos.
-Shit! Come on.

35
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,732
Go!

36
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,529
Minka.

37
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,553
-What are you doing?
-Ever seen "Batman"?

38
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:28,971
No, I can't.

39
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,890
No!

40
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,183
No!

41
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,979
Shut up!

42
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,362
Goddamn it!

43
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,718
Here's your little pride and joy.

44
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,805
Thank you.

45
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,265
Thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

46
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,851
We thought
we'd never see our little girl again.

47
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,436
Thank you.

48
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,939
Cut the shit! Where's my money?

49
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,401
Honey, pay this woman.

50
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,946
I'm afraid
there's been a slight problem.

51
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,657
I could only come up
with half the money.

52
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,867
Half the money?

53
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,663
-Fine... I'll take half your daughter.
-Wait.

54
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,457
I'm sure, we can negotiate something.

55
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,176
The car plus the cash...

56
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,220
Not a bad night's work.

57
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,850
It was the middle
of the second American Civil War.

58
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,185
The world had gone to hell.

59
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,897
The year was 2017,
the worst year of my life.

60
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,150
There was only one free city:

61
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,612
And that's where I lived
for three years... port Steel Harbor.

62
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,198
What a shithole!

63
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,254
Why don't we start again?

64
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,132
From the beginning.

65
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,760
I told you...
I told you everything I know.

66
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,179
I told you.

67
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,306
Line's cleared up on screen one,
Colonel.

68
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,516
Image is present.

69
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,312
Image is recording.

70
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,732
Citizen, I... I abhor torture.

71
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,319
But your words
just don't match your thoughts.

72
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,197
There are too many details
that you're just not sharing.

73
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,158
Our little mind-reading device
doesn't lie.

74
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,538
Reset sensors.

75
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,463
Now,
where's doctor Corrina Devonshire?

76
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,298
No! No!

77
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,149
She's going to Steel Harbor,
the free city.

78
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,779
Can you tell me,
why Cora D. is going to Steel Harbor?

79
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,198
She's meeting
members of the resistance.

80
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,201
They're giving her the retinal lenses.

81
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,704
Helping her out of the country.
To Canada.

82
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,000
She's with a freedom fighter...
named Axel.

83
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,878
Who has the retinal lenses now?

84
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,088
Krebs.

85
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,882
William Krebs.

86
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,301
How are they
getting her into the city?

87
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,263
She's had plastic surgery.

88
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,974
Her face is changed.

89
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,934
You won't recognize her.

90
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,854
-You'll never find her.
-You're so beautiful.

91
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,982
I'm sorry.

92
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,359
Colonel Pryzer,
Executive Council on line two.

93
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,611
Tell him to hold.

94
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,082
Put him on.

95
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,963
Colonel Pryzer... any word yet
on our traitorous doctor, Cora D.?

96
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,258
I'm not gonna pander
to that mythic name bullshit.

97
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:39,013
Doctor Devonshire still poses
quite a problem to the Congressionals.

98
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,309
Her escape may jeopardize
our strongest defensive action yet.

99
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,352
I'm fully aware of that, citizen.

100
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:50,441
Doctor Devonshire was privy to some of
the most sensitive military secrets.

101
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,194
Her DNA holds the antidote
to our greatest biochemical weapon.

102
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,197
She must be captured alive
at any cost.

103
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,408
I'll take care of your problem.

104
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,910
I'll get my hands dirty for you again.

105
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,330
I wouldn't be cleaning up your mess

106
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,082
if youâ€™d stopped her from escaping
Washington in the first place.

107
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,294
Well, I...

108
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,922
I had no direct knowledge
of that operation.

109
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,509
Of course, it was a vital part
of our contract to...

110
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,847
Save it for the U.N.
Doctor Corrina Devonshire, Cora D.,

111
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,976
whatever she calls herself,
it really doesn't matter...

112
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,270
She belongs to me.

113
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,648
She's connecting
with a resistance contact named Krebs.

114
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,359
He has the lenses

115
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,819
and will be helping her
leave the Congressional territories.

116
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,655
They're meeting in the free city,
Steel Harbor.

117
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,034
I'll contact
their local authorities immediately.

118
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,620
You see, I do my homework, citizen.

119
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,056
It's them. Let's go.

120
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,690
-Which one of you is Krebs?
-We meet him later.

121
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,319
Hurry.

122
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,622
I said, get to the back of the line!

123
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,840
-I'll take those weapons.
-Don't lose the clip.

124
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,883
Don't worry about it.

125
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,783
Dry martinis and a Cuban cigar.

126
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,035
You got it.

127
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,089
Bubbly on the house!

128
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,020
Please, leave it out.

129
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,192
Excuse me. Curly!

130
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,487
I'm still waiting
to hear from Miss Wire.

131
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,739
I conveyed your offer to her.

132
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,618
1500 Dollars to chop off
the legs of your ex-partner.

133
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,830
You must be joking.
Naturally she declined.

134
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,958
Miss Wire doesn't accept
this kind of job.

135
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,585
Please!

136
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,965
What?
My money's not good enough for her?

137
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,677
I will make my offer in person!

138
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,764
-If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
-Why?

139
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:13,936
Her private secretary Camille doesn't
have you in her appointment book.

140
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,105
-And she can be very mean.
-Let me through.

141
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,068
-You see?
- Time for a couple of dedications.

142
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,531
To Bobby from Colleen... The test
came back and everything's cool.

143
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,867
And from Samantha to Cal...
"You thieving murderous bastard!

144
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,788
If I ever see you again, I'll rip out
your eyes and pluck off your ears."

145
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,541
Damn, if that just don't thug
at my heart strings.

146
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,086
Now, here's a little rhythm
for you heartsick boys and girls.

147
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,673
Chanel No. 5. Am I correct?

148
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,675
Yes, you are.

149
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,762
When I smelled it,
I thought to myself...

150
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,683
"Charlie, now this is obviously
a woman of significant breeding."

151
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,810
And then I thought...

152
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,688
"I wonder if she'd like to do some?"

153
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,817
Breeding, that is. What do you
think about that, sweetheart?

154
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,236
Who are you talking to?

155
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,990
Some chick.

156
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,535
Where's your mercurial sister?

157
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,621
Why don't you try the office?

158
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,583
And when you see her,
tell her I only had two.

159
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,172
Okay, whatever you say, Charlie.

160
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,091
That's my boy.

161
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,856
Goddamn. Customs police.

162
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,527
Stay put. We'll handle this.

163
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,205
Where's your ID?

164
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,709
-Something feels wrong.
-This is making me very nervous.

165
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,545
Look,
we just stick with the plan, okay?

166
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,258
Change of plans! Let's go!

167
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,500
Shit!

168
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,962
Find them now!

169
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,230
Sorry, boss. Is this a good moment
to talk about the payroll?

170
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,816
-No.
-Tonight's fan mail.

171
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,987
Three offers
to sell black market dollars...

172
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,198
Another offer to buy the bar...

173
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,702
An urgent request
to contact the resistance,

174
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,287
and a badly-scented proposal
of marriage.

175
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,000
No more valentines, Curly.

176
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,586
Oh, it's awful.

177
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,550
Look, boss, I hate
to keep bringing this up, I really do.

178
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,219
But tomorrow's payday.

179
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,389
What am I going to use for money,
a smile?

180
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,474
Relax, Curly, I got it covered.

181
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,602
-Are we going out?
-For a while.

182
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,313
Just how far out are we going to go?

183
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,399
I want to get some air.

184
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,693
But I thought
you got some air last night?

185
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,653
That didn't happen.

186
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,030
This isn't happening either.

187
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,661
Anybody asks,
I'm taking a bubble bath.

188
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,872
Barb, I just don't like...

189
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,709
Keep Charlie out from
under the tables. It's embarrassing.

190
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,627
I will.

191
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,764
Sweet dreams.

192
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,975
Okay. Okay, let's go.

193
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,144
Now what?

194
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,979
We find Krebs.

195
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,232
Any bright ideas how?

196
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,942
Just one.

197
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,737
I had to do a little moonlighting
to keep my bar running.

198
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:20,033
Not an easy life. A girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

199
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,538
And in this world
you gotta use everything you got.

200
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,665
Hey, handsome, you want some company?

201
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,000
You a cop?

202
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,755
See a badge?

203
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,516
You got your Med-Reg?

204
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,143
Full medical, checked yesterday.

205
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,950
-How much is this gonna cost me?
-That depends on how you wanna play.

206
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,537
-I like to play rough.
-Me too.

207
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,878
Hey, nice nuts!

208
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,839
Get a life!

209
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,398
Apartment four, seven, two...

210
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,150
One guest.

211
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,573
Retinal scan verified:
Ruben Tannenbaum,

212
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,533
one, zero, eight, one, one.

213
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,204
How romantic!

214
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,089
I have an idea.

215
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,133
Why don't you go change
into something more comfortable?

216
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,594
How about
something a little less comfortable?

217
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,639
I can hardly wait.

218
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,120
Bingo! Mr. Krebs.

219
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,798
Did you wash your hands?

220
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,675
No.

221
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,593
I was bad.

222
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,013
I'm so glad to hear that.

223
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,612
Now, close your eyes and turn around.

224
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,317
What the hell?

225
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,784
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Krebs.

226
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,706
Come on, move your ass!

227
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,168
Shit!

228
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,146
Go ahead, go!

229
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,095
-You're not going soft on me, are you?
-Okay.

230
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,181
You can have him.

231
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,349
Good.

232
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,187
You're my last bail jumper, Krebs.

233
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,190
Wake up, sunshine.

234
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,277
-Please don't kill me.
-That was nice kicking.

235
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,696
You really know your stuff, babe.

236
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,034
What did you call me?

237
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,749
Don't call me babe!

238
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,850
Goddamn it!

239
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,117
Ah, Mr. Krebs.

240
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,537
It's a pleasure to see you.

241
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,290
You know,
we were getting very concerned.

242
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,376
And Barb...

243
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,837
it's a pleasure to see you too.

244
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,674
You're looking
rather buoyant this evening.

245
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,093
Shut up! My fee?

246
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,095
-10 000...
-No!

247
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,514
The price went up for this one,
Schmitz.

248
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,142
-We had an agreement.
-You told me he was alone and unarmed.

249
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,561
-He wasn't.
-Sorry.

250
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:50,858
How could I know that? Bounty hunting
is an ugly, unpredictable business.

251
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,194
You of all people should know that.

252
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,196
How much?

253
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,198
20 000.

254
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,833
Canadian.

255
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,710
Miss Wire.

256
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,965
I do believe
that I'm being extorted here!

257
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:18,094
As a duly authorized officer
of the court, I must protest!

258
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,431
Look at it this way, Schmitz:

259
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:25,727
Alive, Krebs represents
your investment in this bail bond.

260
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,730
Dead, he's toxic waste.

261
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,525
20 000,

262
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,527
Canadian, now!

263
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,085
It's a pleasure
doing business with you, Barb.

264
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,921
If it was a pleasure, I'd charge more.

265
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,998
-Everything go okay?
-Candy from a baby.

266
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,461
-Pay the help, for God's sake.
-Please, not in public.

267
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,339
Excuse me, Miss Wire? I...I...

268
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,051
I'm going back
to the front lines tomorrow,

269
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,679
and I was wondering...
You look beautiful. Would...

270
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,265
Would you dance with me?

271
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,352
Come on, Barb, give him a thrill.

272
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,314
Come on.

273
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:26,347
I can't believe, I'm actually dancing
with the Barb Wire!

274
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,559
Where are you from, soldier?

275
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,355
Steamboat Springs, Colorado,
or what's left of it.

276
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,191
Did you hear, the Congressionals
just took over Denver?

277
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,445
No, I didn't.
Do you have a girl back home?

278
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,030
Yeah.

279
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,325
-Do you miss her?
-Yes, ma'am, every day.

280
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,871
I tell you what: close your eyes

281
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,291
and let's pretend
she's right here in your arms.

282
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,126
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,976
Everyone, stay where you are!
This is the police.

284
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,354
Willis,
Steel Harbor's Chief of Police.

285
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,108
He was a drunk with sticky fingers.
But at least, he was honest.

286
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,360
He admitted,
he was a liar and a thief.

287
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,988
-Check his ID.
-Yes, sir.

288
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,415
Retinal scan verified:
Lawrence Crabtree,

289
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,250
five, seven, two, three, nine.

290
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,419
Ben Jones, eh?

291
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,255
Arrest him.

292
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,594
Good luck, soldier.

293
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,102
-Next.
-Right, get over.

294
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,316
- Retinal scan verified: Martha Berg.
-Arrest her.

295
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:04,111
-Willis, what the hell is going on?
-Barb, how lovely to see you.

296
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,988
What gives?

297
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,074
It's a messy business tonight.

298
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,662
Most unpleasant: a rather spectacular
double homicide in the old harbor.

299
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,040
-So?
-So, we're checking a few IDs.

300
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,419
We have reason to believe, this
might have been resistance-related.

301
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:25,466
As your bar is non-discriminating
to this town's more nefarious side...

302
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,136
-How long is this gonna take?
-Everything's negotiable.

303
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,725
-Curly...
-Music!

304
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,192
You really upgraded this place
from what it was, Barb.

305
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,404
I like the new sound system.
Sounds expensive.

306
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,199
-I've been saving my lunch money.
-Didn't know you opened for lunch.

307
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,036
Now, a little gun running here,
some bail jumping there,

308
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,080
the occasional midnight detonation:

309
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,916
Those are the kind of jobs
that pay for new toys.

310
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,544
-I don't moonlight.
-I do.

311
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,550
-It's profitable.
-What's with the bullshit arrests?

312
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,387
You sold half those
Congressional IDs yourself.

313
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,598
Moi? Bullshit arrests?

314
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,392
Two of my men are dead.

315
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,730
Now granted, they were
homicidal thugs, but they were my men.

316
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,232
What makes you think
resistance was involved?

317
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:31,407
Why? Do you have any
other information I should know about?

318
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,242
Of course not.

319
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,453
Of course not.

320
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,914
That's sexual harassment, Chief.

321
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,043
Listen, Barbara Kopetsky,

322
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,503
we can play this
cat and mouse game all night long.

323
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,548
But I have
more important things on my mind.

324
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,967
Now, where the hell is William Krebs?

325
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,927
Never heard of him.

326
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,680
Why are your men watching him?

327
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,268
That's classified police business.

328
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,691
I can tell you he was resistance

329
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,527
and the Congressionals have
a million dollar bounty on his head.

330
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,574
So if someone knew where Krebs was,
I can make it worth their while.

331
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,284
Goodbye, Willis.

332
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,621
Okay.

333
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:24,293
By the way, we're expecting
some distinguished visitors tomorrow.

334
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,004
A Congressional delegation
out of Washington

335
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,466
including First Directorate,
Colonel Victor Pryzer.

336
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,678
-Might bring them by the Hammerhead.
-Their money will be welcome.

337
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,930
You don't know Victor Pryzer.

338
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:41,686
Speaking of money, I don't have to
make more arrests for the usual 3000.

339
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:42,853
1500.

340
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,523
1500...

341
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:48,734
I better go downstairs
checking some more IDs.

342
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,905
2500.

343
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,616
-Two grand.
-Darling.

344
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,621
-30 bucks for the cognac.
-Add it to my tab, Miss Kopetski.

345
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,834
Miss Kopetski died in the war.

346
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,461
I'm Barb Wire.

347
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,393
Some cigarettes and a drink,
then I'll be fine.

348
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,271
Give me a goddamn drink!

349
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,233
You, you or you!
Just give me my drink!

350
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,653
-Sir, we're not open yet.
-You've had enough already.

351
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,238
Blow me!

352
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,158
Camille... package check.

353
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,539
Get her off of me!

354
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,333
That's Camille. She works here.

355
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,378
Camille, sit.

356
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,302
-You don't wanna see her roll over.
-No, no, no.

357
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,679
Good. Camille, outside.

358
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,438
-Have a nice day.
-Yes, ma'am.

359
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,209
Willis, what's with the monkey suit?

360
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,546
You know how uniforms
impress the Congressionals.

361
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,590
The delegation arrived this morning.

362
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,717
Look lively.
They could be here any minute.

363
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,719
Excuse me, Barb.

364
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,389
-My table?
-Best in the house, as you requested.

365
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,267
Just keep them away
from the weapons check.

366
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,979
We don't want our customers from
the United Front trying to get even.

367
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:53,567
I think you'll find our guests
from Washington command more respect.

368
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,945
You're confusing respect with fear.

369
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,938
Speak of the devil.

370
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,358
They are punctual,
I'll give them that.

371
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,572
You'll join us for a drink later.
On my tab, of course.

372
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,783
Fat chance!

373
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:48,414
Colonel Pryzer. Alexander Willis,
Director of Police Operations.

374
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,374
Welcome to Steel Harbor.

375
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,960
Wipe that smile off your face, Willis.

376
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:57,381
This burnt-out hellhole is
the last place on earth I want to be!

377
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,302
If it wasn't
for your almost complete incompetence,

378
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,804
I wouldn't be here in the first place,
would I?

379
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,639
Yes. Needless to say,

380
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:10,144
we had intended to have both Krebs
and Cora D. sent to Washington by now.

381
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,022
However, due to circumstances
outside of our control...

382
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,149
Listen... carefully!

383
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,445
If Cora D. escapes,

384
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:24,158
I will personally
rip your heart out of your ass

385
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,536
and stuff it back down your throat!

386
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,956
That's not very sanitary.

387
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,509
Baby, you tell me it's late, but
I tell you, it only feels that way.

388
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:47,348
So sit back and enjoy someone or
something elicit, if you can get it,

389
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,850
and listen to the music.

390
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:53,062
Gentlemen,
the steaks are excellent tonight.

391
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:00,945
Colonel Pryzer, allow me to introduce
our hostess, the inimitable...

392
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,657
Even in Washington...
we've heard of Barb Wire.

393
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,368
I hope you'll join us.

394
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,081
You attract a very eclectic crowd.

395
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,208
It looks that way.

396
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,919
Rumor has it you used to fight
with the resistance?

397
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,672
Shouldn't believe everything you hear.

398
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:23,842
-I'm neutral. I'm a business woman.
-Perhaps we can do business.

399
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:28,430
I can assure you, Barb has
a very keen sense of commerce.

400
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,016
Then I'll get to the point.

401
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,602
There's a fugitive, a traitor,
in Steel Harbor.

402
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,522
She intends to make
a crossing into Canada with the help

403
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,066
of some more disenchanted members.

404
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,818
Do I look disenchanted to you?

405
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:45,447
Your business dealings bring you
in contact with all levels of society.

406
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,741
I thought
you were getting to the point.

407
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:52,705
Her name is doctor Corrina Devonshire.
You may have heard of her as Cora D.

408
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,625
One of those
overly romanticized resistance names.

409
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,794
It keeps her legend alive.

410
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,714
-What does she look like?
-We're not sure.

411
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,591
She had her appearance
surgically altered.

412
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,553
These are photos of her before.

413
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,932
It's hard to find somebody
unless you know what she looks like.

414
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,935
Her present appearance
is of no consequence.

415
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,814
Identification can always be made
by retinal scanning.

416
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,024
So?

417
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,194
The Congressionals
can count on your assistance?

418
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:28,240
Excuse me, boss.
Trouble in the kitchen. I need you.

419
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,368
Excuse me, gentlemen,

420
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,079
I have a bar to run.

421
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:43,047
-Very interesting woman.
-With most impressive assets.

422
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,383
Gentlemen... There you are, sir.

423
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:07,279
Act natural?
That's easier said than done.

424
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,798
Two beers, buddy. I'm looking
for a Barb or Charlie Kopetski.

425
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,301
Barb is out there.

426
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,018
The Congressionals!

427
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,732
-They have my photographs.
-Let's hope resistance are here.

428
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,611
-They are looking everywhere for you.
-Who are we meeting?

429
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,571
Someone I used to know.

430
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,323
Wait here.

431
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,802
Hello, Charlie.

432
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,599
This must be
a post-traumatic stress flashback.

433
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:21,895
I could swear I just heard
an old voice from the battle fields.

434
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,856
Surprised to see me?

435
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,945
Do I look surprised?

436
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,072
Guess you didn't hear.

437
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:37,077
A Congressional smart grenade.
It followed me to my foxhole.

438
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,663
I thought I'd dug it deep enough.

439
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,332
I guess I didn't.

440
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,751
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

441
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,295
Me too.

442
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,755
Miss, two bourbons.

443
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,217
You don't have to buy me a drink,
Axel.

444
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,430
I'm tight with the management here.
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.

445
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,850
I had no choice.

446
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,060
Where's Barb?

447
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:05,063
I don't think talking to Barb
is such a good idea.

448
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,442
She took Seattle
a hell of a lot harder than I did.

449
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,362
I need her help. I need her to put us
in touch with local resistance.

450
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,949
Haven't you heard?

451
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,911
Barb's retired.

452
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:24,124
Leave. Now. Before Barb sees you.

453
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,002
There's no telling what she might do.

454
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,630
Too late.

455
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,260
Three,

456
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,679
-Two...
-Hello, Barb.

457
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,182
One!

458
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,481
-Okay, I guess I deserved that.
-Get out!

459
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,150
-I need your help.
-Rot in hell!

460
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,278
I remember
when you believed in something.

461
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,782
I remember how it felt,
like I was kicked in the stomach.

462
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,868
I've got 24 hours
to find a man named Krebs.

463
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,829
I don't know how I feel.
I don't feel much of anything anymore.

464
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,166
-Will you just trust me please?
-Like I did in Seattle?

465
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,378
What happened there isn't what
you think. I never wanted to hurt you.

466
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,340
-Now is not the time to explain.
-You're three years late.

467
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,425
Get out and don't come back!

468
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,427
Your check, sir.

469
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,855
Such blatant disregard for money.

470
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,112
Thank you for your hospitality.

471
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,282
And I do hope
you'll think about our offer.

472
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,834
I'm thinking about it.

473
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,841
I knew I shouldn't have come here.

474
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,968
That woman's in love with you.

475
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,389
There's a lot of things
I need to tell you.

476
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,559
-I hope it's sooner than later.
-Axel, over here!

477
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,894
Charlie.

478
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,856
I can help.

479
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,775
The blind leading the blind.

480
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:21,575
Go to the old factory district to a
place called Steel Harbor Metal House.

481
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,744
It's a front for the resistance.

482
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,663
There's a stairway in the back,
near the loading dock.

483
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,373
Watch yourself.

484
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,055
Shit!

485
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,278
Who are you?

486
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,655
Charlie Kopetski sent us.

487
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,075
Doesn't matter who I am
but this is Cora D.

488
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,493
Scan her.

489
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,254
Retinal scan verified:
doctor Corrina Devonshire,

490
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,799
four, four, seven, nine, one.

491
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,802
Cora D., I'm honored.

492
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,264
We've been looking for you. I never
thought I'd meet the legend in person.

493
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,558
I'm commander here.
They call me Spike.

494
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,895
-You're so young.
-Maybe.

495
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:35,857
-But I'm tough.
-Well, we're glad we found you.

496
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,527
We hope that you can help us, Spike.

497
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,197
It took us a while but we found Krebs.

498
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,075
The lenses are gone,
not to mention his eyeballs.

499
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,578
We found him in an abandoned washing
machine behind the old V.A. hospital.

500
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,873
-The Congressionals took the lenses?
-No.

501
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,501
They're still looking for Krebs,
we know that.

502
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,880
Willis and the cops don't know squat.
Everybody's chasing their tail.

503
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,924
Who's got the contact lenses now?

504
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:05,053
Word on the street is Krebs was turned
over to a bail bondsman named Schmitz.

505
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:09,266
Schmitz was aiming to turn Krebs over
to the Congressionals for the bounty.

506
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:13,395
-But then they got wise to the lenses.
-They are worth two million.

507
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:18,316
Without them I won't be able to get
past the scan and get on that plane.

508
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:22,237
-Let's not wait. Let's get Schmitz!
-It's not that easy, doc.

509
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,449
-We can't find him.
-The plane leaves in 24 hours.

510
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,242
Somebody must help us.

511
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:31,037
Only one person at Steel Harbor
has connections on all sides.

512
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,373
If anyone would know
where Schmitz is, she would.

513
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,751
The trouble is,
she won't help nobody for free

514
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,629
and we're a little low on cash.

515
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,802
You know I do, Connie.
Don't make me say it.

516
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,054
I love you. Bye.

517
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,184
-What are you two laughing at?
-Who was that?

518
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,644
-Your mother.
-Give me three.

519
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,396
How many?

520
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,273
Put that down!

521
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,777
-How many more?
-Give me two.

522
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,410
-Your bet, Moe.
-I'll bet, when I get ready.

523
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:11,786
Just wait.

524
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,304
Ten-hut!

525
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,989
Don't know how you do things
in Washington,

526
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,326
but I do make the occasional arrest
without slaughter.

527
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:00,669
You incompetent.
We needed to make an interrogation.

528
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,088
Sorry, sir, they resisted.

529
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,475
Is any of these men Schmitz?

530
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,478
No.

531
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,529
Look who's here.

532
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,782
Krebs.

533
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,617
Cora D. can't be far.

534
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,581
I'll need one of the bodies.

535
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,377
Preferably...
one without a head wound.

536
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:11,573
-Hey. You want some company?
-No.

537
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:15,452
Okay. Do you want some advice?

538
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,580
No!

539
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,832
Okay.

540
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:30,508
Drink when you want to remember.
Don't drink when you want to forget.

541
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,890
I'll be there.

542
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,476
I promise.

543
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,816
Let's move!

544
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,863
-Barb, we have to go now!
-No, he'll be here!

545
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,616
Barb!

546
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,952
Axel!

547
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,913
Are you Barbara Kopetski?

548
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:04,542
-Yes. Where's Axel?
-He's not here. He's not coming.

549
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,463
He said he's sorry
but you gotta get out of here.

550
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:12,008
You guys gotta get out of here!
Go! Go! Go!

551
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:13,677
That's it. Let's go!

552
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,014
Come on, get in! Get in!

553
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,739
You cheated me
out of one million bucks, Schmitz!

554
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,367
I should blow your head off right now.

555
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,454
Lucky for me you don't hold a grudge.

556
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,623
Don't I?

557
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:49,212
A million dollars is pocket change
to what's going down.

558
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,798
I got a business proposition
for you.

559
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:55,468
-You got connections, everyone knows.
-I don't take sides.

560
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,430
Exactly... You deal with everybody.

561
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,683
-I got something to deal.
-You can't sell Krebs on your own?

562
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,352
It's not about Krebs anymore.

563
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,771
It's about retinal contact lenses.

564
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,400
Smuggled in from Germany.

565
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,319
You put these in your eyes,
you get through any retinal scanner.

566
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,238
Congressional or U.N.

567
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,657
I was gonna sell them
but my buyer fell through.

568
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:20,326
Krebs was resistance.

569
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,913
Those belonged to his friends.
Do yourself a favor:

570
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,458
Just give them back
and say you're sorry.

571
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,669
Goddamn it Barb, I can't.

572
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,088
They'll kill me and you know it.

573
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,012
The Congressionals
broke into my office.

574
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,265
They slaughtered everybody.

575
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,851
They were looking for me.

576
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,938
With or without these,
I'm a dead man.

577
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,443
Relax, Schmitz, you can only die once.

578
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,827
Barb?

579
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,914
I know I double-crossed you.

580
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,417
I made a mistake. It happens.

581
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:14,339
I want to trade the lenses.

582
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,384
-I want to trade them to you.
-For what?

583
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,055
Get me out of Steel Harbor.
Canada maybe.

584
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,099
Just get me out and they're yours.

585
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,687
You want out?
Click your heels together three times.

586
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,774
You could sell these.
Do you know how much they're worth?

587
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,736
You could get two mil...
Canadian... easy.

588
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:42,742
Enough money for Europe. You could
get an operation for Charlie's eyes.

589
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:45,703
I don't buy. I don't sell.

590
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,082
Get out!

591
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,172
You're gonna regret
not dealing with me!

592
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:59,342
You're gonna regret this
very, very much.

593
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,179
I'll add that to my list.

594
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,047
The subject is reasonably fresh.

595
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,009
We'll probably only get a few seconds
of readable thought data.

596
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:45,138
Cognitive impressions, those closest
to death first. And then what's left:

597
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,140
memories, dreams.

598
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,059
-Record it.
-Sir. Step away from the tank.

599
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,493
-That's it?
-Here it is in slow motion, Colonel.

600
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,384
Issue a warrant
for the arrest of Barb Wire.

601
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:27,013
Issue a warrant?
This isn't Washington, Pryzer.

602
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,016
-I need a reason.
-She's involved.

603
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:35,772
Well, you heard what he said.
Sometimes all you get are dreams.

604
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:39,525
Every man in Steel Harbor
dreams about Barb Wire.

605
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,905
-I need something more conclusive...
-When did the law ever matter to you?

606
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,950
Miss Wire may know the whereabouts
of the retinal lenses.

607
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:50,203
-We will search her bar.
-Retinal lenses?

608
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,872
All of this
is over a set of Bausch and Lombs?

609
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:57,460
All of this is over capturing an enemy
of the Republic, the traitor Cora D.

610
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:01,214
If Cora D. were to exit
this charming free city,

611
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:07,512
your relationship with the Republic
would be severely compromised.

612
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,683
Painfully compromised.

613
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:16,187
Do I make myself clear?

614
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:22,193
Your administrative fee should cover
the cost of issuing a search warrant.

615
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,612
Now, find a reason
to search the Hammerhead!

616
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,031
As you wish, Colonel.

617
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,409
As you wish.

618
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,166
I'm unarmed.

619
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,502
How did you get in here?
Where's my dog?

620
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,006
I'm irresistible to females.

621
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,635
Thanks, Camille.

622
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,390
Towel!

623
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,480
-What? Are you gonna shoot me?
-Why waste a good bullet?

624
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,524
I thought I told you
never to come back?

625
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,819
I came here to do a job.

626
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,822
The biggest operation
I ever signed up for.

627
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:54,118
I came ready for anything
the Congressionals could lob at me.

628
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,747
The only thing I wasn't prepared for
was running into you.

629
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,166
You'll get over it. I did.

630
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,216
I wouldn't have come here
unless I had to.

631
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,176
I wouldn't be here
if I knew you were coming.

632
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:12,011
Goddamn it!

633
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,229
I guess
it's bad timing for both of us.

634
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:39,247
Am I interrupting something?

635
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,042
Lovely you brought company.

636
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,718
Barb, this is my wife, Cora D.

637
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:58,975
How impressive. I'm sure you'll have
very strong, smart children.

638
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,311
Look, I know
this is awkward for all of us.

639
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:07,608
You gotta know, all I wanted back
in Seattle was to disappear with you.

640
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:11,154
-The war changed that.
-The war changed everything.

641
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,947
Good one.

642
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,116
I'm not surprised
you don't believe me.

643
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,952
The mission took months.
I thought after all that time

644
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,996
I was better left a part of your past.

645
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,874
That's why I didn't get
an invitation to your wedding?

646
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,043
Barb, there's more to the story
than meets the eye.

647
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,379
Do you remember
what happened in Topeka, Kansas?

648
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:32,133
How the whole city was wiped out?
I can explain.

649
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,261
I was Chief of Medical Research
for the Congressional Directorate.

650
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,599
I was directly but unknowingly
involved in a global project,

651
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,143
an HIV derivative
known as Red Ribbon.

652
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,645
It can kill you in twelve hours.

653
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,815
When I learned that Topeka, Kansas,
was a lab experiment

654
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,527
and the Congressionals planned
to unleash it on the entire territory,

655
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:55,531
I defected to the resistance.
Axel got me out of Washington.

656
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:01,078
Initially we married on paper
purely for identification purposes.

657
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:06,292
-We've been on the run ever since.
-How utterly, goddamn heroic!

658
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,503
Now, what the hell
do you want with me?

659
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,756
Cora has the vaccine
to Red Ribbon in her system.

660
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,426
The Congressionals want it back.
We have to get her to Canada

661
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,012
to tell the Truth Commission
there's a cure.

662
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,848
We have to tell the world.
We need your help.

663
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,934
The cause needs your help.

664
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,062
What has the cause done for me lately?

665
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,482
Barb, where are the contact lenses?

666
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,778
-If I knew you think I'd tell you?
-We know that Schmitz was here.

667
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:38,241
Now, if you know where the lenses are,
for Christ's sake, name a price.

668
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,411
That's what you do, isn't it?
Sell yourself to the highest bidder?

669
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,997
I'm out of your price range.

670
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,560
-Is there another way out of here?
-Are you kidding?

671
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,854
The other way is covered.

672
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,985
Roll it, ladies.

673
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:34,005
Give me three minutes
and meet me downstairs.

674
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,926
-Why should we trust you?
-Maybe you shouldn't.

675
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,017
-Check him!
-Yes, sir.

676
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,311
Put his head back.

677
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:50,021
Oh god!

678
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,232
He doesn't have any retinals,
you morons!

679
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,862
Sorry about that, Charlie.

680
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:09,498
-We're not open for breakfast.
-It's legal. We have a warrant.

681
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,669
It's a little sticky.

682
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:19,592
-What exactly are you looking for?
-This... is a murder investigation.

683
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,429
It's a Congressional matter.
I can assure you, citizen,

684
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:27,141
if we discover that you're involved,
the consequences will be abrupt

685
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,143
and severe.

686
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,357
-Who are they?
-I picked them up off the boulevard.

687
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,943
I like a good menage
every now and then.

688
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,783
Go out through the back.

689
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,118
Scan them.

690
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,621
This is ridiculous.

691
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,125
Commence scan.

692
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,720
Sir, the scanner is broken, sir.

693
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,556
Idiot!

694
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,061
You're wasting my time. Get out!

695
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,065
How long is this gonna take?

696
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:21,278
As long as it takes, citizen.
As long as it takes.

697
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:51,911
I wish you could see this mess.

698
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,080
I couldn't see it when it was clean.

699
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,750
What the hell
were they looking for anyway?

700
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,628
-Stupid contact lenses.
-Oh yeah?

701
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,840
Schmitz was here last night trying
to trade them for a trip to Canada.

702
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,550
I should've done it.

703
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:08,802
-Contact lenses?
-Yeah.

704
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:13,849
Like these?

705
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,686
What color are they?

706
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,439
The color of money.

707
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,441
We can give them to Axel
and help them escape.

708
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,401
This is our ticket to Europe.

709
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:27,655
-They don't belong to us!
-Finders keepers.

710
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,157
I still believe
in fighting for what's right!

711
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,118
Cheer up, baby brother. We're rich.

712
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,497
You're making a mistake, Barb.

713
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:38,832
-Tell me that when we get to Paris.
-A big one!

714
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,378
-Charlie, you worry too much.
-It's not just about money.

715
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:45,506
I knew Charlie was still friendly
with the resistance.

716
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,092
But I didn't know how friendly.

717
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:16,495
-He's expecting me.
-Let her through.

718
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,526
Big Fatso!
How's the king of the underworld?

719
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,570
Well, well, well...

720
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:53,032
-If it isn't Barb the buxom.
-A gesture.

721
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:02,291
Donuts! I thought
I'd be hearing from you real soon.

722
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,045
-I have a proposition.
-Oh now, ain't that sweet?

723
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,298
But you know
I only like big fat women.

724
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,474
A business proposition.

725
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,268
As in... lenses?

726
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:26,523
Don't give me that surprised look like
you don't know what I'm talking about.

727
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:30,778
You didn't drive to the evil empire
to see how my diet's going.

728
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:34,198
You came here to talk about
the contact lenses, didn't you?

729
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:39,078
-I'm in a position to broker the sale.
-That's what I heard.

730
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:43,082
I believe
you've already met... Mr. Schmitz.

731
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:47,252
Never looked better.

732
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,713
Let's make a deal.

733
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:14,613
Spike?

734
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,702
Anybody?

735
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,330
It's Charlie, I'm here.

736
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,709
-Spike ain't here.
-Well, where is she?

737
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,632
She knows
I was supposed to meet her here.

738
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,926
She sent me instead.

739
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,470
I talk to Spike or I talk to nobody!

740
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:42,975
If the resistance wants to know where
those lenses are, you get me Spike!

741
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,977
Coming right down.

742
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,754
-Spike?
-Charlie Kopetski!

743
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,173
Hold him!

744
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:19,678
You're charged with concealing
information regarding contact lenses!

745
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:23,307
You can cooperate and talk to me...

746
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,184
or you can join your little friend.

747
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,270
I'd rather join my friend!

748
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,816
One million Canadian.

749
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:35,110
-Deal!
-I'm not done yet!

750
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,865
There's a plane I wanna catch at the
old airport by the unoccupied zone.

751
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,909
Unoccupied zone...

752
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,578
Bad part of town.

753
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,207
I want save passage for me and Charlie
all the way through there.

754
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,751
That means an escort
to the old airport.

755
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,337
The zone can be very unpredictable,

756
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,006
and
the toll collector's quite difficult.

757
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:59,635
I'd have to stack
a few more men here and there...

758
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:02,721
How about... half a mil Canadian?

759
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:04,681
750 upfront.

760
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:07,392
Deal! You got the lenses?

761
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:11,021
What do I look, new?

762
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:15,818
We'll meet at the first toll entering
the zone an hour before sundown.

763
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,278
Cash for the lenses, right there.

764
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:22,491
You're five minutes late,
I'll sell to another buyer.

765
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,508
The damn screen
is not picking up his thoughts!

766
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,719
Colonel,
he has no visual data for that period.

767
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,556
Goddamn it! Where are the lenses?

768
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,559
Speak now, man

769
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,602
or suffer at your leisure.

770
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,355
The Easter Bunny took them.

771
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,781
I'll talk.

772
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,491
I'll talk.

773
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,745
-This guy has them.
-What guy?

774
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,165
He's fat... wears a red suit...

775
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:14,793
white beard.

776
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,795
The name is Kringle.

777
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,799
Kris Kringle.

778
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,306
Merry Christmas!

779
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,509
-What a mess!
-Well, this mess is all yours, Curly.

780
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,351
The bar is yours.

781
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,062
Get out!

782
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,982
I'm giving it to you.
Me and Charlie, we're history.

783
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,069
What do you mean, "history"?

784
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,155
You're leaving forever?
You're not coming back?

785
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,452
Look, Barb...

786
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,497
I have no experience in running a bar.

787
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,749
I'm just a waiter, for Christ's sake.

788
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,876
Curly, relax, you're a natural.

789
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:42,172
Camille!

790
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:52,516
Well, this is it.

791
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,187
I'm gonna miss you.

792
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,690
I'm gonna miss you too, Curly.

793
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:03,026
Now, take care of Camille, okay?

794
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,070
Yeah, all right.

795
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,909
I never thought I'd see the day you'd
drive away in that horrible thing.

796
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:14,913
-Where's Charlie? He should be here.
-He went to see an old friend.

797
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:18,166
-Someone named Spike.
-Spike?

798
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:20,627
Get in!

799
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,196
Oh god!

800
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:56,997
Charlie!

801
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,393
Oh my god!

802
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,899
What happened?

803
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,859
They're just kids.

804
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,988
What's that?

805
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,342
Charlie.

806
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,556
We heard the Congressionals
discovered this place.

807
01:13:57,308 --> 01:14:01,603
-We were on our way to warn them.
-Yeah, well you were too late.

808
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:05,023
Listen to me, Barb, we need your help.

809
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,860
There's no more time. The plane leaves
in 90 minutes. Only you can help us.

810
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,695
Please.

811
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,368
For Charlie.

812
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,332
I'll take care of Charlie.

813
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,684
Let's go.

814
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,714
-What about the lenses?
-They're safe.

815
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:17,762
She'll never be able to get on
that plane without the contact lenses.

816
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,057
I said they're safe.
Are you coming or not?

817
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,485
Does the word "overkill"
mean anything to you?

818
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,113
-Ever driven out of Steel Harbor?
-No.

819
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:36,990
Then shut up!

820
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:00,639
-What's this?
-It's a road block.

821
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,933
On the other side
is the unoccupied zone.

822
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,060
There's a toll.

823
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,952
-You two stay here.
-What's going on?

824
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,206
This is our escort.

825
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,465
Look at her, all gussied up.

826
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,802
-Nice jewelry, Barb.
-Got the money?

827
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,137
No chit-chat?

828
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,723
Have it your way.

829
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,022
-I said cash!
-Hey, I had to work fast.

830
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,776
It's a gold debit card
with 750 000 credit on it.

831
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,905
-It's as good as cash.
-That wasn't part of the deal, Fatso!

832
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,700
I told you, I had to work fast.

833
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,202
You got the lenses?

834
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:06,538
Nice.

835
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:10,166
-Watch them!
-What the hell you think you're doing?

836
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:13,503
-Back off, Axel!
-Well, well, well...

837
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:17,549
If it isn't Axel the freedom fighter
and the famous Cora D.

838
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:21,136
We got ourselves the star-studded
gathering going on here.

839
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,097
-How could you?
-How many times do I have to tell you?

840
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,224
I don't take sides!

841
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:29,185
I'm in this for me only.
Right, Big Fatso?

842
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:32,063
Right,
and I like the way you think, Barb.

843
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,569
The lenses!

844
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:51,499
All right, phase two of the deal:

845
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,543
a safe escort to the old airport.

846
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,339
Slight change of plans.

847
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,223
You fat son of a bitch!

848
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,783
Nice work, Mr. Big Fatso.

849
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,243
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man!

850
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,706
Barb, I'm gonna have to ask you
to drop your weapons.

851
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,921
You'll love this, Barb.
Not only do I get the lenses,

852
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:42,300
but I get a million dollars bounty on
your head and on the head of the doc

853
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,677
for turning you both over
to the Congressionals.

854
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:49,599
And not to mention the 750 000
dollar credit on the debit card.

855
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:55,855
Don't you just love it
when a plan comes together?

856
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:04,531
The face may deceive,
but the eyes never lie.

857
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,909
Do they, doctor Devonshire?

858
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:12,247
Washington has been
in such an uproar since you ran away.

859
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:16,209
I can't tell you how eager we are
to have you back.

860
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:25,468
Whore!

861
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,521
Chief Willis, arrest these people!

862
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:44,988
I want you to know I had nothing to do
with what happened to Charlie.

863
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,781
And I'm sorry.

864
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:01,254
-Don't move!
-Look out, she's got a grenade!

865
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,228
Forward!

866
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,443
Hang on!

867
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,697
Jeez, we're gonna die!

868
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,958
I'll kill you! I'll break you in half!

869
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,300
How am I supposed to get on the plane?

870
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,969
If we ever get out of this alive,
I'll kill you!

871
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,228
-Axel, take the wheel!
-What?

872
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,064
Don't argue, hurry!

873
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:08,863
In an emergency
pull that yellow lever.

874
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,534
How come I don't get to drive?

875
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:05,837
Second toll, dead ahead!

876
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,798
The airport's just beyond.

877
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,928
We canâ€™t just break through a bus!

878
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:19,392
-Does this constitute emergency?
-Yes!

879
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:31,154
Oh shit!

880
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:33,531
Hang on!

881
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,825
Where are you going?

882
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,167
Holy shit!

883
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:21,245
Wait up!

884
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,250
Give me your gun.

885
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,627
Willis, get them to the airport,
quick! I'll stall them.

886
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,547
-You can't.
-I'll meet you at the plane.

887
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,133
Goodbye, Axel.

888
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:19,512
All right, let's go!

889
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:35,820
Get going to the airport,
I'm going back. Move!

890
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,044
There he is. Get him!

891
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:00,553
He's over here!

892
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,185
Follow him!

893
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,373
Hold your fire!

894
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:57,318
Where are you, bastard?

895
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:19,632
Gosh!

896
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:32,163
This one makes it go up and down?

897
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:34,165
Yeah, it does.

898
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,251
-Which one makes it go round?
-That one right here.

899
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,003
How about this one?

900
01:27:56,855 --> 01:28:00,483
How touching,
the last stand of the desperate.

901
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,235
Normally I don't get emotional
about my work.

902
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,573
But vaporizing your springy ass
is gonna be a real pleasure.

903
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,966
Oh Barb, we're so close.
Don't you feel the magic?

904
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:47,131
This is just like my favorite song...

905
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:50,676
-"I got you, babe!"
-Don't call me babe!

906
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,826
Attention! Attention!

907
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:19,955
Prepare for retinal scan
identification enforcement.

908
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,918
Only U.N.
authorized and identified personnel

909
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:26,420
will be permitted past this point

910
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,340
but fractions
will be dealt with severely.

911
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:31,801
Damn, Willis, we gotta do something.

912
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:34,804
We'll create a flamboyant diversion.

913
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,555
Thanks.

914
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,453
There they are.

915
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,083
Are we cutting it close enough?

916
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:15,761
Put these in.

917
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:19,056
Final seating flight 647.

918
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,684
Destination Quebec, gate two.

919
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:25,354
Hold that plane!

920
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:30,025
Good luck, doc.

921
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,027
Thank you.

922
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,199
-Destination?
-Quebec.

923
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:39,410
Step to the scanner.

924
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:54,258
Retinal scan verified:
Citizen approved by all governments.

925
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,886
She's home free, mission completed.

926
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,513
You're gonna miss your plane.

927
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:02,641
I thought Barb Wire never took sides.

928
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:04,602
Keep it to yourself!

929
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:07,104
Last call, flight 647...

930
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,190
Goodbye, Axel.

931
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:14,486
Goodbye.

932
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,742
Willis.

933
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:46,143
Where will you go?

934
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,191
I hear
Paris is nice this time of the year.

935
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:00,491
I do believe I'm falling in love.

936
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:03,160
Get in line!
