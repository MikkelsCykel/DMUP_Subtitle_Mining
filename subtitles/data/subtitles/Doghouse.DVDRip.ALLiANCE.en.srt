00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,956
Aw, fuck...

2
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,558
Fuckin' hell!

3
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,154
What's the matter with you? What?

4
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,995
- I'm not a bloody prostitute!
- All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,316
Christ's sake, this was our second date!

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,869
Was it? Listen, listen, all right...

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,713
I was on the tequilas
last night and, um...

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,070
- What is your name again?
- Oh, you're kidding.

9
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,800
Tell you what, if you was a prostitute...

10
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,916
you know... you'd be caked.

11
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,551
- Argh!
- Ow!

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,159
What's the matter with you?
That was a compliment!

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,074
You know what I mean, I can't win!
I've got the pox of it.

14
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,833
Tell you something else,
you're only an old dog, anyway.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,878
Maybe "boys' weekend,"
wasn't the best choice of words.

16
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,632
Whatever. Have a nice time.

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,475
I'm not one of those guys
who ditches his mates for his girlfriend!

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,393
- I don't want you to ditch your mates!
- What DO you want?

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,471
An invite would've been nice.

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,631
No girls allowed, darling.

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,070
I didn't know
there was gonna be strippers!

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,755
- And Neil's not in charge. I am.
- That fills me with confidence.

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,559
I'm only going to my gran's.
I'll be back on Monday.

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,870
I'll have the locks changed before then.

25
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,196
Bex, Bex...
It's for Vince. Vince!

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,999
He's helped me
out so many times, I've lost count.

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,197
When I first came to London,
he supported me. I owe him.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,557
Lots of people get divorced, Mikey.
He'll get over it.

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,235
Yes, by spending a weekend
getting trollied with his mates.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,392
Well, you can celebrate
your own divorce with him!

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,711
I thought you'd react like that,
so I glued your ring on.

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,998
- See you Monday, babe. Love you too!
- Mikey, if you walk out that gate...

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,756
You don't know whether
you're coming or going, do you?

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,237
Patrick!

35
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,993
I'm going. I'm going!

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,435
The first weekend
my parents visit in years,

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,036
and you bugger off to the wilderness
to rediscover your testicles!

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,317
It's bad enough I have to tell them
you've quit your job...

39
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,119
<i>Welcome to Sonic Stress Therapy.</i>

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,070
<i>It's going to be a beautiful day.
Let's start it with a smile.</i>

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,153
<i>- Anxiety is almost the same...
- Are you just gonna fucking go?</i>

42
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,951
<i>No, no.</i>

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,877
It's a symbol of his identity, and the
source of his primeval inner strength.

44
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,032
So how come the Zombie Girls
kick his arse on page four?

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,998
How many times have I told you
they're NOT zombies?!

46
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,439
- All right, calm down. It's only a comic.
- No, no, it's not only a comic.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,037
This is a... It's a unique
and often misunderstood art form.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,590
This... is a painstakingly crafted,

49
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,151
and carefully balanced alignment
of words and art, OK?

50
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,357
- What, like TV?
- Do you want it or not?

51
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,830
- No, it's stupid.
- Right, piss off!

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,629
- Go on. We're closing early, OK?
- What? Why?

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,678
<i>Spaceltime anomaly.</i>

54
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,037
You mean... you want
a bit of time alone with your missus.

55
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,395
Don't touch her. Get off her and get out!

56
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,994
Go on, then!

57
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,390
Go on, out!
And don't come back!

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,071
Little knob-end.

59
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,476
Vince, you're not getting out of this!

60
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,633
- You're coming with us!
- We're gonna have such a good time!

61
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,469
Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!

62
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,796
Oh, you bastard!

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,399
Bastard!

64
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,668
Bastard!

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,551
Bastard!

66
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,276
Bastard! Argh!

THE HORRORS'

Thanks.

86
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,679
- Vince, you left this behind, mate.
- Ta.

87
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,559
- I thought you'd given up.
- I have.

88
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,154
- Where's Banksy?
- Late.

89
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,550
He's always late for everything.

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,711
He showed up on time for his wedding.

91
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,038
Why's that funny?

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,512
Well, he showed up, and, um...
she didn't show up at all.

93
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,035
+ Lucky bastard!

94
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,668
Here, I'll give him call.

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,630

Hurry up!

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,116
Liven yourself up, lazy-bollocks!

101
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,194
Hey, Pat, what's with
them golf clubs, man?

102
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,033
There's no golf courses
where we're going.

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,510
That's why have this bag...
my little friend.

104
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,671
You know there's more
to life than football.

- All you need is the open air...
- Me nuts, ow!

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,989
I don't think your new-age
golf therapy is gonna work on Vince, Pat.

107
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,196
Vince is real man, Pat, not like you.

108
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,920
You should've seen him
in his glory days, Mikey.

109
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,755
I mean, they used to call him Fearless.

110
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,357
He would step out in front of
a raging bull just to protect his mates,

111
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,229
and still manage to buy the first round
from his hospital bed.

112
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,393
Yeah, that's only 'cause you guys
picked up what was left in me wallet.

113
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,233
- We helped you.
- Go on, show Mikey.

114
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,710
- Oh, yeah, look at this!
- Let's have a look.

115
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,795
Pamplona Bull Run '96. He screamed
like a girl the whole way around.

116
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,951
I wish I was there, man...

117
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,348
Shit!

118
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,119
Sorry, mate, seriously.
Let me just...

119
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,555
Anyway, where were we?

120
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,712
Snap out of it, Vince.

121
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,350
Today you re-discover your inner bloke.
You don't wanna miss it.

122
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,511
Me inner bloke's all right, thanks.

123
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,433
He's not, though, is he?
He's lost his way.

124
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,991
We all have.
All suffering from social gender anxiety.

125
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,116
Is that some sort of disease
or something?

126
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,157
Nobody knows, that's the problem.

127
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,312
The second you try
to figure it out... doomed.

128
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,918
Not you, Vince. We're gonna
bring you back from the brink.

129
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,278
- Oi, no smoking!
- Shut up.

130
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,956
- You're outnumbered.
- Ooh, I'm terrified

131
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,872
Slag.

132
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,315
- Charmer...
- Wha'? Wha'?

133
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,075
- Now, listen to me, boys...
- I thought it was funny.

134
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,878
This is the plan.

135
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,591
First thing we do in the country,
we piss up the trees, mark our territory.

136
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,514
Then we're gonna find a pub and drink
till we've forgotten how to speak.

137
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,276
We'll communicate in grunts like
cavemen, until we pass out in the woods.

138
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,556
Any questions?

139
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,871
- Are you Michael? I'm the driver.
- Hey, she's the driver!

140
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,310
Wanna see my driver's license?

141
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,356
Uh...

142
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,869
That's Mikey,
the little squirt sitting there.

143
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,437
I'm Neil. What's your name, babe?

144
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,556
I can tell you now it's not "babe".

145
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,678
It's gonna be a long drive, isn't it?

146
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,354
Looks like it's heading that way,
don't it?

147
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,954
I tell you what, let's start again.

148
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,554
- My name's Neil.
- My name's Ruth.

149
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,549
From now on it's Candy.

150
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,713
Ignore him, RUTH. He's a throwback.
He hasn't evolved properly.

151
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,876
Call me Candy.

152
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,357
Come on!

153
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,349
Wehey! Woo-hoo!

154
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,999
- Right, boys, you ready?
- Yeah!

155
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,709
Get on these two here, look.
A couple of right wrong 'uns.

156
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,997
I'll tell you what, women love me.

157
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,550
<i>You got enough petrol,
babe, and all that, yeah?</i>

158
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,157
- Have you called Banksy again?
- He'll show up.

159
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,710
He's like Mikey's missus.
You can't shake him off.

160
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,469
It looks nice, but it's a piece of shit.

161
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,437
- What?
- It's fucked.

162
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,397
But I've only had it five minutes.

163
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,997
Someone's run the knackers off it.
You can't fix that with a nice paint job.

164
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,399
You're the one
who's getting divorced, ain't you?

165
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,198
Thanks for bringing it up.

166
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,113
There's worse things
than getting divorced.

167
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,113
Rape, murder, castration.

168
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,635
Fair enough.

169
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,349
What's in a weird village like Moodley
that you can't find in London?

170
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,035
Mikey's nan lives there.
We'll stay there while she's away.

171
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,872
What do you mean weird?

172
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,554
Well, it's just a dead-end
in the middle of the woods.

173
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,598
There's nothing there.

174
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,069
When I saw the booking
I thought it was a wind-up.

175
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,913
Mikey says the women
outnumber the men four to one.

176
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,275
- Yes, they do, Neil.
- Oh...

177
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,318
- And obviously they're all gagging for it.
- Obviously.

178
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,675
An entire village
full of man-hungry women

179
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,957
waiting to jump the first band
of desperados rolling up from London.

180
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,270
- Have you been there, then?
- Uh-uh.

181
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,079
My firm hasn't booked
a job to Moodley in years.

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,672
Oh, sod off.

183
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,670
<i>Don't fear. There's no cause for alarm.</i>

184
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,035
<i>All is well.</i>

185
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,998
<i>Death is a natural part of life.</i>

186
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,994
<i>Anxiety about this
is an inbuilt survival reflex,</i>

187
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,076
<i>no longer required in this beautiful
predator-free world.</i>

188
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,910
Welcome to the country.

189
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,356
I'll do it, then, shall I?

190
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,119
Yeah, well done.

191
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,598
What's your nana up to
this weekend, Mikey?

192
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,149
She's off on a cruise
while the builders are in.

193
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,276
What builders?

194
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,352
Oh, they'll be gone by the time
we come out of the pub.

195
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,398
What about when they're back
at dawn and start drilling holes?

196
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,358
- She doesn't know we're coming.
- Well... I did say...

197
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,832
- You fuckin' idiot.
- Listen, man, I know where the key is!

198
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,150
Jesus! This gets better and better.

199
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,551
I might just stay on the minibus
and wait for the return trip.

200
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,157
Gentlemen, you are all past
the point of no return.

201
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,550
Oh, for fuck's sake, Mikey.

202
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,517
It's not me. It's not me!

203
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,555
Hello? Yeah...

204
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,075
I told you I'd sign the papers.

205
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,310
Solicitors always say that.

206
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
I can't do nothing today.
I'm not in London.

207
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,874
Moodley... Moodley!

208
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,235
What do you mean it's a shit hole?

209
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,437
Hello? Hello?

210
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,034
<i>Not my PS...</i>

211
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,909
That's it. Give us that fucking thing.
I've had enough of this!

212
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,875
- I'm not having this.
- What are you gonna do?

213
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,079
- All the phones, off, in this bag.
- What?!

214
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,879
- OK? All of you. Come on!
- No, no, no, no.

215
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,555
Getting away from it all doesn't include
spousal abuse by T-Mobile.

216
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,712
- See you, darling.
- I need to ring my mum.

217
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,156
- You've got mine already.
- In the bag, sunshine.

218
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,114
- Ladies first.
- After you, then.

219
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,591
All right.

220
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,350
Mikey?! Is this it?

221
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,513
- Please tell me you took a wrong turn.
- Told you the place was a dead end.

222
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,240
Is that it? Is this?

223
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,197
Mikey!

224
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,035
We're in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

225
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,318
I'd leave all that, Mikey,
till we've done a bit of reconnaissance.

226
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,156
- We might not be staying.
- What do you mean not staying?

227
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,392
I'm off the clock for half an hour,
then I'm leaving...

228
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,551
...with or without you.

229
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,477
Fiddlesticks!

230
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,751
On your head!

231
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,238
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You idiot!

232
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,909
I'm sure this place used to be bigger
when I was, err... little.

233
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,432
Looks like the whole village
has fucked off with your nan.

234
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,591
Where's all the women, then?

235
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,990
When were you last here, Mikey?

236
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,836
- Well, it's been a few years.
- Right, come on. First things first.

237
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,516
Mikey, you break into your nan's house
and make sure I've got a bed for tonight.

238
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,752
The rest of us can get the beers in
at the... Cock & Bull,

239
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,514
and drink until Moodley
starts looking like Barbados.

240
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,671
And someone
go get Candy down for a drink.

241
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,512
I'll go.

242
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,309
Neil, if she sees you,
she's liable to drive away with our stuff.

243
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,790
What are you talking about?
Women love me.

244
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,313
Really

245
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,711
You are a long way from
your sports car, though, aren't you?

246
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,913
I'm gonna go for a slash.
Get us a pint of the usual.

247
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,799
Oh, no, put your money away, Neil.
My shout

248
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,997
Knob.

249
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,356
Wow...

250
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,031
"Vote Meg Nut".

251
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,953
Meg Nut... Nut-meg...

252
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,996
"Sponsored by Wundawash. "

253
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,639
Ew!

254
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,396
Oh, shit.

255
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,473
Ew!

256
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,515
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,556
Oh, thank you, gnomie.

258
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,793
Hello?

259
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,157
I can't believe we jumped
on one of Mikey's schemes.

260
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,074
- His heart's in the right place.
- Shame his head is up his arse.

261
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,232
Come on, Pat.
Liven yourself up. Get 'em in.

262
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,755
Neil, Do you see any bar staff?

263
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,593
I think I just saw one in the khazi,
chucking up.

264
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,311
- Maybe they're all sick.
- What the fuck is that horrible stench?

265
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,552
It's the smoking ban, mate.
Get rid of the all the puffers,

266
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,395
you'll find out what a pub really
smells like - stale beer and piss.

267
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,994
No. It's something else.

268
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,352
Where the fuck's Matt?

269
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,195
All right, calm down.
You sound like a dolphin.

270
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,078
Idiot.

271
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,800
Look at that.

272
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,914
It's a knob in a box.

273
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,437
This is a joke, right?

274
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,317
Don't...

275
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,635
Hey, back up. Back up.

276
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,028
I will...

277
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,591
Looks like there is
life on Mars, after all.

278
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,158
- What's the matter with her?
- I think she's homeless.

279
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,757
300 miles from London, the only
person we see is selling the Big Issue.

280
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,833
- Let's get some change.
- I've got some, I've got some.

281
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,433
Ooh!

282
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,795
Hey! Hey!

283
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,158
Go Vince!

284
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,835
- It's not what it looks like, mate!
- Yeah?

285
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,110
Matt, call the police!

286
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,433
Go, Graham. Hit him!

287
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,075
Go on! Somebody else hit him!

288
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,755
Put the knife down, mate.

289
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,354
Put the knife down!

290
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,595
You lot, just listen to me!

291
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,997
- Hey, watch!
- She stabbed me!

292
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,912
All right, hey, hey!

293
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,876
- Oi! Oi!
- What are you doing?!

294
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,876
- Can we talk about this?
- Hang on, hang on.

295
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,433
Jesus...

296
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,197
- What... What's wrong with her?
- What do you mean?

297
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,239
She's like Evil Dead in your shop,
those things with the claws and teeth!

298
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,190
And she's not the only one.

299
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,394
Look! Look at that. Look, look.

300
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,874
- Back on the bus, then, eh?
- Yes, yes!

301
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,269
- What about Action Man?
- Oh, shit.

302
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,590
Come on! Leave him!

303
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,672
Candy, start her up, baby.
We're leaving.

304
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,200
Let's go somewhere else, then.

305
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,552
Yeah, OK.

306
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,552
Where's your nan's house, Mike?

307
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,233
Mike, your nan's house!

308
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,479
OK, uh...

309
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,074
Let's take the scenic route.

310
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,150
Mikey... Get his gun.

311
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,191
YOU get it.

312
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,629
It's empty.

313
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,438
Oh, mate...

314
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,477
That is not cool...

315
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,790
Look at the state of him.

316
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,955
What?

317
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,391
He said, "Don't go in the woods. "

318
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,596
- Why?
- Why you asking me?

319
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,675
What's in the woods?

320
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,308
Everything... you've ever been afraid of.

321
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,432
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

322
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,470
Quick, quick, Graham!

323
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,598
- Open the fucking door!
- I'm gonna do it when I get the key!

324
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,479
These are multi-combat trousers!
They've got 11 pockets!

325
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,670
You missed her!

326
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,279
Open the fucking door!

327
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,433
- Vince!
- What?

328
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,794
Help me!

329
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,871
- I've got the key!
- OPEN IT, THEN!

330
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,630
Shut the back door!

331
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,999
Oi, oi!

332
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,116
They're moving away!

333
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,035
All right, you funny cunts,
how's this supposed to cheer me up?

334
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,757
- Phones are dead.
- "Let's put all the mobiles in a bag. "

335
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,912
- Good idea, Neil!
- You wanna talk about this some more?

336
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,675
Let's talk about the unliveable state
of this house we're staying in.

337
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,274
OK, back door's locked, kettle is on.

338
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,919
Neil.

339
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,234
- They're not coming back.
- So what's going on here?

340
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,232
It could be some kind of
chemical spillage.

341
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,834
Maybe one of the streams
has been polluted.

342
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,036
Patrick, when was the last time

343
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,512
you saw pollution turn somebody
into an axe murderer?

344
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,069
Candy didn't even get off the bus
and she still turned into that.

345
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,795
- So it must be in the air.
- Why haven't we got it? And him?

346
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,839
- Maybe only women get it.
- What kind of virus only affects women?

347
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,113
Bird flu.

348
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,156
So where did all the men go?

349
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,799
Shh!

350
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,879
Shh, shh, shh...

351
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,553
No, no, no, no!

352
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,798
What is it?

353
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,834
Are you fucking retarded?

354
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,150
All the men are dead.

355
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,915
- Sit down, Andy McNabb.
- Easy, mate. I'm not the enemy.

356
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,469
- Really? See, I think you are.
- Right...

357
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,996
We demand an explanation!

358
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,594
Is it a biological weapon
gone out of control?

359
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,432
It's classified is what it is.

360
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,319
It's hardly classified, mate,
it's running about in stilettos!

361
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,631
- I said sit down.
- Or what? Or what?

362
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,030
Oi! Oi! Oi!

363
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,191
Kettle's boiled.

364
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,234
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Gavin Wright.

365
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,870
We don't give fuck about your rank.
We want an explanation.

366
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,508
- It's virus.
- Why aren't we infected?

367
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,592
I thought you'd worked this one out.
Only women get it.

368
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,228
- Why?
- Just luck.

369
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,755
Oh, that's not funny. Is there a cure?

370
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,559
I don't think anybody
survived long enough to try.

371
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,518
But that's not my department.
I'm just here to shoot them.

372
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,957
- What?
- How did it start?

373
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,315
The only questions you need to ask are,

374
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,074
"How many are there?"
and, "Are they in our way?"

375
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,832
So, how many are there?

376
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,275
The whole village
has gone over to the dark side.

377
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,749
Most of them are out in the woods.

378
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,037
So if you're thinking
of hiking out of here, think again.

379
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,589
What the fuck are they doing
in the woods?

380
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,958
Maybe they're all taking a shit.
Women like to go to the toilet together.

381
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,715
What do you think they're doing?
They're looking for fresh meat.

382
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,029
- So what's your exit plan?
- Same as yours.

383
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,397
Get on the minibus
and fuck off out the way you came in.

384
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,233
Well, there's little problem
with your plan, Marvin.

385
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,076
Bad Candy lives on that bus.
And she's got a little skin complaint.

386
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,111
When she gets off the bus, start running
and don't stop until you hear the horn.

387
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,157
We'll come back and pick you up.

388
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,993
Why are you so sure
she's gonna follow me?

389
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,071
Women love you.

390
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,519
If you have to kill her, just do it.
She's not Candy anymore.

391
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,433
She never was. Her name's Ruth.

392
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,795
- Whatever.
- Well, stop calling her Candy.

393
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,838
Neil, now is not the time
to stop objectifying women.

394
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,672
Be new man tomorrow.

395
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,675
Today, we need you to be the misogynist
Neanderthal arsehole we know and love.

396
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,276
- You could get this virus next...
- Fuck off.

397
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,396
You even hit like a girl.

398
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,031
- What are you doing?
- Fucking go.

399
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,236
- Liberty-taker.
- Hurry up!

400
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,277
All right, I'm going.

401
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,108
Come on... Come and have a nibble.

402
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,714
You know you want it.

403
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,151
Bollocks.

404
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,113
Get off the...

405
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,352
- Go! Go!
- Quick, hurry up!

406
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,471
Get the phones!

407
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,039
Someone get the phones!

408
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,799
Bastards!

409
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,115
Aaargh! Fuckin' hell!

410
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,471
Oh, man. We are dog meat.

411
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,600
They're everywhere!

412
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,671
- Shit...
- Oh, man!

413
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,873
Julie?

414
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,519
Do you know her?

415
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,153
Yeah, yeah...
We had thing once, it didn't end well.

416
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,919
- I'm gonna be sick.
- How do you think I feel?!

417
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,991
The phones...
I've got the fucking phones!

418
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,718
Shit...

419
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,709
- Do something! You're the soldier!
- Look at the fucking size of her!

420
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,232
Oh, no...

421
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,118
Get her off me!

422
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,076
Look out, Vince. Look out!

423
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,598
Fuck! Come on!

424
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,639
Yeah!

425
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,758
Oh, look at your teeth!

426
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,111
Fuckin' hell! Patrick!

427
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,873
Ooh... Ow!

428
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,512
- We should start placing bets.
- My money's on that one.

429
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,517
Let's go!

430
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,037
Everyone stay together!

431
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,676
Here, here! Quick, come on.

432
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,232
Ow!

433
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,551
Fuckin' hell.

434
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,317
Argh! Argh! Argh!

435
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,472
She'll be through that freakin' window
in a minute. Grab anything you can.

436
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,637
- Vince!
- What?

437
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,674
Still in its original packaging!

438
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,792
Weapons, Matt.
Grab any weapons you can.

439
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,269
Not fuckin' robots.

440
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,476
All right... I'm looking.

441
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,076
Did you lock that?

442
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,079
Matt! Matt!

443
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,912
Where are you going? Matt!

444
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,711
I'm coming!

445
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,837
Weapons... Weapons...

446
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,791
Matt! Matt!

447
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,758
- What are you doing?
- Give us a lighter!

448
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,070
In me pocket...
THE OTHER POCKET!

449
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,916
Get back. If they can't see us,
they'll forget we're in here.

450
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,753
- That's optimistic, innit?
- They are easily confused.

451
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,515
NOW you decide to shoot someone,
you fucking monkey's arse-ring.

452
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,193
You had a gun all along?

453
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,357
I was saving the last bullet
for when I needed it.

454
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,238
You're still a twat.

455
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,638
Fuck, I think you've just sent out
a party invite.

456
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,309
Do they sell petrol in toy shops?

457
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,879
No.

458
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,998
It's Nitro Fluid for radio-controlled cars.

459
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,997
Don't you know anything?!

460
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,676
I know we need to be tooled up with
something that wasn't made in Taiwan.

461
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,234
Who taught you to drive?
Let me have a go.

462
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,593
Get off!

463
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,558
Reverse. Reverse. Over here!

464
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,033
<i>Hello? Are we in there?</i>

465
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,476
<i>- I take it you're in a toy shop.
- Who's there? Is Neil there?</i>

466
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,790
No, just me, Mikey
and the Milky Bar Kid.

467
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,757
- My name's Gavin.
- Whatever.

468
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,832
The speed Neil was running,
he's probably halfway home.

469
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,471
SPACE'S
"FEMALE OF THE SPECIES")

470
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,872
Mmm...

471
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,198
<i># A thousand thundering thrills await me</i>

472
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,954
<i># Facing insurmountable odds, greatly #</i>

473
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,917
You're so sexy, do you know that?

474
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,390
<i># The female of the species
is more deadly... #</i>

475
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,030
Why don't we forget about all this?
This finger food.

476
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,591
That's a really lovely spread.

477
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,752
But why don't we
just take this upstairs, eh?

478
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,316
We're both adults.

479
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,437
I'm a man...

480
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,949
You're a...

481
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,557
You're a woman.

482
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,951
This could be the start
of something special - you and me...

483
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,269
All you've gotta do...

484
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,635
...is... untie me, yeah?

485
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,475
Just untie me, please.

486
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,556
Come on, then. Come on!

487
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,478
No, no, don't do that. No.

488
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,633
<i>Fear and panic
are only chemicals within your body.</i>

489
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,588
<i>Anxiety is nothing more
than a chemical reaction.</i>

490
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,558
So, what's the plan?

491
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,750
What do you mean what's the plan?

492
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,070
<i>The plan. What's the plan?</i>

493
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,038
- I haven't got one. What's yours?
- I've got a plan.

494
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,158
What's all this bollocks
with the walkie-talkies, then?

495
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,676
Just fancied a chat about
something other than Star Wars.

496
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,956
Oh... How is Matt?

497
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,436
Yeah, the force is with him.

498
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,916
- Oi!
- What?

499
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,593
I said I've got a plan.

500
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,519
Go on, then.

501
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,148
You're the double hard bastard.
You do it.

502
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,197
It's your plan, arsehole.

503
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,396
You two are so gay!

504
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,596
Your mum's an arsehole.

505
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,870
The payload has been delivered.

506
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,519
<i>What?</i>

507
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,830
The head's in the truck, man.
You ready?

508
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,912
We're gonna need a diversion
for our diversion.

509
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,399
I'm on it.

510
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,754
Come and get your meals on wheels.

511
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,152
No!

512
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,639
Fuck off!

513
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,909
Do the horn.

514
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,039
You're not getting the better of me.

515
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,711
Turn it, you're gonna go
out of range!

516
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,110
I'm turning it. I'm turning it!

517
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,396
Get off!

518
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,678
Oh, f... No!

519
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,194
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Fuckin' hell.

520
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,110
Fucking thing!

521

<i>- How could things get any worse?

522
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,232
<i>- Yeah?

523
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,599
Great.

524
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,511
Mm... Yum...

525
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,510
Yum!

526
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,674
<i>Mik ey?</i>

527
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,637
<i>Mik ey?</i>

528
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,552
Mikey!

529
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,073
Fuck.

530
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,754
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, wait. Wait.

531
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,798
I am not going out there half-cocked.

532
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,036
Let's party.

533
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,311
Where's mine?

534
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,195
Well, there's only one.

535
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,750
No, look, got a spare.

536
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,079
No?

537
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,030
All right, you can have my backup.

538
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,273
What's this?

539
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,910
I will make you feel sexy.

540
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,353
Yeah!

541
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,230
Right, then. Come on, Vince.
Me and you - Butch and Sundance!

542
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,073
- They both died.
- Yeah!

543
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,834
- Come on, you gimp. Let's go.
- Yeah!

544
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,592
Woo-hoo!

545
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,955
Aaaargh!

546
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,679
Aargh!

547
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,914
Do your fire thing! Do the fire thing!

548
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,399
Hurry up!

549
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,479
Oh!

550
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,599
Oh, shit!

551
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,832
Argh!

552
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,072
Ta.

553
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,639
What do we do now?

554
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,190
We do what everyone else does,
when they're facing mortality.

555
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,032
Run.

556
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,595
Wait, wait.
I bet you a tenner it's locked.

557
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,280
- Bollocks.
- You owe me tenner.

558
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,316
Oh, my God.

559
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,508
Look, look.

560
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,197
<i>Mik ey? Neil? Is anyone there?</i>

561
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,309
<i>- Where's the walkie-talkie?
- Lads, can you hear me?</i>

562
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,075
<i>Me and Matt, we're in the church
but we've lock ed the doors.</i>

563
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,631
<i>So if you get over here, please
just let me know. Try and get over here.</i>

564
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,231
We have to get out of here.

565
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,790
Let's follow your mates over
to the church. It's our best chance.

566
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,872
I think it's a bit late
to start praying, don't you?

567
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,833
You feeling all right, mate?

568
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,389
I have just had a genius idea.

569
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,111
- Is everyone ready?
- You're loving this, aren't you?

570
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,271
- Garry?
- It's Gavin.

571
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,476
Let's just get it over with.

572
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,634
- What?
- You've done this before, haven't you?

573
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,076
- Don't get any funny ideas
- Don't worry, he's not a lesbian.

574
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,755
- Is this gonna work or what?
- Let's try.

575
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,950
Here she is!

576
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,874
<i>Vince, open the church door.</i>

579
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,119
No, no, no! Don't go in there!
Don't go in there!

580
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,957
Wait! That's my nine iron.

581
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,279
Come on!

582
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,310
- Oh, Christ, it's the ex.
- Vince, we're outside. Open the door.

583
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,914
Don't move, just keep smiling.

584
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,071
Our clothes are in there! Shit!

585
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,437
Oh, for fuck's sake, Julie.
We split up, get over it!

586
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,111
All right, gays... guys!

587
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,829
- Where did you come from?
- I took the scenic route.

588
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,877
Come on.

589
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,991
I hate you. I hate you.

590
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,950
Why don't you just sit on me
and get it over with, you fat fucking pig!

591
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,431
Vince.

592
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,275
- I really wanna go home.
- OK. OK, let's go.

593
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,151
Let's go home.

594
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,956
<i>Vince, are you taking piss?
This isn't funny any more.</i>

595
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,350

- Hold on, we're coming.</i>

596

- What are they doing?

597
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,633
- What are you doing...
- What the fuck's this?!

598
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,473
- Shh, don't laugh at me!
- Neil! Neil!

599
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,313

00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,477
<i>- There's nothing up here.
- Come back, then.</i>

624
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,959
We're nearly there.

625
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,475
- Ahh!
- Oh, shut up, you girl.

626
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,470
<i>That's it.</i>

627
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,596
Talking of girls...

628
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,638
There's not even a spare
choir-boy outfit up there.

629
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,360
Sit down, silly-bollocks,
you look gorgeous.

630
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:14,038
- I think that butcher took a shine to you.
- Nah, she's not my type, that one.

631
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,838
What about one of the others?

632
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,117
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Don't you ever have a day off?

633
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,193
There were three kinky birds
in that house.

634
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,749
For second, I thought, you know...

635
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,629
as long as they don't start
with that sicking-up bollocks...

636
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,189
The one with the, um,
scissors is pretty fit.

637
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,433
She'll have your bollocks for earrings
before you've even bought her a drink.

638
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,239
- I like the one with the axe.
- She's married.

639
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,631
I can't believe this!
You people have no respect for women.

640
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,873
Oh, come on, Graham.
That's why you bat for the other side?

641
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,270
All women are mental.

642
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,752
You can't make that kind of sweeping
generalisation about an entire gender.

643
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,718
Why not? Look at us.

644
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,919
Look at Vince. His glory days are over.
His missus did that to him.

645
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,789
He was king when he met her.
She turned him into a fucking ghost.

646
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,238
We brought him out here to convince
him that all women aren't out to get him.

647
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,197
Yeah, thanks for that, lads.

648
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,590
It's all gone really fuckin' well, innit?

649
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,799
- What are you looking for?
- Yes.

650
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,837
This.

651
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,991
I've done it!

652
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,957
Right.

653
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,997
Wow, we've got the whole village
under surveillance.

654
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,480
<i>Well, it's about time.</i>

655
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,154
<i>You've been offline for nearly 24 hours.</i>

656
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,279
<i>And why was my so-called escort
called back to Moodley last night,</i>

657
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,557
<i>and left me chained
to the fucking briefcase?</i>

658
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,315
That's Meg Nut from the poster, look.

659
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,831
<i>Who are you?</i>

660
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,872
<i>You're not inv olved
with Project Cat-house.</i>

661
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,156
<i>Where's the Colonel?</i>

662
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,514
- Get her back.
- It's on fire.

663
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,798
It's happening.

664
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,832
- What's happening?
- Phase II.

665
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,675
Hold on a minute. What's Phase I?

666
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,389
Sickness, disorientation, psychosis.

667
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,471
Phase II is the mutation.

668
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,633
They're gonna get smarter,
faster and weirder.

669
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,628
- What's that?
- It's called The Dolphin.

670
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,872
There are high-frequency
sonic deterrents all over the village,

671
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,235
emitting painful sound
only women can hear.

672
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,995
- So there was a fail-safe all along.
- It only works after Phase II.

673
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,277
- Obviously.
- Well, stop talking and press the button.

674
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,796
- Is it working?
- I dunno.

675
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,677
Can YOU hear it?

676
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,316
Um, that doesn't work, does it?

677
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,869
This isn't funny.
They'll be relentless now.

678
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,871
They hunt in packs. We are fucked!

679
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,670
For the sake of clarity, we're not dealing
with few insane women any more.

680
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,070
What you boys
have actually created here

681
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,472
is an army of pissed off,
man-hating, feminist cannibals.

682
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,997
This biological weapon can turn one half
of the population against the other.

683
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,631
- We can fight wars with no armies.
- So this is a test run?

684
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,553
You set the virus loose
in an isolated little village

685
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,790
and then sit and watch it on the telly?

686
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,236
They used to do this kind of thing
in the '50s with LSD.

687
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,597
Thanks, Matthew. What does
Meg Nut have to do with this?

688
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,356
- Not much. She's just a delivery girl.
- Yeah. But delivering WHAT?

689
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,671
How fucking stupid are you people?
What do you think?

690
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,831
A free box of Wundawash?

691
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,239
The virus
is in the washing powder, look.

692
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,913
It's biological.

693
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,278
Everybody, get back.

694
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,789
- Leave her out of it. That's my nan.
- I thought she was on a cruise.

695
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,678
Yeah... So did I.

696
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,476
Matt. Matt, no!

697
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,229
You've, um...

698
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,356
There's some stuff on your face.

699
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,595
All right, Matt?

700
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,076
Thank you.

701
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,360
Don't go in there, Matt.
It's the mortuary.

702
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,351
I think he's traumatised.

703
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,752
I'm the one who's fucking traumatised!
Look what he did to my nan.

704
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,990
Matt? Matt?

705
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,912
Matt...

706
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,358
Vince. Run, run!

707
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,550
What's happened?

708
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,438
Is he all right?

709
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,511
No.

710
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,148
So, where is he, then?

711
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,754
He's dead.

712
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,951
Come on!

713
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,751
That's for Matt...

714
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,796
...bitch.

715
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,111
Shit, shit...

716
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,714
- Look at the state of him.
- We can't just leave him here.

717
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,872
What, in mortuary
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

718
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,589
I'm just as freaked out as you are.

719
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,757
What was that?

720
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,637
Vince, don't go down there,
that's how she got in.

721
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,878
Yeah, and it might be our only way out.

722
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,232
Ew...

723
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,317
- It's the other half of Moodley.
- Jesus, it's all the men.

724
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,278
- You mean parts of them.
- It's a nest.

725
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,791
Come on, come on!

726
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,990
- Get up, come on!
- Get up!

727
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,231
Get up the stairs! Come on!

728
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,236
Vince, Vince! Come on!

729
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,358
- Neil! Neil!
- Close the door!

730
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,192
Neil, give us a hand with this!

731
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,956
Hurry up, will ya?

732
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,474
Oi, what are you pair of tarts
doing up there?

733
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,632
Banksy, what time do you call this?

734
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,314
You would not believe
the shit day I've had.

735
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,156
- What's going on?
- Listen, soft-lad,

736
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,598
outside Mikey's nan's house, there's
a big ladder, go and bring it back here.

737
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,512
What's with the...

738
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,956
- Get the fucking ladder, soppy bollocks.
- Hurry up.

739
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,032
All right, all right,
don't get all aggressive.

740
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,915
Fuck, help me out!

741
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,799
- Get your ass outside.
- I think I'll stay a bit.

742
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,191
Get your ass outside now.
Go, fuck off.

743
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,758
Pat, go on.

744
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,911
- All right?
- Vince?

745
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,991
Hurry up!

746
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,636
I can see your bikini line from here.
What's with the frock?

747
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,040
- What are you doing?
- Vince said a get ladder.

748
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,998
So we can get down, you plank,
not so you can get up.

749
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,799
- What's happening?
- All the women have gone evil.

750
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,430
One of them ate Neil's finger,
Matt killed me nan with a nine iron

751
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,229
and now he's dead, and we need
to get down the sodding ladder. Down.

752
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,516
You lot been taking drugs?

753
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,677
- You got some left?
- Get down, get down!

754
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,558
Move, move!

755
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,316
Go back up!

756
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,032
We're alive!

757
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,432
Let go!

758
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,232
Who's the monster?

759
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,960
- What are you still doing here?
- Wishing I wasn't.

760
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,959
- Come on!
- Come on, Pat. Come here.

761
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,998
- Come on, Pat.
- Watch his leg!

762
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,638
- Graham, come on, let's go.
- You go.

763
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,268
I'm right behind you.

764
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,398
Fuck me.

765
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,598
Fuckin' hell.

766
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,832
This is worse than
the fucking Pamplona Bull Run.

767
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,271
Fuckin' hell!

768
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,438
Jesus!

769
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,390
- Get the ladder. Get the ladder.
- What's this one?

770
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,792
Come on!

771
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,591
- Come on!
- Vince, Vince...

772
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,199
- Banksy, give us your phone.
- I left it at home.

773
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,669
Right, of course, yeah...

774
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,432
Where are you parked, then?

775
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,239
Behind the big billboard lying
across the street.

776
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,551
What's that?

777
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,632
- It's a rental.
- It's a rental?

778
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,034
What do you mean it's a rental?
Where's your van?

779
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,191
- It broke down, I forgot.
- You forgot?

780
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,715
Repeating everything I say
ain't gonna help, Vince.

781
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,440
What's not gonna help
is that fuckin' moon buggy.

782
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,319
Maybe we can squeeze in.
I'll sit on someone's lap.

783
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,917
Shut up. Forget it, it's too small.
Why did you even get here?

784
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,038
- What are you trying to say?
- This trip was bad a idea.

785
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,031
No... really

786
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,239
- It could be worse.
- It could be worse?

787
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,710
How many fingers am I holding up?
They're fucking eating us!

788
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,429
- How can it get any worse?
- Can everyone shut the fuck up?

789
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,833
Cracking skulls open with a nine iron
is not my idea of golfing holiday!

790
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,629
But this is not Mikey's fault,
and it's not Banksy's.

791
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,360
I'm sure as fucking shit,
it's not mine either.

792
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,351
Relax... Relax...

793
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:28,360
Now, we all need to work together
to facilitate some kind of positive -

794
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,593
and I mean POSITIVE escape scenario,
'cause I'm not dying in this shit hole!

795
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,393
<i>There's nothing wrong
with you that can't be fixed with a smile.</i>

796
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,671
Get on the bus.

797
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,918
Come on!

798
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,917
Ruth!

799
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,712
Banksy!

800
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,757
Banksy!

801
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,478
Banksy!

802
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,318
Come on! I've had enough
of standing here!

803
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,472
I'll fuckin stick it in ya!
I'll fucking stick it in ya!

804
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,596
Get in the fucking bus!

805
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,274
I'm fucking sick of it! Fuck!

806
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,356
Come on, Vince, let's go!
Let's go!

807
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,715
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.

808
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,830
What, now? Can't it wait?

809
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,353
No.

810
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,875
Well, it's about fucking time.

811
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,875
Anyone seen me lighter?

812
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,156
Where's me lighter?

813
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,752
Oi, look after it next time, yeah?

814
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,758
You know, I always thought you two
were completely fucking useless.

815
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,310
You - you just follow your dick
like it's a fucking compass.

816
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,359
And you - you're letting your marriage
slip through your fucking fingers.

817
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,829
Neither of you
know anything about women.

818
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,039
- So why are you two still fuckin' alive?
- We're not gonna be for much longer,

819
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,998
if you don't stop yapping
and get us out of here!

820
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:54,036
The rest of us, we try to do everything
by the book - and we get shafted.

821
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,589
We try to be what they want us to be.

822
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:03,108
You know, we become reliable,
mature, domesticated.

823
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,356
And then what happens?

824
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,512
They get bored -
that's what happens.

825
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:17,790
If all women really want is pet,
why don't they buy a fucking Labrador?

826
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,833
I've had enough,
being told to sit, and lie down,

827
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,753
and roll over, and play dead.

828
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,238
From now on,
what you see is what you get.

829
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,472
For fuck's sake!

830
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,279
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.

831
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,433
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.

832
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,070
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.

833
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,233
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.

834
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,230
Whoo!

835
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,790
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.

836
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,236
Whoa, easy, easy!

837
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,232
Oh, my God!

838
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,437
What was that?

839
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,556
Fat bird.

840
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,030
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.

841
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,756
<i>Hello, hello...</i>

842
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,951
<i>Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

843
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,317
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?

844
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,552
In the nest with the stiffs.

845
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,711
<i>Where are you?</i>

846
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,077
Coming to get you, silly twat.

847
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,077
Let's do it.

848
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,149
Ew...

849
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,236
Who's your favourite Spice Girl?

850
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,798
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,

851
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,077
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,

852
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,268
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?

853
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,953
Yeah.

854
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,074
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?

855
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,356
Pass one of them golf clubs.

856
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,353
No, give me a wood.

857
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,511
Give him wood as well.

858
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,190
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.

859
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,476
But I've got the hump.

860
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,633
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion

861
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,872
and... present company
excepted, of course,

862
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,158
bash the living shit
out of anything in a dress.

863
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,356
Bloody hell, Vince...

864
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,916
...not very PC is it?

865
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,749
Come on.

866
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,872
Let's have it!

867
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,192
Now what?

868
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,235
Oi, oi!

869
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,236
You all right?

870
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,031
I've got it working.

871
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,077
Let me see that, let me see that.

872
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,514
Ahh!

873
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,677
Remote-controlled women.

874
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,798
- Do it again, Neil!
- Oh, my word!

875
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,199
Take that.

876
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,639
Get in there, Graham.

877
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,751
Be careful, Neil.

878
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,078
Whoa!

879
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,078
Oh, I'm lovin' this.
Absolutely lovin' it.

880
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,232
Lovely little thing,
ain't you, sweetheart, eh?

881
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,471
Whoa, whoa!

882
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,277
Vince, you got to have
a bang on this, mate. Just have a bang!

883
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,433
Bollocks!

884
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,559
Go!
