::::::::: (25 fps) ::::::::::::

1
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:37,724
And now, from New York,
<i>The Jerry Langford Show,</i>

2
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:42,164
with Jerry's guests:
Tony Randall, Richard Dreyfuss,

3
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:47,002
Rodney Dangerfield, Dr Joyce Brothers,
Lou Brown and the orchestra,

4
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:49,726
and little old me, Ed Herlihy.

5
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:53,083
And now say hello to Jerry!

6
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:17,959
Thank you. Good evening.
You look like a great audience.

7
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:22,359
Louis, how are you? Lou Brown
and the marvellous Langford orchestra.

8
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,722
Group.

9
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,276
- Ed, how are you tonight?
- Very well.

10
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:31,165
Wonderful. I'm sorry I woke you.

11
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:34,239
I shall adhere to your request, sir.

12
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:44,725
You want Jerry's autograph?
Gimme the books.

13
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:47,037
Gimme the books, gimme the books. OK.

14
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:52,799
- Have him write something personal.
- Half an hour. Goodbye.

15
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,956
I'll give you Mia Farrow for it.

16
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:03,006
I'm not gonna give you anything else.
I'm not wasting my time going in to get it.

17
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,521
- Hi, Rupert.
- Hello, Rupert.

18
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:07,006
- Who'd you get?
- Nobody.

19
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,726
I got Rodney Dangerfield. I'll trade for Barbra.

20
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:13,004
- You're wasting your time.
- Robin Williams.

21
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,237
Sidney, it's not my whole life.

22
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:17,841
That supposed to mean it's <i>my</i> whole life?

23
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:21,920
It's not my whole life. It's yours, but not mine.

24
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,998
Jerry!

25
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:50,238
Don't go, Jerry!

26
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:02,037
Will you stop shoving, please?
Will you stop pushing?

27
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:08,277
I'm not gonna take this, Jerry! No!

28
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:40,960
Please.

29
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:53,760
OK! Stand back! Stand back!
Please let Mr Langford get some air!

30
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:03,117
Didn't you get my message?

31
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:19,558
Jerry, I'm sorry. I don't mean to disturb you.
I just wanna talk to you for a minute.

32
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,366
- This is not the time.
- If we could just drive away.

33
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,642
You can drop me off anywhere.

34
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:28,003
No, I have a very strict rule
about people getting in the car.

35
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:32,797
I hate to bring this up, and I don't mean to be
rude, but I did put myself on the line for you.

36
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:34,878
Go ahead, Harvey. Hit it.

37
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,084
Here.

38
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,158
Thanks.

39
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,238
- Is that your initials?
- Yeah.

40
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,879
I just wanna tell you,
my name is Rupert Pupkin.

41
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:59,961
I know the name doesn't mean very much
to you, but it means an awful lot to me.

42
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,443
- Calm down. Take your time.
- I'm a little nervous.

43
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:10,396
You might have wondered who I am.
I've been outside your show many times.

44
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:15,561
I'm in communications now, but the point I'm
trying to make is by nature I'm a comedian.

45
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:20,801
You're gonna say "Not another one."
But, believe me, I'm very good. I'm dynamite.

46
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:24,800
I wouldn't take one minute of your time
if I wasn't convinced I'm dynamite.

47
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:28,926
You're probably wondering "If he's so good,
how come he hasn't caught my act?"

48
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:32,716
That's a very good question,
and I'll tell you why. You know why?

49
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:38,279
I've been biding my time, slowly and
carefully, so that when my big break came...

50
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:41,723
Like the night when Jack Paar got sick?
Your big break?

51
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:45,038
That was the night that convinced me
I wanted to be a comedian.

52
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,561
I walked out of that show
like I was in a dream.

53
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,798
After that, I caught
all your guest appearances on <i>Sullivan.</i>

54
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,244
I studied everything you did. The way
you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed.

55
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,478
How you delivered the jokes
without leaning too much on 'em.

56
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:01,206
How you didn't say
"Folks, here's the punch line."

57
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,642
You know what I'm talking about?

58
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:07,436
You don't say "Folks, here's the punch line."
You just do the punch line.

59
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:10,041
Exactly. That's what I loved
about what you did.

60
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:13,563
So what I'm trying to say is that,
you see, now I'm ready.

61
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,956
I'm ready, and I've finished the course.

62
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:21,041
And I'm thinking as I'm sitting here now,
maybe this is my big break, my big chance.

63
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,516
You know what I mean?

64
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,116
What do you think?

65
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,761
- What'd you say your name was?
- Rupert Pupkin.

66
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:39,797
This is a crazy business, but it's not unlike
any other business. There are ground rules.

67
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,596
You don'tjust walk on
to a network show without experience.

68
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:48,681
It's an old hackneyed expression, but it's
the truth: You've got to start at the bottom.

69
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:52,362
- That's where I am, at the bottom.
- That's a perfect place to start.

70
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,881
I know that, but... There's gotta be a...

71
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:59,597
It looks so simple to the viewer at home,
those things that come so easily,

72
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:03,566
that are so relaxed and look like
it's a matter ofjust taking another breath.

73
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:07,686
It takes years and years and years
of honing that and working it and...

74
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:11,806
There's only one problem.
I don't mean to interrupt you. I'm 34 years old.

75
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:17,484
That's why I'm asking you if you'll listen to
my act and tell me what you think about it.

76
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,957
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you call my office?

77
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,039
You ask for Cathy Long. She's my secretary.

78
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:27,403
And we'll make time to listen to you.

79
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:29,921
I've had this conversation in my head.

80
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:33,397
- Did it always turn out this way?
- Yeah, it did.

81
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:40,204
I really believe this. I think once you get over
the initial shyness, you're gonna be OK.

82
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:44,997
- I hope it works out for you.
- Thanks, Jerry. Thanks a lot.

83
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,123
It's a pleasure meeting you, Jerry.

84
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,606
Jerry?

85
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:52,999
I'm short on cash, but if you don't mind just
appetisers, I'll take you to dinner sometime.

86
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:56,636
I got people waiting. I don't know
what my schedule is. Maybe we can.

87
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,160
Thanks, Jerry, thanks.

88
00:09:58,247 --> 00:09:59,805
Jerry! Jerry.

89
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:02,606
Let me show you a picture
of my pride and joy.

90
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,601
That's good.

91
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,042
Hey, Jerry, take it.

92
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:13,802
Take it. Go ahead. Take it.
Consider it a gift. It'll work for you.

93
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:18,355
- I will.
- Not that you need the help.

94
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:21,644
Jerry. Seriously,
you ever want lunch, my treat.

95
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,597
- Call my office.
- OK, OK, OK.

96
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:26,597
OK.

97
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,678
Jerry, you're a prince.

98
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:46,595
Hey, Rupe, before I forget,
I really appreciate you meeting me for lunch.

99
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,680
I know how busy you are
and how tired you are.

100
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,565
What are friends for, Jerry?

101
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,281
You're the one who looks tired.

102
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,756
Yeah, I know. It's the show.

103
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:06,520
The pressure, the ratings,
the same guests, same questions...

104
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:14,000
- I'm just not enjoying it any more.
- That's... the worst.

105
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:20,676
Listen, I really wish
you would think about it again, OK?

106
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,565
You're starting again.
You're starting up again.

107
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:27,276
- It's not that big a deal to think.
- I am thinking. I'm thinking.

108
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,881
That's all I do, is think day and night.

109
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,606
How can I not think about it?
I'm here at lunch with you,

110
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:35,360
which I knew was the reason you invited me,

111
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,439
and all I'm sitting here for
is to get guilty with you.

112
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:42,884
I'm asking you to take over the show
for six weeks. I mean, what's six weeks?

113
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:47,643
Anything, but don't ask me to do six weeks.
I can't take over the show for six weeks.

114
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,161
I can't even take over
my own life for six weeks.

115
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:53,000
And you're asking me to do
something that's impossible!

116
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,442
- It's impossible.
- Rupert!

117
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:58,678
- What?
- What are you doing down there so late?

118
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:03,443
It's impossible! I'm trying to tell you that.
You want the tears to come out of my eyes?

119
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:07,122
There's gotta be a way you can work it out.
It's just six weeks.

120
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:10,324
Excuse me, Mr Pupkin?
Do you think you could...

121
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:11,396
Yeah.

122
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:14,285
- Sure. What's your name, dear?
- Dolores.

123
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,756
Dolores? That was my father's name.

124
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:21,077
"To Dolores, who sensed greatness."

125
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,957
There you go, sweetheart.

126
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:28,641
- Thanks, Mr Pupkin.
- Don't mention it.

127
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:32,240
Rupert! Rupert, who are you talking to?

128
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,204
- Mom!
- What is it?

129
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,518
Please stop calling me!

130
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:46,519
It's terrific. It's great.
There's only one problem, though.

131
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:49,883
- He made you bigger.
- Will you give me an answer?

132
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,879
You got the six weeks!
I'll give you the six weeks.

133
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:56,642
Don't bother me.
What can I say? Are you happy now?

134
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,718
You're a tough man, Rupe.

135
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:00,877
You gotta be in this business.

136
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:44,800
- Hello.
- Hello. It's Masha, Jerry.

137
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:46,639
- Did you get my note?
- Who is this?

138
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,117
It's Masha. Did you get the note?
I left it on the back seat.

139
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,040
I dropped it there before
they dragged me out of the car.

140
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:56,597
Those guys really hurt me.
I think that was a bit much. I really do.

141
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,838
- How did you get this number?
- Don't be angry with me, Jerry.

142
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:03,636
- How did you get this number?
- I didn't know what else to do.

143
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:44,398
How have you been, Rita?

144
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:49,079
- Do I know you?
- I think you might.

145
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,005
Rupert.

146
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,476
- Rupert Pupkin, right?
- Right.

147
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,116
I brought you a little present.

148
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:07,161
Oh, yeah. I remember. Mr Romance.

149
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,962
Put an aspirin in. It'll last longer.

150
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:16,526
So, what are you up to these days?

151
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:19,405
You're looking as beautiful as ever, Rita.

152
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:22,797
Well, here I am.
Local cheerleader makes good.

153
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:27,403
You know, it's funny, but I...
I voted for you - Most Beautiful.

154
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,526
- Did you? That was sweet.
- I didn't have the nerve to tell you then, but...

155
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:35,043
Yeah, now you can tell me.
It's OK, we're both adults.

156
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:38,278
When you're younger,
you're afraid to say those things,

157
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,483
but when you get older, 15, 20 years later,

158
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:44,162
you can say all those things
that you should have said 15, 20 years ago.

159
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:48,001
Isn't that the final irony of life? Isn't it?

160
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,638
I guess.

161
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,756
Are you happy in this place, Rita?

162
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:59,801
- Why? You got something better?
- Maybe.

163
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:03,038
- Really? Like what?
- Well, what are you doing tonight?

164
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:07,040
- What am I doing tonight?
- Yeah. What's so funny?

165
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:11,120
It only took you 15 years to ask me for a date.
Don't you think it's a little late?

166
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,646
Really? Well...

167
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:19,325
Waiter? Can I have a fresh one?

168
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:21,481
Rita.

169
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,400
Who is your favourite movie star?

170
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:28,958
This some kind of a game? You gonna tell me
something about my character, my future?

171
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:33,757
You'll see. Tell me.
Everybody has a favourite movie star.

172
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:38,318
Well, I better come up with somebody
or we'll never get out of here, right?

173
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:42,241
- That's a little test.
- Let's see... Marilyn Monroe.

174
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,555
Perfect.

175
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:56,362
Talent register, huh?

176
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,676
That's her name.

177
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:05,521
She signed this when she was in New York
on her publicity tour for <i>The Misfits.</i>

178
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,804
- That was her last movie, you know.
- Yeah?

179
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:13,085
She wasn't a great actress,
but she did have a real gift for comedy.

180
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:17,126
She died tragically alone, like many
of the world's most beautiful women.

181
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:20,005
I don't wanna see that happening to you.

182
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,963
- Who's this?
- Burt Reynolds.

183
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,003
- This?
- Mel Brooks.

184
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,875
He's what you call "on" funny.
Others are just regular.

185
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:36,721
That's Sid Caesar. He's remarkable.
I really like him. He's great.

186
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,367
Woody Allen. He's a personal friend of mine.

187
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:42,757
- Of course he is.
- No, he is.

188
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:46,598
That's Ernie Kovacs. He was wonderful.

189
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:50,885
He was a great comedian, a great
innovator, and it was a great, great loss.

190
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:53,117
I bet some of these are worth money.

191
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:56,961
Oh, yeah. Especially this one. Just hold it.

192
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:05,120
- Who's this?
- Well, just take a guess.

193
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,596
It looks like a retard wrote this.

194
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,600
The more scribbled the name,
the bigger the fame.

195
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,042
That might be true, Rupert, but who is it?

196
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,561
"R" is the first letter.

197
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:21,879
- Come on, Rupert. Who is it? I'm tired.
- Well, I'll give you a little hint.

198
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,764
- R...
- Robert Redford.

199
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,359
No.

200
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,239
No, no.

201
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:31,841
That's Rupert Pupkin.

202
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,285
Rupert Pupkin.

203
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,203
I surprised you, didn't I?

204
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,278
Take this as a gift.

205
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:52,562
Take good care of that. In a few weeks,
everyone's gonna want one.

206
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,558
Rupert, you have not changed.

207
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,686
Just a couple of hours ago,
do you know who I was talking to? Guess.

208
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,479
- Your shrink?
- That's very funny.

209
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:06,162
No. Jerry Langford.
That's right. <i>The</i> Jerry Langford.

210
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,397
He gave me the go-ahead, Rita.

211
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:13,720
You know what? Don't tell anyone yet, but
you're looking at the new King of Comedy.

212
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,635
Why not me? Why not?

213
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:20,685
A guy can get anything he wants,
as long as he pays the price.

214
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:24,442
What's so funny about that?
I mean, crazier things have happened.

215
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:27,166
You don't understand
what a shot on <i>Langford</i> means.

216
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,283
That's coast-to-coast national TV,

217
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:33,121
a bigger audience than the greatest
comedians played to in a whole lifetime.

218
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:35,482
A shot at a free ticket on the comedy circuit.

219
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:39,446
A comedy show of my own.
<i>The Rupert Pupkin Show.</i> Everything.

220
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,961
All that leads in one direction: Hollywood.

221
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,483
A beach house in Malibu on the ocean.
And we'll keep a suite at the Sherry.

222
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:49,355
Everybody stays there when they make it big.
Up top, so we can look down and yell

223
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:52,678
"Hey, tough luck, suckers!
Better luck next time."

224
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,803
Come on. What do you say?

225
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:58,197
It sounds wonderful, Rupert,
and I wish you the best of luck.

226
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:01,962
But it's getting late and I'm a working girl.
I gotta go home.

227
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:06,199
I don't get you.
Here I am offering you a way out.

228
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:09,324
Rita, every king needs a queen.

229
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,762
I want you to be mine.

230
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,601
This is a nice street. Nice building.

231
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,076
Thanks for yourjacket, Rupert.

232
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,520
I guess you're entitled
to come up and have some coffee.

233
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:27,201
I wouldn't wanna impose, really.

234
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:30,279
- I know I can be...
- What do you want, Rupert?

235
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:31,356
What?

236
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:36,524
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

237
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:40,077
Rita, you still don't understand? I love you.

238
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:44,160
I wanna help change your life,
if you'll just give me a chance.

239
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,840
What if I set something up
between me, you and Jerry?

240
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:52,522
What if we went out to dinner one night?
What do you think?

241
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,316
You know what's even better?
We'll go to his summer house for a weekend.

242
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:59,399
- He wouldn't wanna meet me.
- That's not true.

243
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,482
Jerry is a very nice guy.

244
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:06,082
He's a very, very nice guy,
and we had a terrific meeting.

245
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:12,242
You shouldn't sell yourself short. You have
too little faith, and you're a wonderful person.

246
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:17,685
Why don't you go to sleep
and get a good night's rest, OK?

247
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:20,439
OK.

248
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,836
- Good night, Rupert.
- Good night.

249
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:28,041
Go to sleep right away.

250
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,158
I'll tell you, boy.

251
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:42,846
Hiya, Liza. Good seeing you.

252
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,397
Jerry, good seeing you. Don't get up.

253
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:49,717
Oh, boy, I'll tell ya.

254
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:52,196
Every time you come back from a tour -

255
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:55,279
there must be something in the air -
it really becomes you.

256
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:58,040
It's like you become rejuvenated.

257
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:01,005
Isn't that so, everybody? Isn't that so?

258
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:04,966
That's the truth. I'll tell ya.
It's amazing. You look wonderful.

259
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:09,643
Yeah, I know. You look wonderful too, Jerry.
I wasn't leaving you out.

260
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:13,038
What? Yeah!

261
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:23,077
Oh, Jerry. I love this guy.
Always coming up with these great lines.

262
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:26,603
I love him. I love him.
He's wonderful. You're wonderful.

263
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:28,996
I don't know what I'd do without you.

264
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:33,877
Rupert! The bus is here.
It's early. Try to be on time for once!

265
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:38,157
I can't believe this. I gotta go now.
Yeah, I gotta catch a bus.

266
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:42,763
Jerry, take care of yourself.
Baby, be good. Good luck in Rio.

267
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:50,400
- Good morning, Rupert.
- Good morning.

268
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:53,285
- How are you?
- This is for you.

269
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:55,676
Work.

270
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:59,038
- What time is it?
- It's 10 o'clock.

271
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,925
Is it 10 o'clock?
Could I use the phone for one second?

272
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,122
- Is it local?
- Yeah.

273
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:06,005
Sure. Just dial 9 first, and make it short.

274
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:16,280
Hello. Jerry Langford, please.

275
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,835
Rupert Pupkin.

276
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,918
Thank you.

277
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:25,635
Yes, is Jerry there, please? Rupert Pupkin.

278
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:27,877
Yes.

279
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:32,165
Just tell him it's Rupert calling,
and he'll know what it's about.

280
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:37,686
He is? Well, that's OK.
I'm in a meeting myself.

281
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:42,716
Just tell him I called. Thank you very much.
And I'll call later. Thank you. Bye.

282
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,847
Was that <i>the</i> Jerry Langford?

283
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,646
- I'll see you, Roberta.
- Sure.

284
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:53,922
Hello. Jerry Langford, please.
Rupert Pupkin.

285
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:57,841
Yes, Rupert Pupkin calling.
Jerry Langford, please.

286
00:23:57,927 --> 00:24:00,964
Which, the first name or the second name?

287
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:06,041
P-u-p-k-i-n. It's often mispronounced
and misspelled, so that's why... Yes.

288
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,398
Jerry knows I'm calling.
He knows what it's about. Sure.

289
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:15,600
I see, I see. I see. Yes, you can call me.

290
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,042
I'll be here for the next hour and a half.

291
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:24,316
I'm at my office, and the number is JL54321.

292
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:34,116
I am waiting for a phone call.
It'll only take a few minutes.

293
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:37,404
- All these phone don't work.
- The phone does not work.

294
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:39,717
I cannot make a call. I am <i>expecting</i> a call.

295
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:43,482
- Let me try. I'll make a call.
- It doesn't work.

296
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,401
Wait. Let me just slide in and make a call.
Let me just make a call.

297
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:51,995
- It's important.
- This phone don't work either!

298
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:24,682
I can't do that. Because
we're gonna be working late. Hold on.

299
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,439
- Yes, sir?
- Jerry Langford.

300
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,724
- Your name, please?
- Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.

301
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,999
- Rupert...?
- Pupkin. P-u-p-k-i-n.

302
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:38,079
People often misspell it and mispronounce it.

303
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:45,601
There's a man here by the name of Rupert
Pumpkin who wants to see Mr Langford.

304
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:55,364
I'm sorry, Mr Pumpkin, but Mr Langford's
secretary has no record of your appointment.

305
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:58,286
Pardon me?

306
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,881
We have no record of your appointment.

307
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:04,437
Technically speaking,
I don't have an official appointment,

308
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:08,361
but he did ask me to call him personally,
and I was in the neighbourhood.

309
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:11,519
I was having trouble calling for some reason.

310
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:13,404
The line seemed to be busy.

311
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:16,081
He has no appointment.

312
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,284
His secretary wants to know
what this is in reference to.

313
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,927
- Mr Gangemi, go right in.
- Hello?

314
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:27,001
Yes. Jerry and I discussed my being on
the show last night. He told me to call. Yes.

315
00:26:28,527 --> 00:26:30,563
No, sure, sure. Sure.

316
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:33,164
I'm supposed to wait.

317
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,597
Is that cork?

318
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:13,565
I don't know what it is. Is it dripping on you?

319
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:16,241
No. I was looking at the patterns.

320
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:20,441
You know, cork is good for sound.

321
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:23,963
It's very quiet in here.

322
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:26,117
Reception.

323
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:29,597
No, you got an hour or so
before they come in. Yeah.

324
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:31,837
He hasn't come back from the meeting yet.

325
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:34,646
- Mr Pipkin?
- Pupkin.

326
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:37,241
- Sorry. I'm Cathy Long. Can I help you?
- You are...?

327
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:40,842
I'm Bert Thomas's assistant.
He's our executive producer.

328
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:44,556
I'm sorry. I've already spoken to Jerry
about my being on the show.

329
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:48,196
He said to get in touch with him personally.
I'm here to follow up on that.

330
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:51,279
- What is it exactly that you do?
- I stand-up comic.

331
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,962
- Where are you working now?
- Right now I'm working on new material.

332
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:58,926
As soon as you do start working again,
why don't you give us a call,

333
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,441
and we'll send someone to check out your act.

334
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:04,758
- Jerry and I went over this last night.
- Does Jerry know your work?

335
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:07,725
Yes. I don't think he does.

336
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:12,119
- Do you have a tape I could listen to?
- A tape? Naturally. Whatever you'd like.

337
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:16,485
- Why don't you drop me by a tape?
- I will. I can see where Jerry would need that.

338
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:20,162
- Of course. Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

339
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:22,715
This is really what's right.

340
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:24,798
This is great. This is...

341
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:28,719
See you again. Nice talking to you. Bye.

342
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,717
Rupert. Hey, Rupert.

343
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,078
I gotta talk to you.
What happened last night in the car?

344
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,601
- Did he talk about me?
- No, he didn't.

345
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:50,680
- He talked about me, as a matter of fact.
- He must've said something about me.

346
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:54,442
What's he gonna say about you
after what you did in the car last night?

347
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:58,406
- You must be really loving this.
- You were schmucko supremo last night.

348
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:02,685
Hold on a minute. I'm the schmuck? Me?
You're wrong, buddy. You're very wrong.

349
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:07,397
If I hadn't gotten in that car, you'd never
even have had the chance to talk to Jerry.

350
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:11,366
What? I don't wanna be cruel,
but we're in front of Jerry's building.

351
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:15,201
God forbid he should see me with you.
Jerry and I have a <i>real</i> relationship.

352
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:20,202
No fantasy world. After what you did last
night, I don't even wanna see you any more.

353
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:24,917
Fine! That's the way you want it?
See if I care! Just get it to him.

354
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:29,797
I'm not giving him anything. You're the one
who's so friendly. You give it to him.

355
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:33,402
We're having a communication problem,
and I need you to get this to him.

356
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:37,196
You're always bragging
about how you broke bread with Jerry.

357
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:40,597
Just do this for me, Rupert.
I've done things for you.

358
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:43,759
You haven't done anything for me.
What are you talking about?

359
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:47,999
How about Howard Johnson's? I bought you
food. I bought you coffee night after night.

360
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:50,885
You got your mind screwed up.
I bought my own coffee.

361
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,401
You never bought anything!

362
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:56,240
What about things I did for you
that no money can buy?

363
00:29:56,327 --> 00:30:01,720
What about the time I gave you my spot?
I let you get right next to Jerry!

364
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:06,881
I waited for eight hours and you went right
next to him cos you were crying at me!

365
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:11,643
And what about the time I gave you my last
album of <i>The Best of Jerry?</i> What about that?

366
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,356
I didn't even ask you for money,
and I can't even pay my rent!

367
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:20,237
I live in a hovel! And you live in a townhouse!
I can't believe this girl!

368
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:22,079
Here, I got money for ya.

369
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:27,764
I can't believe how long I've been your friend
and listened to your tired, stale, boring jokes!

370
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:29,997
- Here's $900.
- Will you be quiet?

371
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:32,442
Take this and give it to Jerry.

372
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:35,360
All right, this is the last time.

373
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:38,200
- When are you gonna get it to him?
- You're a wacko.

374
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:42,075
You make sure. I'll know if you don't.
I know where you are, where Jerry is!

375
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:45,204
I cover the waterfront! Remember that!

376
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:48,916
What are you lookin' at?!
Beat it! You scum! You're street trash!

377
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:08,241
First, Miss Long, thank you for your help
at the office and for passing this on to Jerry.

378
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,602
I appreciate it more than you know.

379
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:16,080
Jerry, thank you for listening to this material
and for the opportunity you've given me.

380
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:19,398
Lots of people think that guys like you,
people who've made it,

381
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:22,604
lose their feeling for struggling
young talent such as myself.

382
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:26,043
But now I know from experience
that those people are just cynics,

383
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:28,197
embittered by their own failure.

384
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:33,077
I know, Jerry, that you are as human
as the rest of us, if not more so.

385
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,840
No point in going on about it.
You know how I feel.

386
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,522
So let's get on with the show,
<i>The Best of Rupert Pupkin.</i>

387
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:43,839
Jerry, I've sketched out this little outline
in order to save you a bit of time.

388
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:49,081
It's a little introduction. So close your eyes
and imagine it's exactly six o'clock.

389
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:54,685
You're standing in the wings, and we hear
the orchestra strike up your theme song.

390
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:00,557
And now from New York,
it's <i>The Jerry Langford Show,</i>

391
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:05,038
with Jerry's guests:
Richard Pryor, Ben Gazzara,

392
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,925
Elizabeth Ashley, Carol Burnett...

393
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:11,636
And the comedy find of the year,
making his television debut,

394
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:16,084
- Rupert Pupkin, the new King of Comedy!
- Rupert! Rupert!

395
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,556
Are you crazy? What's the matter with you?

396
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:22,037
- Come on, Mom!
- People are sleeping. Lower it!

397
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:28,159
- What's the matter with you?
- Mom!

398
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:32,160
- Take it easy. Lower it.
- I'm not gonna lower it! I have to do this now!

399
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:35,239
I don't mind you playing it, but lower it.

400
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:40,237
You come on, Jerry,
and do your monologue.

401
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:45,082
When the time comes, this is how I see you
introducing me. Something like this.

402
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:49,957
Will you please give your warmest welcome
to the newest King of Comedy,

403
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:52,356
Rupert Pupkin!

404
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:59,884
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

405
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:03,118
I was born in Clifton, New Jersey...

406
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:08,477
Is there anyone here from Clifton?

407
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:48,640
- Mr Pipkin.
- Pupkin.

408
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,685
- Pupkin. Sorry.
- You'll get it right one of these days.

409
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,440
- I'll bet you have a tape for me.
- Right here.

410
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:58,202
Got your name on it? We'll listen to it
and return it as soon as we can.

411
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:02,883
Thank you very much. When Jerry
finds a moment. Good. When will that be?

412
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:09,163
Actually, you can try me tomorrow. We might
know something by then. Otherwise, Monday.

413
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,078
Monday?

414
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:15,763
Miss Long, what I might do is just wait here
a while. Maybe Jerry'll find a minute.

415
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:19,681
You're wasting your time. We won't know
until tomorrow at the earliest.

416
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:23,442
That's all right. I don't mind.
I'm not wasting my time. I'm glad to do it.

417
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:26,087
It's important to me, so... I really don't mind.

418
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,761
- It'll probably be Monday.
- Monday?

419
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:33,357
Well, I'll still wait.

420
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,915
Really, I don't mind. It's OK.

421
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,636
I'll tell you what. Why don't you try me
tomorrow afternoon for sure?

422
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,400
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?

423
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:45,445
- 4.30.
- 4.30? I'll be here. Thank you.

424
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,121
- You're welcome.
- And thank Jerry.

425
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:55,478
Goodbye.

426
00:34:59,087 --> 00:35:00,884
Goodbye.

427
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,962
At least once in his life every man is a genius.

428
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:10,164
And, Rupe, it's gonna be
more than once in your life for you.

429
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:12,966
It's gonna be a number of times,
because you've got it.

430
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:16,562
From what I've heard here,
you've got it and you're stuck with it.

431
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:21,118
I don't care if you wanted to get rid of it -
you couldn't. It's always gonna be there.

432
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:25,997
Now, I know there's no formula for it.
I just don't know how you do it.

433
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:30,195
And I'm not curious, mind you,
because I wanna use the material.

434
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:35,919
I'm just curious to know how you do it.
I really have to ask you. How do you do it?

435
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:41,559
I think it's that I look at my whole life,
and I see the awful, terrible things in my life

436
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:44,684
and turn it into something funny.

437
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,122
Itjust happens.

438
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,767
Were the first few one-liners strong enough?

439
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:55,717
If they were any stronger, you'd hurt yourself.
They're marvellous. Leave them alone.

440
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:59,277
I remember a man... A man said...
Listen to me. Listen to me.

441
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:04,487
A man said something very profound
some years ago - which I later originated.

442
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:08,560
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
You wanna know how I know it's so good?

443
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:09,443
Yes.

444
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:13,440
Cos I envy you. I hate you, but I envy you.

445
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:17,440
Because it's purity, it's marvellous,
it's humour based on you.

446
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:21,958
No one else could do it but you.
I wouldn't lie. I wouldn't lie to you, Rupe.

447
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:27,326
Now, look, this weekend would be a perfect
time for you to come out to the house,

448
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:31,116
if you care to, and we can hash it around.
Only cos I wanna know how you do it.

449
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:33,641
There'll be people there, but we can still work.

450
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:36,241
- It sounds great.
- Terrific.

451
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,443
- I would really like to come.
- Wonderful.

452
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:40,677
Could I bring somebody?

453
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:44,521
- A young lady?
- A very special young lady.

454
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:46,837
Of course. I'd like to meet her.

455
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:53,679
- Hey, Jerry, how ya doin'?
- How are you?

456
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:58,124
- You're looking good.
- You should see me in my white taffeta.

457
00:36:58,207 --> 00:37:02,041
- You're doing some great shows, Jerry.
- Thanks a lot.

458
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:06,917
- How about putting me on your show?
- Yeah. I could've used you last night.

459
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:22,238
Come on down!

460
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:28,355
- Hi, Jerry. How are you?
- Hi there.

461
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:31,484
Morris, you will not believe
who's coming down here.

462
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:34,718
Jerry Langford, right?
Morris, please hold on.

463
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:38,117
Jerry, could you please
sign my magazine for me?

464
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:41,961
You're just wonderful.
I've watched you your entire career.

465
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:47,246
Would you say something to my nephew
Morris on the phone? He's in the hospital...

466
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:51,240
- I'm sorry. I'm late.
- I hope you get cancer!

467
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:53,318
Jerry?

468
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:56,001
I can't. I'm late.

469
00:38:58,207 --> 00:38:59,640
Yes, sir? Oh, hi.

470
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:01,922
- Hi. How are you?
- Not bad.

471
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,646
Good, good. I'm fine.

472
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:09,244
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like to see Jerry, please.

473
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:11,283
You are...?

474
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:13,517
Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.

475
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:18,319
Mr Potkin is here. That's right.

476
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,956
She'll be with you in a minute.

477
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:26,119
- Who's that?
- Miss Long.

478
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:29,085
I'd prefer to see Jerry.

479
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,203
Miss Long will take care of you.

480
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,596
OK. I'll wait right here.

481
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:43,319
As a surprise to Rupert
for being on the show with us tonight,

482
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:47,884
we'd like to present to you someone
in a form that we've never presented before.

483
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:53,360
A mystery guest. Would you please welcome
our mystery guest. Let's hear it for him.

484
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,797
Jerry, this is the mystery guest?

485
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:07,355
This is the mystery guest.

486
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,642
Let me see if I can place him.

487
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:12,400
- Don't you remember me?
- No, I don't.

488
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:16,116
- I'm George Kapp.
- George Kapp. My high-school principal!

489
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,641
- You guessed it.
- Well, how are ya?

490
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:22,197
You used to fail me. What do you have him
on the show for? He's an enemy.

491
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,801
- Only because you deserved it.
- Thank you.

492
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,037
But I'm ajustice of the peace now.

493
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:29,516
- I perform weddings.
- Do you?

494
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:37,281
Jerry, what are you doing?
I can't believe this.

495
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,358
Believe it. It's part of the surprise.

496
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:43,804
How would the audience like to see the King
of Comedy marry his queen on the show?

497
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:46,560
I can't believe it. I don't know what to say!

498
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:49,923
He's too much. He's too much.

499
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:03,242
Dearly beloved, when Rupert here
was a student at Clifton High School,

500
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:08,924
none of us - myself,
his teachers, his classmates -

501
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:12,443
dreamt that he would amount
to a hill of beans.

502
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:16,236
But we were wrong.
And you, Rupert, you were right.

503
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:21,918
And that's why tonight,
before the entire nation,

504
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:26,000
we'd like to apologise to you personally

505
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:32,526
and to beg your forgiveness for...
for all the things we did to you.

506
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:36,043
And we'd like to thank you
personally, all of us,

507
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:41,042
for the meaning you've given our lives.

508
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:46,125
Please accept our warmest wishes,
Rita and Rupert,

509
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:50,483
for a long and successful reign together.

510
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:56,397
We'll be back to marry them
right after this word.

511
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:00,566
Mr Pupkin.

512
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:03,036
- How are you today?
- I'm fine.

513
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:07,078
Thank you for your tape.
We listened to it with great interest.

514
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,395
Good. I'm glad.

515
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:11,160
We see a lot of good things
in what you're doing.

516
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:15,718
We think you have potential, which is why
I'm gonna be absolutely honest with you.

517
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:18,560
That's the way you should be.
Absolutely honest.

518
00:43:18,647 --> 00:43:21,400
- We don't think you're ready yet.
- Not ready yet.

519
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:24,638
- We don't feel you're right for Jerry.
- Right for Jerry.

520
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:30,120
Some of the material is good, but some of the
one-liners, for instance, are not very strong.

521
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,756
Not very strong. You didn't like
some of the jokes. Is that it?

522
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:36,281
- That's right.
- I can take care of that.

523
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:41,361
Just tell me the ones you don't like,
and no problem. Actually, that's a great help.

524
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,837
We think you have a good potential.
Your timing is excellent.

525
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:47,077
But you should keep developing your act.

526
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:51,558
You ought to test it in a few live situations.
I think that'd be very good for you.

527
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:54,241
There are a number of clubs that you can try.

528
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:58,718
When you start working in one of those,
give us a call. We'll send someone down.

529
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:00,843
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

530
00:44:00,927 --> 00:44:02,918
Thank you.

531
00:44:04,047 --> 00:44:07,517
Miss Long, may I ask you a question?
Are you speaking for Jerry?

532
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:08,926
- Yes, I am.
- You are?

533
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:13,842
- He has complete faith in ourjudgment.
- Well, I'm sorry to have to say this.

534
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,885
I have to tell you,
I <i>don't</i> have faith in yourjudgment.

535
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:21,006
I'm sorry that you feel that way. But I guess
there's nothing we can do about that.

536
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:23,806
No, I'll have to disagree
with you again, Miss Long.

537
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:25,923
That's your privilege, Mr Pupkin.

538
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:29,079
Now, would you excuse me?
I have a great many things to do.

539
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,397
Miss Long, when will Jerry be back?

540
00:44:31,487 --> 00:44:34,604
Mr Langford won't be in
until very late this afternoon.

541
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,123
Mr Pupkin, we mean what we say
when we thank you for stopping up.

542
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:42,166
And we mean it when we tell you
that you can call us when you start working.

543
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:45,045
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

544
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,239
Is there anyone else you'd like to see?

545
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,438
No. That's all right.

546
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:19,995
I don't mind waiting.

547
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:25,684
Which reminds me about the man who waited
so long, he forgot what he was waiting for.

548
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:29,445
Well, would you mind
waiting outside, Mr Pupnick?

549
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:32,724
This is a reception area, not a waiting room.

550
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:34,798
I understand.

551
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:48,405
- Did you ask him to leave?
- Yeah, but he won't go.

552
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:50,876
- What's his name?
- Rupert Pumpkin.

553
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:57,520
Hi. I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security
for the Langford organisation.

554
00:45:57,607 --> 00:45:59,962
Let's go outside and talk. Is this your bag?

555
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:02,197
Yes. I'm waiting for Jerry. It's personal.

556
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:05,518
- We'll talk about that outside.
- I know he's expecting me.

557
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:09,566
Listen, we'll talk about that outside.
Please take your bag.

558
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:12,878
I'll explain company policy
to you on the way, OK?

559
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:17,324
Now, I'm pretty sure you understand
that we have certain rules here

560
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:22,606
that are essential to the smooth functioning
of our operation. Right?

561
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:25,804
- If I could just say that...
- Now just listen, please. OK?

562
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:30,119
And that without these rules, we really
wouldn't be able to function at our best.

563
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:32,357
- You follow my point?
- I get the point...

564
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,961
- Please, Mr Puffer.
- After you.

565
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:38,483
- After you, sir, please.
- If I could just say that Jerry is...

566
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:42,924
Just listen to me. I checked with Miss Long.
You do not have an appointment.

567
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:47,080
Now, company policy
is that only authorised personnel

568
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:50,796
and those persons with official business
with our organisation

569
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:53,685
are permitted on our premises.

570
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:56,964
In other words, you want me
to leave the building?

571
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:22,165
- Well? Did you get it to him?
- What?

572
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:27,360
- Did you get my letter to him?
- He's not in there, OK?

573
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:31,076
Now that you're so in with him,
you can't do me a favour? Don't bother.

574
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:33,158
Just give me the letter.

575
00:47:33,247 --> 00:47:35,761
- He wasn't there.
- I saw him go in myself.

576
00:47:35,847 --> 00:47:37,883
- Who?
- Jerry!

577
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:41,004
- He's up there right now. Wanna see him?
- That's impossible.

578
00:47:41,087 --> 00:47:45,000
- They assured me that he was out.
- And you believed them?

579
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:48,079
You're so naive. I would expect that from you.

580
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:50,442
So inexperienced. You're such a chump.

581
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,644
- He went up there just now?
- Of course. Go back up.

582
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:57,515
Assert yourself a little bit.
He's up there right now.

583
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,161
- Would you tell Jerry I'm here?
- He's not in.

584
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:15,717
- I know he is. Would you tell him I'm here?
- He's not in.

585
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:19,356
You're putting yourjob on the line, lady.
You hear me?

586
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:21,722
Security.

587
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,798
You too.

588
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,885
Mr Pupkin, what are you doing here?

589
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,958
Mr Pupkin?

590
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:50,844
Mr Pupkin.

591
00:48:51,687 --> 00:48:54,281
Get security on the telephone.

592
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:01,838
There he goes.

593
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:06,757
Hold on. Grab his other arm. Hold on to him.

594
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,645
Right. All right, right out the door.

595
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:12,996
You wouldn't listen, huh?

596
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:14,361
Jerry? Jerry?

597
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:18,884
- Nobody's gonna help you.
- You're gonna have a lot of explaining to do.

598
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,879
- You had your warning, Krupkin.
- My lawyer'll be calling.

599
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:24,561
Make sure he gets my name right.

600
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:29,959
- Say goodbye to our guest, Miss Long.
- Wait till Jerry hears about this.

601
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:32,436
I will mention your name to Jerry, Pupper.

602
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:38,204
Listen good, because if we see
your face again, we're gonna call the police.

603
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:42,005
Thank you. Thank you very much.

604
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:46,085
Terrific. I suppose
that you got the letter to him?

605
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,317
- No, but I'll get it later.
- Great.

606
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:52,036
- You just got thrown out of the building.
- I didn't get thrown out.

607
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,845
What do you call that?

608
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:56,361
Excuse me.
I wasn't thrown out of the building.

609
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:59,917
- You're a constant embarrassment.
- They walked me outside.

610
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:04,364
- You can't handle the simplest things.
- I'll tell you something else.

611
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:08,042
- Jerry invited me for the weekend.
- Great. I'll go with ya.

612
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:11,721
Do I look OK?

613
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:14,002
- Wonderful.
- Does this look all right?

614
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:16,317
- That I'm not sure about.
- What do you mean?

615
00:50:16,407 --> 00:50:18,796
- You look wonderful.
- What's wrong with it?

616
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:20,878
Nothing. I just don't think you need it.

617
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,437
- You don't think it looks nice on me?
- No, it looks wonderful.

618
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,043
Hello.

619
00:50:42,127 --> 00:50:44,322
- You must be Jonno.
- Yes.

620
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:46,682
I'm Rupert Pupkin and this is Rita Keane.

621
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:50,077
- Would you let Jerry know we're here?
- Mr Langford asked you to come?

622
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:54,399
No, we just thought we'd drop in
uninvited for the weekend.

623
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:58,162
Come on in. We'll be staying
in separate rooms. The blue bag is mine.

624
00:50:58,247 --> 00:51:02,126
- But Mr Langford's not here.
- Where is he? Out playing golf?

625
00:51:02,207 --> 00:51:03,686
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

626
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:07,043
- I hope he's finally gonna break 100.
- 100?

627
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:10,278
- Perhaps better you come back.
- No, we'll just wait.

628
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:14,565
- But Mr Langford is not here.
- That's OK. We'll just wait.

629
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:16,842
That's OK. We don't mind waiting.

630
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:18,918
Isn't this lovely?

631
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:24,636
Table's only set for one.

632
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:33,035
- How do you like it?
- I could live here.

633
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:35,925
Mr Langford, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

634
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:39,602
What's wrong? Everything's wrong.
There are a couple over here.

635
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:44,966
His name is Pumpkin. Pumpkin, yes.
Do you know a name Pumpkin?

636
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:50,362
Didn't you tell him what time we'd get here?

637
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:53,519
We didn't have time to iron out the details.

638
00:51:53,607 --> 00:51:55,962
But that butler wasn't even expecting us.

639
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:59,960
Jerry has more important things
to think about than what to tell his houseboy.

640
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:02,436
Really? Well, excuse me.

641
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:11,277
He knows everything.
He knew you were playing golf.

642
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:15,201
I don't know what he want.
He wanna spend the weekend over here.

643
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:19,678
You better come back. He's touching
everything. He's ruining the house.

644
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,678
And I'm getting a heart attack.

645
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:26,363
Here's a famous one
with the youngest clown in the world, Zippo.

646
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:29,564
Remember this one
with Ray Charles on Jerry's special?

647
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,638
- That's famous.
- I know. There it is.

648
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:34,446
Here's a famous one
when he was a kid, 12 years old.

649
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:38,839
Someone sent this in as a part of the show,
"I Knew You When" section.

650
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:44,843
They thought they were playing ajoke.
Now Jerry shows it to everyone on the show.

651
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:54,360
Let's get a little life into this place.
It's like a funeral parlour.

652
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:58,326
You should really turn that off.
You shouldn't put that on. It's not polite.

653
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:01,843
- How about a little spin, handsome?
- We shouldn't be dancing.

654
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:05,203
- A little fun never hurt anybody.
- What if Jerry walks in?

655
00:53:05,287 --> 00:53:08,165
He'll be happy to see us having a good time.

656
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:12,399
- What if he walks in?
- So? You're his friend. He won't mind.

657
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:25,001
- I wonder what the rest of this place is like.
- Well, I'm sure it's very nice.

658
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:28,162
No, Rita, I wouldn't go up there.

659
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,839
- Rita? Rita?
- Come on.

660
00:53:29,927 --> 00:53:32,316
I don't think it's a good idea...

661
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:37,283
Rita, they're watching us. Rita, I don't think
you have the right to go upstairs.

662
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:39,722
Rita, please don't go up there.

663
00:53:48,087 --> 00:53:52,000
Would you open the goddamn door?
I was standing out there eight minutes.

664
00:53:52,087 --> 00:53:55,363
What was with the door? Jesus!
Where are they?

665
00:53:55,447 --> 00:53:57,836
I was gonna call the police, but I wait for you.

666
00:53:57,927 --> 00:54:03,559
Hi, Jerry. Hi, Jerry. How are you?
We were just freshening up upstairs.

667
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:08,482
Rita, I want you to meet <i>the</i> Jerry Langford.
Jerry, I want you to meet <i>the</i> Rita Keane.

668
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:12,162
Come on down. Don't be ashamed.
Attagirl. Come on down.

669
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:15,236
What's your pleasure, Jerry?

670
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:23,484
It's hot out there. I wanna get something nice
to drink. Jerry, what would you like? Jer?

671
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:27,398
Jer?

672
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:32,758
Excuse us, but it's not every day
that a girl like Rita meets a man like you.

673
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:35,998
I mean, this is part of your success.
You have to live with it.

674
00:54:36,087 --> 00:54:39,397
How was your golf game? Was it good?
Did you finally break 100?

675
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:42,479
- I told them you were not here.
- He did.

676
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:44,956
They did. They were really very helpful.

677
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:48,835
We took an earlier train.
There wasn't anything else until after one.

678
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:54,206
Anyway, I brought the work. It's right here.
All ready. All ready and set to go.

679
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:57,916
So... where is everybody?

680
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:03,440
- What everybody?
- What everybody? The guests, Jer.

681
00:55:03,527 --> 00:55:06,519
To tell you the truth,
we're getting a little hungry.

682
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:09,997
You know I could have
the both of you arrested?

683
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:12,647
Well, of course you could have us arrested.

684
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:15,241
There's no way
we can prove that we belong here.

685
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:18,603
He's great. When he comes up
with an idea, he's terrific.

686
00:55:18,687 --> 00:55:21,918
- I never thought of that.
- You should have.

687
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:27,604
We can set up a story where you invite all
your friends out and you throw 'em all in jail!

688
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,556
That's terrific. That's terrific.

689
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:38,320
What's the matter? Lighten up. Let's get
to work on that. After this, of course.

690
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:40,238
How did you get here?

691
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:43,478
We walked in the door.
Jerry, what's the matter with you?

692
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,319
How did you get here?

693
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,524
I think you're upset.
I'm gonna leave my material here.

694
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:51,963
We'll talk later. You've got more
important things to worry about.

695
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:57,121
- We'll just stroll around, wait till lunchtime.
- Did anyone ever tell you you're a moron?

696
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:03,525
You know, Jerry, ordinarily I wouldn't allow
anybody to speak that way about Rita.

697
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:07,839
But since it's you, I know you're only kidding.
He's a real character.

698
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:12,000
- Rupert, he's saying he wants us to go.
- No, he's not saying that.

699
00:56:12,087 --> 00:56:15,716
Jerry, tell her that. You're not saying that.
He's not saying that at all.

700
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,924
- Call the station, Jonno.
- Where are you going? Rita?

701
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:22,761
There'll be a cab here in five or ten minutes.
Wait at the gate and use it.

702
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:25,600
Why? You going someplace?

703
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:28,326
No, you are.

704
00:56:28,407 --> 00:56:33,720
Did I say something wrong, Jerry? Cos if
I did, could we chalk it up to inexperience?

705
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,399
Rita?

706
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:39,644
I have my stuff right here.
We could do it in a half an hour.

707
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:42,446
Then you'd have
the rest of the afternoon to yourself.

708
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:47,681
I want you outta here. I want you
outta here now. Is that plain enough?

709
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:50,361
- I understand.
- Is that clear?

710
00:56:50,447 --> 00:56:52,961
Look, you're tired. That's OK.

711
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:56,676
I'm gonna leave the stuff here.
Read it and let me know what you think.

712
00:56:56,767 --> 00:57:00,077
Don't be so dopey. Use your ears.
The man is telling us to go.

713
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,998
He is not telling us to go.

714
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:05,716
- Mr Langford, I knew nothing about this.
- Tell her she's wrong.

715
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:09,641
I don't even know him. I haven't seen him
in years. He told me you were friends.

716
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,001
Rita!

717
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:14,602
I feel terrible. I'm so humiliated.
If there's anything I can do...

718
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:17,440
She works in a bar.
She wants to spoil everything.

719
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:19,916
Come on, Rupert. Let's go.

720
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:24,396
- Jerry...
- OK, come on. Come on, come on.

721
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:26,637
- Let's go.
- Sorry, Mr Langford.

722
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:30,766
- Here you are. Take your things and go!
- I can take a hint.

723
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,681
I just want you to listen to my stuff
for 15 minutes. Is that asking too much?

724
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,962
Yes, it is. I have a life, OK?

725
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:40,039
- I have a life, too.
- That's not my responsibility!

726
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:44,564
- It is when you tell me to call you.
- I told you to call to get rid of you!

727
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:47,480
To get rid of me? OK, I can take a hint.

728
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:50,877
If I didn't tell you that, we'd still be
on the steps at my apartment!

729
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,800
- All right, so I made a mistake.
- So did Hitler!

730
00:57:55,167 --> 00:58:00,287
This is the way it is when you're famous.
Now I see. That's how you guys are, huh?

731
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:03,165
- Not them. Me. Yeah!
- That's how you are.

732
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:06,205
- When you reach the top.
- No, I was that way before.

733
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:10,075
- Now I know how people like you are.
- Goodbye and good luck!

734
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:14,806
And, Jerry? Jerry,
I just wanna say one more thing, Jerry.

735
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:19,802
I'm glad what you did to me today.
Because now I know I can't rely on anybody.

736
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:23,357
Not you, not anybody.
And I shouldn't rely on anybody.

737
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:27,599
And you wanna know something else?
I'm gonna work 50 times harder

738
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:30,121
and I'm gonna be 50 times
more famous than you.

739
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,721
And have idiots like you plaguing your life!

740
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:37,005
That's right. Come on, Rita.
We're wasting our time. Goodbye, Jerry.

741
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:41,641
Jonno, lock that door.

742
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,719
- You did good, Mr Langford.
- Thank you.

743
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,398
It looks real.

744
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,358
That's the whole point.

745
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:05,956
- Is that him?
- No.

746
00:59:06,047 --> 00:59:09,198
- You sure?
- Sure, I'm sure. It looks too much like him.

747
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:13,121
- What do you mean?
- When it's him, it doesn't look like him.

748
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:19,957
God, it feels like
it's taking him for ever.

749
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,798
How much longer?

750
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:28,678
It's him.

751
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,958
Yeah, that's him.

752
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:38,759
- Don't go too fast.
- OK, OK.

753
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:41,202
Stay on this side so you're not all over him.

754
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:44,916
- I'm getting over as soon as I can.
- Get in the next lane.

755
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:46,998
OK, OK, OK.

756
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:52,755
- Not yet. There are too many people.
- I know. I'll keep going.

757
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:55,998
He walks in crowded areas.
You'd think he'd wanna stay away.

758
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:58,442
Because he doesn't wanna be alone.

759
00:59:58,527 --> 01:00:02,520
Tell me why. I know. You tell me why.

760
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:07,163
Don't get an attitude with me.

761
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:10,239
Explain it to me,
cos you know so much about him.

762
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:12,557
Fill me in. Let me learn from you.

763
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:17,243
All right. Because when he walks
on crowded streets, he feels safe, that's why.

764
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:20,319
Is that what it is? Thanks for telling me.

765
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:30,846
Go past him and stop.

766
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:38,442
OK, Jerry. Get over. Get in there.
I'm not fooling around.

767
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,679
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Get in, Jerry. Get in.

768
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,086
Hi, Jerry.

769
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:52,001
She's gonna hold a gun on your head.

770
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:55,079
Don't make any false moves.
I'd hate to do anything drastic.

771
01:00:55,167 --> 01:01:00,116
If everything works out, you should be
out of here by the very latest 12, 12.30.

772
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:04,437
Well, maybe one. 1.15 at the very latest.

773
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,724
What I want you to do is call your producer.

774
01:01:07,807 --> 01:01:10,480
- Call what?
- Bert Thomas. I want you to call him.

775
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:13,320
I'm gonna give you a phone right now.

776
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:17,400
Get him on the phone,
and I'll tell you exactly what to say, OK?

777
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:23,478
Now, if you don't do it,
I don't know what to say -

778
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:25,956
there could be a problem.

779
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:32,240
Watch your eyes, Jerry. I'm gonna take
these off now. It's a little bright in here, OK?

780
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:49,198
OK.

781
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,727
Are these yours?

782
01:01:55,807 --> 01:01:58,196
- Jerry, these are yours?
- Yeah.

783
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:02,279
- Do you mind if I have one?
- I don't mind.

784
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:03,436
Thank you.

785
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:06,246
- Masha, do you want one?
- Save it for me.

786
01:02:06,327 --> 01:02:08,841
- You want one?
- I'd love one, but will you save it?

787
01:02:08,927 --> 01:02:12,363
It's a little bit inconvenient at the moment.
Thank you, Rupert.

788
01:02:12,447 --> 01:02:15,166
- Do you want one?
- No.

789
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:17,636
I'll just take one for later, then.

790
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:24,197
There's no reason to get mad.
I'm just trying to ease the tension.

791
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:26,357
Even though this is a strange situation,

792
01:02:26,447 --> 01:02:30,235
there are moments of friendship
and moments of sharing or whatever.

793
01:02:30,327 --> 01:02:32,318
OK, let's go.

794
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:41,676
Jerry, I mean business. Get on the phone.
Let's go. The fun is over.

795
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,238
Let's go. Come on.

796
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:05,322
Bert Thomas, please. Jerry Langford.

797
01:03:08,727 --> 01:03:11,287
- What happened?
- They hung up.

798
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:18,000
Phone 'em again. Why did they hang up?

799
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:20,442
Thought it was a gag. We get that all the time.

800
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:23,121
Well, I find that strange, you know.

801
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:28,042
But it's typical.
Cos that's the way they treat even you.

802
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:30,436
Cos I'll let you in on a little secret.

803
01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:33,439
That's the way they treated me.

804
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:35,563
And now look where we are.

805
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:39,806
Bert Thomas.

806
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:43,323
Audrey, this is Jerry Langford.
Get Bert Thomas on the phone, quickly.

807
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:46,319
Martino, I know it's you.
I'm too busy for games today.

808
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:50,286
Did you hear what I said?
This is Jerry Langford. Get Bert Thomas.

809
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:53,359
It's not a gag. It's serious. Now move it!

810
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:58,085
- Why don't we have somebody else?
- Like what?

811
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,476
It's Mr Langford. He says it's urgent.

812
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:03,320
Tell him I'll call him back. I'm busy.

813
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:06,638
- It's Martino, the impressionist.
- He's a pain in the neck.

814
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:09,799
Will you do what I tell you? And do it quick.

815
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:14,005
I'm sorry, Mr Thomas, he insists on
talking to you. I cannot get rid of him.

816
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:16,078
OK, I'll take it.

817
01:04:19,127 --> 01:04:20,526
Martino, you know better...

818
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:25,556
Bert, I said this is Jerry. Jerry Langford.
And I'm in deep trouble.

819
01:04:25,647 --> 01:04:30,084
- Now you'd best pay attention.
- Yeah, I am listening.

820
01:04:32,727 --> 01:04:35,321
Would you give me that again?

821
01:04:38,247 --> 01:04:41,603
Now wait a minute.
I wanna ask you something.

822
01:04:42,927 --> 01:04:45,157
What do we call our second cameraman?

823
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:48,876
We call our second cameraman Helen Keller.

824
01:04:51,007 --> 01:04:53,475
His favourite colour is plaid.

825
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:55,637
Helen Keller? Plaid? What is that?

826
01:04:55,727 --> 01:04:58,195
When someone does
an impression of me on the phone,

827
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:01,836
the only way they're gonna know
it's really me is by that clue.

828
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:05,317
If I didn't know what we called him,
then he would know it's not me.

829
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:08,001
Say no more. I understand.

830
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:10,476
Now, listen, Bert. Listen carefully.

831
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,556
"I have a gun...

832
01:05:16,487 --> 01:05:18,682
at my head."

833
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:23,557
"If a man who identifies himself as...

834
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,196
the King..."

835
01:05:34,487 --> 01:05:37,081
Card's upside down.

836
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:40,441
Sorry.

837
01:05:40,527 --> 01:05:44,406
"Is not allowed to be the first guest on..."

838
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:51,957
You got a blank card there.

839
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:56,006
Hold on, Bert. I'm reading from cue cards.

840
01:06:00,647 --> 01:06:02,842
"Tonight's show..."

841
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:08,119
"you will never see me..."

842
01:06:10,807 --> 01:06:12,843
Go back.

843
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,521
"Alive again."

844
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:21,681
It's not grammatically correct,
but I think you have the idea.

845
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:26,045
It's clear, but let me break in for a minute.
Let me talk to you. Don't do anything silly.

846
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:28,766
OK. I'm OK.

847
01:06:28,847 --> 01:06:31,441
I'm OK, Bert. Just get it done.

848
01:06:35,247 --> 01:06:38,080
He wants you to call at five.
I have the private number.

849
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:41,955
- They'll do whatever you want.
- OK, that was very good, Jerry.

850
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,481
Turn around, let's see how it looks.

851
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:49,083
Oh, I love it. I'm sorry.
The sleeves aren't quite right.

852
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:51,965
Do you like it on him? What do you think?

853
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:54,838
I think it looks pretty good.

854
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:58,840
To guess on it and have it turn out like this...
I'm very pleased with it.

855
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:02,237
The colour's great, and I like
to see him more casual for a change.

856
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:06,957
This is a look I like to see on him.
Not so uptight, not so...

857
01:07:07,047 --> 01:07:09,720
- OK. I gotta get started here.
- What do you think?

858
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:12,321
- It's wonderful.
- Be honest with me.

859
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:15,126
- I'm being honest.
- Would you wear it?

860
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:20,122
I like it. I'm so glad I went with red.
It looks so good on him.

861
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:22,880
- It looks good, Jerry.
- Gorgeous.

862
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:24,241
- Come on.
- What?

863
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:26,966
- Take it off and let's go.
- OK.

864
01:07:28,487 --> 01:07:32,366
You want me to take it off?
Why can't he wear it for a little while?

865
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:34,483
Will you take it off, please?

866
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:39,038
I know he's in a meeting, but this is
an emergency and I gotta talk to him.

867
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:43,885
You'll interrupt him,
or I'm gonna come busting into that meeting.

868
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:46,879
No. Forget calling me back. I'm on my way.

869
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:51,606
Why didn't you listen to the tape when
I asked you to? It wasn't that hard, was it?

870
01:07:51,687 --> 01:07:55,646
A few minutes of your time to listen to
something that I worked on my whole life.

871
01:07:55,727 --> 01:08:00,596
If that's what's behind all this, let's go to
my office and we'll play the tape right now.

872
01:08:00,687 --> 01:08:03,997
Are you crazy? You know what would
happen to me if I went there now?

873
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:07,079
- I'm not stupid.
- Nobody's calling you stupid.

874
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,362
You pulled this off. That makes you smart.

875
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:12,439
You know, Jerry,
I'm gonna tell you something.

876
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:15,485
Friendship is a two-way street.

877
01:08:15,567 --> 01:08:19,446
You know that?
And you couldn't have cared less about me.

878
01:08:19,527 --> 01:08:23,315
Am I gonna hold this till next Shavuoth?
You gonna make some decisions here?

879
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:26,604
You gonna knock off
the talking for two minutes?

880
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:28,678
When you dressed him, did I bother you?

881
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:31,156
It took one minute.
You have a long night ahead.

882
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:34,239
- I have something to say.
- You've got more than enough to say.

883
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:39,401
You're driving me nuts! Can you be quiet
for one goddamn minute and let me rest?

884
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:42,684
With this gun? You're driving me crazy!

885
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:45,406
You have not shut up
since we walked into my house.

886
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:47,637
This is <i>my</i> house. This is <i>my</i> domain.

887
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:51,242
Jerry is <i>my</i> guest and you're my guest,
and you're lucky to be here!

888
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,081
You get to change in my house, to get
your head together for the show tonight...

889
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,603
Why can't you give me a little break?!
Shut up!

890
01:08:58,687 --> 01:09:02,646
You shut up! I did give you a break.
I listened to you talk about that sweater.

891
01:09:02,727 --> 01:09:06,322
Worrying about the sleeves, the colour...
Did I say anything?

892
01:09:06,407 --> 01:09:09,319
I didn't make it for you. I made it for Jerry.

893
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:14,276
Whose idea was this anyway? If it wasn't
for me, you wouldn't even be here.

894
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,838
Why didn't you listen to the tape
when I asked you to? Was that so hard to do?

895
01:09:18,927 --> 01:09:23,762
I'm sure you can understand, doing the kind
of show I'm doing, it's mind-boggling -

896
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:27,760
there's so much stuff that comes down,
you can't keep your head clear.

897
01:09:27,847 --> 01:09:30,202
And if that's the case, I'm wrong.

898
01:09:30,287 --> 01:09:33,484
You're right, I'm wrong.
If I'm wrong, I apologise.

899
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:38,357
I'm just a human being,
with all of the foibles and all of the traps.

900
01:09:38,447 --> 01:09:42,281
The show, the pressure, the groupies,
the autograph hounds, the crew.

901
01:09:42,367 --> 01:09:45,518
The incompetents behind the scenes
you think are your friends

902
01:09:45,607 --> 01:09:48,804
and you're not sure if you'll be there
tomorrow because of them.

903
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:53,802
Wonderful pressures that make every day
a glowing, radiant day in your life.

904
01:09:53,887 --> 01:10:00,838
It's terrific. OK. If all of that means nothing,
if I'm wrong, in spite of all that,

905
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:03,202
then I apologise, I'm sorry.

906
01:10:04,487 --> 01:10:08,924
If you accept my apology, I think we should
shake hands and we'll forget the whole thing.

907
01:10:09,007 --> 01:10:15,003
I won't press charges. You two could be
in deep trouble, but I will not press charges.

908
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:20,523
- That's easy for you to say, Jerry.
- But I mean it.

909
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:23,838
I mean, I'll go to the office
and tell them all it's a gag.

910
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:26,964
They'll understand that.
If I tell them that, they'll buy it.

911
01:10:27,047 --> 01:10:31,518
- And then we'll put the tape on and listen...
- Sit down! I said sit down.

912
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,837
You heard what he said.

913
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:36,680
All of a sudden with a gun on him,
he wants to be friends?

914
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:40,476
- What happens when he walks out the door?
- What happens then, Jerry?

915
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:44,606
- You get to his office, and they jump you.
- Is that what happens, Jerry?

916
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:48,282
Not if I tell them not to. They won'tjump you.
No one's gonnajump you.

917
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:52,883
If I tell them to do something, they do it.
No one's gonnajump you.

918
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:56,084
That's the truth.
You have to take my word for it.

919
01:10:56,167 --> 01:11:00,399
If you think I'm not telling you the truth,
then don't respond.

920
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:04,162
If you think I'm telling you the truth,
then let me get the hell outta here.

921
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:06,636
- He gives me his word.
- And what else?

922
01:11:06,727 --> 01:11:09,685
And what else, Jerry?

923
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:12,918
There is nothing else. Just my word.

924
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:16,282
Isn't my word good enough?

925
01:11:19,367 --> 01:11:21,358
I'm sorry, Jerry.

926
01:11:34,287 --> 01:11:40,806
Suppose we tape him, he doesn't talk,
it gets to be 11.30.

927
01:11:40,887 --> 01:11:43,242
Do we put him on, no matter what?

928
01:11:43,327 --> 01:11:47,366
You can go ahead and tape him. It won't
hurt anything. You always can erase it.

929
01:11:47,447 --> 01:11:50,996
We may learn something from it,
and it'll also buy us time.

930
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:53,681
But we will not put this man on the air.

931
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:58,283
This lunatic is threatening Jerry's life
and you're not gonna put him on the air?

932
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:03,521
Let's not get too excited. I don't think
you understand. We'll tape at seven.

933
01:12:03,607 --> 01:12:07,441
We won't have to make a decision
about putting him on the air till 11.30.

934
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:12,920
This gives us four hours. Hopefully, by that
time, we'll have Mr Langford back safely.

935
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:17,364
Harry, that's it. We're suing. We're going
to sue. We're gonna sue everybody.

936
01:12:17,447 --> 01:12:19,756
- Who is this man?
- Jerry's lawyer.

937
01:12:19,847 --> 01:12:23,396
What do you mean, who am I?
I'm the one who's suing. I'm the lawyer.

938
01:12:23,487 --> 01:12:25,637
- Jay...
- Don't "Jay" me, please.

939
01:12:25,727 --> 01:12:28,241
Jay, who are you going to sue?

940
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:30,363
You. We're suing you - personally!

941
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:32,278
- Who else are you suing?
- The FBI.

942
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:35,564
We have a serious situation
and I want it dealt with rationally.

943
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:39,083
Unless we start talking politely,
there'll be serious consequences.

944
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:44,195
There is nothing polite about kidnapping.
It is one of the most stupid offences ever.

945
01:12:44,367 --> 01:12:48,076
Where's the defence of kidnapping?
How can you say "I was crazy"?

946
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,318
"I didn't know what I was doing.
I did it on the spur of the moment"?

947
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:52,396
Who cares?

948
01:12:52,487 --> 01:12:57,117
Only an idiot kidnaps. And only an idiot
decides to do what you guys are doing.

949
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:08,636
Jerry, I'm gonna go now.

950
01:13:09,407 --> 01:13:14,356
Pretty soon you'll be able to go.
About 12, 12.30, as I said. Have a good time.

951
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:16,837
I know you will.

952
01:13:16,927 --> 01:13:18,918
Bye.

953
01:13:22,287 --> 01:13:26,075
We don't know whether
we're dealing with kidnappers or terrorists.

954
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,886
Terrorists? What do you mean, terrorists?

955
01:13:28,967 --> 01:13:32,357
You might have this man go on the air,
deliver a coded message,

956
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:35,598
and 50 people around the country
could lose their lives.

957
01:13:35,687 --> 01:13:38,724
- You're out of your mind!
- I'm not out of my mind.

958
01:13:38,807 --> 01:13:41,924
That guy is gonna be taped,
and we'll listen to what he says.

959
01:13:42,007 --> 01:13:46,159
Unless something horrendous is on that tape,
we're gonna put that tape on the air.

960
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:51,640
All we're dealing with here is ten minutes
of talk-show time against a man's life,

961
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,922
and I don't see that as any argument.

962
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:58,317
Hello. How are you today? Well, I'm calling...

963
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:01,638
Mr King calling collect
long distance for Mr Thomas.

964
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:04,764
Mr Thomas, there's a long-distance call.

965
01:14:04,847 --> 01:14:06,326
Let's go.

966
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:09,319
If this is it, remember, keep him talking.

967
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:11,726
Hi there. Who is this?

968
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:16,517
- This is Mr King. I'm calling for Mr King.
- Well, you're right on time.

969
01:14:16,607 --> 01:14:20,202
Yes, of course. We're always punctual.
We're fine, thank you.

970
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,642
I wanna make it brief, and I wanna tell you...

971
01:14:22,727 --> 01:14:26,402
Could I break in and ask you -
could I speak to Jerry?

972
01:14:26,487 --> 01:14:29,877
Jerry's not with us. We're at a payphone.
Don't have the call traced.

973
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:33,039
I noticed you just did,
cos I heard the sounds, which I know.

974
01:14:33,127 --> 01:14:38,440
It's kind of important, so that we know
that he's in - what'll I say? - Your care?

975
01:14:38,527 --> 01:14:44,079
We've taken care of that by bringing along
an article of clothing that you will recognise.

976
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:48,479
It is not as easy as you thinkjust to
walk in the studio, go right on the show...

977
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,922
No, Bert - if I could call you...

978
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:55,683
Well, if I could just say, there is no problem.
The material is clean material.

979
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:59,646
- Do you know of Standards and Practices?
- No, but that can be discussed.

980
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:02,639
All I can say is don't have any press leaks.

981
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:08,882
You must keep the audience there until 11.45
or 12 o'clock, after it's been aired nationally.

982
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:13,563
Thank you. We'll discuss the other things...
That's your problem. Nice talking to you.

983
01:15:17,287 --> 01:15:21,246
Boy, he's shrewd.
He just wouldn't buy anything.

984
01:16:15,727 --> 01:16:18,958
I feel completely impulsive tonight.

985
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:21,607
Anything could happen.

986
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:25,236
I have so much to tell you.
I don't know where to start.

987
01:16:25,327 --> 01:16:29,718
I wanna tell you everything about myself,
everything you don't know.

988
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:36,006
Do you like these glasses?
Crystal. Beautiful. I bought them just for you.

989
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:39,716
There's something about them.
Just the simplicity of them.

990
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:45,006
But if you don't like them, if there's even
an inkling, even a doubt in your mind...

991
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:53,202
Sometimes during the day
I'll just be doing the simplest things.

992
01:16:53,287 --> 01:16:55,755
I'll be taking a bath and I'll say to myself,

993
01:16:55,847 --> 01:16:59,601
"I wonder if Jerry's taking a bath right now."

994
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:02,724
And I'll just hope
you're not drowning or something.

995
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:07,244
I just get really worried about you,
like something terrible's gonna happen.

996
01:17:07,327 --> 01:17:11,002
And I have these daydreams
that I'm out with you at the golf course,

997
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:14,079
driving your cart, just driving around.

998
01:17:15,127 --> 01:17:18,324
"You need a putter, Jer?" You know?

999
01:17:18,407 --> 01:17:20,682
"Need an iron?"

1000
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:25,761
I don't even know how to play golf.
I played with my parents once, my dad, but...

1001
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:27,838
I love you.

1002
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:35,162
I've never told my parents that I love them.

1003
01:17:35,247 --> 01:17:38,796
They never told me that they loved me either,
which was fine with me.

1004
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,355
But I love you.

1005
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:45,439
Want some wine? No? OK.

1006
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:48,519
I'm not in the mood to drink either, though.

1007
01:17:48,607 --> 01:17:51,679
But I'm sure in the mood to be alone with you.

1008
01:17:53,727 --> 01:17:56,719
Why don't we just clear off the table?

1009
01:17:58,567 --> 01:18:02,276
I was thinking why don't we go upstairs,
but that's so predictable.

1010
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:06,076
Let's just take everything off the table
and do it right here.

1011
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:10,365
That would blow your mind. It would blow
<i>my</i> mind. I've never done anything like that.

1012
01:18:10,447 --> 01:18:14,963
I've never even had anybody over for dinner,
let alone made love on the table.

1013
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:20,041
But I just wanna do that. I just wanna dance.
I just wanna, like, put on some Shirelles.

1014
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:22,118
I wanna be black.

1015
01:18:24,127 --> 01:18:26,243
Wouldn't that be insane?

1016
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,557
God. You know who I wish I was tonight?

1017
01:18:28,647 --> 01:18:32,322
I wish I was Tina Turner,
just dancing through the room.

1018
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:41,438
Please have your tickets ready.

1019
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:49,798
Good evening.
My name is Clarence McCabe. I'm the writer.

1020
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:52,447
- Are these people with you?
- This is my wife.

1021
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:56,566
- These people here?
- Her parents, from Cleveland, Ohio.

1022
01:18:56,647 --> 01:18:59,525
- I'll check your name, sir.
- I'm gonna be on third.

1023
01:18:59,607 --> 01:19:01,598
I'll check your name, sir.

1024
01:19:03,087 --> 01:19:07,399
- I'm sorry, sir. I don't see your name, sir.
- You just went past the M's.

1025
01:19:07,487 --> 01:19:11,162
I'll go back again for you, sir.
There it is again, sir.

1026
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,205
Let me just check. This isn't possible.

1027
01:19:15,447 --> 01:19:18,166
- Did Miss Long call you?
- No, sir, she didn't.

1028
01:19:18,247 --> 01:19:21,205
She didn't tell you about my book
and that I was gonna be on?

1029
01:19:21,287 --> 01:19:24,677
- Not according to this list.
- She told me to be here at a quarter to six.

1030
01:19:24,767 --> 01:19:27,839
It's now ten to six. I've only got ten minutes.

1031
01:19:27,927 --> 01:19:32,045
Only authorised personnel are allowed in.
That's the rules and regulations.

1032
01:19:32,127 --> 01:19:36,837
You never heard of the book?
<i>The Vanishing Siberian Tiger?</i>

1033
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:39,885
- Can I call Miss Long?
- You cannot call Miss Long at all.

1034
01:19:39,967 --> 01:19:41,798
- Can <i>you</i> call her?
- No, sir.

1035
01:19:41,887 --> 01:19:47,280
Your name is not on the list, so I cannot
let you in. That's the rules and regulations.

1036
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,517
- I'm gonna try to get her.
- Stop him.

1037
01:19:49,607 --> 01:19:51,598
Miss Long?

1038
01:20:00,247 --> 01:20:02,044
Clarence!

1039
01:20:02,127 --> 01:20:03,719
Miss Long!

1040
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:20,039
- What is this Clarence McCabe?
- That's who I am.

1041
01:20:20,127 --> 01:20:23,597
- Is that your real name?
- Well, technically, it's my real name.

1042
01:20:23,687 --> 01:20:27,919
- No, it's a pseudonym, actually. An alias.
- Why do you use a pseudonym?

1043
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:30,646
- I'm an author. That's <i>my</i> business.
- Author of what?

1044
01:20:30,727 --> 01:20:33,878
I told you. I wrote a book called
<i>The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.</i>

1045
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:37,323
I spent two years in Russia,
two years in China, researching it.

1046
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:41,116
- Two years in Russia, two in China?
- Right. Does that make me a Communist?

1047
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:52,523
We have one more light to preset.
That'll be number 47.

1048
01:20:52,607 --> 01:20:55,485
- Hello. I'm the King.
- What?

1049
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:59,276
- The King.
- What can I do for Your Highness?

1050
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:01,119
Really, I'm the King.

1051
01:21:01,207 --> 01:21:05,758
Your dressing room's backstage. Your throne
is in there also. You'll recognise the door.

1052
01:21:05,847 --> 01:21:06,882
Very funny.

1053
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:09,561
- There's a half-moon, stars...
- Who's in charge?

1054
01:21:09,647 --> 01:21:14,357
Mr Ding. He's a little fella with
an ice-cream cone nose, a couple of bells.

1055
01:21:14,447 --> 01:21:16,119
- Miss Long.
- Mr Pipkin?

1056
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:19,802
No, it's Mr Pupkin, Miss Long.
Mr Pupkin. How are you?

1057
01:21:20,687 --> 01:21:23,645
What are you doing here, Mr... Pupkin?

1058
01:21:23,727 --> 01:21:26,116
I'm the King.

1059
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:29,040
I think you're expecting me.

1060
01:21:29,127 --> 01:21:31,595
- Yeah.
- Yes. Mr Thomas around?

1061
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:00,758
- Mr King?
- Yes.

1062
01:23:00,847 --> 01:23:05,363
I'm Inspector Gerrity from the FBI.
Do you understand? What is your name?

1063
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,642
- Rupert Pupkin.
- Your real name?

1064
01:23:07,727 --> 01:23:09,763
That's my real name. Rupert Pupkin.

1065
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:14,796
Well, Mr Pupkin, are you gonna tell us
where Jerry Langford is or not?

1066
01:23:14,887 --> 01:23:17,117
- Are you from the show?
- I'm not in the show.

1067
01:23:17,207 --> 01:23:22,042
This is my assistant, Agent Giardello, and
Captain Burke of the New York City Police.

1068
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:27,247
- I'd like to meet someone from the show.
- Not until I get to see Langford.

1069
01:23:27,327 --> 01:23:32,242
- I'd like to see someone from the show first.
- Not unless you tell us where Langford is.

1070
01:23:32,327 --> 01:23:34,716
Well, then Jerry Langford is dead.

1071
01:23:36,287 --> 01:23:38,278
Get Thomas.

1072
01:23:40,327 --> 01:23:43,876
- I'm Bert Thomas. Are you Mr King?
- Yes. How do you do?

1073
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:48,165
- Did we talk on the phone today?
- Yes, we spoke a few moments ago.

1074
01:23:48,247 --> 01:23:50,841
And Jerry spoke to you earlier.

1075
01:23:51,647 --> 01:23:55,925
- Where did you get this?
- That's Jerry's, as you can see.

1076
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:59,204
- What's that?
- That's my blood, not Jerry's.

1077
01:23:59,287 --> 01:24:01,676
I'll buy this. What have we here?

1078
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:06,238
This is my introduction, and I'd like
Mr Randall to speak it word for word.

1079
01:24:06,327 --> 01:24:10,764
Randall's introduction to your monologue?
Could I have a copy of your monologue?

1080
01:24:10,847 --> 01:24:14,203
Actually, I have it memorised,
so I don't have a copy of it.

1081
01:24:14,287 --> 01:24:17,882
I need a copy. We have to make sure
you don't say anything obscene

1082
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:21,118
or anything that could cause
a problem in the audience.

1083
01:24:21,207 --> 01:24:24,324
No, it's all right, really.
It's a wholesome monologue.

1084
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:27,046
- You guarantee it?
- I guarantee it.

1085
01:24:27,127 --> 01:24:30,005
Make sure the audience stays till after 11.30.

1086
01:24:30,087 --> 01:24:33,966
- The man gets everything he asks for.
- Nice meeting you.

1087
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:36,642
Sit down, Pupkin.

1088
01:24:36,727 --> 01:24:42,006
Pupkin, I gotta tell you this. From this point
on, you have the right to remain silent.

1089
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:44,965
You understand?
Cos anything you say from here on out

1090
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:49,325
might be used against you later on
in a court of law. You understand?

1091
01:24:49,407 --> 01:24:51,967
- Say you understand.
- I understand that.

1092
01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:55,437
Did you participate
in the abduction of Jerry Langford?

1093
01:24:55,527 --> 01:24:57,882
Yes, I did. I abducted him.

1094
01:24:57,967 --> 01:25:00,765
You abducted him?
Do you know where Mr Langford is now?

1095
01:25:00,847 --> 01:25:02,121
Yes, I do.

1096
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:05,483
- Will you lead us to Mr Langford?
- No, I won't.

1097
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:10,925
At this time, Mr Pupkin, I wanna advise you
to consider yourself under arrest.

1098
01:25:11,007 --> 01:25:13,475
Fine. I think I should get made up.

1099
01:25:13,967 --> 01:25:17,243
You need some make-up.
Put some colour on his face.

1100
01:25:17,327 --> 01:25:20,125
I'd like to put some colour on your face.

1101
01:25:21,167 --> 01:25:22,566
I should get made up.

1102
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:26,196
"...sad news for you." Turn the card.
"I have some sad..."

1103
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,676
- Did you wanna see me?
- Have you seen this stuff?

1104
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:30,803
I've gone over it. I think it's fine.

1105
01:25:30,887 --> 01:25:35,244
"My writing staff was executed
in Central Park by the network firing squad."

1106
01:25:35,327 --> 01:25:37,318
- It's good.
- You're laughing at that?

1107
01:25:37,407 --> 01:25:39,921
- Do it, please.
- Why do I have to say this?

1108
01:25:40,007 --> 01:25:44,922
Exactly as it's written. It'll play for us.
It'll be good for you. Trust me.

1109
01:25:45,007 --> 01:25:48,602
- You're the director. Can you help me?
- Take the tissues out and let's go.

1110
01:25:48,687 --> 01:25:52,919
- A few more minutes. Let's go.
- Turn the cards fast. Are you listening?

1111
01:25:53,287 --> 01:25:54,117
OK.

1112
01:25:54,207 --> 01:25:58,200
Let's do something crazy tonight.
Just get insane. I wanna be crazy!

1113
01:25:58,287 --> 01:26:01,040
I wanna be nuts!
I wanna have some fun! Goddammit.

1114
01:26:01,127 --> 01:26:06,360
My doctor says "Don't have any fun.
You're not allowed to have a good time."

1115
01:26:06,447 --> 01:26:09,007
I have to be in control. I like being in control.

1116
01:26:09,087 --> 01:26:13,399
But for one night I'd like to see myself
out of my head! Wouldn't you?

1117
01:26:13,487 --> 01:26:16,684
Wouldn't that be great?!
Wouldn't it be fabulous?!

1118
01:26:17,527 --> 01:26:19,518
I'm havin' a good time.

1119
01:26:23,647 --> 01:26:26,207
I'm havin' fun.

1120
01:26:26,287 --> 01:26:29,279
Fun is my middle name. I'm having fun.

1121
01:26:30,127 --> 01:26:34,678
That's right. Havin' some fun.
Never had this much fun before.

1122
01:26:34,847 --> 01:26:42,117
That's right. Good, old-fashioned,
all-American fun.

1123
01:26:42,847 --> 01:26:47,637
And now, direct from New York,
it's <i>The Jerry Langford Show,</i>

1124
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:51,276
with guest host Tony Randall
and his special guests:

1125
01:26:51,367 --> 01:26:54,996
Shelley Winters, Gore Vidal, Tony Bennett,

1126
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:59,880
as always, Lou Brown and the orchestra
and little ol' me, Ed Herlihy.

1127
01:26:59,967 --> 01:27:02,720
Now say hello to Tony!

1128
01:27:19,607 --> 01:27:23,361
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I have some sad news for you.

1129
01:27:24,927 --> 01:27:29,921
Earlier today my writing staff was executed
in Central Park by the network firing squad.

1130
01:27:31,047 --> 01:27:34,722
So there will be no sensational
Randall monologue this evening.

1131
01:27:42,287 --> 01:27:44,881
No embarrassing display of emotion, please.

1132
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:49,006
Instead we'll do something a little bit different
- a lot different, if you ask me.

1133
01:27:49,087 --> 01:27:53,922
We're going to give you a glimpse -
turn it over, please - into the future.

1134
01:27:54,007 --> 01:27:57,841
It isn't often you can call someone
a sure thing in the entertainment business.

1135
01:27:57,927 --> 01:28:01,044
After all, the verdict is always
in your hands, isn't it?

1136
01:28:01,127 --> 01:28:03,641
But I think tonight, after you've met...

1137
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:09,198
my first guest,

1138
01:28:09,287 --> 01:28:14,407
you'll agree with me that he's destined
for greatness, in one way or another.

1139
01:28:14,487 --> 01:28:18,958
So will you please give your warmest
greetings to the newest King of Comedy,

1140
01:28:19,047 --> 01:28:21,038
Rupert Pupkin!

1141
01:28:33,447 --> 01:28:38,441
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Let me
introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin.

1142
01:28:42,607 --> 01:28:45,201
I can't believe I'm gonna kiss you.

1143
01:28:46,967 --> 01:28:49,197
Masha.

1144
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:51,801
Take the tape off.

1145
01:28:51,887 --> 01:28:53,320
Really?

1146
01:28:53,407 --> 01:28:55,398
Go on. Take it off.

1147
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:04,522
- I'm ready now.
- Take him back down.

1148
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:05,596
With pleasure.

1149
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:09,600
Why did you do this? Tell me why
and then maybe I'll be able to believe in you.

1150
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:13,043
- Why did you do such a thing?
- Do you know what time it is?

1151
01:29:13,127 --> 01:29:15,402
- It's five minutes to 11.
- We better go.

1152
01:29:15,487 --> 01:29:20,242
Cos otherwise - and I don't like to say it
like this - Jerry's gonna be unavailable.

1153
01:29:20,327 --> 01:29:23,683
- You'll understand when we go.
- Why will I understand?

1154
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:25,758
Where are we going?

1155
01:29:25,847 --> 01:29:29,635
- That's part of the bargain.
- Part of what bargain?

1156
01:29:29,727 --> 01:29:33,606
That's my understanding.
I just want to see it in this other place.

1157
01:29:33,687 --> 01:29:37,362
And once I see it, that's it.
I'll give you Langford.

1158
01:29:37,447 --> 01:29:40,405
But you don't understand my position.
I have you right now.

1159
01:29:40,487 --> 01:29:43,285
- That's true.
- If I have you, I have a shot at Langford.

1160
01:29:43,407 --> 01:29:46,558
- But you don't have Jerry.
- I understand that.

1161
01:29:47,887 --> 01:29:50,037
I'm getting it off as fast as I can.

1162
01:29:50,127 --> 01:29:52,925
- That's good, Masha.
- Yeah?

1163
01:29:54,007 --> 01:29:56,043
- You all right?
- I'm doing fine.

1164
01:29:56,127 --> 01:29:58,163
I know you are.

1165
01:29:58,687 --> 01:30:00,678
Come on.

1166
01:30:06,007 --> 01:30:09,556
One more thing, please.
I can't walk in here with you.

1167
01:30:09,647 --> 01:30:13,276
If you could just wait here
and let me walk in by myself, that's all.

1168
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,801
I'll break your ankles
if you make a wrong move.

1169
01:30:15,887 --> 01:30:18,640
I promise, OK?

1170
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:21,287
But make believe you don't know me, too.

1171
01:30:21,367 --> 01:30:22,482
Go ahead.

1172
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:50,722
Jerry, you seem a little bit...

1173
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,886
Jerry! Jerry, wait!

1174
01:31:04,967 --> 01:31:06,958
Jerry! Jerry!

1175
01:31:08,247 --> 01:31:10,238
Jerry, come back here!

1176
01:31:11,607 --> 01:31:13,598
Jerry!

1177
01:31:18,607 --> 01:31:20,598
Oh, God.

1178
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:22,678
What do you want now?

1179
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:30,122
- What are you doing? I'm watching that.
- Just a minute.

1180
01:31:30,207 --> 01:31:34,086
Direct from New York,
it's <i>The Jerry Langford Show,</i>

1181
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:38,683
with guest host Tony Randall
and his special guests: Shelley Winters...

1182
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:43,282
- What's going on here?
- Do you know him?

1183
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:48,282
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Just sit tight. Relax. Everything'll be OK.

1184
01:31:49,007 --> 01:31:53,159
...my first guest, you'll agree with me
that he's destined for greatness,

1185
01:31:53,247 --> 01:31:55,317
in one way or another.

1186
01:31:55,407 --> 01:31:59,639
So will you please give your warmest
greetings to the newest King of Comedy,

1187
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:01,763
Rupert Pupkin!

1188
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:18,637
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Let me
introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin.

1189
01:32:19,927 --> 01:32:23,966
I was born in Clifton, New Jersey,
which was not at that time a federal offence.

1190
01:32:25,727 --> 01:32:27,877
Is there anyone here from Clifton?

1191
01:32:27,967 --> 01:32:30,879
Good, we can all relax now.

1192
01:32:30,967 --> 01:32:37,202
I'll begin by saying that my parents were
too poor to afford me a childhood in Clifton,

1193
01:32:37,287 --> 01:32:40,916
but the fact is that no one is allowed
to be really too poor in Clifton.

1194
01:32:41,007 --> 01:32:45,444
Once you fall below a certain level,
they exile you to Passaic.

1195
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:54,725
But my parents did put the first two
down payments on my childhood.

1196
01:32:54,807 --> 01:32:58,516
But they did also return me
to the hospital as defective.

1197
01:33:00,927 --> 01:33:05,205
But, like everyone else, I grew up
in large part thanks to my mother.

1198
01:33:05,287 --> 01:33:07,642
If she were only here today, I'd say

1199
01:33:07,727 --> 01:33:11,959
"Hey, Mom! What are you doing here?
You've been dead for nine years!"

1200
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:18,079
But you should've seen my mother.
She was wonderful.

1201
01:33:18,167 --> 01:33:21,045
Blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic...

1202
01:33:23,647 --> 01:33:29,005
We used to drink milk together after school.
Mine was homogenised, hers was loaded.

1203
01:33:29,087 --> 01:33:31,806
Once they picked her up for speeding.
She was doing 50.

1204
01:33:31,887 --> 01:33:34,276
All right, but in our garage?

1205
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:45,083
And when they tested her,
they found out that her alcohol had 2/ blood.

1206
01:33:49,647 --> 01:33:53,037
But we used to joke together, Mom and me,

1207
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:58,042
until the tears would stroll down her face
and she would throw up! Yeah.

1208
01:33:58,127 --> 01:34:00,687
And who would clean it up? Not Dad.

1209
01:34:00,767 --> 01:34:05,443
He was too busy down at O'Grady's,
throwing up on his own.

1210
01:34:05,527 --> 01:34:09,725
In fact, until I was 16, I thought
throwing up was a sign of maturity.

1211
01:34:10,887 --> 01:34:14,357
While the other kids were off in the woods
sneaking cigarettes,

1212
01:34:14,447 --> 01:34:18,156
I was hiding behind the house
with my fingers down my throat.

1213
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:28,516
The only problem was I never got anywhere,
until one day my father caught me.

1214
01:34:28,607 --> 01:34:32,998
And just as he was giving me
a final kick in the stomach for luck,

1215
01:34:33,087 --> 01:34:36,477
I managed to heave all over his new shoes!

1216
01:34:36,567 --> 01:34:40,162
"That's it!" I thought.
"I've made it! I'm finally a man!"

1217
01:34:48,207 --> 01:34:50,437
But, as it turned out, I was wrong.

1218
01:34:50,527 --> 01:34:53,883
That was the only attention
my father ever gave me.

1219
01:34:55,247 --> 01:34:59,843
He was usually too busy out in the park
playing ball with my sister Rose.

1220
01:35:01,127 --> 01:35:04,244
But today, I must say,
thanks to those many hours of practice,

1221
01:35:04,327 --> 01:35:06,795
my sister Rose has grown into a fine man.

1222
01:35:12,767 --> 01:35:14,962
I wasn't interested in athletics.

1223
01:35:15,047 --> 01:35:18,926
The only exercise I ever got
was when the other kids picked on me.

1224
01:35:19,007 --> 01:35:23,080
They used to beat me up once a week,
usually Tuesday.

1225
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:27,479
And after a while,
the school worked it into the curriculum.

1226
01:35:27,567 --> 01:35:30,445
And if you knocked me out,
you got extra credit.

1227
01:35:32,487 --> 01:35:35,445
Except there was this one kid.
Poor kid. He was afraid of me.

1228
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:37,722
I used to tell him "Hit me, hit me!"

1229
01:35:37,807 --> 01:35:41,322
"What's the matter with you?
Don't you wanna graduate?"

1230
01:35:45,647 --> 01:35:51,040
As for me, I was the youngest kid in the
history of the school to graduate in traction.

1231
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:58,723
But my only real interest,
right from the beginning, was show business.

1232
01:35:58,807 --> 01:36:03,278
Even as a young man, I began at the very top,
collecting autographs.

1233
01:36:04,887 --> 01:36:06,684
Now...

1234
01:36:08,247 --> 01:36:12,286
A lot of you are probably wondering
why Jerry isn't with us tonight.

1235
01:36:12,367 --> 01:36:14,835
I'll tell you, the fact is he's tied up.

1236
01:36:14,927 --> 01:36:17,725
And I'm the one who tied him.

1237
01:36:19,647 --> 01:36:24,641
I know you think I'm joking, but that's the
only way I could break into show business,

1238
01:36:24,727 --> 01:36:27,366
by hijacking Jerry Langford.

1239
01:36:27,447 --> 01:36:32,077
Right now Jerry is strapped to a chair
somewhere in the middle of this city.

1240
01:36:36,767 --> 01:36:41,795
Go ahead and laugh. Thank you.
I appreciate it. But the fact is, I'm here.

1241
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:45,323
Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding
and you'll think I was crazy.

1242
01:36:45,407 --> 01:36:50,401
But I figure it this way: Better to be king
for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.

1243
01:36:52,607 --> 01:36:54,802
Thank you. Thank you.

1244
01:37:33,367 --> 01:37:37,076
- How'd you do that?
- Did you like it? Thank you.

1245
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:41,046
I'd like to buy everyone here a drink,
and I hope you all enjoyed the show.

1246
01:37:41,127 --> 01:37:45,120
- Rita, you keep the change.
- We can go get Langford now.

1247
01:37:45,207 --> 01:37:49,803
Just because I made it big
doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you.

1248
01:37:49,887 --> 01:37:52,355
- I'll call you...
- No more speeches!

1249
01:37:52,447 --> 01:37:54,438
- What's happening?
- Take care.

1250
01:37:54,527 --> 01:37:59,806
That's the same guy who was just
on television. Just now. Same guy.

1251
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:05,242
I'm just getting even.
Those jokes. Those jokes were murder.

1252
01:38:05,327 --> 01:38:07,443
- You didn't like those jokes?
- No.

1253
01:38:07,527 --> 01:38:12,726
I'm looking for whoever wrote the material.
I'd like to pick him up and take him along.

1254
01:38:12,807 --> 01:38:18,245
I wrote the material. I disagree with you.
I thought they were very good jokes.

1255
01:38:19,247 --> 01:38:22,922
If you wrote that material,
I got one piece of advice for you.

1256
01:38:23,007 --> 01:38:27,717
Throw yourself on your knees
in front of the judge and beg for mercy.

1257
01:38:27,807 --> 01:38:29,843
That's very funny. You'll see.

1258
01:38:29,927 --> 01:38:32,646
In the most bizarre debut
in recent times,

1259
01:38:32,727 --> 01:38:37,676
a self-styled comedian named Rupert Pupkin
appeared on <i>The Jerry Langford Show...</i>

1260
01:38:37,767 --> 01:38:42,124
The incident has made
the name Rupert Pupkin a household word.

1261
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:46,598
His performance has been viewed
by a record 87 million American households.

1262
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:51,124
Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping
King of Comedy, was sentenced to six years

1263
01:38:51,207 --> 01:38:54,563
at the minimum-security facility
in Allenwood, Pennsylvania,

1264
01:38:54,647 --> 01:38:58,162
for his part in the abduction
of talk-show host Jerry Langford.

1265
01:38:58,247 --> 01:39:00,807
On the anniversary
of his appearance on the show,

1266
01:39:00,887 --> 01:39:06,564
Pupkin told reporters he still considers
Jerry Langford his friend and mentor.

1267
01:39:06,647 --> 01:39:09,957
He reported that
he has been writing his memoirs,

1268
01:39:10,047 --> 01:39:14,996
which have been purchased by a leading New
York publishing house for over $1 million.

1269
01:39:15,087 --> 01:39:17,078
Rupert Pupkin was released today

1270
01:39:17,167 --> 01:39:20,318
after serving two years and nine months
of a six-year sentence.

1271
01:39:20,407 --> 01:39:23,558
Hundreds greeted
the 37-year-old comedian and author,

1272
01:39:23,647 --> 01:39:26,286
among them
his new agent and manager, David Ball,

1273
01:39:26,367 --> 01:39:29,962
who announced that <i>King for a Night,</i>
Pupkin's autobiography,

1274
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:31,924
would appear as a major movie.

1275
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:35,841
Pupkin said he had used his stay
at Allenwood to sharpen his material.

1276
01:39:35,927 --> 01:39:39,237
He said he and his people
were weighing a number of attractive offers

1277
01:39:39,327 --> 01:39:42,319
and he looked forward
to resuming his show-business career.

1278
01:39:44,047 --> 01:39:48,677
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the man we've all been waiting for...

1279
01:39:48,767 --> 01:39:50,758
and waiting for.

1280
01:39:52,447 --> 01:39:56,759
Would you welcome home, please,
television's brightest new star.

1281
01:39:56,847 --> 01:40:00,840
The legendary, inspirational,
the one and only King of Comedy,

1282
01:40:00,927 --> 01:40:04,442
ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Pupkin!

1283
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:21,318
Rupert Pupkin, ladies and gentlemen!
Let's hear it for Rupert Pupkin!

1284
01:40:24,967 --> 01:40:28,164
Wonderful! Rupert Pupkin,

Rupert Pupkin, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's hear it for Rupert Pupkin!

1286
01:40:36,487 --> 01:40:40,036
Wonderful! Rupert Pupkin,

1287
01:43:39,847 --> 01:43:43,920
