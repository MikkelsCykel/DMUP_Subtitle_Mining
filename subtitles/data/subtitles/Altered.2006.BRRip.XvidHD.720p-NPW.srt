1
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,055
Do it.

2
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:18,775
Hey, I think we ought to wait.

3
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,143
Don't go pussy on me all of a sudden.

4
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:21,177
I'm not, man. I mean, l--

5
00:01:21,177 --> 00:01:22,337
Don't!

6
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:29,879
This is the stupidest goddamn
thing I've ever done.

7
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,518
Go right, Cody, go right.

8
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:54,701
Watch for traps.

9
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,005
Hey, moron! You almost harpooned me.

10
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,269
Suck it up, piss pants.

11
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,834
Idiot.

12
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:42,847
Guys?

13
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:02,335
Shit!

14
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,506
Duke!

15
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,818
Duke!

16
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:10,376
It's over here!

17
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,061
Shit.

18
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:19,585
Fuck. Fuck.

19
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:21,854
God damn it!

20
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:00,432
Shit.

21
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:08,805
Fuck you!

22
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:22,754
Fellas!

23
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:26,722
I can't believe we actually caught one.

24
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,567
It's uglier than I remembered.

25
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,228
It's about to get uglier.

26
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,445
Those sons of bitches following us.

27
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:43,246
I don't think so.

28
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,047
You don't think so?

29
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,848
Rush took off right after
we seen the first one.

30
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:48,751
God damn right they ran. Little bitches.

31
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:49,852
I need more chains.

32
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:50,520
More chains.

33
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,387
I ain't got no more.

34
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:52,877
He ain't got no more.

35
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:56,125
Son of a bitch!

36
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,114
Cody!

37
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:59,161
Stop that shit!

38
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:04,801
God damn it, Duke,

39
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,502
You're bleeding all over the van.

40
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:08,129
I try holding it.

41
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:09,505
It looks dead.

42
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:10,506
It's not dead.

43
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:11,608
I don't think it's breathing.

44
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:14,310
Would you just shut the fuck up, please?

45
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,800
I need to think.

46
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:33,963
Cody!

47
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:35,131
Don't look that thing in the eyes.

48
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:36,366
What do you think, I'm retarded?

49
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,934
That's some dangerous shit back there.

50
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,937
Oh, thanks for the news flash, brainiac.

51
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:42,171
Duke?

52
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:43,439
What the hell is that?

53
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,340
It's a star.

54
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,475
It's a moving star.

55
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,409
It's an airplane, then.

56
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,577
Ain't no fuckin' airplane.

57
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:51,069
It's a fucking airplane, Otis! Chill.

58
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:04,961
Oh, God!

59
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:05,895
What the fuck!

60
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:08,298
For protection. Against the eyes.

61
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,632
Gimme that shit.

62
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:10,894
Left! Turn left!

63
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,174
What the fuck's that?
That's not the turn.

64
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:20,369
Only thing up here is boonies, man.

65
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:21,878
Oh, man, Duke.

66
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:23,846
We gotta get off the road.

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,615
Fuck no, Duke.

68
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:26,349
Fuck no!

69
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,583
You got a better idea?

70
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,153
All these years we pissed away
at Nixon's farm...

71
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:31,187
... waiting for this...

72
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:32,455
And this is the best you've got?

73
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:34,657
I never thought
we'd catch the damned thing.

74
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,392
We can't trust 'em, Duke.

75
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:38,227
Wyatt's the only one who
knows about these things.

76
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:40,163
We all know about these fuckin' things.

77
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,653
Not like Wyatt.

78
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,696
Fuckin' bullshit!

79
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,367
Not like Wyatt.

80
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,796
Fuck this shit.

81
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,174
Wyatt?

82
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:07,483
You better go back to sleep.

83
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,844
There's nothing out there, baby.

84
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,089
It never ends.

85
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,702
This is fucked, Duke.

86
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:08,363
They're gonna come looking.

87
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:10,864
We can't just stand out here
in the open.

88
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:12,897
Get back in the van.

89
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,678
The thing's in the van.

90
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,080
Wyatt.

91
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:24,576
Fuck this.

92
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,889
Wyatt, I know you're in there, Wyatt.

93
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:34,493
Look,

94
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:37,923
I know you don't want to see us.

95
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:43,102
I understand. But me and
the boys. We got no choice.

96
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,510
We've been out to Nixon's farm, Wyatt.
And...

97
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:52,615
They're after us.

98
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,650
You know that better than I do.

99
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,086
And I bet my ass you know
what we got out here in this van.

100
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:00,087
Get it!

101
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,847
Go get it!

102
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,632
Dadgommit, Wyatt,
we need a place to hide.

103
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:10,633
You don't let us in here,

104
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,692
... we're all gonna die out here.

105
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,805
I know you, Wyatt.
You won't let that happen.

106
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:18,171
You can't let that happen, Wyatt.

107
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:23,310
Not this time.

108
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,635
What's up, Wyatt?

109
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,262
That's far enough.

110
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:55,444
What is this?

111
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:57,647
It's a chance to make things right.

112
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:58,481
What's in the tarp?

113
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:01,712
You know damn well what's
in the goddamned tarp.

114
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,321
What the fuck did you boys do?

115
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,186
We took some action.

116
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,322
But you wouldn't know shit about that.

117
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:14,630
Come on, Otis.

118
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,530
The mask was my idea.

119
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,561
The chains.

120
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:22,905
Did you kill it?

121
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:24,507
It wouldn't come without a fight.

122
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:25,941
It's lost a lot of goop, though.

123
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:27,932
Is it breathing?

124
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,079
Is it supposed to?

125
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,615
Is... god damn it.

126
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:33,809
Shit.

127
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:37,943
This thing dies,
we're all in a world of shit.

128
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,546
Kick this one's ass.

129
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,451
Kick some more.

130
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,360
You ignorant shit.

131
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,729
You kill it and the rest are
gonna come and put us down.

132
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,892
And I don't just mean us
in this fucking garage.

133
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,701
Get out of the way, Otis.

134
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,461
What the fuck is this?

135
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,393
Hope.

136
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,566
It's one thirty in the morning.

137
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:25,329
Yeah, it's just business.

138
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,803
Christ, Wyatt.
What the fuck kind of business.

139
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:29,236
They have guns.

140
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,075
One of them's bleeding.

141
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,310
Hey, Wyatt.

142
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,945
You need me to put
your woman in her place?

143
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:36,879
Excuse me?

144
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,714
Well, he don't mean nothing, ma'am.

145
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:39,882
He's just an asshole.

146
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:42,818
At this point I'm gonna ask you all
to get the fuck out of my house.

147
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:43,986
Please, baby....

148
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:45,248
Let it go.

149
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:46,255
It's okay.

150
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:47,957
Wyatt, you in some kind of trouble?

151
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,857
Nothing I can't handle.

152
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,950
What the hell is that?

153
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,060
Please.

154
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:04,406
Just give me a minute.
That's all I need.

155
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:05,908
What is that, Wyatt?

156
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,967
I'll explain everything.

157
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,942
Do I want to know?

158
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,281
Please, baby.

159
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:26,729
You all need to get that thing
back where you found it

160
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:27,863
But we think they're coming after us.

161
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:28,964
It ain't my goddamn problem.

162
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:29,298
Wyatt.

163
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:31,266
It ain't my goddamn problem!

164
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:33,335
Now, you listen to me.

165
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:36,038
The longer you keep that thing,
the more dangerous things get.

166
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:38,207
I told you, he ain't changed.

167
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:39,108
Wyatt, just hear us out.

168
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,235
I'm not getting mixed up
in your shit, Duke.

169
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:45,173
I left this shit in the
rear view a long time ago.

170
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,984
It's been 1 5 years, guys.

171
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:50,419
So let this shit go.

172
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:52,154
Fuck this pussy!

173
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:54,857
We'll take it back to Otis'
and carve it like a turkey.

174
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:57,493
The hell we will. My mom would shit.

175
00:14:57,493 --> 00:15:00,129
Pissing on these things
ain't gonna bring back Timmy.

176
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,198
I ain't gonna hide like a pantywaist...

177
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,224
... from the sons of bitches
that murdered my brother.

178
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,038
Fuck it. You do what you want.

179
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,774
But don't do it in here.

180
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:14,376
God damn right I'm gonna do what I want.

181
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:16,445
You sack of fucking shit.

182
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:17,746
Cody...

183
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:18,974
What.

184
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:22,249
We're all friends here, Duke.

185
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:25,877
You gotta trust me on this one, Cody.

186
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,579
Trust you?

187
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:31,427
Last time we did that,
you made us look like apeshit.

188
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:34,988
The whole town thought
we gone retard, you asshole!

189
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,700
My own fuckin' father thought...

190
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,370
... I killed my brother and
buried him out in the woods.

191
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,504
I thought it would be better.

192
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:43,698
Better?

193
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,370
Better?

194
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:49,540
Fucking over your friends was better?

195
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:51,714
Telling the whole world we were lying?

196
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,883
Telling everybody we made everything up?

197
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:54,550
Guys?

198
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,450
I thought if people knew the truth--

199
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:58,153
Cody!

200
00:15:58,153 --> 00:16:00,122
Cody. God, that's enough, Cody.

201
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:01,624
What'd you think about that, dipshit?

202
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:02,291
Cody.

203
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,425
Guys. 205a. Huh?

204
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:07,162
You're worse than any fuckin'
cocksuckin' piece of shit!...

205
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:10,598
You got your money's worth,
now get the fuck out of my garage.

206
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:14,964
It's awake.

207
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:17,603
That's good, right?

208
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,217
Wyatt, I think it knows you, man.

209
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,468
No. No. No.

210
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,206
What's it doing?

211
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:52,441
Fuck if I know.

212
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:54,033
Wyatt, what's it doing?

213
00:16:55,077 --> 00:16:56,237
Wyatt!

214
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,206
Wyatt!

215
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,309
They're coming back.

216
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:09,391
This fucknut wants to take care of us.

217
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,626
We should make it to the van.

218
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,127
I mean, if they're coming,
we probably should--

219
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:15,230
Shut up! Shut up!
Nobody talk. Nobody talk.

220
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,099
What? Oh, fuck that shit.

221
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,200
Shut up!

222
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,326
Shut up!

223
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:22,037
What the fuck?

224
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,061
Shut up!

225
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:25,735
The man says shut up, you shut up, Cody.

226
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:28,576
They're gone, right, Wyatt?

227
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,981
It's sending a signal.

228
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:36,483
Hold it down.

229
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,854
Hold it down! Hold it down!

230
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:39,843
Hold it down!

231
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:46,352
Hold it.

232
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:50,988
Good.

233
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:09,844
God fuck!

234
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:12,955
Fuckin' God!

235
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,547
Hold it down!

236
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:16,381
Aw, fuck.

237
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:20,596
Fuck you, goddamn it.

238
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:21,363
Fuck.

239
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:22,352
Fuck.

240
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,697
Hold it still, damn it.

241
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:38,313
The fucker's trying to send a code.

242
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:39,048
Cut it.

243
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:39,415
What?

244
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:40,916
Cut it! Cut the fucking...

245
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,747
Get something to cut the fucking thing.

246
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,150
Come on, Duke. Cut it. Cut it.

247
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:48,557
That's it. Cut it.
Come on. Cut it. Cut it.

248
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:49,785
Cut it, Duke!

249
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:06,640
It was trying to call the others.

250
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:08,610
If it's calling its buds,

251
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,374
why aren't we knee deep
in these sons of bitches?

252
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:13,882
It must be damaged.

253
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:15,951
Probably because of that
goddamn ass whooping

254
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:19,250
... we put on this motherfucker
out in them woods.

255
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,222
Probably.

256
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,032
Best not to take no chances.

257
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,932
How'd you know, Wyatt?

258
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:33,897
About the implant?

259
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,273
Call it a hunch.

260
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,865
Keep the lights out and stay quiet...

261
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,730
... and they might not find us.

262
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,468
Take it back to Nixon's farm
in the morning.

263
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,507
Safer to travel in the daytime.

264
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:21,049
Hey, do you think
we all got one of those

265
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:23,449
... GPS clicker thingies in us?

266
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,985
Wyatt would know if we did.

267
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:35,891
Hey, that clicker went off
the second it saw you.

268
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,297
What the fuck is going on, man?

269
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:42,502
Wyatt?

270
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:47,775
You think you can check me
for one them clickers?

271
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:55,184
Not usually... but have them deliveries...

272
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,652
... and they're willing to...

273
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:57,846
Who you calling?

274
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,255
Wyatt, baby,
this is a dangerous situation.

275
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,957
Who did you call? Just tell me!

276
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:03,458
She's calling the cops, wasn't she!

277
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,660
I'm outta here. Give me the keys.

278
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,361
The hell you are, you fucking bitch!

279
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,262
Shut the fuck up.

280
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:08,363
Give me the keys, Wyatt.

281
00:21:08,363 --> 00:21:10,832
Listen to me. I can't let you go.

282
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,561
Not until morning.

283
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,770
Hope, I'm trying to protect you.

284
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,000
By holding me hostage.

285
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,473
First thing in the morning,

286
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:20,108
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.

287
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:21,043
I'm on fucking parole.

288
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:21,777
Fuck off, Cody.

289
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,579
You fuck off, Wyatt.

290
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,846
I ain't going back to prison

291
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,882
... 'cause this crazy
ass bitch is losing it.

292
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:28,577
You understand that?

293
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,452
This bitch called the cops,

294
00:21:30,452 --> 00:21:32,010
I swear to God I'll cut her up.

295
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:38,227
Hey, baby.

296
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:39,922
What's the play now?

297
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:42,197
You always got the answers.

298
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:44,290
Put the gun down, Cody.

299
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,867
You always thought you were the leader.

300
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,569
Some leader.

301
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,973
Look at us.

302
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:55,405
We're all fucked up now.

303
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:00,381
I guess Timmy was the lucky one, huh?

304
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:02,444
Lucky my ass.

305
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:04,920
You got no idea what happened to Timmy.

306
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,289
That's right, I have no idea.

307
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,323
But you do.

308
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:11,690
Look, we're all friends here, okay?
Let's not do anything stupid.

309
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:15,330
Let's take a deep breath and calm down.

310
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,490
Hope!

311
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,391
What are you doing, baby?

312
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:21,336
Give me that knife, Hope.

313
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:23,472
She looked it in the eyes, didn't she?

314
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,139
Ah, fuck. Easy.

315
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:26,141
This ain't gonna fly, Wyatt.

316
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:27,109
The thing's got her.

317
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,410
Don't matter.

318
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,978
She ain't got nothing to do with this!

319
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:32,276
If that thing gets loose...
We're all dead.

320
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:34,616
I know she's your girl and all...
But I don't give a shit.

321
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:35,250
No.

322
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,318
It's playing with us.

323
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:37,719
Look what she's doing!

324
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,453
I'm shooting.

325
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:39,886
No. No. No.

326
00:22:40,722 --> 00:22:41,590
Cody.

327
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,357
Hope...

328
00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:44,126
Hope. Please, baby...

329
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,560
This man will kill you.

330
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,255
She's fucking cutting it.

331
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:50,024
Please, baby... Concentrate on my voice.

332
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:54,536
What do you want?

333
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:55,604
He's talking to it.

334
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:57,299
You let her go!

335
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:03,005
The gun.

336
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,048
Put down the gun, Cody.

337
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:07,249
No fuckin' way.

338
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:08,650
Calm down, Cody.

339
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,918
Put down the fucking gun!

340
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:12,521
Fuck this bullshit!

341
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,355
Jesus Christ!

342
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:14,923
Put down the gun!

343
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:16,891
No fuckin' way.

344
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:26,692
Stop!

345
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:31,206
Let go of her!

346
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:32,264
Let go!

347
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:38,671
God damn it! Let go!

348
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:21,321
Red line's out of bounds.

349
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,789
Nobody crosses it. No matter what.

350
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:58,126
Oh, damn, that looks infected.

351
00:24:58,126 --> 00:25:00,185
Might need a tetanus shot.

352
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,753
Had one when I was seven, remember?

353
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:08,902
Fuck itps deep.

354
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:13,197
Oh, jees... Wyatt.

355
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:17,479
That works?

356
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,003
Hell if I know.

357
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:25,446
You shouldnpt be out trying to pull
some cockamamie stunt, Duke.

358
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,052
You got a wife and kid.

359
00:25:30,192 --> 00:25:32,660
Pam left me four years ago.

360
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,502
That ain't shit.

361
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,574
I've seen worse.

362
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:57,986
How many nights have you boys been
out trying to catch one of those things?

363
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,214
Nights?

364
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:01,646
Try years.

365
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:04,921
Probably seven by now.

366
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:08,964
Damn, Duke.

367
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,131
That's some shit.

368
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:12,725
It was either that or go out drinking.

369
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:17,864
Well, there was some drinking
out there too.

370
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:23,574
Actually after a while it was
pretty much all about the drinking.

371
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,922
Got easier
when Otis started hanging out.

372
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:35,822
We could watch in shifts.

373
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:38,692
Then numbnuts got out of prison.

374
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,264
Fucking bear traps was his idea.

375
00:26:42,264 --> 00:26:44,289
Yeah, I could have guessed that.

376
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:48,367
Going out to Nixon's farm was...

377
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:50,696
... our way of coping.

378
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:57,544
You been coping, Wyatt?

379
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:02,612
What do you think, Duke?

380
00:27:03,351 --> 00:27:05,120
Ah, shit!

381
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,179
Motherfucker!

382
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,492
Fuck!

383
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:15,058
Fuck it. God damn it.

384
00:27:16,665 --> 00:27:20,268
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

385
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:22,395
I'm supposed to...

386
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:27,208
... put this duct tape over your mouth...

387
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,903
... because of the...

388
00:27:31,746 --> 00:27:33,515
Wyatt thought it'd be better.

389
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:36,006
You tell Wyatt to go fuck himself.

390
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:44,925
We all know how it feels.

391
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:50,031
Having one of those things...

392
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,931
... inside you like that.

393
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,494
Controlling you?

394
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,832
It's the worst fucking thing ever.

395
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:02,002
It's hell.

396
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:07,574
It's worse when it's longer.

397
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:13,382
They did it to us for days.

398
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:21,289
Oh, well.
Let's hold off on tape for now...

399
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:30,000
God damn it.

400
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:33,272
What the fuck?

401
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:37,476
God damn it.

402
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,849
Oh, fuck me.

403
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:50,018
God damn it. What the fuck?

404
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:54,996
What the fuck are those...

405
00:28:57,132 --> 00:28:58,199
God damn it.

406
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:00,435
Oh, fuck!

407
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:02,570
Oh, God damn it.

408
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,730
Oh, fuck.

409
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:05,434
Please no.

410
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,376
What the fuck.

411
00:29:12,347 --> 00:29:14,215
Fuck. God damn it

412
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,147
Fuck!

413
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:16,781
Fuck.

414
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:23,852
Oh, shit.

415
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:29,390
Come on, man. I gotta drop a deuce.

416
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,062
Quit playing.

417
00:30:12,107 --> 00:30:16,066
Is this why you gave me so much
shit when I wanted to move in?

418
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:21,504
Yeah.

419
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,581
Good call.

420
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,818
Honey...

421
00:30:36,364 --> 00:30:39,697
I never wanted to get you
mixed up in all of this.

422
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:42,830
You understand that, right?

423
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:50,405
You're gonna have to give me a little
more time on the understandin' part.

424
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,962
Get the hell out of my way!

425
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,708
Get the fuck out of my way!

426
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:24,445
Come on, Cody. Calm down, man.

427
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:26,581
This was your fucking plan.

428
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:29,250
No, my plan was to catch it.

429
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,020
And now what? You want out?

430
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,823
Oh, you sad fucking sack.

431
00:31:34,823 --> 00:31:37,621
There's more at stake now than just us.

432
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:41,320
You're damned right.
They killed my brother.

433
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,960
Now get the fuck out of my way, Duke.

434
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:47,559
Cody!

435
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:49,170
Cody, put that thing down.

436
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,502
You're not calling
the fucking shots, Wyatt.

437
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:56,639
Now I'm not playing around here.

438
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:00,613
I've got business with this thing.

439
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:04,385
And I plan on taking care of
it right fucking now.

440
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:06,621
Get out of my fucking way, Duke!

441
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:07,322
Cody!

442
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:10,086
Get the fuck out of my way, Duke!

443
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,359
Fucking savages.

444
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,627
Calm down, Cody.

445
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:15,330
I want answers, motherfuckers. Now!

446
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,365
Cody, this is some dangerous shit.

447
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:18,696
Dangerous?

448
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:20,935
You want to see dangerous?

449
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:24,837
You boys still think
I'm screwing around?

450
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,041
It bit me.

451
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,144
Look at that. It is spreading.

452
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:31,145
We can help you.

453
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:33,781
Duke. Not too close.

454
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:35,009
What?

455
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:39,921
Listen, Cody, why don't you
turn off the torch and lay down man.

456
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:41,650
You seen it before.

457
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:44,392
It's bad, ain't it.

458
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:45,193
Ain't it!

459
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:46,694
It's just a rash, right, Wyatt?

460
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:48,889
It's just a rash, Cody.

461
00:32:49,163 --> 00:32:50,926
Oh, shit!

462
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,035
Get out of the fucking way!

463
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:55,470
This is between me and it.

464
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,939
Put the torch down, okay?
We can fix this.

465
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,340
We can get you to a hospital.

466
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,606
Yeah. Yeah. I could be some
college boy's thesis project.

467
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm not being a lab rat.

468
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,781
Not again.

469
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:07,949
That ain't gonna happen, Cody.

470
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,717
Now just put the torch down.

471
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:12,020
Now see, Wyatt? That's your problem.

472
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,614
You always think you
got a say in the matter.

473
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:22,689
You see what happens when
you try to fuck with me?

474
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:25,733
Come on. You see what
happens, motherfuckers?

475
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:27,235
I dare you. Come on.

476
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,237
Try that shit again, you motherfuckers.

477
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:30,704
You little pussies.

478
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,146
Duke!

479
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,280
Don't touch him.

480
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,281
What about you, man?

481
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,873
Don't worry about me.

482
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:43,484
He's not dead, is he?

483
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:44,752
I mean, I didn't hit him that hard.

484
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:46,652
No, he ain't dead. Don't worry.

485
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:55,997
We just gonna let him rot away in there?

486
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:56,898
He needs help, Wyatt.

487
00:33:56,898 --> 00:33:58,991
Nobody can help him, all right?

488
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:01,235
Stay away from him.

489
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:02,770
That shit's contagious.

490
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,705
But you touched him.

491
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:04,405
It won't do nothing.

492
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:06,532
None of this shit ever does.

493
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:12,103
That's what Timmy had, isn't it?

494
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:14,415
When they took us.

495
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:15,973
That's what killed Timmy.

496
00:34:21,956 --> 00:34:23,514
It won't take long.

497
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:30,990
They'll start eating him inside and out.

498
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:36,793
He'll watch his flesh peel
away layer by layer.

499
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,733
It'll hurt so bad,
it'll make him insane.

500
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:43,575
Dangerous.

501
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:47,548
A few hours from now,

502
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:49,017
he'll be begging us to
put a bullet in his head...

503
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,952
... 'cause his fingers are hurt so bad...

504
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:53,250
he won't be able to pull the trigger.

505
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:56,122
Sweet Jesus Christ on the cross.

506
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,688
Wyatt.

507
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,328
Can I talk with you for a minute alone?

508
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:02,057
Hey, what about me?

509
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,062
You stay in there and watch the girl.

510
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,201
Shit, Duke,

511
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:10,068
I don't want to be alone with
that chick. She freaks me out.

512
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:11,639
Sorry, Wyatt.

513
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,937
Just get your ass in there,
Otis, please.

514
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:16,503
Please.

515
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,577
They let us catch it, didn't they?

516
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:29,991
What the fuck you talking about, Duke?

517
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,359
I'm saying there's no way in Hades...

518
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,895
... we could have caught
that thing the way that we did.

519
00:35:33,895 --> 00:35:37,126
They just dropped that
fucker off and sent him right to us.

520
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:39,159
You're crazy.

521
00:35:40,034 --> 00:35:41,626
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

522
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,302
I'm sorry.

523
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:49,006
I'm such a fucking idiot.

524
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,704
They knew our dumb
asses would bring it to you.

525
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:55,683
What the fuck would they want with me?

526
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:56,911
I don't know.

527
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:00,583
Maybe they ain't
done fucking with you yet.

528
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:03,958
Have you ever wondered why you
were up there the longest and

529
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,893
... came back with
that clicker shit inside you?

530
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,462
I try not to think about that.

531
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:10,590
I think it's about time you
started giving that some thought.

532
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,102
Fuck me.

533
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:28,804
Oh, shit.

534
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:31,976
Oh, fuck.

535
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,602
What's going on?

536
00:36:47,602 --> 00:36:48,796
Nothing, buddy.

537
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,239
I wish you weren't lying.

538
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,707
Otis, you keep this door locked,

539
00:36:52,707 --> 00:36:54,641
... and don't let anything through.

540
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:56,039
It's loose, ain't it.

541
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:59,469
Just do as he says and secure the door.

542
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,283
Maybe it's gone.

543
00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:31,163
Oh, fuck. God damn it, Duke.

544
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:33,289
It was over here.

545
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:35,936
There's fucking blood
all over the place.

546
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,767
Where the hell is it?

547
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:51,548
Help!

548
00:39:57,058 --> 00:40:00,361
Wyatt, it's Sheriff Henderson.

549
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:02,596
Open up or I'm breaking in.

550
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:05,565
Get the fuck away from me.

551
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,737
Just a minute.

552
00:40:20,414 --> 00:40:21,282
Hands up.

553
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:22,749
Easy, Sheriff.

554
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:27,779
What's with the lights?

555
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,957
The power went out.

556
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:34,653
Happens out here all the time.

557
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:41,632
Oh, yeah? Well, I heard voices.

558
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:45,032
It's the radio.

559
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:48,474
I was hoping they'd say when
the electricity would be back.

560
00:40:52,613 --> 00:40:54,581
What's this all about, Sheriff?

561
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:56,746
91 1 call.

562
00:40:57,685 --> 00:41:00,279
Said you were holding a hostage.

563
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:02,223
Is that right?

564
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:03,485
Yeah.

565
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,123
An extraterrestrial one.

566
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,001
What is it?

567
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:16,103
The third time this winter?

568
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:17,798
The fourth, I think.

569
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:23,444
What, are you locking me in here?

570
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:25,679
No, it's wild dogs, man.

571
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,442
... snooping around lately.

572
00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:32,511
I guess I could take care of
some wild dogs.

573
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:38,655
I guess you're getting used to
this prankster shit.

574
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,119
Yeah.

575
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:44,098
Anyways, we gotta check it all out.

576
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:46,233
You know, the routine.

577
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:51,603
Especially since the call
came from your phone.

578
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:56,106
My phone.

579
00:41:56,744 --> 00:41:58,234
Yeah.

580
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,141
You been drinking?

581
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,449
Yeah, I had a couple.

582
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:08,780
You mind if I have one?

583
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:11,814
I guess not.

584
00:42:22,636 --> 00:42:23,796
Good.

585
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,573
What's back there?

586
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:31,934
Uh, nothing.

587
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:42,590
You got a key?

588
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,626
Yeah, I got it right here.

589
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:48,595
Shit. I stepped in something.

590
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,003
What is this?

591
00:42:58,405 --> 00:43:00,202
A radiator leak?

592
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:03,109
Yeah, I guess so.

593
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:08,611
Listen, Sheriff, there's
something I need to tell you.

594
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:12,342
I got a girl in there.

595
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:16,015
You got an alien groupie, huh?

596
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:19,558
No, she's just a friend.

597
00:43:21,495 --> 00:43:23,156
I'd like to meet this friend.

598
00:44:12,146 --> 00:44:13,614
What the fuck!

599
00:44:13,614 --> 00:44:14,376
What--

600
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:18,552
Go away. Wyatt! Wyatt! Help me! Shit!

601
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:19,219
Hold it.

602
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:20,379
On the ground.

603
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:22,623
I gotta ram it.

604
00:44:22,623 --> 00:44:23,557
I said hold it!

605
00:44:23,557 --> 00:44:25,192
You're gonna have to shoot me, Sheriff.

606
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:26,327
Wyatt, help! Wyatt!

607
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:26,994
Fuck!

608
00:44:26,994 --> 00:44:28,362
On the ground!

609
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:29,954
Come on, Sheriff!

610
00:44:30,664 --> 00:44:33,968
God damn it! Please, Sheriff!

611
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:36,232
The next one's gonna
be between your ears.

612
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:46,680
Otis?

613
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,045
Don't move!

614
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:53,620
Don't move! Please, Wyatt, don't move.

615
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:57,947
It's come here, Wyatt.

616
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:04,055
I want my mommy. I want
my mommy. I want my mommy.

617
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:17,044
What the fuck.

618
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:18,238
Don't move.

619
00:45:19,747 --> 00:45:21,682
No. No. Don't point the gun at it.

620
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:22,850
Point it away, god damn it.

621
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,084
Point it away!

622
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:26,109
Everybody stay calm. Stay calm.

623
00:45:26,387 --> 00:45:27,615
Stay calm.

624
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:33,819
Get the tape, Duke!

625
00:45:38,732 --> 00:45:39,630
Make it stop!

626
00:45:44,038 --> 00:45:45,801
Make it stop!

627
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:58,752
Hold on, Duke.

628
00:45:58,752 --> 00:45:59,720
You fucker! Take it!

629
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,754
Make it stop.

630
00:46:00,754 --> 00:46:02,312
Make it stop.

631
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:21,372
You're all right.

632
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:24,705
You're all right.

633
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:30,748
I don't think the duct tape's
gonna work this time. Wyatt?

634
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:32,953
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

635
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:35,751
Just hold it together, all right?
It's all over.

636
00:47:12,326 --> 00:47:13,418
Sheriff?

637
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:17,089
Sheriff?

638
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:24,835
Sheriff?

639
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:28,709
Shit.....There's a pulse. All right.

640
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:30,410
I'm gonna get you some help.
Okay, Sheriff?

641
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:31,604
Fuck that.

642
00:47:33,013 --> 00:47:35,038
Go get me a beer.

643
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:40,745
All right.

644
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:51,989
Easy.

645
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:57,260
How's your friend?

646
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:01,468
About as good as you.

647
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,843
All that shit about you
and aliens was true, huh.

648
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:12,183
Yeah.

649
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,750
Shit. That's fucked up.

650
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,661
Got anything harder?

651
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:29,962
Yeah. Yeah.

652
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:06,105
It's not safe out here.

653
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:09,669
It's safe in there?

654
00:49:12,913 --> 00:49:14,281
I'm not going back in here, Wyatt.

655
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:15,805
Not until it's dead.

656
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:19,412
We're taking it back
where they found it.

657
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,255
Otis needs help. We're
gonna take him to County.

658
00:49:27,561 --> 00:49:29,051
Kill it, Wyatt.

659
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:34,931
You can't kill it, Hope.

660
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:40,203
I 'll do it, then.

661
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:42,203
Hope.

662
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,170
Hope?

663
00:49:45,512 --> 00:49:46,376
Hope.

664
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,348
Please don't tell me
it'll be okay, Wyatt.

665
00:49:48,348 --> 00:49:49,182
If you tell me it's gonna be okay,

666
00:49:49,182 --> 00:49:50,851
I swear to God, I'll fuckin' hurt you.

667
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:53,287
Killing this thing will
only make it worse.

668
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:55,689
Worse? Fucking worse?

669
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:58,025
Did you fucking see what it did?

670
00:49:58,025 --> 00:49:59,559
Why can't you be a man?

671
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:01,754
Why don't you care? I hate you!

672
00:50:03,397 --> 00:50:05,763
I care. I care.

673
00:50:08,268 --> 00:50:09,701
Oh fuck.

674
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:12,839
You had the keys.

675
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,307
You should have just gotten
the hell out of here.

676
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,644
I've never been
so good with "should've".

677
00:50:24,184 --> 00:50:25,173
Me either.

678
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,813
Me either.

679
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:40,490
We're losing him.

680
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:47,297
Cody.

681
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:54,277
Cody. Otis is...

682
00:50:55,015 --> 00:50:56,880
Otis is bad off.

683
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:04,823
We're gonna go for help, man.

684
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:16,295
Always thought one day we'd find Timmy.

685
00:51:21,074 --> 00:51:25,443
Take him back to town and have
a fucking parade or some shit.

686
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,284
That ain't gonna happen, huh, Wyatt.

687
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,725
I'm gonna die...

688
00:51:41,828 --> 00:51:45,025
... with everyone thinking
I killed my brother.

689
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:48,932
Nobody thinks you killed Timmy, man.

690
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:51,800
The hell they don't!

691
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,866
My own pop...

692
00:51:59,613 --> 00:52:01,638
If I had my way...

693
00:52:02,883 --> 00:52:06,620
I'd take that fucking monster and...

694
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,954
... drive it back to my
pop's little peach house,

695
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:17,164
... walk right past that
motherfuckin white picket fence,

696
00:52:17,164 --> 00:52:19,633
... and drop that piece of shit alien...

697
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:23,433
... right on that cocksucker's doorstep.

698
00:52:25,005 --> 00:52:26,404
Ding dong.

699
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:32,207
Oh, that will be good.

700
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:39,246
I'm sorry, Cody.

701
00:52:51,232 --> 00:52:52,756
My mom...

702
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:56,402
she thinks I 'm working overtime.

703
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:03,199
She's gonna be all alone, now.

704
00:53:07,448 --> 00:53:09,109
Oh shit.

705
00:53:14,622 --> 00:53:15,356
Watch your fingers.

706
00:53:15,356 --> 00:53:16,323
Yep.

707
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:17,625
Ready?

708
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:18,593
All right.

709
00:53:18,593 --> 00:53:20,686
It's a heavy little fucker, isn't it.

710
00:53:21,162 --> 00:53:22,493
I doubled the chains.

711
00:53:23,164 --> 00:53:24,966
Let's hope it stays unconscious.

712
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:25,796
Yeah.

713
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:31,772
It ain't safe out here, Duke.

714
00:53:31,772 --> 00:53:33,364
I can't leave Cody.

715
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:36,100
The boy's my responsibility.

716
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:48,979
Take care of yourself.

717
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,349
Bye, buddy.

718
00:54:27,962 --> 00:54:30,362
What happens if we kill it, Wyatt?

719
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:36,293
You know what happens when
an animal kills a human?

720
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:44,340
We kill that thing and they put us down.

721
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:47,678
They put us all down.

722
00:54:47,915 --> 00:54:48,482
We kill one...

723
00:54:48,482 --> 00:54:50,677
They declare
war on the human race?

724
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:53,987
Wouldn't be no war.

725
00:54:54,822 --> 00:54:57,958
They want us gone from
this planet, we are gone.

726
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,984
The show is over, end of the human race.

727
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,162
It'd be a goddamned massacre.

728
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,071
Wyatt, when this is over,

729
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:12,938
I think I'll move back to
my mama's house.

730
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:19,970
Cody?

731
00:55:26,754 --> 00:55:28,745
I'm real sorry, Cody.

732
00:55:51,445 --> 00:55:53,413
I'm gonna make things right.

733
00:56:11,966 --> 00:56:14,264
Why'd they come back, Wyatt?

734
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:30,807
They let the others go after
the second night.

735
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:35,823
They tested us all, you know.

736
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:39,088
But Timmy and l...

737
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:45,124
I guess we made it past the first round.

738
00:56:48,936 --> 00:56:51,564
Timmy got sick real fast...

739
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,073
Like his brother.

740
00:56:57,411 --> 00:56:58,846
But it didn't take with me.

741
00:56:58,846 --> 00:57:01,508
So they kept doing more and more.

742
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:05,315
They kept fucking with me.

743
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:12,155
They altered me.

744
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,330
Till one morning I woke up,

745
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,630
... naked...

746
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:22,935
... couple of counties away.

747
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:29,007
They'd sent me back with some
sort of tracking device in my body.

748
00:57:29,243 --> 00:57:31,478
But I knew it was there because I could...

749
00:57:31,478 --> 00:57:33,742
... hear it clicking away.

750
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:40,215
So I cut it out and went into hiding.

751
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:50,763
I guess they want me back.

752
00:57:52,132 --> 00:57:54,259
They're scared of you, Wyatt.

753
00:57:54,935 --> 00:57:58,735
When that thing was fucking
around inside my head, I felt it.

754
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:00,641
That's why they came back for you.

755
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:03,143
They're scared shitless of you.

756
00:58:03,143 --> 00:58:05,509
Yeah, well the feeling's mutual.

757
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:16,152
What?

758
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:21,562
What the fuck, Wyatt?

759
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:22,927
Shut up! Shut up!

760
00:58:24,932 --> 00:58:26,194
They'll hear.

761
00:58:43,617 --> 00:58:44,551
How do you even know--

762
00:58:44,551 --> 00:58:45,779
I can feel them.

763
00:58:48,355 --> 00:58:49,623
Where are they?

764
00:58:49,623 --> 00:58:50,954
Everywhere.

765
00:58:52,426 --> 00:58:54,257
Lots of them.

766
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:58,966
We can't just sit here.

767
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,868
It's not safe out there!

768
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:02,703
I'm real sorry, sweetie...

769
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:04,772
Sure as fuck ain't safer sitting
in the middle of the road in this van...

770
00:59:04,772 --> 00:59:06,569
... with that thing in the back.

771
00:59:10,377 --> 00:59:11,435
Wyatt?

772
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:16,044
Wyatt!

773
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:24,892
Hope.

774
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:26,382
Hope. This ain't cool, Hope.

775
00:59:28,996 --> 00:59:29,697
Hope, this ain't cool.

776
00:59:29,697 --> 00:59:31,198
That van'll be our coffin.

777
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:32,132
Otis is back there.

778
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:34,293
Otis died ten minutes ago.

779
00:59:36,136 --> 00:59:37,104
That is not true!

780
00:59:37,104 --> 00:59:39,595
Yeah? Then check on him yourself.

781
00:59:39,873 --> 00:59:40,908
Hope, we should get back in the van.

782
00:59:40,908 --> 00:59:44,469
I'm not hiding for
the rest of my life, Wyatt.

783
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:47,975
That's your thing.

784
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:50,150
Hope.

785
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,139
Hope!

786
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:58,580
Otis?

787
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:01,056
Come on, buddy. Otis?

788
01:00:01,495 --> 01:00:02,962
Come on, Otis!

789
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:05,859
Come on, Otis.

790
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,927
Come on, boss. Come on.

791
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:12,297
Come on. Stick with me. Come on, man.

792
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,720
Son of a bitch!

793
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,823
God damn you motherfucker.

794
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,383
Why'd you pick us? Why?

795
01:00:32,593 --> 01:00:34,458
Motherfucker!

796
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:44,436
You like that? You like that shit, huh?

797
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:47,908
Fifteen years ago,
we were out on a hunting trip.

798
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:50,344
You know all about hunting trips,
don't ya.

799
01:00:50,344 --> 01:00:51,111
Don't you!

800
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:52,713
It was me, Wyatt...

801
01:00:52,713 --> 01:00:53,814
Otis and Cody...

802
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:54,803
And Timmy.

803
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:56,450
Yeah, you fucking remember

804
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:57,584
You fucking remember.

805
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,711
You fucking remember that shit!

806
01:01:01,155 --> 01:01:02,622
We were just kids

807
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:04,792
But Timmy...

808
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:06,419
You remember Timmy.

809
01:01:07,227 --> 01:01:08,862
You killed our friend.

810
01:01:08,862 --> 01:01:10,727
Now you're gonna pay for it.

811
01:01:12,766 --> 01:01:14,495
You're gonna fucking die.

812
01:01:15,035 --> 01:01:17,697
See what it feels like.
Feel what it feels like.

813
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,804
Duke!

814
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:25,905
Duke.

815
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:30,909
Oh, shit. Fuck.

816
01:01:34,955 --> 01:01:36,946
Cody. Cody.

817
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:39,253
Holy shit.

818
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:42,728
What the fuck, Duke.

819
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,054
Shit, Duke.

820
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:47,935
You're not supposed to be
holding me like this. Shit.

821
01:01:47,935 --> 01:01:48,993
It's okay.

822
01:02:05,586 --> 01:02:06,920
We could get help.

823
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,821
You get help. I'm going back.

824
01:02:12,826 --> 01:02:14,691
Take this, okay?

825
01:02:15,963 --> 01:02:17,658
Won't you need that?

826
01:02:18,465 --> 01:02:19,762
No.

827
01:02:21,468 --> 01:02:22,669
Okay. I'll drive you back.

828
01:02:22,669 --> 01:02:25,968
No. You stay on the road
and keep driving.

829
01:02:26,406 --> 01:02:29,603
All right?
You don't turn back for nothing.

830
01:02:31,211 --> 01:02:32,974
I won't leave you.

831
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,649
I need you to do this for me, Hope.

832
01:02:35,649 --> 01:02:37,378
No, I won't leave you.

833
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,888
Duke?

834
01:06:19,706 --> 01:06:21,606
Duke. Duke. Duke.

835
01:06:22,576 --> 01:06:23,543
Duke.

836
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:25,045
Wyatt.

837
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:27,206
Duke. Where is it?

838
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:29,116
Where'd it go?

839
01:06:29,116 --> 01:06:31,175
It's calling the others, Wyatt.

840
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:35,380
Duke.

841
01:06:40,193 --> 01:06:42,024
You run, Wyatt.

842
01:06:44,498 --> 01:06:45,590
Go.

843
01:06:51,104 --> 01:06:51,968
Duke.

844
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:53,731
Duke.

845
01:08:29,169 --> 01:08:30,397
Damn.

846
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,780
Get off him, you fuck.

847
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:22,455
Duke!

848
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:24,186
Nooooo!

849
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:30,363
Duke!

850
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:46,939
You motherfucker!

851
01:09:48,248 --> 01:09:49,806
You fucking bastard!

852
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:52,686
Why'd you have to do that,
you son of a bitch!

853
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:55,018
You goddamned motherfuck--

854
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:39,127
How'd that feel?

855
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:46,998
You ugly motherfucker.

856
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:50,068
Cody!

857
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:58,076
How does it feel to be probed,
motherfucker?

858
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:08,851
Cody?

859
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:15,999
Oh, shit, Cody.

860
01:11:16,503 --> 01:11:18,405
I ain't got time for this, man.

861
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:20,498
We've got some serious company coming.

862
01:11:20,774 --> 01:11:22,575
Cody. God damn it, Cody.

863
01:11:22,575 --> 01:11:24,344
You hear me, Cody? Please.

864
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:25,971
God damn it. Shit.

865
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:29,274
Oh, God, Cody. I'm sorry.

866
01:11:29,449 --> 01:11:30,814
I'm sorry, man.

867
01:11:31,451 --> 01:11:33,510
God damn it, Cody. Listen to me!

868
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,687
Cody!

869
01:11:36,222 --> 01:11:37,120
Oh, shit!

870
01:11:37,557 --> 01:11:38,615
Oh, shit!

871
01:11:43,196 --> 01:11:44,322
Oh, shit, Cody.

872
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,141
Shit, Cody.

873
01:11:58,812 --> 01:12:00,780
Cody.

874
01:12:03,717 --> 01:12:04,484
Oh, Jesus.

875
01:12:04,484 --> 01:12:05,416
Cody.

876
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,987
He's had enough!

877
01:12:09,622 --> 01:12:11,453
God damn it. He's had enough!

878
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,058
I said that's enough!

879
01:13:16,089 --> 01:13:17,852
I know what they want.

880
01:13:19,392 --> 01:13:20,950
Call them off.

881
01:13:22,829 --> 01:13:24,729
I'll go with you.

882
01:13:27,467 --> 01:13:28,832
Call them off!

883
01:13:30,804 --> 01:13:32,931
Just leave Cody alone.

884
01:13:33,273 --> 01:13:35,503
And don't hurt anybody else.

885
01:13:37,343 --> 01:13:38,970
And I'll go with you.

886
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:45,047
They'll give you a ribbon or
something, you piece of shit!

887
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:53,960
No! This is between you and me!

888
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,295
Nobody else!

889
01:13:55,295 --> 01:13:57,661
I said call it off and I'll go with you!

890
01:13:57,897 --> 01:14:00,627
I'll go with you! I'll go with you!

891
01:14:12,145 --> 01:14:14,010
You're not going anywhere with them.

892
01:14:36,169 --> 01:14:38,000
Van's down the road. Let's go.

893
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:40,570
Wyatt.

894
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:42,199
Cody?

895
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:45,035
Cody.

896
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:56,017
Timmy was never really
good with pain, was he?

897
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:02,186
He was a real pussy, wasn't he?

898
01:15:12,672 --> 01:15:19,077
I need you to do what you did to Timmy.

899
01:15:21,347 --> 01:15:23,316
I didn't... I didn't do...

900
01:15:23,316 --> 01:15:24,840
Please, Wyatt.

901
01:15:25,785 --> 01:15:27,844
You were his best friend.

902
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:30,754
Please, Wyatt.

903
01:17:02,315 --> 01:17:03,082
Come on.

904
01:17:03,082 --> 01:17:04,117
Come on. Come on. Hurry.

905
01:17:04,117 --> 01:17:05,551
Come on, Hope. Get in.

906
01:17:05,551 --> 01:17:06,540
Hope, get in.

907
01:17:56,669 --> 01:17:57,658
Come here.

908
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:01,898
Cover your ears.

909
01:20:55,748 --> 01:20:57,375
What the fuck.

910
01:21:05,591 --> 01:21:06,922
Where now?

911
01:21:13,266 --> 01:21:14,858
Somewhere else.

912
01:21:32,084 --> 01:21:34,279
We're all right now, aren't we, Wyatt?

913
01:21:41,961 --> 01:21:43,223
We'll see.

914
01:21:44,223 --> 01:21:54,223
