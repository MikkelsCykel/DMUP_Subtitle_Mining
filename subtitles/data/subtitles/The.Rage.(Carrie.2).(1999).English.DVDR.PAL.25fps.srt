00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:06,746
You... can't...

2
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,071
have...

3
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:11,421
my daughter.

4
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:15,304
No!

5
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,429
No! Stay away!

6
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:23,463
Stay out of here.

7
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,988
Stay out!

8
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:38,590
She's my daughter!

9
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:48,423
Stay away!

10
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:49,981
Stay away!

11
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:51,620
Stay away!

12
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,985
Stay out!

13
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,229
Mommy.

14
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:49,469
Mommy, come and play with me

15
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,867
in my room.

16
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:54,950
Right now, Mommy. Okay?

17
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:57,187
Hey!

18
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,825
I got an idea!

19
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,396
No! Let go of me!

20
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,598
No! Who will protect her? No!

21
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,364
Let me go!

22
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,965
Rachel! Rachel!

23
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:19,077
No! I can't leave her!

24
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:21,515
I have to protect her! Rachel!

25
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay, Rachel,

26
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:28,245
your mama's gotta go somewhere
to rest, so she'll feel better.

27
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:30,599
Are you okay?

28
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,957
Is your dad around?

29
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:35,678
I don't have a dad.

30
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,158
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

31
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,562
We're gonna take you someplace nice,
with a nice family,

32
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,642
until we get this sorted out, okay?

33
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,481
No!

34
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,005
Rachel!

35
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:07,801
Rachel!

36
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,565
Rachel!

37
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,399
Rachel!

38
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,634
Stop it!

39
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,358
Stop!

40
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:24,555
Stop it!

41
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,877
Stop it!

42
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:09,000
<i>Monday morning!</i>
<i>Time to get up and go to work!</i>

43
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,122
<i>But never fear,</i>
<i>the Moneyman is here</i>

44
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:15,483
<i>to help you through</i>
<i>your Monday morning ordeal with $101...</i>

45
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:21,847
Sorry, Walt.

46
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:38,760
- Are you workin' tonight?
- They moved me to the graveyard shift.

47
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:40,688
Was the dog in the house last night?

48
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:42,883
He's allowed in the morning.

49
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,923
Daytime's okay, but not at night.

50
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:48,201
I only let him in this morning.

51
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:50,805
There's no juice.

52
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:52,603
We're out of a lot of things.

53
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,609
Rachel, I heard dog noises
when I was trying to sleep.

54
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,722
Walter was not in the house.

55
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,409
That voice!

56
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:01,647
As long as you're under this roof

57
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:05,047
you respect us as your parents
and treat us like that.

58
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:06,490
Sorry.

59
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:10,204
Take it easy, Boyd.
She might not be with us

60
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:13,448
much longer.
Your mom's making progress, right?

61
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,846
On her new medication, the Clozaril?

62
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:18,724
Where are we gonna make up
that 300 bucks a month?

63
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,763
May I be excused?

64
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,122
- Well, hello!
- Oh! She speaks!

65
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,599
Her mouth opens and sounds come out.

66
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:38,201
She didn't call all weekend.
I figured her voice was gone.

67
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,970
What's wrong?
Foster dad being a pain again?

68
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,047
Yeah.

69
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,369
Why are you so weirdly happy?

70
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,447
Do I look any different?

71
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,443
Do you look any...

72
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:55,002
Oh, my God! You did it?

73
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,689
Yeah.

74
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,688
Who?

75
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:02,929
You wouldn't believe me if I told you,
so... I'm bringing him to lunch.

76
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,120
You suck!

77
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,764
Oh, love you, too!

78
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,644
Best blood.

79
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,273
Are... you

80
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,071
ready

81
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,633
to... beat-beat?

82
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,956
B-H-S

83
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,798
will dominate

84
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,717
the rest!

85
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,953
Morning, girls.
How you doin' this morning?

86
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,071
What's goin' on?
Get away from me!

87
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,236
According to these new rules,

88
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,828
how many points do I get
if I do that chick?

89
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,110
The fat one? Six.

90
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,038
I did her last week and you gave me five.
And she's not fat.

91
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,314
I figure if he's got the balls to go in
after you, I'm giving him an extra point.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,834
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, Jesse, Jess, that Tracy girl!

93
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,474
You gotta get all over that girl, man.

94
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,555
Serious.

95
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,750
- She's on my list.
- Definitely fine.

96
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,871
She got an ass stamped BP, baby!

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,956
Bulldog property!

98
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,236
Can you develop these at work?

99
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,156
Woof! Woof!

100
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,919
- Total coyote date.
- That's harsh, bro.

101
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,359
It's the truth.

102
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,948
- What's a coyote date?
- You don't know?

103
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,675
That's when you wake up,
some ugly chick sleeping on your arm,

104
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,234
and you'd rather gnaw it off
than wake her up.

105
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,990
God, woman, you come prepared!

106
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,311
Tell me who the special someone is.

107
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,079
All will be revealed in due time.

108
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,838
<i>"Romeo and Juliet",</i>
<i>a tale of star-crossed lovers,</i>

109
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:24,693
pulled apart by their families,
society, and, some might say, by fate.

110
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:30,768
Pulled apart by their families,
society, and, some might say, by fate.

111
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:35,762
Why is it that we are so moved
by love that ends with separation?

112
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:38,009
What say?

113
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:40,089
Anyone.

114
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,883
Anyone!

115
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,806
Rachel.

116
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,648
I don't know that I believe in it.

117
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:52,604
Believe in what?

118
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,726
Love.

119
00:09:54,853 --> 00:10:00,052
Well... then you've got bigger problems
than passing this class.

120
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:03,085
- Who would love her?
- Yes, Arnold?

121
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:06,523
"Love is 15 seconds
of squishing noises."

122
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,848
Johnny Rotten.
Know what I'm saying?

123
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,533
Dork! Kill that kid.

124
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,363
Are all love stories tragedies? I mean,
unless they die at the same time

125
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:21,886
all lovers are eventually
separated by death, right?

126
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:25,972
Then <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> isn't a tragedy.
They could only be together in death.

127
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,566
Yes!

128
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,365
Very good!

129
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:35,682
A foul cynic. Most cliché.
A true romantic. How refreshing!

130
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:37,728
Yeah.

131
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:40,807
Shut up.

132
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,760
Ohh, hello there!

133
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,684
Hey, girls, what's happenin'?

134
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,119
Move out. Thank you.

135
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,209
Oh, Mark Bing wanted me to invite you
to his party Friday night.

136
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,362
- Is Jesse going with anyone?
- I don't think so.

137
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,323
Could you please refrain
from shooting my ass?

138
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,685
Lisa?

139
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,163
Did you see that!

140
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,044
Let's stay back, please!

141
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,839
You better come with me.
A girl just killed herself in the lot.

142
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,009
Stay here.

143
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,640
Best blood.

144
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,999
Oh, my God.

145
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,406
Rachel... come on, back away.

146
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,720
<i>Attention all students.</i>
<i>Report to your homeroom classes.</i>

147
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>Report to your homeroom classes.</i>

148
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,081
Oh, man!
Whose car is this?

149
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,686
She was

150
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:08,967
really happy this morning.
I don't understand why she...

151
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,247
It's okay.

152
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,445
Let it out.

153
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:15,684
No.

154
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,571
I don't cry.

155
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:29,327
<i>Miss Snell, please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

156
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:33,049
I have to go.

157
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:35,325
Rachel, stay here, okay?

158
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,764
I'll be back as soon as I can.

159
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,333
One of our students died today.

160
00:14:56,535 --> 00:15:00,528
We will observe at exactly 1pm
a moment of silence.

161
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:08,773
- <i>Lisa Parker may be gone</i>
- Hand me the scorebook.

162
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:11,329
<i>But she will not be forgotten</i>
<i>by her friends.</i>

163
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:14,049
<i>She will not be forgotten</i>
<i>by her fellow students.</i>

164
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,291
<i>She will not be forgotten</i>
<i>by her teachers</i>

165
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,245
or by her school.

166
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,930
Her parents are gonna want all this.

167
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:46,771
Oh, my.

168
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:48,612
That girl Lisa, right?

169
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:49,727
That girl Lisa, right?

170
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,080
Yeah.

171
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:54,522
I was supposed to have lunch
with her today.

172
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:55,971
Yeah?

173
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:02,044
You guys thought she was shit, right?

174
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,850
Don't look at me like this.
You thought she was shit.

175
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,246
What did you do?

176
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,328
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

177
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:15,729
It's just Lisa was acting all happy,
you know, like we were going steady.

178
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,889
I had to break the news to her
that she was just a pump.

179
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,684
You know, a nut.

180
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,042
She didn't mean anything to me.

181
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,842
I guess she couldn't handle it.

182
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,762
Is that your brilliant attempt to fix it?

183
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,169
That's good.

184
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:39,126
You need all the points you can get.
I don't know why you're erasing them.

185
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,208
That's cold, man.

186
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:47,121
On Friday the King's University scout
is coming to the game.

187
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:50,480
If all this gets out... Sex and suicide?

188
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:54,446
Come on, man.
Catholic schools frown on that shit.

189
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:59,167
If I don't get into a good school,
my dad's gonna kill me.

190
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,123
But nobody's gonna find out.

191
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:07,402
Lisa took a picture of us last night.

192
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:11,328
What if her parents ask questions?

193
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:13,408
That's a problem.

194
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,523
Oh... shit!

195
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:19,121
I'll handle it. I'll take care of it.

196
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,566
How?

197
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,328
Relax, man. Come on.

198
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,408
Come on.

199
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:22,289
- Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
- It's all right.

200
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,975
You're Rachel, right?

201
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:26,536
Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,693
I'm Jesse. English?

203
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,127
Right. The true romantic?

204
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:35,611
- Yeah.
- Rachel, listen. That Lisa girl?

205
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:39,616
She had pictures that have
what you might call sentimental value.

206
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:42,171
I figured 20 bucks ought to cover it.

207
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,045
No.

208
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,813
What do you want, 30?

209
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:50,132
They're not your pictures, all right?

210
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:53,010
It's not like she's gonna
pick 'em up, is it?

211
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:56,727
Cut it out, man.

212
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,377
Rachel, I'll tell you what.

213
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:04,570
I'll swing by when you get off work,
take you out for a little cruise.

214
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,047
Come on. I don't bite.

215
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:10,133
Unless you want me to.

216
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:12,689
I don't think so.

217
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,250
Why not?

218
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,736
Because I'm a dyke.

219
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,525
That's funny.

220
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,932
- Don't laugh, man.
- Just drive.

221
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:03,412
Hey!

222
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,893
How you doin' tonight?

223
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:12,212
"For a moment I thought
someone was actually seeing me

224
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,373
but it was all a lie."

225
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:17,807
"Eric lied when he said I was special,
and I was lying to myself."

226
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:19,893
"I believed him."

227
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:24,772
Rachel, is there anything in there
that strikes a chord for you?

228
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:28,286
Do you know what Lisa was referring to?

229
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:34,737
Yesterday she, uh...

230
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:39,736
She told me she lost her virginity.

231
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:42,007
Do you know this boy?

232
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,096
Eric Stark.

233
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,173
He's on the team.

234
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:47,810
Can I talk to you?

235
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:50,292
Excuse us, Rachel.

236
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:56,089
Robbie, I had a freshman girl
crying last week.

237
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:59,050
Five more have been in my office
this semester.

238
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:02,726
I couldn't get anything out of them,
but... their friends told me

239
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:06,054
football players slept with them,
then dumped them.

240
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,930
It's not illegal to break a girl's heart.

241
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:11,013
Eric is 18.

242
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,492
Lisa was 16. That's statutory rape.

243
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:14,766
That's a stretch.

244
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:18,253
Let's make it, before someone else's
daughter jumps off a building.

245
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,332
Sue.

246
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:22,456
Listen.

247
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:26,206
Are you sure you're not still trying
to save a girl that died 20 years ago?

248
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:30,606
Help me!

249
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:33,126
Plug it up! Plug it up!

250
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:44,686
Okay. I'll look into it.

251
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,700
That was great.

252
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,251
Yeah.

253
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:09,692
The minute man!

254
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:12,859
Do it, baby! Do it again!

255
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:15,860
Gimme the book. Gimme the book!

256
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:20,614
Oh, my!

257
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:24,576
- He nailed a hottie!
- No, no, an eight.

258
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:29,732
Is he going back in for double time?

259
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,252
I don't feel good. I'm gonna be sick.

260
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:39,577
- He's gonna puke!
- Not in my car!

261
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:49,817
You know, Mark invited me
to his party on Friday.

262
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,779
What are you thinking about?

263
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,170
Nobody.

264
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:02,492
I asked what, not who.

265
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:05,011
It's nothing. It's, uh...

266
00:23:08,182 --> 00:23:10,616
Doesn't it bother you that some girl

267
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:12,698
offed herself yesterday?

268
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,578
Why? She wasn't anybody.

269
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:16,737
What?

270
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,059
I mean, I didn't know her.

271
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:29,092
You know, I still don't have
a date for Mark's party.

272
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:32,380
Hint, hint.

273
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:43,746
Shit!

274
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:01,063
Stop.

275
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,023
Stop!

276
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,464
Rachel, stop this.

277
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:35,578
Hey! Hey! Get back here!

278
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:38,659
That rotten dog.

279
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:13,980
Hey! Your dumb dog got out.

280
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:51,019
Walter!

281
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,657
Stay!

282
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:06,662
Stop!

283
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,303
Walter! My God!

284
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:20,346
Walter!

285
00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:31,183
Stop! Help!

286
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:35,902
Please stop! Stop!

287
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:39,376
Stop!

288
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:43,936
Rachel?

289
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:45,864
- Please!
- What happened?

290
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:47,943
Please help me!

291
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,698
Are you gonna be all right?

292
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:13,019
Sorry.

293
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:15,297
For what?

294
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:19,859
For making you come out here
all this way.

295
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:21,466
Don't worry about it.

296
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,942
What about my windshield?
How bizarre was that?

297
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,376
I'm sorry about your car.

298
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:30,022
It wasn't your fault.
It was probably a rock or something.

299
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:35,424
Walter's banged up pretty bad.

300
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,105
He has broken ribs.

301
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:40,424
He tore an artery in his front leg.
He's lost quite a bit of blood.

302
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:42,219
His pressure's stabilised.

303
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,338
He's gonna make it.

304
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:48,021
- Can I see him?
- Come back tomorrow.

305
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:49,739
Any time after eight.

306
00:27:57,147 --> 00:28:00,105
Don't worry. It's because
you look like a mass murderer.

307
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:08,543
What's with the music?

308
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,306
Don't they have anything good,
like Garbage?

309
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:14,578
- You like Garbage?
- Yeah. Shirley Manson, she rocks.

310
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,423
Lisa loved her.

311
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,263
You two were really close, huh?

312
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:33,983
I'm really sorry.

313
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:37,263
Sometimes...

314
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,499
I'd see someone from behind

315
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:45,381
and... I'd know, I'd just

316
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:48,063
know it was Lisa.

317
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,346
And she'd turn around, and it wasn't.

318
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:53,935
But sometimes it was.

319
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,023
And now

320
00:28:57,227 --> 00:29:01,015
whenever I see someone who looks
like her and she turns around,

321
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,823
it won't be.

322
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:08,458
Ever.

323
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,579
It's gettin' pretty late.

324
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:26,619
- Can I give you a ride home?
- I can walk.

325
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,700
Yeah, right.

326
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:32,465
I can hitch. Don't worry.

327
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:34,498
Then you can go hitch.

328
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,463
Or I could just

329
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:40,498
wait for my limo.

330
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,896
Yeah, you could do that.
Just wait for your limo.

331
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:53,143
Come on.

332
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:07,621
I guess I'll see you in school tomorrow.

333
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,390
Sure.

334
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:13,146
You'll let me know how Walter's doing?

335
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:14,625
Yeah.

336
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:17,027
And uh

337
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:19,108
thank you

338
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:21,228
for everything.

339
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,662
Well, uh... good night.

340
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:28,947
Good night.

341
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:32,505
- Dry weather.
- Acrylic sweater.

342
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:40,462
I shook her hand.

343
00:30:41,112 --> 00:30:44,184
Thank you for your support.
I'd like your vote.

344
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:47,380
Stupid.

345
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:50,186
Lisa!

346
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:56,382
Don't! Don't jump!

347
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:32,075
Last night I took a look at your file.

348
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:35,163
Your mom is at Arkham
for schizophrenia?

349
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:39,041
How's she doing?

350
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:40,962
She's gonna be fine.

351
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:46,717
I had a really traumatic experience
in high school.

352
00:31:46,845 --> 00:31:50,963
I tried to help someone,
and it backfired horribly.

353
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,876
No! Stop!

354
00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:00,156
I spent some time at Arkham

355
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:02,995
as a patient.

356
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,922
Does that shock you?

357
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:09,323
I guess. I mean, you seem
pretty normal to me.

358
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:14,156
Yeah, well... I try.

359
00:32:15,245 --> 00:32:16,200
So,

360
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:19,401
do you visit your mom often?

361
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,436
Is that scary for you?

362
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:27,678
What do you mean?

363
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:31,923
It's perfectly normal to be afraid
of turning out like your parents.

364
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:33,876
Come on!

365
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,963
I know I'm ten times more likely
to get it than most people.

366
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:39,835
I didn't mean to patronise you.

367
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,677
So,

368
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:44,841
is that scary for you?

369
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,278
Rachel,

370
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:57,554
in a way you've lost your mother

371
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,721
and now you've lost a friend.

372
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:03,359
Losing people close to you can be

373
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:07,444
very painful and lonely.

374
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:22,436
- If you wanna talk...
- No!

375
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,964
I'm sorry. I...

376
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:35,962
I must've knocked it.

377
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:38,394
I didn't see you knock it.

378
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,004
I know.

379
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:50,395
I know what you did to her.

380
00:34:02,282 --> 00:34:02,802
As we can see from last year's film

381
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:04,474
As we can see from last year's film

382
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:07,799
the Carlin Devils play tough,
smash-mouth football.

383
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:10,434
Here we see Mr Bing...

384
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,793
- I thought you got the pictures.
- Relax, all right?

385
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:16,390
Nobody knows.
I'm sure they're at the Photo Mat.

386
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,514
It takes an hour to develop film.
Come on, man.

387
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:22,202
Mr Bing, on your feet.

388
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,831
- Turn around and drop trou.
- What?

389
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:31,716
You heard. Drop trou, shorts and all.

390
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:33,400
Now, son!

391
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:35,592
If you wanna stay a starter on this team.

392
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:40,951
You undress like a girl. Let's go.

393
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:46,437
After that half-assed block,

394
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:50,237
I wanted to check if maybe you
had a tampon string between your legs.

395
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:53,274
Sit.

396
00:34:57,602 --> 00:35:01,800
All right, girls, this Friday it's gonna be
kill or be killed. Let's go!

397
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:08,672
- Yeah, Bing!
- You ready for the game Friday?

398
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:10,434
Yeah!

399
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:19,714
You've never seen,
met or talked to Lisa Parker?

400
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:21,434
No, sir, never.

401
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:24,478
Who's this you're hanging on to?

402
00:35:28,122 --> 00:35:31,671
Salvation Army alert.
Look who Jess is talking to.

403
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:33,918
She's such a bottom-feeder.

404
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,919
You working tonight?

405
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:38,033
No.

406
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:41,120
You wanna meet me at the diner?

407
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:43,918
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

408
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,077
Okay.

409
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:48,193
Cool. See you there.

410
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:55,230
So, what did he want?

411
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,432
He asked me out.

412
00:35:59,202 --> 00:36:03,434
- What did you say?
- I said, "Okay. It's your funeral."

413
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:06,201
Well, okay, pardon me,

414
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:09,632
but is hanging out with jock-boy
such a hot idea?

415
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:13,550
I just heard that he's dating
Tracy Campbell, you know.

416
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:16,355
And she uh...

417
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:20,521
Right now she's giving you
the look of a thousand deaths.

418
00:36:26,362 --> 00:36:28,478
She's beautiful.

419
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:32,678
Yeah, duh!

420
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:34,695
Coach says I'm starting this week.

421
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,925
Coach says I'm starting this week.

422
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,212
What happened in there?

423
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:46,965
Kelton, man. Somebody told him
I did Lisa and now I'm suspended.

424
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:48,528
My dad will kill me.

425
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:50,885
- What about the game?
- Who cares?

426
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:54,212
Kelton had a picture of Lisa and I,
and talked statutory rape.

427
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:56,644
Now I face the DA on Thursday.

428
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:59,243
Relax. It's bullshit, all right?

429
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:03,368
Your dad will kick your ass, but
he's a lawyer. He'll kill that shit dead.

430
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:07,613
I'll miss the game of the year.
Football scouts are gonna be there

431
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:10,454
and I'll be on the bench
with a thumb up my ass.

432
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:16,172
And that bitch Rachel will be talking
all kinds of shit to anyone who'll listen.

433
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:18,013
The best defence is a good offence.

434
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:22,924
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We're gonna do some damage control.

435
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:31,449
Get it together. He's just a guy.

436
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:37,691
You are gonna be late.

437
00:37:39,895 --> 00:37:41,294
Boyd?

438
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:48,131
Emilyn?

439
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,526
Forget your keys?

440
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:00,411
Let's take the front.

441
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:12,253
Rachel...

442
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:16,292
Stop it! Stop!

443
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:18,371
Stop! Stop!

444
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:21,692
- Rachel...
- Stop it!

445
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:38,004
Hello?

446
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:41,366
<i>What's your favourite scary movie?</i>

447
00:39:42,455 --> 00:39:44,286
Rachel?

448
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,928
<i>What?</i>

449
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:48,011
Are you naked?

450
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,171
Who is this?

451
00:39:50,295 --> 00:39:53,651
<i>Or are you wearing a little red towel?</i>

452
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:02,526
It's playtime!

453
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:06,366
Who the fuck is this?

454
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:09,850
Why don't I come and show you,
you fuckin' dyke?

455
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:14,171
What do you want!

456
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,410
Who is this!

457
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:24,003
<i>Don't you recognise the voice?</i>

458
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,569
<i>Who does it sound like?</i>

459
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:28,651
Hey, Rachel!

460
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,168
I'm calling the police.

461
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:36,810
- Rachel! Rachel!
- Come on out here, Rachel!

462
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,573
You bitch!

463
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:42,647
- What are you doing?
- Fuckin' her over like she's fuckin' me.

464
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:45,573
No way.
What the fuck are you doin'?

465
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:51,210
I have an emergency!
I'm at 3366 Broad Street!

466
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:06,852
- It's the parents!
- Let's go! Let's get outta here!

467
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:15,694
Yeah. I'm still here.

468
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:21,567
- If she touches you one more time...
- You never liked her.

469
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:23,174
Everything's okay now.

470
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:25,445
What's this?

471
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,213
Really.

472
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:28,563
Thanks.

473
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,286
Look at the window.

474
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:33,565
What the hell happened here?

475
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,447
How should I know?

476
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:39,009
Ah, Jesus!

477
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,167
<i>Don't go tellin' no stories</i>
<i>about my boy Eric.</i>

478
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:15,002
Motherfucker!

479
00:42:18,524 --> 00:42:19,479
Come on!

480
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:22,838
Why do the innocent
always get hit in a drive-by!

481
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:27,161
What happened to you last night?
I waited up for you.

482
00:42:30,764 --> 00:42:34,120
- Why don't you tell me?
- What are you talking about?

483
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:38,272
I waited at the café for over an hour.

484
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:40,881
I'll tell you what happened.

485
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:43,199
What is wrong with this picture?

486
00:42:43,324 --> 00:42:45,394
What does he see in her?

487
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:48,834
Come on, Trace.
You're caviar, she's Cheez Whiz.

488
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:53,242
He'll come around. He's letting little Jesse
do the thinking for big Jesse.

489
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:58,479
I just don't want any part of this, okay?

490
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,883
Let me talk to Mark. I'll work this out.

491
00:43:02,004 --> 00:43:04,359
They were probably drunk
and being stupid.

492
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:06,440
No, don't.

493
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:10,842
Maybe all of this isn't such a good idea.

494
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:12,920
All of what?

495
00:43:15,404 --> 00:43:19,079
Guys like you are supposed
to date girls like Tracy, okay?

496
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:23,558
That's what this is about?
No. Hold on.

497
00:43:24,844 --> 00:43:26,914
Let me take you out for a date.

498
00:43:27,044 --> 00:43:29,239
A nice mellow one. Tonight.

499
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:33,122
I'm not going anywhere
until you say yes. Try me.

500
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:35,920
See?

501
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,639
I mean it. I'm telling you.

502
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:41,720
Just say yes.

503
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:43,599
Okay.

504
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:46,363
- What was that?
- Okay.

505
00:43:46,484 --> 00:43:48,440
All right!

506
00:43:50,804 --> 00:43:51,953
Yes.

507
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:01,403
Rachel, I need to talk to you.

508
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:07,070
We need to talk.

509
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:10,469
- What's the matter?
- Did you go by Rachel's?

510
00:44:10,593 --> 00:44:14,506
Yeah. We were just sending her
a little message.

511
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:17,705
Give it to me next time.
I'll make sure she gets it.

512
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,950
What are you gettin' all bent for?
This girl's a skank.

513
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:24,110
- You don't even know her!
- What, and you do?

514
00:44:24,233 --> 00:44:29,751
She doesn't deserve to be treated like
that. Who are you to send her a message?

515
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:34,025
Who am I? I'm a friend who gives a shit
that my boy's goin' down for rape!

516
00:44:34,153 --> 00:44:36,713
I'm gonna do anything
to keep her from talkin'.

517
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:40,906
Eric's a big boy. You got anything
to tell her, deal with me.

518
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:43,627
- Deal with you?
- Deal with me.

519
00:44:43,753 --> 00:44:45,709
No. You're gonna have to deal with me.

520
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:52,542
What is wrong with you, Jesse!

521
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:55,426
This is us, man! We're all friends here!

522
00:44:56,713 --> 00:44:58,943
No. We just grew up together.

523
00:45:00,702 --> 00:45:01,222
This is just a test that will
let me know how to help you better.

524
00:45:01,222 --> 00:45:04,931
This is just a test that will
let me know how to help you better.

525
00:45:05,062 --> 00:45:06,495
You're wasting your time.

526
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:09,261
Just answer the statements
true or false.

527
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:15,412
"There's a man inside the television
who tells me what to do."

528
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:19,171
Uh, false? I don't see the point.

529
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:23,818
"Sometimes my thoughts assume
the form of a giant insect."

530
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:25,898
This doesn't make any sense.

531
00:45:26,022 --> 00:45:27,455
Answer true or false.

532
00:45:27,582 --> 00:45:31,257
"Sometimes my thoughts assume
the form of a giant insect."

533
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:32,371
False.

534
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:35,460
"If you want to play the piano well,
you have to practise."

535
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:36,731
True.

536
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:39,695
"Large furry animals crawl
on my face while I sleep."

537
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:40,777
True.

538
00:45:43,102 --> 00:45:44,615
I have a dog.

539
00:45:48,502 --> 00:45:51,300
"Sometimes I can move things
with my mind."

540
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:56,896
- You can't make me do this.
- Sit down.

541
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:58,375
I'm trying to help.

542
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:01,096
- You're not my mother.
- I'm trying to be your friend.

543
00:46:01,222 --> 00:46:03,338
Let go of me!

544
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:21,178
<i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>

545
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,341
<i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>

546
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:25,780
<i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>

547
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:27,621
<i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>

548
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:40,573
Selling used cars is not what I want.

549
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:45,054
Unless I nail that football scholarship,
that's what I get.

550
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:48,015
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

551
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:52,609
I never told anybody this before in my life.

552
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:59,009
It must be nice not having to be
like everybody else.

553
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:04,538
It's not so great.

554
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:06,251
I mean,

555
00:47:06,379 --> 00:47:10,611
sometimes I wish I could just be
one of the shiny, happy people.

556
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:14,651
Does that surprise you?

557
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:17,816
Yeah. Yeah.

558
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:20,328
Everything about you surprises me.

559
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:38,695
Whoa! Whoa!

560
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:44,331
Um...

561
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:48,213
I knew this guy once. He did this thing.

562
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,368
He could suck a strand of spaghetti

563
00:47:51,499 --> 00:47:54,889
up his mouth and right out of his nose.

564
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:56,498
Brain flossing?

565
00:47:57,659 --> 00:47:59,615
He called it a talent.

566
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:05,287
I bet you're wondering
where I'm going with this, right?

567
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:07,654
Well...

568
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:11,018
you really have a talent.

569
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,936
You've got football.

570
00:48:13,939 --> 00:48:18,217
It'll get you out of this place.
After that, you can do what you want.

571
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:21,729
Make your own path.
Write your own book.

572
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:23,577
Think so?

573
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,098
Word.

574
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:26,652
Word?

575
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:27,928
Word.

576
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,294
Word.

577
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,849
You wanna come with me?

578
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:01,297
What?

579
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:07,819
Uh... your brake.
It's poking me right in the back.

580
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,297
You wanna?

581
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:14,169
Uh...

582
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,377
I really don't know how to say this.

583
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,410
What?

584
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:24,211
I've never...

585
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:26,533
Oh.

586
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:28,572
Oh!

587
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,018
Yeah.

588
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,768
- And I want it to be special.
- Yeah.

589
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:40,848
Like, you come to my door
with flowers in your hand.

590
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:45,612
Oh, well, okay.

591
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,417
What kind of flowers do you like?

592
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:56,053
- Daisies.
- Daisies.

593
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:57,134
Yeah.

594
00:49:57,259 --> 00:49:59,250
Okay. I'll have to remember that.

595
00:50:07,496 --> 00:50:08,975
I don't know!

596
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:11,052
I don't know! I don't know!

597
00:50:11,336 --> 00:50:13,292
I don't know! I don't know!

598
00:50:13,696 --> 00:50:15,652
I don't know! I don't know!

599
00:50:15,856 --> 00:50:16,811
I don't know!

600
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:19,451
I don't know! I don't know!

601
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:22,454
I don't know! I don't know!

602
00:50:23,656 --> 00:50:28,093
Mrs Lang, I need to ask you
a few questions about Rachel.

603
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:31,132
Who is...

604
00:50:31,256 --> 00:50:34,771
- Who is her father?
- It ain't important.

605
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:38,605
- I knew you'd come back.
- I'm afraid we don't know each other.

606
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:40,772
We can still get married.
I'll marry you.

607
00:50:40,896 --> 00:50:44,127
- I need to know who he is.
- I'm sorry, that's private.

608
00:50:44,256 --> 00:50:46,724
The hell with them!
What do they know?

609
00:50:47,616 --> 00:50:50,847
Cut it out! She's not Terry!
Now kindly go away.

610
00:50:54,576 --> 00:50:58,171
He's never had a visitor.
Wants to share everybody else's.

611
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:03,611
Mrs Lang, it's very important

612
00:51:03,736 --> 00:51:07,570
that you tell me who Rachel's father is.

613
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:09,891
I don't see how that's
any of your business.

614
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:14,726
I'm trying to help Rachel. She seems
troubled and I'm very worried about her.

615
00:51:15,536 --> 00:51:18,767
You're worried?
Are you very worried?

616
00:51:18,896 --> 00:51:20,124
I am.

617
00:51:20,256 --> 00:51:22,975
You don't have any children,
do you, miss?

618
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:25,212
No. No, I don't.

619
00:51:28,216 --> 00:51:33,210
Then you don't know. You will never know
how terrifying children can be.

620
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:37,692
Mrs Lang, I know this is
a really strange question,

621
00:51:37,816 --> 00:51:39,613
but when Rachel was growing up

622
00:51:39,736 --> 00:51:42,648
did you ever see objects
move by themselves?

623
00:51:44,336 --> 00:51:47,089
And did the doctors convince you
it was your imagination?

624
00:51:47,216 --> 00:51:49,810
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord
is with thee. No. I was crazy then.

625
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:53,690
I thought she was possessed.
I thought the devil was inside her.

626
00:51:53,816 --> 00:51:56,967
Mrs Lang, Rachel needs help.

627
00:51:57,096 --> 00:52:00,327
She may have a disease,
a genetic disorder.

628
00:52:00,456 --> 00:52:04,085
I believe her father
may have passed it on to her.

629
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:07,765
- Could I have it? Did I give it to her?
- No.

630
00:52:07,896 --> 00:52:10,364
- How do you know?
- The male is the carrier.

631
00:52:10,496 --> 00:52:13,727
Mrs Lang, you must tell me his name.

632
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:18,214
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

633
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:20,691
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

634
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:25,811
I did tell Rachel once how we met.

635
00:52:27,456 --> 00:52:29,412
He said it was love at first sight.

636
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:34,804
I'll tell you, but don't you dare
hurt my daughter.

637
00:52:35,856 --> 00:52:37,812
I never told her, cos

638
00:52:37,936 --> 00:52:41,645
people around here aren't fond of
Carrie White, cos of what she did.

639
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:43,368
See,

640
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:46,090
he was her daddy, too.

641
00:52:47,136 --> 00:52:49,127
His name was Ralph.

642
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,805
Ralph White.

643
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:01,694
Rachel?

644
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:05,046
I need you to come with me.

645
00:53:12,496 --> 00:53:14,452
The night of the prom

646
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:18,690
73 people died.

647
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:23,135
A few of us survived, but

648
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:25,690
we've never talked about that night.

649
00:53:29,776 --> 00:53:33,086
That's why I ended up at Arkham,
if you wondered.

650
00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:37,004
I witnessed something
I can't even begin to tell you about.

651
00:53:37,136 --> 00:53:40,128
But look around. See for yourself.

652
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:42,724
This was the original high school.

653
00:53:43,856 --> 00:53:46,245
I wish they'd tear it down.
It's like some

654
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:49,049
twisted memorial to that night.

655
00:53:51,776 --> 00:53:54,051
I haven't been here in over 20 years.

656
00:53:55,176 --> 00:53:56,609
Happy homecoming.

657
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:59,446
You've heard of Carrie White?

658
00:54:00,256 --> 00:54:04,374
Supposedly she set the fire
as some type of

659
00:54:04,496 --> 00:54:06,964
revenge-suicide thing.

660
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:10,133
Elvis was her date,
and they escaped in a UFO.

661
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:16,406
I know what happened
to that snow dome on my desk.

662
00:54:18,096 --> 00:54:19,893
It fell.

663
00:54:20,016 --> 00:54:22,086
We both know.

664
00:54:26,136 --> 00:54:29,333
Rachel, is Jesse Ryan pressuring you...

665
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:31,412
- That's none of your business.
- Look...

666
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:34,733
I know everything there is to know
about Carrie White.

667
00:54:36,976 --> 00:54:37,852
She did this.

668
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:44,646
It began with something like the snow
dome and then it got out of control.

669
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:46,846
I'm leaving.

670
00:54:46,976 --> 00:54:47,772
Rachel...

671
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:49,773
Rachel, it's...

672
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:53,252
- It's a genetic recessive trait.
- What are you saying I have?

673
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:57,415
I'm saying you're not crazy,
and it's not the devil.

674
00:54:57,536 --> 00:55:00,528
It's a trait, Rachel, you've inherited.

675
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:04,205
Telekinesis. The ability
to move objects with your mind.

676
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:08,015
For years I didn't believe it existed.

677
00:55:08,136 --> 00:55:12,288
There are places that study it. There's
a lab at Princeton. I can take you there.

678
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,372
With all respect, lady,

679
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:17,215
you are seriously batshit!

680
00:55:17,336 --> 00:55:19,327
I'm walking back to the real world.

681
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:22,368
Your mother told me your father
is Carrie's father.

682
00:55:22,496 --> 00:55:25,090
No, my father's name was Bill Kirk.

683
00:55:25,216 --> 00:55:28,049
- He left when I was three months old.
- It's a lie.

684
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:29,768
My mother wouldn't lie to me.

685
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,932
Believe me, you need help.

686
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:34,206
Like they helped you?

687
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:37,328
I can help you to get it under control.

688
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:40,528
I don't want or need your help.

689
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:43,869
You're not thinking of
pressing charges against my son?

690
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:46,429
You're not thinking of
pressing charges against my son?

691
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:48,460
We're doing more than thinking.

692
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:54,824
Look, Eric's a good kid. He may be guilty
of some youthful transgressions...

693
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:58,419
Youthful transgressions?
A girl killed herself, Lou.

694
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:01,137
Hello, Jay.

695
00:56:01,269 --> 00:56:03,703
Sit. Everybody sit.

696
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:06,263
I'm just listening in.

697
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:07,708
Okay, then.

698
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:10,425
Cards on the table.

699
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:13,584
My boy isn't going down alone.

700
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:15,108
Go on.

701
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:23,738
Mark Bing, Jesse Ryan,
Brad Winters and Chuck Potter.

702
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:27,741
The most prominent families in this town.

703
00:56:28,749 --> 00:56:31,980
Maybe they've all slept
with underage girls. Who can tell?

704
00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:34,907
And, yes, maybe they made a game of it.

705
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:37,020
Perhaps Eric can get proof of that.

706
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:39,219
I agree it would be awful,

707
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:41,260
but I don't think it's criminal.

708
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:45,628
There will be scouts
at the game on Friday.

709
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:48,217
Eric takes a fall, maybe they all will.

710
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:51,227
You wanna be responsible
for ruining their lives?

711
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:57,340
That sums it up. Karen, what we
have here is an issue with intent.

712
00:56:57,469 --> 00:56:59,539
- Blue-sheet it.
- Oh, but, Jay...

713
00:56:59,669 --> 00:57:03,662
You don't have evidence enough
to tarnish this boy's reputation.

714
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:07,987
It's not about evidence, is it, Jay?
It's about elections, right?

715
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:10,179
That is it, Robbie. That is all.

716
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:14,587
Lou, thanks for coming by.
I'll walk you out.

717
00:57:14,709 --> 00:57:16,267
Appreciate it.

718
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:18,459
I hope we see you at the game.

719
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:27,119
- Hey, is this seat taken?
- No.

720
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:32,520
- What's goin' on?
- Just studying.

721
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:35,871
You gonna come to the game Friday?

722
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:41,234
I don't really do football.

723
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:46,072
It's the season opener. There's gonna
be some scouts. I need you, for luck.

724
00:57:51,482 --> 00:57:56,192
If he's gonna be seen in public with
someone, he should show some respect.

725
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:59,997
He should show me the respect
at least to be seen with someone pretty.

726
00:58:00,122 --> 00:58:02,078
Someone cool, someone who counts.

727
00:58:02,202 --> 00:58:04,318
You know, someone.

728
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:08,833
But instead it's her.
And I just feel totally...

729
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:10,281
Disrespected!

730
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:12,120
Yeah.

731
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,278
You're being seriously dissed.

732
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:18,395
I wish there was something I could do
to make him come to his senses.

733
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:21,551
Mark's got his wheels turning!

734
00:58:21,682 --> 00:58:23,638
What?

735
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:25,754
What?

736
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:35,474
Good lift.

737
00:58:35,722 --> 00:58:38,680
Come on. Good lift. Good lift. Good lift.

738
00:58:43,842 --> 00:58:47,994
One more. Push it out, man.
Come on, push it, push it.

739
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:49,999
Nice!

740
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:54,598
Hey...

741
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:59,280
Look, man, I'm sorry.
I guess I overreacted.

742
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:02,280
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not, man.

743
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:06,601
We've been friends since
we were both dumpin' our drawers.

744
00:59:06,722 --> 00:59:09,156
I thought we'd be best friends for ever.

745
00:59:10,202 --> 00:59:13,399
Never figured some girl
would come in the way of that.

746
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:19,195
Look, I know I'm scum.
I'm prepared to admit that.

747
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:23,759
I'm lower than scum.
I'm smegma. I'm butt lint.

748
00:59:23,882 --> 00:59:26,191
- Keep going.
- I'm a prick, an asshole.

749
00:59:26,322 --> 00:59:28,517
- Asshole, yeah.
- Is that good?

750
00:59:28,642 --> 00:59:30,837
I'm sorry, man.

751
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:35,834
I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

752
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:37,918
I know.

753
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:49,079
Karen, watch my counter, please.

754
00:59:55,122 --> 00:59:58,671
- Can I help you?
- Um...

755
00:59:58,802 --> 01:00:02,272
Just... Just looking. Thanks.

756
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:16,197
Hi!

757
01:00:17,922 --> 01:00:19,878
Mrs Porter, this is a friend of mine.

758
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:28,599
I thought she was gonna frisk me.

759
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:30,792
She does step class with my mom.

760
01:00:32,682 --> 01:00:34,991
So, what are you shopping for?

761
01:00:35,122 --> 01:00:37,192
Oh, nothing. Just looking.

762
01:00:37,322 --> 01:00:41,634
Perhaps something to wear on a date?
With a certain jock hunk we all know?

763
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,599
No... No.

764
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:47,995
You know, Tracy isn't universally loved.

765
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:50,675
There's a shocker.

766
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:54,515
Exhibit A.
She tried to steal Brad from me.

767
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:56,553
She's a <i>Melrose Place</i> superbitch.

768
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:02,472
You have got great lips!

769
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:08,400
Really. Look. This shade will look
very kissable and soft. Come here.

770
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:12,755
Trust me, okay?

771
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:15,555
Hold still.

772
01:01:15,682 --> 01:01:18,833
Are you going to the game?
Just blink once for yes.

773
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:24,154
Great, cos there's a big party
afterwards. I hope you can go.

774
01:01:26,202 --> 01:01:27,999
I don't think so.

775
01:01:28,122 --> 01:01:30,716
Oh, come on. You really should.
For Jesse.

776
01:01:30,842 --> 01:01:33,310
It'd mean a lot to him if we all got along.

777
01:01:34,242 --> 01:01:35,152
Uh-huh?

778
01:01:35,282 --> 01:01:38,592
Yeah. So you'll go?

779
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:42,198
Great! See?

780
01:01:46,242 --> 01:01:48,517
Can I ring that up for you?

781
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:51,395
Sure. How much is it?

782
01:01:51,522 --> 01:01:53,638
$22.50.

783
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,470
Oh, um, maybe next time.

784
01:01:57,602 --> 01:01:59,513
Thanks, Mrs Porter.

785
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:05,798
I kleptoed it for you.

786
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,434
- Jesse!
- Hey!

787
01:02:09,562 --> 01:02:12,235
Figured out how to make it up
to you and Rachel.

788
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:16,832
The summer house.
My parents aren't gonna be there.

789
01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:20,511
I figured you wanted to get away
from us idiots for a while.

790
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:23,395
Have a nice romantic time.
All right?

791
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:26,876
But you're gonna bring her by my party.

792
01:02:27,002 --> 01:02:29,436
So I can apologise to her, all right?

793
01:02:29,562 --> 01:02:33,441
Then we can all be
one big happy family again.

794
01:02:33,562 --> 01:02:36,122
- All right?
- Okay.

795
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:39,238
Have a good time, man.

796
01:04:01,882 --> 01:04:04,157
- You look great.
- Thanks.

797
01:04:04,282 --> 01:04:06,273
I really like your hair.

798
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:12,078
Oh, you can just, you know,
throw those in the back or something.

799
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:18,398
<i>Mark can be a jerk,</i>

800
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:22,720
<i>but he's trying. He's got</i>
<i>a party Friday, and he invited us.</i>

801
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:25,037
- <i>We won't go if you don't want to.</i>
- <i>Let's go.</i>

802
01:04:44,993 --> 01:04:47,461
Um... Uh...

803
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,185
What's wrong?

804
01:04:49,313 --> 01:04:51,269
I'm just

805
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:53,669
a little scared.

806
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:55,943
Don't be scared.

807
01:04:56,073 --> 01:05:00,544
I know. I just feel kind of strange.

808
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:09,622
Look, we don't have to do this tonight.

809
01:05:09,753 --> 01:05:11,789
Whenever you're ready.

810
01:05:17,473 --> 01:05:21,261
God, I must be crazy.

811
01:05:21,393 --> 01:05:26,626
Actually, you're...
about the sanest person I know.

812
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:30,946
Whoa!

813
01:05:31,433 --> 01:05:32,786
Wow!

814
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:36,827
You're sane. You're sane.

815
01:06:19,593 --> 01:06:21,549
I love you.

816
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:47,593
You're grounded. For a week!

817
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:51,109
- But I've gotta go to the game...
- You wanna make it two?

818
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:54,236
You stay in this room.

819
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,474
Am I clear?

820
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:00,555
Yes, sir.

821
01:07:21,356 --> 01:07:23,995
Come on! Shave it off!

822
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:30,834
Hey, man!

823
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:34,875
Hey, you're next! Get in the chair!

824
01:07:34,996 --> 01:07:36,873
- Come on!
- Come on, bro!

825
01:07:36,996 --> 01:07:38,315
Come on, man!

826
01:07:38,436 --> 01:07:40,392
You're gonna ruin the whole effect!

827
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:43,588
Oh, Jess, where's your sac?
Come on!

828
01:08:06,505 --> 01:08:09,497
You have to tell her who her father is.

829
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,617
- Why?
- Because she'll believe it from you.

830
01:08:12,745 --> 01:08:15,976
Rachel needs to seek treatment
before it's too late.

831
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:18,941
Too late for what?

832
01:08:20,745 --> 01:08:23,623
Rachel's best friend committed suicide.

833
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,857
I'm afraid Rachel may

834
01:08:26,985 --> 01:08:28,941
harm herself

835
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,582
or others.

836
01:08:34,305 --> 01:08:38,218
And you wanna take me... out there?

837
01:08:38,345 --> 01:08:39,937
Yes.

838
01:08:46,398 --> 01:08:48,195
He saw me!

839
01:08:48,318 --> 01:08:50,274
Go get 'em, baby!

840
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:53,832
<i>Welcome to today's match-up</i>

841
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,791
<i>between Bates Bulldogs</i>
<i>and the Carlin Devils.</i>

842
01:08:56,918 --> 01:09:01,469
<i>It's the first game for both teams as the</i>
<i>Bulldogs seek their 7 th championship.</i>

843
01:09:01,598 --> 01:09:04,795
<i>There's a history of bad blood</i>
<i>between these teams</i>

844
01:09:04,918 --> 01:09:08,354
<i>as the Devils have consistently</i>
<i>been a thorn in the Bulldogs' side.</i>

845
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,709
<i>Let's hope the Dawgs can</i>
<i>pull that thorn out once and for all</i>

846
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:15,069
<i>as the special teams get set</i>
<i>for the opening kick-off.</i>

847
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:18,190
<i>Number 42 of the Bulldogs,</i>
<i>Chuck Potter, receiving the kick.</i>

848
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:22,956
<i>Oh, my! He's popped!</i>

849
01:09:24,878 --> 01:09:27,438
Could I have my purse, please?

850
01:09:27,558 --> 01:09:28,911
Oh.

851
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,991
<i>Just about five minutes to go now</i>
<i>in the second quarter.</i>

852
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:45,430
<i>A vicious hit by Stark.</i>
<i>Johnson, number 45, isn't getting up.</i>

853
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:49,028
- What kind of call was that?
- <i>It looks like number 33, Stark,</i>

854
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:52,594
<i>is being ejected</i>
<i>for a flagrant personal foul.</i>

855
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:54,913
What the hell is he fuckin' doing?

856
01:09:55,038 --> 01:09:58,917
- That was not a flagrant foul!
- 33 has been disqualified.

857
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:01,598
Why don't I just take
every starter out for you!

858
01:10:05,518 --> 01:10:08,078
<i>Touchdown, Devils!</i>

859
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:12,111
<i>The Bulldogs are trailing in the second</i>
<i>half as they receive the Devils'punt.</i>

860
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,992
<i>Number 42, Chuck Potter,</i>
<i>takes the kick again for the Dawgs.</i>

861
01:10:16,118 --> 01:10:18,234
<i>And there he goes</i>

862
01:10:18,358 --> 01:10:21,270
<i>cutting across the field,</i>
<i>racing down the sideline!</i>

863
01:10:28,438 --> 01:10:30,474
<i>Fourth quarter action. Here's the snap.</i>

864
01:10:30,598 --> 01:10:34,147
<i>A quick pass to Jesse Ryan,</i>
<i>and, oooh, he was hit hard!</i>

865
01:10:34,278 --> 01:10:38,032
<i>What a pop! He is down.</i>

866
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:40,718
<i>He is not getting up right away.</i>

867
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,355
<i>Wait a minute. I see...</i>
<i>I see movement.</i>

868
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:51,311
<i>Yes, he's finally moving now.</i>
<i>He's up.</i>

869
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:54,392
<i>Shaking it off. And there he goes.</i>

870
01:10:55,958 --> 01:11:00,031
Everything's so different,
so very different.

871
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:02,308
Things change.

872
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:04,872
There's Mr Bellows.
Hello, George!

873
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:08,035
He always had an eye for me.

874
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:11,150
- Where?
- Right there.

875
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,437
Hello, George!

876
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:17,955
Devils suck!

877
01:11:18,078 --> 01:11:20,387
<i>It's pretty much do-or-die time now.</i>

878
01:11:20,518 --> 01:11:23,430
<i>The Dawgs down by 4,</i>
<i>with 12 seconds left on the clock.</i>

879
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:25,389
<i>It's been a struggle for the Dawgs,</i>

880
01:11:25,518 --> 01:11:28,590
<i>trying to move the ball</i>
<i>against the stingy Devils defence.</i>

881
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:31,232
<i>This is not how</i>
<i>the Dawgs wanted it to come out.</i>

882
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:33,269
<i>They've had a tough time on defence.</i>

883
01:11:33,398 --> 01:11:36,470
- <i>They're not moving the ball as usual.</i>
- Ryan, come here.

884
01:11:36,598 --> 01:11:40,227
All right, son, trips right,
crazy eight. Let's go.

885
01:11:40,358 --> 01:11:44,874
<i>They're taking their time here.</i>
<i>Probably their last play of the game.</i>

886
01:11:44,998 --> 01:11:47,193
Trips right, crazy eight.

887
01:11:47,318 --> 01:11:50,867
Go! Go, Bulldogs!

888
01:11:53,718 --> 01:11:55,868
Hey, come back here!

889
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:03,516
<i>Last chance. We'll look for a Hail Mary.</i>
<i>We've got Jesse Ryan set wide.</i>

890
01:12:03,638 --> 01:12:05,594
<i>Bulldogs set. There's the snap.</i>

891
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:08,312
<i>A long bomb down towards the corner.</i>

892
01:12:08,438 --> 01:12:11,874
<i>Ryan is there. He's under it.</i>
<i>He jumps. He's got it!</i>

893
01:12:11,998 --> 01:12:12,748
<i>Complete!</i>

894
01:12:12,878 --> 01:12:15,836
<i>Touchdown, Bulldogs!</i>

895
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,471
<i>The Bulldogs win it!</i>

896
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:22,473
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, baby! Yeah!

897
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:29,956
Yeah! Yeah!

898
01:12:32,038 --> 01:12:33,187
Whoo-hoo!

899
01:12:35,398 --> 01:12:36,911
Jesse!

900
01:12:37,278 --> 01:12:38,597
Jesse!

901
01:12:56,203 --> 01:13:00,242
Ryan! Ryan.
College scout wants to talk to you.

902
01:13:00,363 --> 01:13:01,796
Hi.

903
01:13:01,923 --> 01:13:03,242
Brad.

904
01:13:03,363 --> 01:13:04,318
Yeah?

905
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:07,003
Could you tell Rachel to wait for me?

906
01:13:07,123 --> 01:13:10,559
No problem. And hey... good luck.

907
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:12,241
Thanks.

908
01:13:17,003 --> 01:13:19,233
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey.

909
01:13:19,363 --> 01:13:21,319
- Hi, Monica.
- Hey!

910
01:13:22,163 --> 01:13:24,438
Jesse's talking with a scout.

911
01:13:24,563 --> 01:13:26,997
- He said to go ahead to the party.
- You hear that?

912
01:13:27,123 --> 01:13:28,954
A scout. Isn't that great?

913
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:31,836
- Yeah, that's great.
- All right.

914
01:13:32,883 --> 01:13:35,351
I'm goin' with the guys.
See you there.

915
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:37,553
Come on.
I'll give you a ride to Mark's.

916
01:13:37,683 --> 01:13:39,639
- Thanks.
- Deborah!

917
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:46,393
Dress. Dress. Dress time!

918
01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:50,477
- Try this.
- Thanks.

919
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,433
Mascara. Mascara!

920
01:13:56,563 --> 01:13:57,916
Sorry.

921
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:11,433
Done. How do I look?

922
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:13,360
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

923
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:15,075
- You look good.
- You, too.

924
01:14:15,203 --> 01:14:17,592
- You look really pretty.
- You need lipstick.

925
01:14:18,883 --> 01:14:20,999
Yo, check it out.

926
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,999
Goddamn it!

927
01:14:30,963 --> 01:14:32,919
Whoa, that sucks!

928
01:14:33,043 --> 01:14:34,954
They even slashed my tyres.

929
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:38,473
Further proof the Devils
are just a bunch of pigs, huh?

930
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:41,037
- Are you looking for Rachel?
- Yeah.

931
01:14:41,163 --> 01:14:43,233
She's at Mark's. You want a ride?

932
01:14:50,963 --> 01:14:53,682
I just have to stop by my place real quick.

933
01:15:01,963 --> 01:15:04,272
- Have you seen Rachel Lang?
- Who?

934
01:15:04,403 --> 01:15:08,237
- Rachel Lang. Was she at the game?
- Oh, yeah. With the tattoo.

935
01:15:08,363 --> 01:15:10,319
I saw her leave with Monica Jones.

936
01:15:10,443 --> 01:15:12,877
I guess they went to Mark Bing's party.

937
01:15:13,003 --> 01:15:14,994
Rachel with Monica?

938
01:15:22,363 --> 01:15:26,117
Just go away!
Todd, get off my butt!

939
01:15:26,243 --> 01:15:27,801
Stop!

940
01:15:29,323 --> 01:15:32,235
Whoa, bro, what are you doing?

941
01:15:32,363 --> 01:15:34,923
You bust something,
heads are gonna roll.

942
01:15:37,883 --> 01:15:40,443
Whoo-hoo!

943
01:15:43,963 --> 01:15:46,682
Yes! Yes!

944
01:15:50,723 --> 01:15:52,793
Rachel, yo.

945
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,993
You could get me into this party, right?

946
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:57,318
Arnie, we'll come back for you.

947
01:15:57,443 --> 01:15:58,671
I told you.

948
01:15:58,803 --> 01:16:00,475
In a couple of years!

949
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:02,753
How come she gets to go in, then?

950
01:16:02,883 --> 01:16:06,558
- She's one of us.
- I'll try and get you in, Arnie!

951
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,915
Fuck that. Come on,
let's do some serious doughnuts.

952
01:16:11,043 --> 01:16:13,398
Come on. Hit it! Whoo!

953
01:16:15,243 --> 01:16:16,961
Then the scout said

954
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:20,792
"I love your aggressive play.
You have that killer instinct."

955
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:22,641
Great. For you, that's great.

956
01:16:24,723 --> 01:16:28,511
- There she is. You better disappear.
- No problem.

957
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:35,552
Swank!

958
01:16:43,563 --> 01:16:47,397
Relax. They just need to get to know you
for who you really are.

959
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:49,991
- How about a drink?
- Right on.

960
01:16:56,603 --> 01:16:58,639
What can I get you beautiful ladies?

961
01:16:58,763 --> 01:17:01,721
- Some margaritas would be nice.
- Okay.

962
01:17:02,723 --> 01:17:03,838
- B-rad.
- Yo!

963
01:17:03,963 --> 01:17:06,238
- Margaritas.
- Comin'!

964
01:17:09,163 --> 01:17:11,631
- Thanks.
- I'm glad you could make it.

965
01:17:11,763 --> 01:17:13,640
Sorry about the other night.

966
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:16,994
It was just a bunch of guys
being guys. I'm sorry.

967
01:17:18,003 --> 01:17:20,517
Jesse told us to cool it and explain.

968
01:17:20,643 --> 01:17:22,599
So, no hard feelings? Peace?

969
01:17:22,723 --> 01:17:26,033
Well, as long as you
pour me a drink, all right.

970
01:17:26,163 --> 01:17:27,437
Sho'.

971
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:29,717
Thanks.

972
01:17:29,843 --> 01:17:31,322
To new friends, then?

973
01:17:33,803 --> 01:17:35,555
- Drink to that.
- Okay.

974
01:17:39,784 --> 01:17:42,537
Tracy, I appreciate the ride, but let's go.

975
01:17:42,664 --> 01:17:45,861
I'm trying to figure out what to wear.

976
01:17:45,984 --> 01:17:48,293
Of course.

977
01:17:50,984 --> 01:17:53,134
Hey, what do you think of this?

978
01:17:53,264 --> 01:17:55,175
- Looks good.
- Really?

979
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,259
Yeah.

980
01:17:57,704 --> 01:18:01,379
Well, I don't know.
I think it might be a bit much.

981
01:18:02,384 --> 01:18:03,612
Don't you?

982
01:18:06,704 --> 01:18:08,501
We're gonna be late.

983
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:12,455
Pretty soon she won't care.

984
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:14,017
What's that?

985
01:18:15,064 --> 01:18:18,613
If she cares about you,
she won't mind if you're late.

986
01:18:23,637 --> 01:18:24,157
- Come on, wench, let's dance!
- Don't you "wench" me!

987
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:26,387
- Come on, wench, let's dance!
- Don't you "wench" me!

988
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:36,915
Rachel, let's dance.

989
01:18:37,037 --> 01:18:39,107
I think I'd rather wait for Jesse.

990
01:18:39,237 --> 01:18:42,149
- He'd want you to have fun.
- Come on, have some fun.

991
01:18:42,277 --> 01:18:45,155
Yeah, come on, Rach.
I got you, babe. Come on.

992
01:18:45,757 --> 01:18:47,270
Go, Rachel!

993
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:02,872
Whoa!

994
01:19:15,597 --> 01:19:19,226
Hey, Mark, I got a little present
for you, right here.

995
01:19:19,357 --> 01:19:21,188
Mark, you like the game footage?

996
01:19:21,317 --> 01:19:24,115
I love the footage. Yes, I do!

997
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:26,148
Are you talking about today's game?

998
01:19:26,277 --> 01:19:28,233
No, about the other game.

999
01:19:28,357 --> 01:19:30,427
What other game?

1000
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:34,072
- The game that you're in. My turn.
- Yeah?

1001
01:19:34,197 --> 01:19:37,633
- The game you played, Rachel.
- Right. What was the score?

1002
01:19:37,757 --> 01:19:39,907
Grab that scorebook. I wanna see it.

1003
01:19:40,037 --> 01:19:43,109
- Want to see it now? All right.
- Come here, baby.

1004
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:46,149
I wanna show you how you
helped Jesse win the game.

1005
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:49,712
Two-twenty-four!
Hut, hut, hut, hut!

1006
01:19:51,637 --> 01:19:52,911
Whoo!

1007
01:19:56,157 --> 01:19:57,351
Whoo!

1008
01:19:57,997 --> 01:19:58,952
Rachel!

1009
01:19:59,077 --> 01:20:00,476
Catch!

1010
01:20:02,157 --> 01:20:04,034
Yeah, baby!

1011
01:20:04,157 --> 01:20:05,431
Yeah!

1012
01:20:06,157 --> 01:20:08,113
Hold it! I gotta get my camera.

1013
01:20:08,477 --> 01:20:10,593
- Read off the scores.
- Hold on.

1014
01:20:11,797 --> 01:20:14,755
Come on, Rachel! Read the scores!

1015
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:19,428
Let's start with Eric's scores
cos it's gonna be so sad.

1016
01:20:19,557 --> 01:20:21,513
Start with poor Eric.

1017
01:20:24,117 --> 01:20:27,234
What's the matter? Is there
someone in there you recognise?

1018
01:20:27,357 --> 01:20:29,871
Someone you know? Huh?

1019
01:20:36,717 --> 01:20:39,277
Ahh, Lisa!

1020
01:20:39,517 --> 01:20:41,428
I forgot about Lisa.

1021
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:42,626
Eric!

1022
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:44,907
Come on down!

1023
01:20:45,037 --> 01:20:47,870
There's our brother!
The DA kissed his butt!

1024
01:20:51,557 --> 01:20:54,390
- We were just talking about Lisa.
- Oh, Lisa!

1025
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:56,826
How was she?

1026
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:59,630
To be honest,
I just about split her in two!

1027
01:21:07,677 --> 01:21:09,190
How many points was she?

1028
01:21:09,317 --> 01:21:12,548
Four, but we should deduct those
since she offed herself.

1029
01:21:12,677 --> 01:21:17,467
Wait. Think of how many points he'd have
got if he'd done her after she was dead.

1030
01:21:17,597 --> 01:21:19,553
- A bit cold, huh?
- Chuck, come on!

1031
01:21:19,677 --> 01:21:23,226
Rach, baby, read that.
Open it up to Jesse's page.

1032
01:21:23,357 --> 01:21:26,076
I want you to see how many points

1033
01:21:26,197 --> 01:21:28,267
Jesse got for you!

1034
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:31,514
I think that'll be about a two-four-six-eight!

1035
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,229
Who do we appreciate!

1036
01:21:33,357 --> 01:21:38,112
Remember, you said you were a dyke,
so extra points for the conversion.

1037
01:21:38,237 --> 01:21:41,229
Oh, the conversion! Two points!

1038
01:21:41,357 --> 01:21:43,154
Not two. Thirty!

1039
01:21:43,277 --> 01:21:45,950
Thirty?! You gave her thirty?!

1040
01:21:46,877 --> 01:21:50,074
She should get extra points,
being so skanky.

1041
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:55,516
Look.

1042
01:21:55,637 --> 01:21:58,868
Look at that. Look at it.

1043
01:22:04,037 --> 01:22:05,948
We didn't think Jesse could do it.

1044
01:22:06,637 --> 01:22:09,868
- So he offered to get us proof.
- How do you like Jesse's big play?

1045
01:22:09,997 --> 01:22:14,195
Lookie, lookie here, Rachel! Lookie here!

1046
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:17,593
- <i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>
- Was it good for ya?

1047
01:22:19,197 --> 01:22:23,110
- Is that you?
- <i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>

1048
01:22:25,077 --> 01:22:26,271
<i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>

1049
01:22:26,397 --> 01:22:28,911
Was it good, Rachel!
Was it good, Rachel!

1050
01:22:29,037 --> 01:22:30,675
<i>They're all gonna laugh at you!</i>

1051
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:46,828
Sucker! Sucker! Sucker!

1052
01:22:53,877 --> 01:22:56,516
Hey, is that a zit on your ass?

1053
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:59,390
It is! It is a zit on her ass!

1054
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:01,906
No, that's a mole.

1055
01:23:02,037 --> 01:23:03,470
Holy shit.

1056
01:23:06,317 --> 01:23:09,593
- Mark, what's going on?
- I have no idea.

1057
01:23:43,877 --> 01:23:46,755
Rachel!

1058
01:23:48,077 --> 01:23:49,590
Out of my way!

1059
01:23:49,717 --> 01:23:52,231
- Hey!
- Brad, you bastard!

1060
01:24:28,837 --> 01:24:32,273
- Get out of the way! Move it!
- Shit! It won't open!

1061
01:24:35,277 --> 01:24:37,711
Holy shit, dude! It's her doing it!

1062
01:24:37,837 --> 01:24:38,713
Go!

1063
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:53,513
Somebody put me out! Help!

1064
01:24:54,837 --> 01:24:56,555
Oh, God, help me!

1065
01:24:56,677 --> 01:24:58,713
Help me!

1066
01:24:59,477 --> 01:25:00,910
Oh, my God!

1067
01:25:02,757 --> 01:25:04,395
Let me out!

1068
01:25:08,797 --> 01:25:11,391
Man, we're missing one killer party.

1069
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:17,716
- Where are the fuckin' keys!
- Hurry!

1070
01:25:17,837 --> 01:25:21,113
My stupid dad's always hiding
these friggin' keys!

1071
01:25:27,277 --> 01:25:29,552
Tyler! Tyler, get up!

1072
01:25:29,877 --> 01:25:31,708
- What's this?
- A spear gun, idiot.

1073
01:25:31,837 --> 01:25:35,466
- Give me that shit.
- What will you do with a flare gun?!

1074
01:25:45,997 --> 01:25:47,953
It's all my fault.

1075
01:26:00,477 --> 01:26:02,433
Let's go! Get outta here!

1076
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:03,512
Oh, shit!

1077
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,431
Go on! Through the glass!
Come on!

1078
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:18,832
Get up!

1079
01:26:21,717 --> 01:26:24,515
- Pull the cord!
- Where's the fuckin' cord!

1080
01:26:49,317 --> 01:26:51,069
Oh, shit!

1081
01:27:02,117 --> 01:27:03,072
Rachel!

1082
01:27:03,197 --> 01:27:04,425
Mama?

1083
01:28:54,357 --> 01:28:56,393
Rachel!

1084
01:29:01,037 --> 01:29:02,231
Mama!

1085
01:29:03,957 --> 01:29:06,517
- Oh!
- Rachel...

1086
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:10,868
What's wrong?

1087
01:29:16,437 --> 01:29:18,234
Mama?

1088
01:29:18,357 --> 01:29:20,427
What are you?

1089
01:29:20,557 --> 01:29:22,707
You're not my little girl.

1090
01:29:22,837 --> 01:29:26,386
No! No, the devil's in you!

1091
01:29:26,517 --> 01:29:30,066
- The devil's in you! The devil's in you!
- Mama!

1092
01:29:30,197 --> 01:29:34,952
Mama, please! Please, Mama,
don't leave me! Don't leave me!

1093
01:29:37,357 --> 01:29:39,825
I don't have anyone!

1094
01:29:46,277 --> 01:29:48,552
Please...

1095
01:29:50,237 --> 01:29:52,068
Please...

1096
01:29:53,197 --> 01:29:55,233
Please, God,

1097
01:29:57,397 --> 01:29:59,308
let me die.

1098
01:30:05,757 --> 01:30:08,112
Please...

1099
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:10,826
Rachel!

1100
01:30:42,962 --> 01:30:47,877
Come on, she's dead! They're all dead!
We have to get out of here! Let's go!

1101
01:30:49,442 --> 01:30:50,795
Oh, my God!

1102
01:30:50,922 --> 01:30:52,799
Forget about that! Let's go!

1103
01:30:52,922 --> 01:30:54,196
You used me.

1104
01:30:54,322 --> 01:30:55,755
I had no idea!

1105
01:30:55,882 --> 01:30:56,792
Liar!

1106
01:31:00,282 --> 01:31:03,035
Is that all I was to you, Jesse?

1107
01:31:03,162 --> 01:31:04,959
30 points?

1108
01:31:05,082 --> 01:31:07,516
I'd never do that. Trust me.
I'd never hurt you.

1109
01:31:07,642 --> 01:31:09,439
Stop lying!

1110
01:31:13,922 --> 01:31:16,755
I believed you. You know that?

1111
01:31:16,882 --> 01:31:17,951
God!

1112
01:31:18,082 --> 01:31:20,038
I believed you.

1113
01:31:20,162 --> 01:31:23,996
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I love you. I do.

1114
01:31:24,122 --> 01:31:25,794
- Liar!
- I love you!

1115
01:31:25,922 --> 01:31:27,833
<i>I love you.</i>

1116
01:31:31,922 --> 01:31:33,560
<i>I love you.</i>

1117
01:31:37,442 --> 01:31:38,761
<i>I love you.</i>

1118
01:31:39,602 --> 01:31:40,591
<i>I love you.</i>

1119
01:31:41,122 --> 01:31:42,271
<i>I love you.</i>

1120
01:32:06,162 --> 01:32:06,958
No!

1121
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:12,841
Rachel!

1122
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:25,760
Rachel!

1123
01:32:31,802 --> 01:32:34,794
- Get out. Stay away from me.
- No.

1124
01:32:34,922 --> 01:32:38,153
- Please go.
