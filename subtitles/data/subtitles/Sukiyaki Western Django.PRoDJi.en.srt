1
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,480
Ringo...

2
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,880
Been looking for you.

3
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,040
It's the end of the road for you.

4
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,360
What's that sound?

5
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,720
That's the sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells.

6
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,680
What?

7
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,680
You know, them
Heike and Genji boys.

8
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,040
On a distant island,

9
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,320
these two clans split into
the Reds and the Whites.

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Wage war.

11
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,760
Sort of like that
War of the Roses, you know?

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,880
In England?

13
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Who won?

14
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
The Whites?

15
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,560
This high noon battle
was waged in Dannoura.

16
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,360
Hear the Heike clan in red
got themselves hog-tied

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,120
by the Genji clan in white.

18
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,520
Their story goes
a little something like this.

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,160
The sound

20
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,720
of the Gion Shoja temple bells

21
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,840
echoes the impermanence

22
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,600
of all things.

23
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,480
What bells you say?

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,840
The color
of the sala flower

25
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,720
reveals the truth

26
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,280
that to flourish

27
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,200
is to fall.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,240
The proud do not endure

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,280
like a passing dream

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,440
on a night in spring.

31
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,360
The mighty

32
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,080
fall at last.

33
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,120
See you in hell.

34
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,800
To be no more than
dust before the wind.

35
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,440
Piringo.

36
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,200
That's why I love you.

37
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,000
Ain't nothing back there.

38
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,720
You ain't heard me?

39
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,640
It's an ain't nothing town.

40
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,720
Bet you came
for the gold, too.

41
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,440
White or Red?

42
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,000
You Genji

43
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,440
or Heike?

44
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,040
Which gang's gonna buy it?

45
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,960
My reward is one third.

46
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,000
If there ain't no treasure, don't pay.

47
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,240
Benkei, show him.

48
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,080
No doubt about who's
gonna be left standing.

49
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,120
But best not get any ideas
about playing Yojimbo.

50
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,320
You got to be alive to
spend your money, stranger.

51
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,640
The kid's got a heart,
and balls to match.

52
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,840
No! Join us!

53
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,160
We'll do better than a third!

54
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,960
We'll leave you half!

55
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,160
Half?

56
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,720
We'll give you everything.

57
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,120
But with us, it's a lifetime contract.

58
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Don't know about that.

59
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,200
I don't stay long in one place.

60
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,160
Suits us fine!

61
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,000
We'll give you half
for this one-time deal.

62
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,040
Not too shabby.

63
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,560
Hey, boy!

64
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,080
Hey. If you're
such a quick draw,

65
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,240
you don't need them.

66
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,760
Take it all.

67
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,720
And tell them to shove
their lifetime contract.

68
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,160
Boy, don't rush yourself.

69
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Make your choice
after cooling your heels.

70
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,120
This town can't grow from seed,

71
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,400
but I can offer
some soba tea at my place.

72
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,720
Come with me.

73
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,080
Hey.

74
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,880
So the Reds
rode in first, eh?

75
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,040
Yeah. How do you figure that?

76
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,520
Simple.

77
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
With the sheriff,

78
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
seeing the law hitched
with the weaker side

79
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,080
must mean they made him
an offer he couldn't refuse.

80
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,840
Uh, of course, now,

81
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,120
maybe he's looking
for a chance to switch sides.

82
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,320
How long has it been like this?

83
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,520
Two months since
the Heikes walked in.

84
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,800
And before that,

85
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,680
gold prospectors
started coming 'round.

86
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,360
What?

87
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,800
But what we couldn't
figure out was

88
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,520
why so many people,
and why now?

89
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,160
The end of last month,

90
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,360
a town with the same legend

91
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,680
found the mother lode.

92
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,320
The country's gone crazy
with Heike gold tales.

93
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,240
Every nook and cranny
of every town

94
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,520
with the treasure legend

95
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
is swarming with prospectors.

96
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,080
It's a genuine gold rush!
Yee-ha ha ha!

97
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,000
You can't touch this land,
or you'll be cursed.

98
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,000
Ha!

99
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,600
We'll take that curse
off your hands.

100
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,360
And we can't quietly sit by
as you lay waste to our land!

101
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Ow!

102
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,680
In the beginning,

103
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,280
we expected them
to be a godsend

104
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
because they were Heike,
like us.

105
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,280
But things soon went sour.

106
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,680
The Heikes
ran off the prospectors

107
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,720
and started digging.

108
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
Look!

109
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,200
What?

110
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,640
Kiyomori! Boss Kiyomori!

111
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
We found this.

112
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,560
Instead of that wood marker
that read "Fear the curse".

113
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,920
I knew it!

114
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,360
So they figured the treasure
must be somewhere,

115
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,920
and they have
been here since.

116
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Boss Kiyomori.

117
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,640
From today, you're one of us.

118
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,560
Think of it as being on vacation.

119
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,400
Uh, yes.

120
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,200
I've been meaning
to take some time off.

121
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,640
Feeling a little beside myself.

122
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,040
But his reign of power
didn't last long.

123
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,960
Dang.

124
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,240
You boys are a day late
and a dollar short.

125
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
This is our town.

126
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,760
Huh?

127
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,680
Ooh...

128
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Dang.

129
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,520
Genjis.

130
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,240
Shigemori, we got to
fatten you up, boy.

131
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,920
Boss Yoshitsune.

132
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,000
The Genjis didn't make
a move against the Heikes.

133
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,680
They left the gold digging to them,

134
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,720
sat back, and waited
for their chance to steal the loot.

135
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,600
Hey.

136
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,280
Finders keepers.

137
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,280
After that,
people began to leave.

138
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,880
Just a few families are left.

139
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,720
Ah, we might as well hire you.

140
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,000
But all the town can offer is this.

141
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,400
Dadacha-mame.

142
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,640
Try this.

143
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,880
Hey. Hey, welcome back.

144
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,480
This is my grandson.
Heihachi.

145
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,480
Give it a go.

146
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,400
Death isn't to be feared.

147
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,440
Don't watch the blade.

148
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,520
How many times
do I have to tell you?

149
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,840
Don't follow the blade
with your eyes.

150
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,400
Don't see it, feel it.

151
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,040
That's the essence
of Mononofu training.

152
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,920
Mononofu training
ain't samurai bullshit.

153
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
Being a samurai is
a philosophical way of life.

154
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,800
But the life of Mononofu
means life of fighting!

155
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,040
If you ask me,

156
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,200
samurai are still
wearing their skiwies.

157
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,280
They are vain.

158
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,480
They're still concerned
about their looks.

159
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,000
That's "tits on the bull" thinking.

160
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,440
But if you peel away that last layer

161
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,800
so you are naked,

162
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,760
this in the raw fighting the spirit is

163
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,400
warrior's lot in life.

164
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,640
His realm,

165
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,800
our realm

166
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,960
is deeper than the samurai's.

167
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,600
Now...

168
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,400
you gonna come at me

169
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,960
or whistle Dixie?

170
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
What's it gonna be?

171
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,760
Take this handsome man
to the Reds

172
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,720
or hand him over to the Whites?

173
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,120
You know, I'm at sea.

174
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
I don't know.

175
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,520
Depends on him.

176
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,840
Today's special is the Whites

177
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,720
with a side of
mashed potatoes and soup.

178
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
Forget about the Heike gang.

179
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
Their Boss Kiyomori smells
like a dead dog on a hot day.

180
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,600
He's lost so much,
he's getting dumber.

181
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,880
"The sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells

182
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,440
echoes the impermanence
of all things. "

183
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,880
You follow?

184
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,040
Yes, I... uh...

185
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,200
It means everything in this
old world changes.

186
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,040
It means we can never
call our services off.

187
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,640
We'll finally restore the glory

188
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,080
of our family name
and the riding-high.

189
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,680
Genji gang will be lead to ruins.

190
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,520
"The color of the sala flowers

191
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,400
"reveals the truth

192
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,040
that to flourish is to fall. "

193
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
That's it.

194
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,840
It's a law of nature.

195
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
The Genjis are going down!

196
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,720
From today,

197
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,480
I read this.

198
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,600
What's that?

199
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,760
Shakespeare. Henry VI.

200
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,800
The War of the Roses.

201
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,560
War of the Roses?

202
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,200
Come on, boy.

203
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,680
Don't you know your Shakespeare?

204
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,040
It's a story about
the Reds winning the war.

205
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,720
The Reds win?

206
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,960
Yes, we'll win.

207
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,160
Yeah! Kiyomori!

208
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,000
What?

209
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,040
Kiyomori.

210
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,560
Don't ever call me
Kiyomori again!

211
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
From today...

212
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,760
the name's... Henry.

213
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,560
Side with the Genjis.

214
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,440
They got a young lady,
fine as cream gravy.

215
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,480
That painted lady
used to be a dancer.

216
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,280
She's the kid's mama,
but still mighty fine.

217
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,680
Hasn't aged a bit.

218
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,800
A woman of true
Genji lineage.

219
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,800
He's Genji and Heike?

220
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,720
Huh? Oh, the kid?

221
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,240
Yeah, he's a half-breed.

222
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,360
And his father?

223
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,400
Got himself killed.

224
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,400
You're of
the same stock, boy?

225
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,520
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

226
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,680
He can't talk no more.

227
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Hard to after seeing
your dad murdered.

228
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,920
What's his mother doing
on the Genji side?

229
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,280
Ahem.

230
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,560
To begin with, that granny's boy
went to work in the city.

231
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,080
Then, one day,

232
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,200
that boy, her son Akira,

233
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,400
brought the Genji woman home.

234
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,920
Mama, the days of being
Genji or Heike are done with.

235
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,600
I don't know how
or where the two met,

236
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,280
but his mother
blessed their marriage.

237
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,680
So Red and White got hitched,

238
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,120
and they figured
crossing roses,

239
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,760
blooming in both colors,
was romantic.

240
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,160
And they raised Heihachi,

241
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,600
their Red and White treasure.

242
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,160
But then the fighting
started again.

243
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,480
Finders keepers.

244
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,400
Ugh!

245
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,160
Kiyomori!

246
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,920
Get out.
There ain't no gold here.

247
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,960
That's it?

248
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,200
Take it all!

249
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,480
If you want it, take it.

250
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,080
And get out!

251
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,440
Daddy!

252
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,040
Heihachi!

253
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,640
Daddy!

254
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,880
Love hurts.

255
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,920
My favorite color.

256
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Looks good on you.

257
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,040
Folks say a Genji woman
painted red

258
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,360
lit a flame in him.

259
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,240
No! No!

260
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,400
Aah!

261
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,880
I'll teach you good!

262
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,280
I show you what a real man is!

263
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,160
I know, I know.

264
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,800
So she ran to the hideout
of her own flesh and blood.

265
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Was it to protect her son,

266
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,440
or get vengeance
for her husband?

267
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,200
How much for the lady?

268
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
How much you got?

269
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,840
Depends on how much
you'll pay me.

270
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,400
Keep it in your pants, lily liver.

271
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,360
The tougher man gets the girl.

272
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,640
Do what you like.

273
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,480
Do her here, upstairs.

274
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,480
Wherever and however
you please.

275
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,440
You are the second
cunning wolf

276
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,400
I ever really wanted
to draw iron at.

277
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,840
Who was the first?

278
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,600
A legend.

279
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,320
One I heard
when I was a kid.

280
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,480
Oh, yeah?

281
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,560
The Bloody...

282
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,600
Benten.

283
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,320
Bloody Benten.

284
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,440
The fighting goddess legend.

285
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,880
Shit.

286
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,560
Now I really want
to draw iron at you.

287
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,320
§§

288
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,920
Nice.

289
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,600
Ain't refined,

290
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,040
but it hits you deep down.

291
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,880
The Anasazi play that music.

292
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,960
They were here
before any of us.

293
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,760
They still keep the old ways.

294
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,720
§§

295
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,040
You'll do fine.

296
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,840
I want Kiyomori dead.

297
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,720
You've thrown away your body,
everything, all for revenge?

298
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,360
So what?

299
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,200
Don't pity me.

300
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,120
I don't need useless
compassion from you.

301
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,760
Good. It ain't
good for nothing, huh?

302
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,040
Do you want me?

303
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,640
Very much.

304
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,840
But be careful.

305
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,920
Yoshitsune's men left town
to get a powerful weapon.

306
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,480
Yoichi wants you dead.

307
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,240
They'll likely be here by sunup.

308
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,560
When the shooting starts,

309
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,280
take Heihachi and
escape to the mountains.

310
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,640
You're not gonna run?

311
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,960
Oh, you got something
against them, too?

312
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,360
I got my reasons.

313
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,840
Have the roses
bloomed yet?

314
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,680
What are they named?

315
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,520
Love.

316
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,800
Howdy, Sheriff.

317
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,960
"A special weapon
will be here soon.

318
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,880
"Before the Genjis get it,

319
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,960
"tell the Heike's to
bushwhack their wagons.

320
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,680
If you don't, we'll all be killed. "

321
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,200
Sorry.

322
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,880
What are you doing, boy?

323
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,800
Shit or get off the pot!

324
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,960
Hold your horses.

325
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,720
Instead of telling them
the godawful truth,

326
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,800
don't you reckon
we better hightail it?

327
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,680
I ain't listening to you no more.

328
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,560
Kiyomori!

329
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,360
Boss Kiyomori!

330
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,320
Aah!

331
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,880
The name's Henry.

332
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,280
Where have you been?

333
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,640
I was spying on the Genjis,

334
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,120
and things are getting
way out of hand.

335
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,360
Excuse me.

336
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,480
Come again?

337
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,320
Whoa!

338
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,880
See-ya! See-ya! See-ya! See-ya!

339
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,000
See-ya! See-ya!

340
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,600
I told you we should've
skipped town.

341
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,360
I told you.

342
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Shit. Whoa!

343
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
Go!

344
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,200
Ye-yeah!

345
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,760
Fear nothing!

346
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,920
Hah!

347
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,000
Whoa!

348
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,680
Stupid.

349
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,080
You did this.

350
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,200
Fire, boys, and guard the windows.

351
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,760
How'd he pull that off?

352
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,240
Come!

353
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,160
Ichiro. Matsui.

354
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,400
Follow me.

355
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,960
What happened?

356
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,360
Tell you later!

357
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,840
We're going to the old man's
place in the mountains.

358
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,360
Heihachi! Heihachi!
Come on, hurry!

359
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,040
- Come on!
- This way.

360
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,200
Watch your step.

361
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,600
Take Heihachi
and go without me.

362
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,880
What did you forget?

363
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,920
Something important!

364
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,360
What's wrong?

365
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Forget them!
You don't need them!

366
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,040
No! They're...

367
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,240
They're...

368
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,720
They're my...

369
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,560
heart.

370
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,960
No matter what,
one of you's gonna die.

371
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,320
Heihachi. Please.

372
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,240
Please, not him.

373
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,480
If you want him to live,

374
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,200
drop... your... guns.

375
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,200
Stop bitching! Hyah!

376
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,320
The time is now!

377
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,920
Ho!

378
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,560
Hey. Hey!

379
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,800
Die!

380
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,120
Hmm.

381
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,520
Haah!

382
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,240
Aah!

383
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,680
Lucky me.

384
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Henry!

385
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,600
Aah!

386
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,120
Hah! Ho!

387
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,000
Henry!

388
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,040
Shigemori,

389
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,240
I won't die until we win.

390
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,640
Uhh... Uh...

391
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,240
Payback's a bitch!

392
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,600
Before you die...

393
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,560
I have something sweet.

394
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,320
You want some, bitch?

395
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,720
You are an animal.

396
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,280
Toshio!
Throw it here!

397
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,480
Can't be...

398
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,920
bloody...

399
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,120
Heihachi.

400
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,800
Heihachi.

401
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,160
What are you doing?

402
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,400
Open your eyes.

403
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,000
Hmm?

404
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,760
See for yourself.

405
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,040
You can't close them
to reality.

406
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,280
Open your eyes!

407
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,360
Heihachi! Heihachi!

408
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,920
Open your eyes!

409
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,800
Aah!

410
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,960
Could you
visit this address

411
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,920
and stock up on these?

412
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,760
If he is still alive,

413
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,600
my signature here
should help you out.

414
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,280
I wish I could go,

415
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,560
but I can't
leave the boy alone.

416
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,520
Ruriko.

417
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,280
Hmm?

418
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,800
But these are guns.

419
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,880
Tell him I need help,

420
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,360
and he owes me.

421
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,000
You are the only one
I can depend on.

422
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,360
What's "BB"?

423
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,680
When this doubly
talented goddess

424
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,520
used to play music.

425
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,800
she would hold her
instruments in both hands.

426
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,720
But when she was
on the warpath,

427
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,400
she held weapons
in eight hands.

428
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,080
When the fire of vengeance dwelled in her
eyes,

429
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,680
this murdering goddess
was wide awake,

430
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,840
and everything in her way
got stained blood red.

431
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,880
They dubbed her
Bloody Benten.

432
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,280
Nicknamed double B for short.

433
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,840
I was the one who
educated her in killing,

434
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,200
and it was tough going.

435
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,080
You like it?

436
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,200
It's too sweet.

437
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,840
Well...
Too much sugar.

438
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,680
This is sukiyaki,
not a damn lollipop!

439
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,720
Oh, I'm so sorry.

440
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,120
How many times
do I gotta tell you

441
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,840
before it sinks into
that thick skull of yours

442
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,120
that you draw the sweetness
out of the Chinese cabbage?

443
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,040
Sorry...
And this tofu.

444
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,240
It's kinugoshi!

445
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,600
But... But...
But the store was sold out.

446
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,920
Aah!

447
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,240
No... damn... darned excuses!

448
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,200
I'm sorry.

449
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,040
Dang useless woman.

450
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,960
Why I ever thought I could
make a gunfighter out of...

451
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,880
Listen up, girl.

452
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,400
If this were a gunfight,

453
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,280
you wouldn't be saying
"They sold out of bullets,

454
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,160
let's shoot beans instead,"
now could ya?

455
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,240
That'd mean death to me and you,
wouldn't it? Hmm, wouldn't it?

456
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,400
That's my girl.
There you go.

457
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,040
Never let
your guard down.

458
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,440
Yes.

459
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,800
The Grim Reaper himself
dwells in that pot.

460
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,920
Don't you forget that.

461
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:02,400
I... I nev...

462
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,200
Sugar.

463
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,000
Don't worry.

464
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,600
The sugar helps me.

465
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,600
Lordy lord.

466
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,040
You ain't pregnant,
is ya?

467
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I reckon it will be
a bouncing boy.

468
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,720
Oh, heck.

469
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,480
You mean Akira?

470
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,960
Akira.

471
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,080
How the lovely sound

472
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,160
of that name
brings me back.

473
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,080
What can I say?

474
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,960
At the end, I am
an anime otaku at heart.

475
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,800
What?

476
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,560
How's my boy?

477
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,160
Ah, so.

478
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,160
That's why you've come
for them irons, eh?

479
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,320
You'll tell her this for me.

480
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,280
Life is all about goodbyes.

481
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,920
We are in your hands!

482
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,680
I'm surprised.

483
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,800
He is still alive.

484
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,160
I guess

485
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,760
every man's got his own reasons

486
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,000
for why he has to keep on living.

487
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,600
Got a cold?

488
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,640
Don't you have one, too?

489
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,040
Thank you.

490
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,600
You going?

491
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,280
Huh?

492
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,880
Yep.

493
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,960
Going. where to?

494
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,200
To settle a score.

495
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,120
What score?

496
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,720
The town's got nothing
to do with you.

497
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,320
Shit just happens.

498
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,440
That's all.

499
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,760
So the meaning of life
is shit happens, huh?

500
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,840
Well, I don't want to run
from the shit anymore.

501
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,600
Sorry, but could you
fetch the treasure for me?

502
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,600
There is one?

503
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,120
Ruriko,
what about the town law?

504
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:57,000
As anyone who's getting on
in years around here knows...

505
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,920
he was chosen to guard it.

506
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,240
That's the town law.

507
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,880
I thought Heihachi
would be the next chosen one,

508
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,400
but he's too weak.

509
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,560
I reckon he was born at the wrong time
and in the wrong place.

510
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,160
He does have a gift
for music, though.

511
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,920
But tenderness alone
won't get you far in life.

512
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,880
What are you fixing to do
with the treasure?

513
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,760
Settle this
once and for all.

514
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,680
If we lose,
they can have it.

515
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,240
If we win,
you can have half.

516
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,680
How about it? You game?

517
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,280
Suits me fine.

518
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,840
Okay, then.

519
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,440
This way.

520
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,520
No. This way.

521
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,600
I ain't gonna listen to you no more!

522
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,520
That's my line!

523
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,280
I'll kill you!

524
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,960
Aah!

525
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,160
Smells like victory.

526
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:41,040
Got the Mr. Gatling riding shotgun.

527
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,480
And now, a shield.

528
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,200
A shield?

529
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:53,080
If you were fatter, it would be perfect.

530
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,840
Hey! Hey!

531
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,040
Hey, hold on!

532
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,600
Come on, now! Hey! No! No!

533
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,120
Shit.

534
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,360
Hey, if I get taken down,

535
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,880
will you give this
to Heihachi for me?

536
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,720
I'll think about it
if and when you die.

537
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,760
Hey! Hey!

538
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,000
I'll carry the treasure for you.

539
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,200
I'll carry the guns.

540
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,280
And if there's
any more carrying to do,

541
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,680
then let me do it.

542
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:40,440
Well, if you ain't the most stubborn
man I ever did meet.

543
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,800
Let him take it.

544
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,640
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

545
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,360
Go, Banjo. Go!

546
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,360
We get shot,

547
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,520
and you are the one's
gonna get smoked,

548
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,760
not me.

549
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,160
You die first.

550
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,920
No, you die first!

551
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,080
We die.

552
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,920
Okay, we die.

553
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,360
We die. I die.

554
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,720
You die, he dies, she dies, we die.

555
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,760
Everybody dies.

556
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,480
Here's the treasure!

557
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,000
Have at it, boys!

558
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,680
Winner takes all!

559
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,560
Hey! Look!

560
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,000
Gold! Gold!

561
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,760
Spread out!

562
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,200
- Here!
- This way!

563
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,320
This way.

564
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,320
Where those Heike boys?

565
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,120
No! No!

566
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,560
No!

567
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,000
Get down!

568
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,360
You've got a new toy.

569
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,080
Shields!

570
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,600
Aah!

571
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,840
Yoshitsune!

572
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,200
Confess thy error!

573
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,960
This time, we win.

574
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,640
This time, we win!

575
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,440
Ha ha ha ha!

576
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,320
This time...

577
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,960
That's for the mayor.

578
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,360
I can.

579
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,880
I win.

580
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,960
I win.

581
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:35,040
I ain't dead...

582
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,040
till I beat you.

583
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,120
This is for Akira.

584
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,400
It's all mine!

585
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,840
It's mine.

586
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,880
It's all ours!

587
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,120
I...

588
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,040
always...

589
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,600
you're...

590
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,480
Don't say it.

591
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:40,280
No one in the world
ever saved Benten's life.

592
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,720
Except for you.

593
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,800
Nope.

594
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,280
You...

595
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,640
You're Ruriko.

596
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,240
My...

597
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:07,800
Ruriko.

598
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,160
I'm not...

599
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,040
dead...

600
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,840
yet.

601
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,320
Now this...

602
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,320
is what I call class.

603
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:51,760
So that old granny
was Bloody Benten, eh?

604
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:57,000
I'm glad I came here.

605
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,880
Hell, I'm glad I was born.

606
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,720
Finally, with a worthy opponent,

607
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,600
I can risk my life to the death.

608
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,680
Victory...

609
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,880
or death!

610
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,760
That's plenty for me.

611
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,840
You keep the rest.

612
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,160
Just do me one thing.

613
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,520
Tend to the roses for me.

614
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,640
But when it doesn't feel right,

615
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,440
you can stop.

616
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,800
Now you've got money,

617
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,720
you've got a gun,

618
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,800
and the roses, too.

619
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:42,280
Heihachi,

620
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,680
son,

621
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:49,840
no matter what the times may be,

622
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,520
no matter where you are,

623
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:58,120
what matters is you
and how you deal with this world.

624
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:05,920
And there ain't no running from it.

625
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,760
Don't run.

626
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,040
Decide for yourself

627
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,880
what tomorrow's gonna be.

628
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,320
Love.

629
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,640
Your mother was a mighty fine lady.
