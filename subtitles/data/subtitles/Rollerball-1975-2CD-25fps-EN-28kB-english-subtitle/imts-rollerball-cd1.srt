00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,755
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>Welcome to Houston, the Energy City,</i>

2
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,997
<i>home of the defending</i>
<i>rollerball world champions.</i>

3
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,669
<i>This key international battle</i>
<i>pits divisional champions Madrid</i>

4
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,756
<i>against powerful Houston.</i>

5
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,839
<i>Here they come for a standing ovation.</i>
<i>On the track comes Houston!</i>

6
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,474
<i>Houston, led by captain Jonathan E,</i>

7
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,955
<i>again their leading scorer this year.</i>

8
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,555
OK. Let's go.

9
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,516
<i>The controller indicates he is ready.</i>

10
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,191
<i>Our 30 Multivision cameras will bring you</i>
<i>all the thrills and excitement of this game.</i>

11
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,199
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>our corporate anthem.</i>

12
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,110
<i>The controller tests his equipment,</i>
<i>readies for the start.</i>

13
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,471
<i>The firing of the test ball</i>
<i>will signal we're about set to go.</i>

14
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,272
<i>The controller for tonight's game -</i>
<i>DA Niehaus.</i>

15
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,593
<i>The officials approve play.</i>
<i>Each team concludes its huddle,</i>

16
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,838
<i>and the crowd cheers once again as</i>
<i>this Houston audience greets its team,</i>

17
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,474
<i>led by the stalwart athlete Jonathan E.</i>

18
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,355
Break off. That's it, boys.

19
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,835
Hook it!

20
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,155
<i>Now the play-by-play. Here's RD.</i>

21
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,757
<i>The computer counts down.</i>
<i>The ball is fired.</i>

22
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,440
<i>First period is under way</i>
<i>here at Houston tonight.</i>

23
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,152
<i>The first team to pick up the ball</i>
<i>will be on offence</i>

24
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,670
<i>and it's a pick-up by Houston!</i>
<i>It's picked up by BJ.</i>

25
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,190
<i>BJ moves around, manoeuvring it in</i>
<i>to the leading scorer Jonathan E.</i>

26
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,753
Go on! Go on!

27
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,836
Watch him!

28
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,955
<i>Jonathan E holds the ball aloft.</i>
<i>You must hold it in view at all times.</i>

29
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,390
- Pick 'em up, pick 'em up!
- I got him, I got him.

30
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,112
On your right!

31
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,393
<i>Jonathan moves in,</i>
<i>then out in front of Blue's bike.</i>

32
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,909
<i>Jonathan moves up the track</i>
<i>and up onto the side.</i>

33
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,430
<i>Here comes Sanchez.</i>
<i>Sanchez grabs Jonathan,</i>

34
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,235
<i>but off the rail comes Moonpie</i>
<i>and takes out four Madrid men.</i>

35
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,676
<i>The old swooper Moonpie</i>

36
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,509
<i>came right off the top of the rail</i>
<i>and took out four Madrid men.</i>

37
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,438
<i>The remaining Madrid skaters</i>
<i>defend the goal.</i>

38
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,030
<i>Jonathan still has the ball.</i>
<i>Moving in, he'll try to shoot.</i>

39
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,833
<i>He does! Jonathan!</i>
<i>He shoots and it's just wide.</i>

40
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,237
- Regroup!
- <i>The Houston team will have to regroup.</i>

41
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,797
<i>Injured on the play is Belmonte</i>
<i>and he's helped off the track for Madrid.</i>

42
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,799
<i>First period, no score, as we get set</i>
<i>for the firing of the second ball.</i>

43
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,195
<i>Oh, and he misses and it hits</i>
<i>the bike of Carter. Knocks Carter down.</i>

44
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,276
Gimme a hand. Move out!

45
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,035
<i>Jonathan is there. It is handed off.</i>
<i>The pass is complete to Jonathan.</i>

46
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,957
<i>- He knocks him down dead!</i>
- Did you see that?

47
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,470
<i>That should be a penalty.</i>
<i>The official looking over.</i>

48
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,434
Keep up!

49
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,199
- Moon, on your left.
- Right, right!

50
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,356
I got him!

51
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,556
Break it up, break it up!

52
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,511
Go, Jonathan, go!

53
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,154
<i>Can he give Houston the first goal?</i>
<i>He scores!</i>

54
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,633
Yeah!

55
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,113
<i>And at the end of the first period</i>
<i>Jonathan's goal gives Houston a 1-0 lead.</i>

56
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,315
<i>Scored by Jonathan E!</i>
<i>The time - first period, 12 minutes.</i>

57
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,829
<i>The ball is fired for the second period.</i>

58
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,795
<i>Madrid, trailing by one goal,</i>
<i>try to go on offence to tie the score.</i>

59
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,756
Go, Madrid!

60
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,436
- Here, latch on, latch on.
- I'm with you.

61
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,829
Come on, Madrid, come on!

62
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,953
<i>He skates up in front. Gonzales has it</i>
<i>for Madrid. Hands off again to Bodeus.</i>

63
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,473
<i>Bodeus, on offence for the Madrid team.</i>

64
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,352
<i>Here's the Houston defence.</i>

65
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,631
<i>It's a shot. It's low!</i>
<i>And down on the track goes Bodeus.</i>

66
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,911
<i>He's not injured,</i>
<i>but his scoring attempt failed.</i>

67
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,873
<i>And the score is still 1-0</i>
<i>in favour of Houston.</i>

68
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,629
<i>The ball is fired again.</i>
<i>Madrid is putting the pressure on.</i>

69
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,274
Move it! Come on, move!

70
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,436
Hold on. Come on, let's move it!

71
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,877
- We got it now.
- Hold on, hold on.

72
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,797
Watch it. Keep an eye out!

73
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,392
<i>Coming in now, Sanchez.</i>
<i>Moving to his left and right.</i>

74
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,910
<i>Has a full head of steam,</i>
<i>trying to tie the score.</i>

75
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,352
<i>Sanchez moves around the bike,</i>
<i>takes a long looping shot. He scores!</i>

76
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,314
<i>Sanchez scores for Madrid</i>
<i>and ties the game 1-1.</i>

77
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,429
<i>Second period.</i>

78
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,473
<i>The ball is in play again</i>
<i>and scooped up this time by Aston!</i>

79
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,272
Three minutes. Get off!

80
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,035
<i>Madrid penalty. Three minutes.</i>

81
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,949
<i>Biking misconduct on No. 1 biker.</i>

82
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,112
Are you satisfied, Madrid?
What game are you guys playing?

83
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,674
Take it easy. Relax, you'll be all right.

84
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,671
<i>The crowd's going wild, loving</i>
<i>this wide-open action in this game.</i>

85
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,439
Skate! Skate!
Come on, goddammit, skate!

86
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,274
<i>A pile-up on the track. The ball rolls free</i>
<i>and into the gutter. It's a dead ball.</i>

87
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,390
Here, here! Come on, come on!
Off the track, off the track!

88
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,476
Come on, move out!

89
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,719
How is it, Jonathan?

90
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,755
- Gimme a towel, will you, Bull?
- Sure.

91
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,436
Come on, Dune!

92
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,520
<i>Moonpie drop-kicks him!</i>

93
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,596
Three-minute penalty!

94
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,195
Off the track! Off the track!

95
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,797
Group up.

96
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,917
<i>Jumping over the Madrid defence,</i>
<i>gets up and he jams it in for the score!</i>

97
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,349
<i>Jonathan jams it in and scores</i>

98
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,199
<i>to give Houston a 2-1 lead over Madrid.</i>

99
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,272
- <i>Houston with the ball again.</i>
- It's a bike!

100
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,790
Stop him!

101
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,836
<i>Jonathan E has it. Jonathan</i>
<i>coming in low with a great manoeuvre.</i>

102
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,679
<i>He shoots, he scores!</i>

103
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,758
- I love this game, Moonpie! I love it.
- Yeah!

104
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,789
We got two games left.
Guess who we're playing first.

105
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,993
Tokyo! Who'd have thought
they'd make it to the play-off?

106
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
They're good.
They got the old samurai spirit.

107
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,509
Yeah, but they're all about this tall.

108
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,835
Two or three little things
make one big one.

109
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,997
They're liable to climb all over you
and eat your lunch!

110
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,033
I can't get on a man-to-man basis
with a Pygmy or an Oriental.

111
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,113
I don't know what it is.

112
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,680
You were fine tonight, all of you.

113
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,468
Mean! Sharp!

114
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,113
- You boys did well again.
- Thank you, Mr Bartholomew.

115
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,994
- And you, you rolled, you really rolled.
- Yeah.

116
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,317
You play like our champion here.
You take lessons from him?

117
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,749
No, we just give lessons
to the other team!

118
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,550
- How are you, Jonathan?
- I'm feelin' mean, Mr Bartholomew.

119
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,593
- It's good to see you.
- Jonathan E, that's the name.

120
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,992
Houston players come and go,
but the champion plays on.

121
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,357
The Energy Corporation has a hard time
figuring out ways to pay the champion.

122
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,278
We can't think up more rewards. You'd
like us to have that problem with you?

123
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,311
Yes, sir!

124
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,476
Like Jonathan, you play with abandon.

125
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,637
But this is Jonathan's season.

126
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,555
Every season seems to be
Jonathan's season.

127
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,073
But this year we've got you on
Multivision. A special show all about you.

128
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,590
No player ever had that before.

129
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,712
The whole world will be watching
because this is your year.

130
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,559
Howdy, babe!

131
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,637
- So, two games left.
- That's right, Mr Bartholomew.

132
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,716
New York in the final!

133
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,391
The team seems healthy.
The champion says he feels mean.

134
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,636
No problems here.

135
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,118
- What is this? Fruit juice?
- Very healthy, Mr Bartholomew!

136
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,437
Sweet dreams, Moonpie.

137
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,393
It's a bad habit you got there.

138
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,149
You know what that habit
will make you dream, Moonpie?

139
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,714
You'll dream you're an executive.

140
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,074
You'll have your hands
on all the controls

141
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,399
and you'll wear a grey suit
and you'll make decisions.

142
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,476
But you know what, Moonpie?

143
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,912
You know what those executives dream
about, out there behind their desks?

144
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,234
They dream they're great rollerballers.

145
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,951
They dream they're Jonathan.
They have muscles.

146
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,153
- They bash in faces.
- Yeah!

147
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,677
Ready to go.
Can't keep these boys here all night.

148
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,633
Jonathan, come and see me tomorrow.

149
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,393
Good night, Mr Bartholomew.

150
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,476
Ssh! Quiet, quiet.

151
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,115
This is a great team. A great city.

152
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,794
Great stuff out there tonight.

153
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,750
- Good morning. Brutal game last night.
- Thank you.

154
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,156
- So it's Tokyo in the semifinals?
- That's right.

155
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,433
Continue to hold the calls, all right?

156
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,313
Come in, Jonathan. Keep silence
with me for a minute, won't you?

157
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,911
It's important to have a place
to think things out.

158
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,113
You have your ranch.
I know you take a lot of pleasure in it.

159
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,394
I cut my finger.

160
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,476
Sorry. Here.

161
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,878
You've had an amazing career, Jonathan.

162
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,912
You know how proud we are
of the Houston team,

163
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,993
and what we think of you at Energy.

164
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,996
But now there are executives
who want you out.

165
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,555
Sir?

166
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,035
You've had <i>1</i>0 years
in this game, Jonathan.

167
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,390
Longer than anyone ever.

168
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,711
- Retire... How can I do that?
- On your special programme.

169
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,437
Some people feel this programme should
be used to announce your retirement.

170
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,195
Who wants that?

171
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,474
When this special was first planned by us
here at Energy, we saw it as a good thing.

172
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,075
Now the Executive Directorate
wants a change.

173
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,078
The programme is scheduled,
the world is waiting,

174
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,953
so this does seem the perfect time.

175
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,836
The team, they depend on me.

176
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,838
Jonathan, let's think this through together.

177
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,674
You know how the game serves us.

178
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,912
It has a definite social purpose.

179
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,271
Nations are bankrupt, gone.

180
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,517
None of that tribal warfare any more.

181
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,916
Even the corporate wars
are a thing of the past.

182
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,352
I know that...

183
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,472
So now we have the majors
and their executives.

184
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,592
Transport, food, communication,

185
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,473
housing, luxury, energy.

186
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,394
A few of us making decisions
on a global basis for the common good.

187
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,796
The team is a unit.
It plays with certain rhythms.

188
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,388
So does an executive team, Jonathan.

189
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,559
Now everyone has all the comforts,
you know that.

190
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,194
No poverty, no sickness.

191
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,835
No needs and many luxuries,

192
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,919
which you enjoy just as if
you were in the executive class.

193
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,750
Corporate society
takes care of everything.

194
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,874
And all it asks of anyone,
all it has ever asked of anyone ever,

195
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,675
is not to interfere
with management decisions.

196
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,510
I don't mean to resist.
I'm just tryin' to understand.

197
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,031
This is for your own benefit.
You must know that, Jonathan.

198
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,674
All decisions concerning you are.

199
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,672
Well, I lost Ella.

200
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,634
They took my wife
because an executive wanted her.

201
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,716
I won't review all that again.

202
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,513
That was before I took over.
I had nothing to do with it.

203
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,316
From what I hear
your wife wanted to leave herself.

204
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,469
So, now you're going to retire.

205
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,353
That shouldn't be too hard for you.

206
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,632
Stupid game, after all. Awful game.

207
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,069
You ought to be glad to be out of it.

208
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,116
I don't...

209
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,509
I don't know, Mr Bartholomew.
I just don't know.

210
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,915
I realise you had nothing to do with Ella.

211
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,679
- Jonathan, I...
- But...

212
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,676
You're right.

213
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,756
I mean, I oughta do...

214
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,628
- I oughta be happy to do what you say.
- Take your time.

215
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,035
Take a few days.

216
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,470
You've just come through a game.
You're tired.

217
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,718
Go to your ranch, but think about it.

218
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,559
And understand it.

219
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,035
Do understand it.

220
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,078
Because I don't understand
your resistance.

221
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
And I don't think anyone else will either.

222
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,996
- Is Clete here?
- In the training room.

223
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,112
I'll go say hello.

224
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,196
Jonathan?

225
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,634
Look what I got for breakfast.

226
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,433
It's a notice from the Corporation.

227
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,596
What's it say?

228
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,713
Oh, that I should get out of here.
You know, go away, vanish.

229
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,719
That kind of thing.
You know anything about that?

230
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,233
Yeah, I kinda heard something about it.

231
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,796
You knew it was comin'.

232
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,314
We've been together six months.

233
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,674
Didn't you even wanna say goodbye?

234
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,791
- We'll talk about it later, OK?
- You didn't, did you?

235
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,598
You didn't even want me here
when you got back.

236
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,438
I gotta go see Cletus.

237
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,473
- What do you want me to do now?
- I want you to take it easy.

238
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,638
I want you to go in
and fix us something to eat.

239
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,548
Clete's come a long way
and I'm hungry. All right?

240
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,189
Jonathan?

241
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,755
I'm glad you're all right.

242
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,355
Come on. All right, come on.

243
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,913
- I ain't tired enough.
- Yeah!

244
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,153
It caught you, didn't it, baby?
Two games running.

245
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,794
- What?
- You did that in the last two games.

246
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,038
Shoulder forward left.
You're standing on your left skate.

247
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,233
You do that in Tokyo, they'll take
your arm home for lunch. You with me?

248
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,200
OK. You practise that for me a little, huh?

249
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,071
Hell, I forget which corporation is which.

250
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,555
Any ass knows that fire's energy.

251
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,509
Who wrote the music?
Where does the music come from?

252
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,317
- OK if I have one of these?
- Go on, have a holiday.

253
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,438
I forget what corporation's
running what city.

254
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,237
Chicago's still the Food City,

255
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,433
but what about Indianapolis?
Whatever happened to that town?

256
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,233
Whatever happened to Mackie?

257
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,478
Everything was much simpler when
I was a kid. We still had three nations.

258
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,750
That was before the corporate wars,
even before rollerball. Before everything.

259
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,552
Do you believe in kids?

260
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,435
I remember hearing about the National
Football League and the World Cup.

261
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,518
- Where are you going?
- Indianapolis.

262
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,438
What do you know about that stuff, Clete?

263
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,072
You know, how the corporations
got started, about the corporate wars.

264
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,509
They were nasty!

265
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,030
- Well, nobody talks about that.
- Well, except for friends.

266
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,116
Yeah.

267
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,708
I remember your rookie year.

268
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,436
You were mean and tight.
The best player I ever coached.

269
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,791
Nobody could lay a hand on you
that year. Remember?

270
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,717
Yeah.

271
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,796
Look, I gotta ask you something.

272
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,480
That figures. Go ahead, I'm listening.

273
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,354
Well, there's something
goin' on with the game.

274
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,599
I don't know what it is.
I don't think I'm supposed to know.

275
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,190
- What's that?
- They want me to quit.

276
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,713
Why would they want you to do that?

277
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,989
I don't know.
That's what I'd like you to find out.

278
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,798
I can try.

279
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,595
I hear just about everything going on
in the game, one way or another.

280
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,555
That's what I mean. I can't think of
another executive who'd tell me a thing.

281
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,876
Like I say,

282
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,117
I'll try.

283
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,678
- But I don't think there's much...
- Look, no troubles for either of us, Clete.

284
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,030
Just find out what you can.

285
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,920
Trust me, Jonathan. You know you can.

286
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,793
Sure.

287
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,916
Well, sit down.

288
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,792
Oh, yeah!

289
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,116
Thanks, boys.

290
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,236
Good show, Johnny.

291
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,120
That's the Houston stride.

292
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,231
You boys wanna play for Houston,
you'll have to learn it.

293
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,273
We pride ourselves
on bein' a power team.

294
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,709
- That's right.
- We're power, we're mean.

295
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,070
And that doesn't mean to say we like to
have you hangin' back there on a rail,

296
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,557
just fightin' somebody in section A,
when you should be in section B.

297
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,399
I'm comin' up to score
and you ain't in the section,

298
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,511
- it won't do us no good.
- That's right.

299
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,916
Who's the two new catchers here?

300
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,474
Right. Gimme that ball.

301
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,229
Don't stick your hand
in that gutter too quick.

302
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,749
Wait till this ball
comes down on the track.

303
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,276
Don't get too anxious.
That thing'll take your arm off.

304
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,038
Now the bikers.

305
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,235
A biker might sacrifice
a little three-minute penalty,

306
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,230
run over the top of a skater,
if he feels he's skating a little too good.

307
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,632
So we have a few methods
here in Houston. There's hundreds.

308
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,719
One, of course, is to use this shield.
Use your pads. Use what you got.

309
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,637
Drive that arm in there.

310
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,275
Keep your feet forward.
Hit, move, you get away from the wreck.

311
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,597
Don't come across in here.
You get all twisted.

312
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,349
Or if a biker's sittin' up nice and high -
a lot of guys like to ride high -

313
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,153
drag one off in midair. I hurt you, Blue?

314
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,396
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.

315
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,752
Now a third method, and the one
perfected by a little friend of mine,

316
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,599
the swoop.

317
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,076
The swooper, that's me!

318
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,634
Hang up on the rail,
use the speed of the track,

319
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,910
come down and drop-kick a biker.

320
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,716
Say, excuse me.

321
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,317
You're not paying a whole lot
of attention, are you?

322
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,719
- What's this dude's name?
- That's our new speedball from Manila.

323
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,751
Yeah, you know. That's Toughie.

324
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,596
Come on up, Tough.

325
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,194
Oh, he's a big honker.

326
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,799
Say, why don't you do
me and the boys a favour?

327
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,832
Since you know all there is to know,
we'd appreciate it.

328
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,191
Why not give us a demonstration?
Show us how you made that big rep.

329
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,993
Just skate around
and just take me out, huh?

330
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,156
Go get him, Toughie.

331
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,108
Now, eyes. Use 'em.

332
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,473
Don't lock your eyes in one spot. This
game isn't all muscle. Use your head.

333
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,273
Lock your eyes on the target and keep...

334
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,793
Ears. Now, they're real important, too.

335
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,679
If there's anything I love,
it's luxury centres.

336
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,709
When I get my privilege card,
I know what I'm gonna get me, too.

337
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,078
- A secretary.
- What for?

338
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,350
You planning on becoming an executive?

339
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,040
I just need one. About this tall.

340
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,515
Yeah? Why don't you give it a rest?

341
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,477
- Can I help you, please?
- Yeah. I tried to order some books

342
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,637
and they said I had to appear
at the centre personally.

343
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,753
That's right, this is our circulation unit.
Make your choice here or by catalogue.

344
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,839
There must be a mistake.
These books are classified.

345
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,679
They have been transcribed
and summarised.

346
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,236
- Who summarises them?
- I suppose the computers do.

347
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,996
- What do you need books for?
- I wanna study up on some things.

348
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,590
You could go to the computer centre
where the real librarians are.

349
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,759
But we have all the edited versions here.
Anything I think you'd want.

350
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,191
Let's see, then. This is not a library
and you're really not a librarian.

351
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,399
I'm only a clerk, that's right.
I'm sorry, really.

352
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,991
The books are really in computer banks
being summarised? Where is that?

353
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,111
There's a computer bank in Washington.

354
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,471
The biggest is in Geneva.
That's a nice place to visit.

355
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,717
- I guess that's where the books are now.
- Thank you.

356
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,830
It's not that exactly.

357
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,951
Yeah, but books, Jonathan?

358
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,550
Anything you wanna know,
you could hire a corporate teacher.

359
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,229
You could call somebody up,
use your privilege card.

360
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,113
I can't. That's just it.

361
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,119
I think there's something goin' on.
Somebody's pushin' me.

362
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,470
Who? Bartholomew?

363
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,231
But you're Jonathan E. Everybody
knows you. You've got everything!

364
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,519
You know you'll be treated right.
You always have been.

365
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,276
Yeah. I don't know.

366
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,198
Well, I do know. We're livin' good.
You know we are.

367
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,709
I found this to wear.

368
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,636
Is it all right?

369
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,275
That's the uniform of the house.

370
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,949
I'm Daphne.

371
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,795
Yeah. That figures.

372
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,396
It's all right.

373
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,275
Here. Wear these, too.

374
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,995
That's right. No penalties.
Limited substitutions.

375
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,032
You can handle it! You can beat Tokyo!

376
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,118
All we gotta do is change our tactics.

377
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,834
There's always been rule changes.
You know that!

378
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,272
It gets more people to watch the game,
that's all there is to it.

379
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,439
You all signed contracts to finish the
season, no matter what the alterations.

380
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,235
- Every last one of you signed.
- See, now we all signed a contract.

381
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,798
It doesn't matter! We're not gonna lose,
no matter how they change the game.

382
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,593
That's right. That's right.

383
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,109
All it means is a change of strategy.

384
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,834
We knock out their bikers early,
then their skaters.

385
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,838
Don't try to score yourselves
and the game's yours.

386
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,475
Watch yourselves out there!
They're playing the same rules we are.

387
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,479
It's gonna be rough.
But it's still basically the same game.

388
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,353
And the team with the power wins.

389
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,755
That's easy to say, man!

390
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,313
Hey, Rusty.

391
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,271
Hey! Wait a minute.

392
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,879
Hey, Rusty, come on.

393
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,073
Listen, you were talking
about them contracts.

394
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,956
How come everyone else has got
to play with the no-penalty rule

395
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,913
and they're pressuring me to quit?

396
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,916
I don't know.

397
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,352
But can't you do what you're told?
For your own good, get out!

398
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,632
I don't wanna leave the guys to play
Tokyo with the rules breakin' down.

399
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,878
Jonathan, it doesn't matter
what you want!

400
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,749
You think about that.

401
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,391
<i>These are in slow motion to show</i>
<i>the impact of your blows on opponents.</i>

402
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,709
- <i>Yeah, fine.</i>
- We want you to approve the sequences.

403
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,796
<i>It's...</i>

404
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,356
<i>It's all fine with me. Anything.</i>

405
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,639
I really don't see why I'm needed here.

406
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,672
<i>Well, the Energy people</i>
<i>want you to be satisfied.</i>

407
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,473
<i>There, now. Isn't that a marvellous shot?</i>

408
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,795
Sure.

409
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,071
<i>I'm a stat freak myself.</i>
<i>Isn't that perverse?</i>

410
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,350
Have you got anything I can take?

411
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,556
Just take one.

412
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,149
Statistics, huh?

413
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,068
<i>Yes. The greatest number of points</i>
<i>scored in a single game - 18.</i>

414
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,716
<i>The highest velocity of a ball when</i>
<i>actually fielded by a skater - 120mph.</i>

415
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,717
<i>Most deaths...</i>

416
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,795
<i>Please.</i>

417
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,239
<i>Don't do that.</i>

418
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,838
Most deaths - <i>9</i>. Rome versus Pittsburgh,
December last year.

419
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,830
The greatest number of players put out of
action by a single player in a game - <i>13</i>.

420
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,637
<i>A world record,</i>
<i>courtesy of your dear self.</i>

421
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,752
<i>There have been studies</i>
<i>of stat freaks in rollerball.</i>

422
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,316
<i>Some go to the track, but they never</i>
<i>take their eyes off the big board.</i>

423
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,351
What's this?

424
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,109
<i>I always wonder if a rollerball player</i>
<i>sees himself as a class apart.</i>

425
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,950
"Hello... pause."

426
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,792
"I'm Jonathan E... smile."

427
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,476
"I would like..." This for me?

428
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,316
<i>Very astute. Yes.</i>
<i>It's your retirement announcement.</i>

429
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,511
<i>Your special is already</i>
<i>scheduled all over the world.</i>

430
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,438
<i>You're supposed to read this</i>
<i>as part of the programme.</i>

431
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,631
- What sort of pill did you give me?
- Pure aphrodisiac, Daph. Enjoy yourself.

432
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,479
<i>Can't we finish up here and go home?</i>

433
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,795
You are being recorded.

434
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,229
- Feelin' woozy?
- <i>Try to read the announcement.</i>

435
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,316
I'm all right.

436
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,036
Why don't you read the...?

437
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,233
- Oh, yeah. You want that, do you?
- <i>You are making things very...</i>

438
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,557
How many assignments
you been on, Daph?

439
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,756
You're good at what you're good at,
so you must have been around some.

440
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,394
A lot of girls have stayed with me,
but you know that. Never seemed to mind.

441
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,559
But odd thoughts I've had
about you, Daph. Odd thoughts.

442
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,351
- Wondered if you'd been briefed on me.
- <i>I'll ask you to read...</i>

443
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,234
Yeah, a lot of things occur to me, Daph.
A lot of things occur to you?

444
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,475
You look terrible.

445
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,194
You do look terrible.

446
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,276
Come on.

447
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,352
You shouldn't take anything
offered to you just like that.

448
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,870
- What was in it?
- Nothin' to hurt you.

449
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,230
You're too trustin'. Ever think of that?

450
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,119
Hook 'em deep now!

451
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,718
They're good boys,
but they're a bit rough.

452
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,192
As you know,
the Tokyo game is coming up.

453
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,792
You will remember that the Tokyo team
uses karate and hapkido techniques.

454
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,591
We will review these techniques
with special attention to deathblows.

455
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,711
Same lecture every year!

456
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,674
There are certain body areas that skilled
opponents will endeavour to strike.

457
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,032
What we got for our skilled opponents
is the Houston fist-in-the-face technique!

458
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,829
Especially in a game with no penalties...

459
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,272
You gotta get mad, all right? Play hard.
It don't matter if they're all tiny little men.

460
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,279
Especially in a game with no penalties
and limited substitutions.

461
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,119
Get mad and fly!

462
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,195
Please...

463
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,189
I know about certain body areas, too.
We gotta hit those guys in the ganglia.

464
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,396
- Where?
- In the ganglia.

465
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,636
That's a mess of nerves under the ear.

466
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,639
You gotta drive the jawbone up in that
mess of nerves and it rings a bell.

467
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,991
You must understand.

468
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,152
The Tokyo team has
a very eccentric playing style.

469
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,829
And no penalties! If I go down,
I know my team is with me, right?

470
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,916
- Please...
- Brute speed!

471
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,350
Familiarise yourself with
the basic fighting-art techniques.

472
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,789
Nobody's gonna take us, rules or no rules!

473
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,753
- Go on.
- This is the Houston team!

474
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,594
- Rules or no rules.
- We fight for each other.

475
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,950
They're really quite beautiful,
in a wild kind of way.

476
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,078
- I can almost smell the lions.
- Don't be silly. They're made in Detroit.

477
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,555
They're android. They're all programmed.

478
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,069
That's right.
The game is played by robots.

479
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,634
They look like men and they bleed!

480
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,035
Not so loud. They'll hear you.

481
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,078
It'll ensure stability, expansion
and profits for the planetary enterprise.

482
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,159
- What do you think about that?
- You make it sound absolutely romantic.

483
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,477
He's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

484
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,434
I know, but he's so intelligent.
I'm practically living on bright pills.

485
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,879
Hey, here he is.

486
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,151
Hey, Johnny boy! Hey, kid!

487
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,874
Come on, let's hear it. Come on!

488
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,314
- Gimme a hand. I got too much here.
- Behave yourself.

489
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,516
Hello, Mackie.

490
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,031
Well, how you been?

491
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,790
It's your night tonight, Jonathan.

492
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,675
You having a good time?

493
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,996
I'm glad you're here.

494
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,475
I'm here with an executive.

495
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,355
He asked all about you.

496
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,594
Wanted to know if I enjoyed you.

497
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,070
Hey, Rockie! Give her your hand.

498
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,633
It's too much!

499
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,517
- What about the new game?
- I haven't heard much about it.

500
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,074
The rule changes
were announced a week ago.

501
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,668
- Who changed them?
- I've been tryin' to find out.

502
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,995
Rules or no rules, it's still the same game.

503
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,557
- I'm looking forward to the programme.
- When you see that screen replay...

504
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,076
- Did you hear about Evans?
- What?

505
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,193
- He's out. Gone.
- No kidding!

506
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,880
The old man? Who got him?

507
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,273
- What?
- I said who got him?

508
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,356
The crocodile.

509
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,149
Do you like poetry?

510
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,400
Why don't you come upstairs?
I got a poem for you.

511
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,354
<i>Welcome, sports enthusiasts everywhere.</i>

512
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,474
<i>Tonight Multivision trains its cameras</i>
<i>on the amazing career of Jonathan E.</i>

513
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,878
<i>As Houston began to mould itself</i>
<i>into a world championship team,</i>

514
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,072
- <i>the attacking style of Jonathan E...</i>
- Jonathan, you're on!

515
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,078
<i>... has always been</i>
<i>the team's strongest asset.</i>

516
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,556
<i>Yes, the game seems invented for him.</i>

517
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,478
Look, I talked to everybody I could.

518
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,672
There is something going on.
You're right about that.

519
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,792
Nobody will talk about it, I mean nobody!

520
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,037
It's hard finding anything out, Jonathan.
You know that.

521
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,551
Hell, nobody even knows the names
of the men on the directorate any more.

522
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,550
Look, I'm sorry.

523
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,315
- They want you out, you know that.
- Yeah.

524
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,908
But do you know who they are?

525
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,195
Bartholomew, I guess.

526
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,074
Above Bartholomew.
It's the Executive Directorate.

527
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,874
- Why would they worry about me?
- Well, they do.

528
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,869
They're even after the old man because
he didn't get your retirement announced.

529
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,878
- Why put the programme on without it?
- I think they had to.

530
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,550
They didn't want to. It's very tricky.

531
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,116
Jonathan,
there's one thing you ought to know.

532
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,388
Look, nobody's said it, but I'm sure of it.

533
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,275
They're afraid of you, Jonathan.

534
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,873
All the way to the top, they are.

535
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,074
What are they afraid of me for?

536
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,035
Don't go yet.
We're showing some replays.

537
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,555
Let's see 'em then!

538
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,989
Mr Bartholomew would like
to see you now. He's in the study.

539
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,593
Come on, hurry up!

540
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,630
You know I've always considered
your situation, Jonathan,

541
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,910
and your needs.

542
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,600
Now you have to consider mine

543
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,958
- and ours.
- I'm considering it, Mr Bartholomew.

544
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,152
No player is greater than the game itself.

545
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,748
It's a significant game
in a number of ways.

546
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,555
The velocities of the ball,
the awful physics of the track.

547
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,799
And in the middle of it all,
men playing by an odd set of rules.

548
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,399
It's not a game a man is supposed
to grow strong in, Jonathan.

549
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,876
- You appreciate that, don't you?
- More and more, Mr Bartholomew.

550
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,190
Shoot that statue!
That's the one! Shoot that!

551
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,836
Hey, the tree!

552
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,796
You must take good advice.

553
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,549
You're not to play against Tokyo.
You're not to play again.

554
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,595
- I want some concessions.
- Concessions?

555
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,873
Believe me, I'd be happy to talk
a deal, Jonathan. I love deals.

556
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,356
But this situation is much, much simpler.

557
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,597
This Multivision event tonight
was very embarrassing.

558
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,076
For me and for others.

559
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,310
It might be I won't ever find out
why I've been asked to leave the game,

560
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,228
but I do know I can get
some concessions and I want 'em.

561
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,671
You missed!

562
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,991
I wanna see Ella - my wife.
Arrange it so I can see her again.

563
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,792
That's not easy, Jonathan.

564
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,912
I want other concessions, too,
Mr Bartholomew.
