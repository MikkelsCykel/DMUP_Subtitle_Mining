1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:02,117
I never thought of that.

2
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:04,165
Since you may not die,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,965
While we most assuredly will...

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,167
There must be a reason for that, no?

5
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:11,034
Perhaps you are an expert.

6
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,967
Uh, that's it, mr.
Oldman. Have a good one.

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,700
Thank you. You too.

8
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,533
Or are you a vampire, john?

9
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,300
Even an unknowing one.

10
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:28,032
Do you stand alive and tall

11
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,200
In a graveyard that you helped to fill?

12
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:31,698
Dan: that's going too far.

13
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:34,633
Bored, perhaps lonely,
because your heart

14
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,684
Cannot keep its treasures.

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,700
Is that what you're doing?

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,067
Have you led a wrongful life?

17
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:45,167
Well, then, perhaps...

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,100
It is time to die.

19
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,099
Wait a minute, now.

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,099
Look, i don't know what john is doing,

21
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:55,565
But i sure as hell don't
like what you're doing.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,034
Give me that gun or i'm
gonna break your goddamn arm.

23
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,367
You sound like our football coach, dan.

24
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,334
What do you think, john?

25
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,299
A shot to the arm?

26
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:08,234
Perhaps we could watch it heal.

27
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,417
A bullet in the head-

28
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,566
What exactly will happen?

29
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,698
I have papers to correct.

30
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,450
As much as i dislike that job,

31
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:26,167
It'll be preferable to this.

32
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,833
I leave you with it.

33
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,466
Jesus christ.

34
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,434
What the hell was that all about?

35
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,732
Where'd he get a gun?

36
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,350
He had you on the ropes, john.

37
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:40,933
Are you really so damn smart?

38
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,300
It's not like will.

39
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,000
Mary passed away yesterday.

40
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,732
Who?

41
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,167
His wife.

42
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:55,367
She had, uh, pancreatic cancer.

43
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,334
Will!

44
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:01,665
I didn't know about mary.

45
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm sorry. I can see how
this might have hit you.

46
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:09,034
Please, permit me to
be infantile by myself.

47
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,367
Will, please.

48
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,816
What the hell were you thinking, art?

49
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:31,666
Oh, come on. Something had to be done.

50
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,084
I have to say i agree.

51
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,432
And he's our friend.

52
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,700
Whatever else on earth is going on,

53
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:37,801
He's our friend!

54
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:38,832
You sure about that?

55
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,432
Why are you being so hard on him?

56
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:43,167
One of my favorite
people has disappeared.

57
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:46,534
Can you get alzheimer's at 35?

58
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:49,867
Maybe i'm trying to wake him up.

59
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:53,501
Maybe i'm too sad to cry.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,767
What i said about myself hurt him.

61
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:03,165
He struck back expertly-

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,966
That stuff about stealing life forces?

63
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,733
I've always wondered about the reasons.

64
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,401
Well, we still have an
afternoon to kill, right?

65
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,300
Charades?

66
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,698
No. John?

67
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,401
I have a charade, and
it is just for you.

68
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:30,432
Sandy, come here.

69
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,117
Come on, come on, come on.

70
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:33,767
Okay, this one's for you.

71
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:35,732
Ready?

72
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,250
Ooh!

73
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:49,732
Uhn.

74
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,383
My first wedding?

75
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:52,926
There you go.

76
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,399
There you go!

77
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,134
Very good, and i bet at least one of us

78
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,299
Is your direct descendent.

79
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,400
And i didn't even send a christmas card.

80
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:02,601
Christmas card? What
about a birthday card?

81
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:04,767
And don't even get me
started on the candles...

82
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,767
With the blowing and the

83
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:08,666
For years with the blowing.

84
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,665
Yeah, all right. I tried.

85
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,967
Well, uh, call me underdeveloped,

86
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,334
But i'd like to hear more.

87
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:21,883
Me too.

88
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,165
More.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,566
You double-Damn swear
this isn't some cockamamie

90
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,767
Science fiction story or...

91
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,134
You're pulling on us?

92
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,631
Next question.

93
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,000
You-You-You
realize

94
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:34,299
This is an invitation

95
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,501
To men in white suits with happy pills.

96
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,531
Dan: think about it-

97
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,401
A mechanism allowing survival

98
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:40,765
For thousands of years?

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,032
Run out of room even faster.

100
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,334
Then we'd have to go to mars as a colony

101
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,234
As we expanded, as we'd have to.

102
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:49,165
I'd like that.

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,167
On a planet of another star.

104
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,032
I envy you.

105
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,399
Did you have a pet dinosaur?

106
00:04:55,434 --> 00:04:57,800
They were a little bit before my time.

107
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,032
At least something is.

108
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,134
No doubt you could give us
a thousand details, john,

109
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,199
Corroborating your story,

110
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,700
From the magdalene to the buddha to now.

111
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:06,865
Ten thousand,

112
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,501
And you could stay out of the books.

113
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:10,965
Oh, it's getting chilly.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
Here, come over here. Join me.

115
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:19,200
That, uh, raises an
interesting question, john.

116
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,698
Could there be others like you

117
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,933
Who escaped the aging
process as you have?

118
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:24,317
Representing something terrific

119
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:25,666
We don't even know about biology.

120
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,934
We're learning all the time.

121
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,132
Yeah, but how would he know?

122
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,200
He doesn't wear an i. D. Badge
saying "yabba dabba doo. "

123
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:33,851
There was a man in the 1600s.

124
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:36,432
Where were you in 1292 a. D.?

125
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:39,067
Where were you a year ago on this date?

126
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,501
Anyway, it was the
1600s, and i met a man,

127
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:47,234
And i had a hunch that he was...

128
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,165
Like me, so i told him.

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,967
Ah. See, you said this was a first.

130
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:53,965
I forgot.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,867
A crack in your story, john?

132
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,901
A touch of senility.

133
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,865
Anyway, he said yes,

134
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
But from another time, another place.

135
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,432
We talked for two days.

136
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,434
It was all pretty convincing,

137
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,698
But we couldn't be sure.

138
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,000
We each confirmed what the other said,

139
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,267
But how do we know if the confirmation

140
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,067
Was genuine or an echo?

141
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:15,798
I knew i was kosher,

142
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,733
But i thought, "maybe he's
playing a game on me. "

143
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:23,132
You know, a scholar
of all we spoke about.

144
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,200
He said he was inclined
with the same reservation.

145
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:27,432
Now, that's interesting.

146
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,633
Just as we can never be sure,

147
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:31,217
Even if we wanted to-

148
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:32,732
I mean, if we were sure,

149
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,432
You couldn't be sure of that.

150
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,566
We parted, agreeing to keep in touch-

151
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,999
Of course, we didn't-

152
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:40,501
And 200 years later i thought i saw him

153
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:42,767
In a train station in brussels.

154
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,334
Lost him in the crowd.

155
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,498
Oh, what a shame.

156
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,333
I
- I mean, if it were true.

157
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:50,099
Okay, here's one for you.

158
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:52,434
What do you do in your spare time?

159
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,698
Every 50 years or so,

160
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,598
When i wanna get away from the rush,

161
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,017
I go down to a primitive
tribe in new guinea

162
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,401
Where i'm worshipped as an immortal god,

163
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:03,800
And they have a huge statue of me.

164
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:04,999
It's a big party.

165
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, i've got a lot of pictures of it,

166
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,932
But i've already packed
them up. I'm sorry.

167
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:12,700
I won't make the obvious nasty
crack about more unwashed cavemen.

168
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:14,065
Actually, bathing was the style

169
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,967
Until the middle ages
when the church told us

170
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,833
It was sinful to wash away god's dirt,

171
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:20,065
So people were sewn

172
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,750
Into their underwear in october

173
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,492
And they popped out in april.

174
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,200
You said you just happened.

175
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,067
I don't believe that.

176
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:28,865
If your story's true,

177
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,816
Why did god allow you to happen?

178
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,733
That makes an interesting point.

179
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,399
Are you religious, john?

180
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,967
I don't follow a known religion. No.

181
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:40,032
Ever.

182
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,350
Long time ago i did,

183
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:44,598
Like most people.

184
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,434
Some just never get over it.

185
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,833
Do you believe in god?

186
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,698
As laplace said,

187
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,367
"I have no need of that hypothesis. "

188
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:54,898
He may be around, though.

189
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,583
He's everywhere. We just can't see him.

190
00:07:57,618 --> 00:08:00,234
Pfft. If this was the best i could do,

191
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:01,784
I'd be hiding, too.

192
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,265
And creation...

193
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,633
It's here-I'm not so
sure it was created.

194
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:06,965
Edith: what then?

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,566
Maybe it's just accumulated,
fields affecting fields.

196
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:13,234
What about the source
of the field energies?

197
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,199
Wouldn't that imply a prime mover?

198
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,332
I'd wonder about the
source of the prime mover,

199
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:20,566
Infinite regress, but that
doesn't imply anything to me.

200
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,332
Back to the mystery.

201
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,399
It's a very old question,

202
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:28,300
But there's no answer
except in religious terms.

203
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:31,032
If you have faith, it's answered.

204
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:34,501
Did you ever meet any person
from our religious history?

205
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:36,566
A biblical figure?

206
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,900
In a way.

207
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,598
Who?

208
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,099
We should skip this one.

209
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:42,833
No, no, no skipping. Come on.

210
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,084
Next question.

211
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,493
No, come on!

212
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:48,132
Come on, spit it out!

213
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,798
Good lord! You were one of them!

214
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,467
This is going in a direction
that i-I didn't expect.

215
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:56,684
I hoped it wouldn't
- We... call it a night.

216
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,867
Come on! You were someone
in religious history?

217
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:01,099
Yes.

218
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:02,666
In the bible?

219
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:03,631
Yes.

220
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,698
Someone we know?

221
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,767
How could we not know
someone in the bible?

222
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,234
I mean somebody important.

223
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:09,666
You may think you know him,

224
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,199
But it's mostly myth.

225
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:14,583
The entire bible is
mostly myth and allegory

226
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:17,933
With maybe some basis
in historical events.

227
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:22,267
You were part of that history?

228
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:23,367
Yes.

229
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,732
Moses.

230
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:29,600
Moses was based on misis, a syrian myth,

231
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,467
And there are earlier versions-

232
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,265
All found floating on water,

233
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,833
The staff that changed to a snake,

234
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,367
Waters that were parted so followers

235
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:39,934
Could be led to freedom

236
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:41,432
And even receive laws

237
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,034
On stone or wooden tablets.

238
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:45,932
One of the apostles.

239
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,383
They weren't really apostles.

240
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,765
They didn't do any real teaching.

241
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,100
Peter the fisherman learned
a little more about fishing.

242
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,134
How do you know that?

243
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:01,533
The mythical overlay is so enormous...

244
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,965
And not good.

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,165
The truth is so, so simple.

246
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,900
The new testament in 100
words or less: you ready?

247
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:16,501
I don't think i wanna hear this.

248
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,032
Harry, will you take me home?

249
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,898
No, not right now. I
do want to hear this.

250
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,300
Sit down, edith. You
act like you believe him.

251
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,698
It's sacrilege.

252
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:24,932
How can it be sacrilege?

253
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,065
He hasn't said anything yet.

254
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,717
The new new testament is sacrilege.

255
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:31,609
There are a dozen new new testaments,

256
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,467
From hebrew to greek
to latin to tyndale,

257
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:36,300
All the way to king james,

258
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,631
All revisionist,

259
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,898
And all called revealed truth.

260
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:43,099
I mean a new new testament in 100 words.

261
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,434
I can give you the ten
commandments in ten words:

262
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:46,999
Don't. Don't, don't, don't,

263
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:48,833
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

264
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:50,432
don't.

265
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:53,533
The commandments are just modern
updates of more ancient laws.

266
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,366
Hammurabi's code.

267
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,900
That's right, they
weren't the first, right?

268
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:00,867
Edith, i was raised on the torah...

269
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:02,332
My wife, on the koran.

270
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,000
My oldest son is an atheist.

271
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,850
My youngest is a scientologist.

272
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:07,631
My daughter is studying hinduism.

273
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,900
I imagine that there is room there
for a holy war in my living room,

274
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,100
But we practice live and let live.

275
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:16,867
Why don't you sit down.

276
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,900
What is your preferred
version of the bible?

277
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,366
The king james, of course.

278
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,867
It's the most modern, the
work of great scholars.

279
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:32,367
Modern is good.

280
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,401
All right, john, hit
us with the short form.

281
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,467
Guy met the buddha, liked what he heard,

282
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,301
Thought about it for a while-

283
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,100
Say 500 years, while he returned

284
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,101
To the mediterranean,

285
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:48,032
Became an etruscan.

286
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,784
Seeped into the roman empire.

287
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,501
He didn't like what they became-

288
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,732
A giant killing machine.

289
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,466
He went to the near east thinking,

290
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:58,767
"Why not pass the buddha's
teachings on in a modern form. "

291
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,999
So he tried.

292
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,200
One dissident against rome?

293
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:04,366
Rome won.

294
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:05,765
The rest is history.

295
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,267
Well, sort of. Lot of
fairy tales mixed in.

296
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,065
I knew it.

297
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,033
He's saying he was christ.

298
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,932
Oh, no. That's the medal

299
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,300
They pinned on jesus
to fulfill prophecy.

300
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:20,498
The crucifixion.

301
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,533
He blocked the pain
as he had learned to do

302
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,898
In tibet and india.

303
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,299
He also learned to
slow his body processes

304
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,933
Down to the point where
they were undetectable.

305
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:31,367
They thought he was dead.

306
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:32,732
So his followers pulled him

307
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,065
From the cross, placed him in a cave...

308
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,733
His body normalized as
he had trained it to...

309
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,466
He attempted to go away undetected,

310
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,933
But some devotees were standing watch.

311
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,817
Tried to explain.

312
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,232
They were ecstatic.

313
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,732
Thus, i was resurrected,

314
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,783
And i ascended to central europe

315
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:56,765
To get away as far as possible.

316
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,267
You don't mean a word of this, john.

317
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:01,267
My god, why are you doing this?

318
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,833
Let me see your wrists.

319
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,299
I don't scar.

320
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:05,965
Besides, they tied me...

321
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,167
But nails and blood make
better religious art.

322
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,334
all the
speculations about jesus.

323
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,099
He was black, he was asian,

324
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:16,617
He was a blue-Eyed
aryan with a golden beard

325
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:19,065
And hair straight out
of vidal sassoon's,

326
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,267
He was a benevolent alien,
he never existed at all.

327
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,399
Now he's a caveman.

328
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:27,533
The christ figure goes all
the way back to krishna-

329
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:28,617
Hercules, of course.

330
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:29,631
Harry: hercules?

331
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,333
Born of a virgin, alcmene.

332
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:35,000
A god for a father, zeus.

333
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:37,631
The only begotten.

334
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,232
<i>The savior
- The greek? Soter.</i>

335
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,399
The good shepherd, the prince of peace,

336
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,967
Bringing gentle persuasion
and divine wisdom.

337
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:47,801
He died, joined his father on olympus

338
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:50,565
A thousand years before gethsemane.

339
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,467
How can you compare pagan
mythology to the true word?

340
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:57,034
Pretty damn closely, i'd say.

341
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,531
The early christian leaders,

342
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,466
They threw away hebrew manuscripts

343
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,401
And borrowed from pagan
sources all over the place.

344
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:07,032
Do you realize how...

345
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,299
Inconsiderately you're
treating my feelings?

346
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:12,833
About as inconsiderately
as we're treating john's.

347
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,099
Well, he doesn't
believe what he's saying!

348
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:17,700
Sandy: do you believe literally
everything in the bible, edith?

349
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:18,832
Yes!

350
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,232
Before you say it,

351
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,933
I know it's undergone a lot of changes,

352
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:25,434
But god has spoken through man

353
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:27,466
To make his word clearer.

354
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,898
He couldn't get it right the first time?

355
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:33,133
We're imperfect! He had to
work to make us understand.

356
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:36,299
<i>He couldn't get us right
the first time, edith?</i>

357
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,134
Dan: taken alone, the
philosophical teachings of jesus

358
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,265
Are buddhism with a hebrew accent-

359
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,067
Kindness, tolerance, brotherhood, love,

360
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:46,765
A ruthless realism acknowledging

361
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,034
That life is as it is here
on earth, here and now.

362
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,168
The kingdom of god, meaning goodness,

363
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:56,267
Is right here, where it should be.

364
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,366
"I am what i am becoming. "

365
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,967
That's what the buddha brought in.

366
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:01,366
And that's what i taught.

367
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,367
But a talking snake
make a lady eat an apple,

368
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:05,498
So we're screwed.

369
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,065
Heaven and hell were peddled

370
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,350
So priests could rule
through seduction and terror,

371
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:13,600
Save our souls that we never
lost in the first place.

372
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:15,232
I threw a clean pass...

373
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:17,367
They ran it out of the ballpark.

374
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:20,099
This is blasphemy.

375
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:22,950
It's horrible! Who else were you?

376
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:25,275
Solomon, elvis, jack the ripper?

377
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,388
It's been said that buddha and jesus

378
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:29,467
Would laugh or cry if they'd known

379
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,898
What was done in their name.

380
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,733
Harry: and if there is a creator,

381
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:35,617
He'd probably feel the same way.

382
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:38,226
I see ceremony, ritual, processions,

383
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,930
Genuflecting, moaning, intoning,

384
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:43,600
Venerating cookies and wine,

385
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:45,366
And i think...

386
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,767
It's not what i had in mind.

387
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,099
But that's vatican flapdoodle.

388
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:50,600
It doesn't have a thing to do with god.

389
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,784
As you said, john,
everywhere, religions...

390
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,933
From exalting life to
purging joy as a sin.

391
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,600
Rome does it as grand opera.

392
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:02,666
A simple path to goodness needs

393
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,633
A supernatural roadmap.

394
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:06,765
Supernatural...

395
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,432
A stupid word, i mean...

396
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,367
Anything that happens,
happens within nature,

397
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:13,501
Whether we believe in it or not.

398
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:15,600
Like a 14,000-
Year-Old caveman.

399
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:26,583
I- I-I drove
for a while,

400
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,733
And then i sat for a while.

401
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,132
I'm so ashamed.

402
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,867
and i'm freezing.

403
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:33,132
Well, come inside.

404
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,300
I still don't believe you, of course.

405
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:36,332
You need help.

406
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:37,366
Everybody needs help.

407
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,467
Yes, well, some more than others.

408
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,631
From the buddha to the cross,

409
00:16:55,666 --> 00:17:00,334
I have always imagined
both as entirely mythic-

410
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,732
But i would like to hear more.

411
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:05,433
May i lie on the couch for a moment?

412
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:08,100
I'm not as young as i used to be.

413
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,832
Ohh!

414
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:17,999
So, you were jesus.

415
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:21,134
Well, perhaps somebody had to
be, for better or for worse.

416
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,865
The jury is still out.

417
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,898
When did you begin to
believe you were jesus?

418
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:29,034
When did you begin to believe
you were a psychiatrist?

419
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:32,132
Since i graduated harvard medical school

420
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,867
And finished my residency,
i've had that feeling.

421
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:37,151
Oh, i sometimes dream about it.

422
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:39,366
Have you acted upon this belief?

423
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,767
I had a private practice for a while,

424
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,267
And then i taught.

425
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:44,698
Nothing unusual-

426
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, until one day, i met a caveman

427
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,567
Who thought he was jesus.

428
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,065
Do you find that unusual?

429
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,533
Very. I would stake my reputation

430
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:57,932
He as sane as i am,

431
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,900
So why does he persist in such a story?

432
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:03,067
There must be a reason, though.

433
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:04,967
Unless i imagined it all?

434
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,232
Is that possible?

435
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,100
I think you're as sane as he is.

436
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:09,850
Oh, god, i-

437
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:11,566
no.

438
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,034
Did you ever find it
prudent to worship yourself

439
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:17,833
Rather than be thought a heretic?

440
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,065
That would be something.

441
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,633
Other times, christianity
was considered heresy.

442
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,399
I had to pretend other faiths.

443
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:27,501
And what does jesus have
to say to those present

444
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,900
Who find it difficult to believe in him?

445
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,566
Believe in what he tried to teach,

446
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,498
Without rigmarole.

447
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,216
Piety is not what the
lessons bring to people.

448
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:39,900
It's the mistake they
bring to the lessons.

449
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,034
Well, it's getting to be night.

450
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:53,700
I still have stuff to carry

451
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:56,067
And a long drive.

452
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,598
I'll help.

453
00:18:57,633 --> 00:19:01,234
Dan: john, do you have
a destination in mind?

454
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,983
Never mind.

455
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,367
I won't ask.

456
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:07,434
John: thank you.

457
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,631
Anyone mentally ill can imagine

458
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,633
A fantastic background-
Even an entire life-

459
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,932
And sincerely believe it.

460
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,566
The man who thinks he is napoleon

461
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,432
Does believe it.

462
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,383
His true identity has taken a backseat

463
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:33,300
To his delusion and the need for it.

464
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:35,317
If that's the case with john,

465
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,300
There is a grave disorder.

466
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,732
Organized brilliantly.

467
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,832
He's got an answer for everything.

468
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:44,501
It might involve
rejection of his father,

469
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,184
Of his entire early past,

470
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,798
Replaced by this fantasy.

471
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,933
He says he can't remember his father.

472
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:50,932
Precisely why?

473
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,533
You said he was sane.

474
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,833
Did i?

475
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:57,733
Do you think that perhaps our caveman

476
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,533
Has a monkey on his back?

477
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:01,132
Drugs?

478
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,631
No, no, no, no.

479
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,067
I've done a lot of consulting
work with narcotics.

480
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:07,184
I've seen people tripping, strung out-

481
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,267
Whatever's up with john, it isn't that.

482
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:11,151
I've looked for signs-None.

483
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:12,965
Could cavemen really talk?

484
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,401
We think that language
came into existence

485
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:16,665
60,000 years ago.

486
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,698
The structure of stone age culture

487
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,000
Is evidence of the
ability to communicate-

488
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:22,399
Verbally.

489
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,267
Oh, shut up.

490
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,633
Maybe it'd be easier if i were.

491
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:38,800
Crazy?

492
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,598
No.

493
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,498
That is fascinating, isn't it,

494
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,666
A brave attempt to teach
buddhism in the west.

495
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,384
It's no wonder he failed.

496
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,032
We're not ready for it.

497
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,501
Edith: you're talking
as if you believed him.

498
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,668
Well, it is possible, isn't it?

499
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,684
I mean, anything is possible.

500
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,926
Look, we have two simple choices.

501
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:15,099
We can get all bent out of shape

502
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:17,501
Intellectualizing or
bench-Pressing logic,

503
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:20,134
Or we can simply relax and enjoy it.

504
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:21,932
I can listen critically,

505
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:25,334
But i don't have to make
up my mind about anything.

506
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,798
But you think you do?

507
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,566
Well, unfortunately, there's
no authorities on prehistory,

508
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,332
So we couldn't stop him there.

509
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,167
Edith: there are experts on the bible.

510
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:34,765
Harry: dream on.

511
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,099
Yeah, thus the lost years of jesus.

512
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:39,798
He didn't exist until john put on a hat.

513
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,867
I don't believe in angels and the
nativity and the star in the east,

514
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:47,000
But there are stories about
the childhood of jesus.

515
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:49,399
History hates a vacuum.

516
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,000
Improvisation, some of it very sincere,

517
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:53,132
Fills the gaps.

518
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,498
It would have been easy

519
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:57,432
To falsify a past back then-

520
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:00,833
A few words, credulity
- Time would do the rest.

521
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:02,965
Now you're talking as
if you believed him.

522
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,416
Art: well, look at the
popular myths surrounding

523
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,833
The kennedy assassination
in a few short years-

524
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,867
You had, uh, conspiracy, mafia, cia-

525
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:13,832
That's a mystique that'll never go away.

526
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,700
It's always been a small step
from a fallen leader to a god.

527
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:20,566
I don't think anybody
will deify kennedy.

528
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:22,533
We're more sophisticated than that.

529
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:24,067
Dan: we are?

530
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:25,700
We are.

531
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,566
Harry: well, you're finally fulfilling

532
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,833
One prophecy about the millennium, john.

533
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:35,767
John: what's that?

534
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,666
Here you are again.

535
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,199
You like the fire, john.

536
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,733
Everywhere i've lived,
i've had a fireplace.

537
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:55,234
Childhood fixation, i guess.

538
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,933
Helps me to feel secure.

539
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:02,401
There are predators out there.

540
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,650
One thing i didn't pack...

541
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,467
I thought i might need it.

542
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,000
<i>Wouldn't sacre du printemps
be more appropriate?</i>

543
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:20,067
What?

544
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,765
You've got...

545
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,967
Four men of science
completely baffled, my friend.

546
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:29,531
We-We don't know what to make of you.

547
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:32,299
Did you know voltaire
was the first to suggest

548
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:35,767
That the universe was created
by a gigantic explosion?

549
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:38,065
I think paul would agree.

550
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,531
And then goethe was the first to suggest

551
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:44,434
That spiral nebulae were
swirling masses of stars.

552
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:46,598
We now call them galaxies.

553
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,332
It's kind of funny how
often new concepts of science

554
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:52,267
Find their first tentative
forms of expression in the arts.

555
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:56,417
So did beethoven do physics on the side?

556
00:23:56,452 --> 00:24:00,533
He spent most of his
time lying on the floor

557
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:02,232
In front of his legless piano

558
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,000
Surrounded by orange
peels and apple cores.

559
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:09,967
Now we're on the floor
listening to beethoven.

560
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:12,765
Full circle.

561
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,100
Did you have, um...

562
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,898
Any religious beliefs,

563
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:20,183
Or did you give it much thought?

564
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:22,434
You can't get there with thought.

565
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:24,118
You have faith?

566
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:25,732
In a lot of things.

567
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,833
Do you have faith in
the future of the race?

568
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,798
I've seen species come and go.

569
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,900
Depends on their balance
with the environment.

570
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,300
We've made a mess of it.

571
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:38,017
There's still time,

572
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:39,665
If we use it well.

573
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,401
Christianity has been a worldwide belief

574
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,099
For 2,000 years.

575
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,334
How long did the egyptians worship isis

576
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:47,965
Or the sumerians ishtar?

577
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,633
In india, sacred cows wandered freely

578
00:24:50,668 --> 00:24:52,466
As reincarnated souls.

579
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:54,184
In a thousand years,
they'll be barbecued

580
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:55,867
And their souls will be in squirrels.

581
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:57,234
You weren't jesus!

582
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:00,467
Oh, edith.

583
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,034
if
it rains... it won't.

584
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,418
How do you know that?

585
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:08,767
I don't smell it.

586
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,200
Were you...

587
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:16,733
I guess... a medicine man?

588
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:18,965
I was a shaman a few times.

589
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,334
I revealed some truths
to eat a little better.

590
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:25,401
You think that's all
religion is about...

591
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:27,965
Selling hope and survival?

592
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,550
The old testament sells fear and guilt.

593
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:33,075
The new testament is
a good code of ethics,

594
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,566
Put into my mouth by
poets and philosophers

595
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,667
That are much smarter than i am.

596
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,733
The message is never practiced.

597
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,533
Fairy tales build churches.

598
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,750
What about the name "jesus"?

599
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:47,900
Did you pull that out of a hat?

600
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:50,267
I called myself john.

601
00:25:50,302 --> 00:25:52,565
I almost always do.

602
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,631
As tales of the resurrection spread,

603
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,434
<i>The name was confused
with the hebrew "yochanan,"</i>

604
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:59,284
Meaning "god is gracious. "

605
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,065
My stay on earth was seen

606
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,750
As divine proof of immortality.

607
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:08,401
That led to "god is salvation"

608
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:09,898
<i>Or hebrew "yahshua,"</i>

609
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:13,100
Which in translation
became my proper name,

610
00:26:13,135 --> 00:26:15,734
<i>Changing to late greek, "iesous,"</i>

611
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:18,299
<i>Then to late latin, "iesus,"</i>

612
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:20,932
And finally medieval latin, "jesus,"

613
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:23,933
And it was a wonder
to watch it all happen.

614
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:27,084
Then you didn't claim
to be the son of god?

615
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,165
Began as a schoolhouse
and ended as a temple.

616
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,767
I said i had a master that
was greater than myself.

617
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,784
I never said he was my father.

618
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,732
I wanted to teach what i learned.

619
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,832
I never claimed to be king of the jews,

620
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:43,000
I never walked on water,
i never raised the dead.

621
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,334
I never spoke of divine
except in the sense

622
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:48,501
Of human goodness on earth.

623
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:55,633
No wise men came from the
east to worship at a manger.

624
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,765
I did do a little healing

625
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,633
With some eastern medicine i'd learned.

626
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:03,533
That's it.

627
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,217
The three wise men began as a myth

628
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,100
About the birth of the buddha.

629
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:19,800
John, i should be home,
uh, kissing my wife.

630
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,167
We're all here, trapped by your story...

631
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:31,401
Hoping for a...
revolution? I don't know.

632
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:36,683
Are there any, uh...

633
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:38,633
More revelations for us?

634
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,000
It's just like old times.

635
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,600
You weren't jesus.

636
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,800
Quote the sermon on the mount.

637
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:02,099
Which one?

638
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:05,334
Darby, king james,
new american standard?

639
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,199
Do you know them all?

640
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:10,401
No one knows the one, not even me.

641
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:11,732
I...

642
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,067
I did some teaching on a hill one day.

643
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:16,134
Not that many people stayed.

644
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:17,265
But you...

645
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,299
Biblical jesus said,

646
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:21,767
"Who do you think i am?"

647
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:24,200
He gave them a choice.

648
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,100
I'm giving you one.

649
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,434
Were you?

650
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:36,067
If i said no, could you ever be sure?

651
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,167
Turn that off.

652
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,134
Please.

653
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:01,250
This has gone far enough.

654
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,232
It's gone much too far.

655
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:05,817
These people are very upset.

656
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:08,332
I don't believe you're mad,

657
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,666
But what you're saying is not true.

658
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,600
That leaves only one explanation.

659
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:17,867
The time has come when you must admit

660
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:19,067
This is a hoax...

661
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,032
A lie.

662
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:25,698
Isn't that true, john?

663
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:28,501
If you don't drop
this now- If you can-

664
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,032
I'll be convinced

665
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,017
That you need a great deal of attention.

666
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:35,967
I can have you committed
for observation.

667
00:29:36,002 --> 00:29:37,634
You know that.

668
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:39,585
I ask you now-

669
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,466
I demand it-

670
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:44,566
That you tell these people the truth.

671
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:47,850
Give them closure.

672
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:51,100
It's time, john.

673
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,300
Please.

674
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:08,733
End of the line. Everybody off.

675
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,965
What?!

676
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,133
It was a story.

677
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:18,267
It was all a story.

678
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:20,200
Good god!

679
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,783
Another fairy tale?

680
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:25,531
All of it? But what-

681
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:26,932
What in the name of heaven...

682
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:29,200
John, you had us wondering
whether you were sane or not,

683
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:30,798
And it's just a story!

684
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:34,134
Where'd you come off with such
a half-Baked, asinine idea?

685
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:35,933
At least you're relieved i'm not a nut.

686
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,601
I'd prefer you were!

687
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,234
You gave me the idea.

688
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:40,634
All of you.

689
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:41,965
Come again?

690
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,567
Edith saw my fake van gogh.

691
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:45,018
You could have just told me.

692
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,643
You commented that i never age.

693
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,234
You gave me the book on early man.

694
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:49,832
Dan, you spotted the burin

695
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,533
And you said, "if stones could speak. "

696
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:53,165
I knew it.

697
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,631
I got the notion, i ran it past you

698
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:58,234
To check your reactions,
and i took it too far.

699
00:30:58,269 --> 00:30:59,598
Too far?

700
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,099
Check my reaction.

701
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:03,700
You asked if i was a figure
from religious history,

702
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:05,217
If there were others like me,

703
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:06,665
If i'd created future identities.

704
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,850
We were chasing our
tails around the maypole,

705
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:13,000
Enjoying the mystery,
the analytical stretch.

706
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:14,933
You were playing my game!

707
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,498
I was playing yours.

708
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:19,134
Oh, man, you know, you
had us going, right?

709
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,366
You were good, man.

710
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:21,865
You know those chinese boxes,

711
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,967
One inside the other inside
the other inside the other-

712
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:28,034
I feel like i'm in the last box.

713
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:30,334
You son of a...

714
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:31,366
Bitch!

715
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:32,933
How could you do this to us?

716
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:34,999
I was worried about you.

717
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:37,383
I know, i was tempted
to cop out many times,

718
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:39,733
But i couldn't resist
seeing whether or not

719
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:41,501
You could refute what i was saying.

720
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:43,435
I had the perfect audience-

721
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,334
Anthropologist, archaeologist,

722
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:47,434
Christian literalist...

723
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:49,598
A psychologist.

724
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:51,698
Okay, i've had enough of this.

725
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm outta here. You
wanna come? Let's go.

726
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:56,165
So, john.

727
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,800
Are you gonna write the story?

728
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,434
If i do, i'll send you copies.

729
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:01,684
Don't bother with mine, okay?

730
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,900
You are absolutely certifiable.

731
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,633
I don't know you!

732
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,334
It was nice seeing
you again, dr. Oldman.

733
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,566
Your name's a pun, isn't it?

734
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:14,566
Old man?

735
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,034
Did that help you with your story?

736
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:20,666
Art: linda!

737
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,367
Bye.

738
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,767
Well, art was half right.

739
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:31,800
Which half?

740
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Well, at least i don't
have to throw away half

741
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:39,401
Of what i know about biology.

742
00:32:39,436 --> 00:32:41,034
Which half?

743
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,698
It's a beautiful idea,

744
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:48,600
So rich, so full of possibilities.

745
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,967
Perhaps you should write
a paper on it, doctor.

746
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:53,698
Maybe i will.

747
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,900
I'll interview you in the rubber room

748
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:57,399
For further details.

749
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,467
You may still need help, my friend.

750
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,432
My ass.

751
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,631
I thought it sounded pretty good.

752
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,733
They believe you because they have to.

753
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:20,800
But the one thing that i know about you

754
00:33:20,835 --> 00:33:22,366
Is that you would never use people

755
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,134
Or abuse their goodwill and intelligence

756
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,867
Like they think you've
just done to them.

757
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:26,999
Psych 101?

758
00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:29,598
No, it's woman,
one-On-One.

759
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,416
So you're a pretty fast liar, mr. Ugg,

760
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:35,165
But i wanna know
- What's your real name?

761
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,134
Believe it or not, the
sound was always john.

762
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:42,068
Why'd you cave to gruber?

763
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,735
What happened was enough.

764
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,332
Just-Just needed to stop.

765
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,533
I shouldn't have expected it to work.

766
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,883
Fourteen thousand years old.

767
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:52,833
I bet that's a lot of women.

768
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:54,833
Are we counting?

769
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,200
Maybe.

770
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:00,234
Well, i'm taking edith home.

771
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:01,167
Sandy?

772
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,100
I'm gonna stay.

773
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,833
Are you sorry for some
of those things you said?

774
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:13,401
I'm sorry i said them.

775
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:14,865
Well.

776
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,367
Like a good christian,

777
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:19,566
I... oh, john.

778
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,367
Oh! Well.

779
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:24,798
You did a terrible thing,

780
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:27,232
But we're all so
thankful you're all right.

781
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:30,334
Even art-He just hates
things he can't understand.

782
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,132
You're a sadist, john,

783
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,265
But i admit i got a kick out of

784
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,034
Chasing my tail around your maypole...

785
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,234
Even if that is all i caught.

786
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:39,399
Good luck to you.

787
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:41,000
Wish you the best. Thank you.

788
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,034
Ready?

789
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,933
Harry: later on.
Sandy: okay, good night.

790
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:56,700
Mm-Hmm.

791
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,332
Mmm.

792
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,265
I don't know, man.

793
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,267
Something about this...

794
00:35:06,302 --> 00:35:08,551
Something about you, john.

795
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,765
The more i think about it,

796
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,666
The more i'm no longer
in that chinese box.

797
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:17,399
I sense... space.

798
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:22,334
A kinda latitude of what
we happily call reality,

799
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:25,401
In which, as everybody keeps saying...

800
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:28,466
Anything's possible.

801
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,367
Yes. No, no. No, no.

802
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:32,201
No-No more words.

803
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:33,965
I'm gonna go home,

804
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>And i'm gonna watch star trek</i>

805
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:37,917
For a dose of sanity.

806
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:39,965
Good luck to you, man,

807
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,416
Wherever this may lead you.

808
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,798
You drop me a line sometime.

809
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,666
Let me know how you're making out.

810
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:49,200
I will.

811
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,733
Mm. Mwah.

812
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,565
So, john oldman.

813
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,167
What other pun names have you used?

814
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:07,501
Lots.

815
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:12,100
John paley for john paleolithic,

816
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:14,498
John savage-

817
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,633
Got really crazy about 60 years ago.

818
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:18,501
When i was teaching at harvard,

819
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:21,332
I was john thomas partee.

820
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:23,900
John t. Partee-
Boston tea party-

821
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,117
I get it.

822
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:26,359
Yeah, i know.

823
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:27,566
Wait, wait, wait.

824
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,898
Boston?

825
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:32,066
60 years ago?

826
