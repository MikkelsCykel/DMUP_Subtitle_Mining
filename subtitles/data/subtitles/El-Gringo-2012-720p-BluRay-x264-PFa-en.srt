1
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:00,351
You're still alive.

2
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:04,118
English, Tortuga.

3
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:16,864
You know where we are?

4
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:25,546
You're here. Across the border.

5
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,380
From El Fronteras.

6
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,323
- El Fronteras.
- Uh-huh.

7
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,515
Is it far?

8
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:36,451
- Quick walk.
- How long?

9
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:40,657
Ten, 15 minutes.

10
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:48,104
You'll like it-- Aah! Unh.

11
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:50,539
You'll like it there.

12
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,671
People are very friendly. Heh, heh.

13
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,315
Why'd you have to start shouting, Tortuga?

14
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:03,719
I didn't want to be taken alive.

15
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,029
Huh?

16
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:31,482
A man is only responsible to himself.

17
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:35,386
Remember that, perro.

18
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,996
Where will you go?

19
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:49,665
Acapulco.

20
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,343
Heh. Acapulco?
What are you, an spring break?

21
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,539
That's for tourists.

22
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:04,484
You want to go someplace nice.

23
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,720
Go to...

24
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,661
...Akumal.

25
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,505
Take care of that bag, amigo.

26
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,604
It carries the bland of many men.

27
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,219
Adiós, Tortuga.

28
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:44,797
Adiós.

29
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,796
Come on.

30
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,883
Hey.

31
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,353
Leave the dog alone.

32
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,997
Gringo.

33
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,245
Shit.

34
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:20,121
Hey, girl. How you doing?

35
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:25,225
You're a good girl, huh?

36
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:29,535
Go on. Get out of here.

37
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,372
I said, go on.

38
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:39,710
Whatever.

39
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:46,080
Give me your bag.

40
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,961
Excuse me?

41
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,421
The bag.

42
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:15,413
I'm not giving you the bag, kid.

43
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,029
You're holding the knife wrong, honey.

44
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,835
You're supposed to hold the knife
blade down.

45
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,739
Someone comes at you blade up...

46
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,314
...that means they don't know how
to handle a knife.

47
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:48,983
And give me your shirt.

48
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:52,046
<i>- What?
- Your camisa. Give it to me.</i>

49
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,796
That's it. Come on.

50
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,023
Thattagirl.

51
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,312
Have a nice day.

52
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,011
Bottle of water, please.

53
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,411
- No water, sorry.
- No water?

54
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,445
Excuse me, miss-- Miss?

55
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:56,650
Excuse me, sir?

56
00:09:57,915 --> 00:10:01,453
- No, I don't want your money. Please go.
- Please, ma'am, I'm very thirsty.

57
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,292
Excuse me.

58
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,030
Some water, please?

59
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:15,877
We are closed.

60
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,815
Come on, just one glass.

61
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,791
Wow.

62
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:25,318
Mm. Do you have any money?

63
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,686
What, you don't take American money?

64
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,890
I don't take fake money, hmm?

65
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,324
- Fake?
- Mm.

66
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,226
Come back here
when you have some real money.

67
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:23,176
Two hundred dollars
for a glass of water. Ahem.

68
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:24,508
Nope.

69
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,413
Five hundred dollars for a glass of water.
That is my final offer.

70
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:14,728
Mm.

71
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,103
You can't drink that.

72
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:22,874
You're a gringo.

73
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,278
You ever hear of Montezuma's revenge'?

74
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:37,048
Mm.

75
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,314
- You just killed your first man.
- Heh.

76
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,190
Welcome to La M.

77
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:20,863
GANGSTER
Shh, shh.

78
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,628
What's up, Flaca?

79
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,712
I jacked that vato that came into town.

80
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,721
What did you get?

81
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:50,724
He brake your nose?

82
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:58,633
What happened to your shirt?

83
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,235
He tank it.

84
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,916
He stole the shirt off your back.

85
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:08,815
Shut the fuck up, putos.

86
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,163
Do you want to get jumped in?

87
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,494
<i>Hmm?</i>

88
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:30,368
You're going to have to do
better than that, flaquita.

89
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,135
Hmm.

90
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:46,023
Stray dogs.
They're the scourge of this town.

91
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:47,820
Spreading disease and vermin.

92
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:53,492
Ahh. If I do only one thing as chief,
it'll be to rid El Fronteras of these...

93
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,702
...miserable, useless creatures.

94
00:16:57,426 --> 00:17:00,703
And you pendejos are no better.

95
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,811
Shit.

96
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:12,915
You heard the bass.

97
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,479
Adiós, Fronteras

98
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,381
I'd like to take the next bus to Acapulco.

99
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:11,983
Acapulco.

100
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:13,618
<i>Si, Acapulco.</i>

101
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:16,880
Why you want to go there? Spring break?

102
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:21,884
Look, can I just get a ticket
for the next bus, please?

103
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,622
No.

104
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:25,292
Why not?

105
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,160
No bus to Acapulco.

106
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,567
- No bus to Acapulco?
- Mm-hm.

107
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:32,727
Okay, 50...

108
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:35,165
How do I get there? You tell me.

109
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,037
No bus.

110
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,012
Try tomorrow.

111
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,816
Try tomorrow? Is there gonna be
a bus here tomorrow or not?

112
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:45,342
Try tomorrow.

113
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,010
Fuck!

114
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,790
Okay, ma'am, I'm sorry. I apologize.

115
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:01,835
But do you know where
I can get a glass of water?

116
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:10,404
- Bus leaves at 2.
- No, there is no bus today.

117
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,416
Of course there is.

118
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,648
They only told you that so you could
stay in town longer and spend your money.

119
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:25,324
- I gotta go.
- It's too late now.

120
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:29,397
The bus leaves at 2:00 sharp.
You've missed it.

121
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,905
Spend my money? On what?

122
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,404
I can't even buy a glass of water.

123
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,142
Where are you headed?

124
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:46,812
- Acapulco.
- Heh.

125
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:50,079
- Acapulco? That tourist trap?
- Yeah.

126
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:55,215
Look, if you wanna go somewhere nice,
go to Tulum or Akumal.

127
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:57,051
Acapulco.

128
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:02,398
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
a room upstairs I could spend the night?

129
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:05,765
This seems to be the only place in town
that'll take my money.

130
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:11,403
You can stay in the attic.

131
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:14,269
For one night.

132
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:17,644
Fronteras is not for tourists.

133
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:21,515
You should leave here,
even if it is for Acapulco.

134
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:25,188
You got a name?

135
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:31,123
Come on, you can tell me your name.

136
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,926
Anna.

137
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,223
- Anna.
- Mm-hm.

138
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,100
Well, Anna, you know
what I really want right now?

139
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:40,874
What?

140
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:42,938
A margarita.

141
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:46,875
- A margarita?
- Yeah.

142
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,747
We only have straight tequila.

143
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,280
Just tequila.

144
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:56,447
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

145
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:58,593
Welcome to El Fronteras.

146
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,757
Mm.

147
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,686
No, this ain't right.

148
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:03,181
I don't like this.

149
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,789
I'm getting the shotgun.

150
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,217
Connors?

151
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:05,819
Sullivan?

152
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:07,751
Bill?

153
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,451
- Everybody's here.
- Where's the other one'?

154
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:33,383
I don't know. I don't see him.

155
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:35,682
Check the trunk, pendejo.

156
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,858
Get out.

157
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:22,931
- What are you doing?
- You're a drug dealer.

158
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:26,133
- No, I'm not.
- You're a bank robber.

159
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:27,775
No, I'm not.

160
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:29,274
Get out of my bar.

161
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:31,037
Why don't you just calm down?

162
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:34,375
- Get out.
- Just let me explain. I can explain.

163
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:37,519
- Where did you get all this money?
- You went through my stuff?

164
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:39,915
I have a right to know
who is living in my house.

165
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:42,080
You don't have a right
to go through people's stuff.

166
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:44,487
Where did you get this money, huh?

167
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,296
Hey, no, no, wait!

168
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:50,522
Get out.

169
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:02,540
Hey! Wait!

170
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,339
Hey!

171
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:22,194
Flaca.

172
00:27:25,391 --> 00:27:27,735
- Oh, fuck.
- Move!

173
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:06,813
Give me the bag.

174
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:12,243
Flaca...

175
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:16,653
...is this the gabacho
who bloodied your nose?

176
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:18,078
Yes.

177
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:20,382
Are you sure?

178
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,439
He's too fast for you.

179
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:46,676
Maybe you should try
to make love, not war.

180
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:53,290
Quiet!

181
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:02,859
Who are you?

182
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:06,704
Nobody.

183
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:08,367
Just passing through.

184
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,374
What are you doing here?

185
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:15,312
On my way to Acapulco.

186
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,085
Acapulco?

187
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:24,819
What, for spring break?

188
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:31,224
Look, amigo...

189
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:33,696
...I don't care where you go.

190
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:39,066
Just get out of El Fronteras.

191
00:30:40,932 --> 00:30:44,141
- Bus doesn't leave till tomorrow.
- Ah.

192
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:53,289
Make sure you're on it.

193
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,317
<i>Hmm?</i>

194
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,963
Oh, you were a big help.

195
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,685
Get the Predator B airborne.

196
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:30,190
What do you need a drone far?

197
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,488
They sent four men on that raid.
There's only three in the car.

198
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:38,332
These tracks mean
there's a car with a flat tire...

199
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,027
.somewhere between here
and the Mexican border.

200
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,400
And I wanna find it.

201
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,846
Suspects heading south on 286.

202
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,777
Copy. Stop and search them.

203
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:25,781
- Copy that.
- Shit.

204
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:29,254
Lieutenant,
they're on their way back from the buy.

205
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,620
The only evidence they can have is money.
We can't hold them on that.

206
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:34,556
<i>Wanna get Section 33'd again?</i>

207
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:38,062
<i>You search those bums
and report in when you are done.</i>

208
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:41,431
- This is bullshit.
- Copy that.

209
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,128
- Come on, it's called doing your job
- No, it's called wasting your time.

210
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:49,766
Haw many scumbags are we supposed to
put in jail? They'll just keep coming back.

211
00:33:58,408 --> 00:34:01,048
You come back to finish the job?

212
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,653
<i>Hmm.</i>

213
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,563
Must be late.

214
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:19,207
I couldn't sleep.

215
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:21,075
Oh, you were worried about me?

216
00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:24,305
I was worried about the dog.

217
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:28,607
How do you like our little town?

218
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:35,448
It's an acquired taste.

219
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:45,093
El Fronteras was once a very nice place.

220
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:49,169
The Americans used to come here
for the festivals.

221
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:53,576
That's when my father built the bar.

222
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:00,283
Then the violence came.

223
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:05,082
The Americans left, the jobs left.

224
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:09,159
The drug cartels
needed this town empty, So...

225
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:15,459
They chased everyone away.

226
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:20,068
The others who stay here
are not allowed to talk to outsiders.

227
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:24,108
They are paid to keep quiet.

228
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:30,145
Well, that explains why
I can't get a glass of water in this town.

229
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,716
So why'd you stay in El Fronteras?

230
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:41,752
My grandmother taught me...

231
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:47,362
...a person who stands up
never stands alone.

232
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,004
You believe that?

233
00:35:51,495 --> 00:35:53,338
Don't you?

234
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:58,376
Not anymore.

235
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:02,250
One man can't make a difference, honey.

236
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,717
Trust me.

237
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:13,958
I'm sorry you feel that way.

238
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,431
This town is not safe for you.

239
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:28,307
Make sure you get on the bus tomorrow.

240
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:31,072
Anna.

241
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:38,545
Can't I just come back inside?

242
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,728
Where did you get that money?

243
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:23,469
Guess it's just you and me.

244
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:22,451
Hula, Tortuga.

245
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,220
Shit.

246
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,671
Get your head in the game.

247
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:27,589
Shit!

248
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:37,088
Thanks a lot, kid.

249
00:44:02,215 --> 00:44:04,559
<i>Two-twenty-two, do you copy?</i>

250
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,424
Lieutenant West.

251
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:08,827
<i>Lieutenant,
the drone spotted your Cadillac...</i>

252
00:44:08,988 --> 00:44:12,595
<i>...at Mile Marker 63 on the border fence.</i>

253
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,968
Copy that.

254
00:44:38,653 --> 00:44:40,792
Scourge of this town.

255
00:44:49,865 --> 00:44:50,900
Chief.

256
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:53,411
I'll get the next one.

257
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,247
One by one, I'm gonna clean up this town
till there's no more interference.

258
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:06,492
Then I will feel
like I have done something.

259
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,130
Chief, the gringo.

260
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:13,533
He carries a black satchel full of money.

261
00:45:14,057 --> 00:45:16,697
- In dollars?
- Yes.

262
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,833
The coyotes didn't come in yesterday.

263
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,812
Instead we get the pinche guerro.

264
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:33,945
- New plan.
- Yes?

265
00:45:37,315 --> 00:45:41,196
Make sure he does not get the 2:00 bus.

266
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:50,963
Cover the bus station.

267
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,167
You tell the others,
and spread out from there.

268
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,119
Shit.

269
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,819
Let me cross the border.
That's all I wanna do.

270
00:46:08,982 --> 00:46:10,393
You ain't got no jurisdiction.

271
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,997
Don't give me this
"no jurisdiction" bullshit.

272
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:17,159
These motherfuckers killed
three of my men. Three.

273
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,439
<i>Border patrol, DEA
mobile enforcement are already on this.</i>

274
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,881
They'll find the bastards who killed them.

275
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:31,677
So, what are we supposed to do
in the meantime? Sit on our ass? Is that it?

276
00:46:37,846 --> 00:46:41,623
<i>We are going to observe jurisdiction.</i>

277
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:45,192
And you are going to follow orders.

278
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,980
That's too easy.

279
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,649
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

280
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:15,062
Do we?

281
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:30,146
Yes, sir.

282
00:47:42,648 --> 00:47:45,390
How much vacation time do I have?

283
00:48:12,713 --> 00:48:15,557
<i>The bus leaves at 2:00 sharp.</i>

284
00:48:30,132 --> 00:48:31,611
Agua, please?

285
00:48:33,802 --> 00:48:35,543
Miss, come on, I'm dying of thirst here.

286
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:38,209
Two hundred bucks.

287
00:48:39,576 --> 00:48:41,715
Two hundred bucks. Just take it.

288
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,858
Thank you.

289
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:47,724
Give me the bag.

290
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:53,757
Take it easy, kid.

291
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,898
Give me the bag.

292
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,768
You know you're supposed
to cock it first, right?

293
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:10,074
What's your name, kid?

294
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:12,415
- Naco.
- Okay, Naco.

295
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:16,389
We can both just walk away quietly...

296
00:49:16,548 --> 00:49:18,585
...pretend like none of this
ever happened.

297
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:20,119
We got a deal, amigo?

298
00:49:30,563 --> 00:49:33,407
Sneaky little bastard.

299
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:40,907
Armor-piercing bullets.

300
00:53:39,727 --> 00:53:41,172
Shit.

301
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:55,855
It's 2:00.

302
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:58,051
Fuck!

303
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:05,191
Wait! Stop the bus! Stop the bus!

304
00:54:15,398 --> 00:54:16,741
Shit!

305
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:23,182
What time is the next bus?

306
00:54:23,773 --> 00:54:25,047
No English.

307
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,890
I said, what time is the next bus?

308
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:35,724
Tomorrow, 2:00.

309
00:54:39,122 --> 00:54:40,760
Thank you.

310
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,329
Find the American.

311
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:42,797
Finish this.

312
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:13,456
No, Flaca!

313
00:57:23,296 --> 00:57:24,468
Fuck.

314
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:28,470
Flaca.

315
00:57:29,037 --> 00:57:31,017
Just listen to me.

316
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:32,917
Just give me the bag.

317
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,119
Hey, wait.

318
00:57:36,277 --> 00:57:38,154
They're gonna kill you for that money.

319
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:41,091
Better they find it with me
than with you, right?

320
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:43,258
Fuck you, puta.

321
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,831
We don't have time for pendejadas.

322
00:58:49,956 --> 00:58:52,596
You said one man
can't make a difference.

323
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:54,799
Haw about a woman?

324
00:59:26,761 --> 00:59:29,071
I am a police officer.

325
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:31,171
A policeman.

326
00:59:34,302 --> 00:59:36,179
Border crossing is in Nogales.

327
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:40,718
I'm with La Paz.
New Mexico Police Department.

328
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,889
Now, if you don't open this gate...

329
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:47,357
...I'm gonna report you to the DEA
and Homeland Security.

330
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,793
Nogales is east of here.

331
00:59:52,254 --> 00:59:54,564
You've got a long drive, migra.

332
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:56,296
Better get started.

333
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,237
Let's think this through.

334
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:03,878
If Homeland Security
shuts down this fence...

335
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:07,641
...your bosses are gonna have to find
another place to conduct their affairs.

336
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,944
Now, that is a lot of lost business
on your head.

337
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,255
So why don't you just let me through?

338
01:00:17,148 --> 01:00:19,560
All right, it's your funeral.

339
01:00:34,766 --> 01:00:38,441
Oh. Which way to El Fronteras?

340
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:48,016
Don't.

341
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:52,291
Why you helping me?
You still think I'm a bad guy?

342
01:00:52,452 --> 01:00:54,090
How many men did you kill today? Hmm?

343
01:00:56,656 --> 01:00:58,693
I didn't really wanna kill any of them.

344
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:01,032
Oh. Do you get shot every day?

345
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:03,732
You have to tourniquet the wounds
to stop the bleeding.

346
01:01:03,897 --> 01:01:06,070
You need to tie it off with something.

347
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:07,371
Hurry.

348
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:28,858
Oh, yeah. Mm.

349
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:31,666
It was almost worth getting shot.

350
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:37,504
Okay. Okay.

351
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:54,155
Heh. Kind of wish he'd shot me
a few more times.

352
01:02:00,324 --> 01:02:03,498
So, uh, what are you gonna use
to bandage me with?

353
01:02:05,395 --> 01:02:08,206
Probably your tongue.

354
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:14,711
I told you to stay away
from that guerro pinche, Flaca.

355
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:23,582
While you, you tried to kill me.

356
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,757
That money belongs to us.

357
01:02:27,886 --> 01:02:30,924
<i>- Huh? You have to choose your side, mija.
- I know.</i>

358
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:35,266
And I thought if I steal that bag,
you would jump me into the gang.

359
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:44,210
The only way to join La M
is to kill a man.

360
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:55,250
You gut that? Huh?

361
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:58,421
Now

362
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:20,276
You lost this.

363
01:03:57,881 --> 01:04:00,452
I wish I could do something
to help you, Anna.

364
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:41,293
Still, I'm concerned about your safety.

365
01:06:49,731 --> 01:06:52,644
Did you hear about the man
who shot up a woman's bar?

366
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,989
That's where I would stay.

367
01:07:05,514 --> 01:07:08,723
A bunch of guys came
to a woman's bar...

368
01:07:08,884 --> 01:07:11,057
...and they just started
shooting up the place.

369
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,193
And why did they shoot up her place?

370
01:07:15,424 --> 01:07:17,995
Because the town was getting
out of control.

371
01:07:19,561 --> 01:07:21,371
And they needed to clean things up.

372
01:07:28,772 --> 01:07:32,015
I heared they gave her until midnight
to leave town.

373
01:07:34,044 --> 01:07:35,717
And when she didn't leave...

374
01:07:38,449 --> 01:07:39,587
...they killed her.

375
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:01,041
Oh, shit.

376
01:08:01,506 --> 01:08:03,452
Three cops dead.

377
01:08:03,608 --> 01:08:05,246
Three good cops.

378
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:07,954
And you take the money...

379
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:11,759
...drug money, and you run?

380
01:08:15,254 --> 01:08:17,734
You are a disgrace.

381
01:08:18,324 --> 01:08:20,998
Yeah, you're right. I fucked up.

382
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:27,178
But you tell me, lieutenant,
what's the point?

383
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:30,444
You send us out on some bullshit job
to pick up some mutts...

384
01:08:30,604 --> 01:08:33,983
...who'll only bounce out on bail
or extradition. That's all we ever do.

385
01:08:34,141 --> 01:08:36,280
We never build a case.
We never solve anything.

386
01:08:36,443 --> 01:08:39,617
And the good cops die
and the bad guys get away. It's bullshit.

387
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,785
You gotta think of the big picture.
Take responsibility.

388
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:47,959
You are just one man.
One man cannot change the world.

389
01:08:51,459 --> 01:08:53,496
So, what, are you bringing me in?

390
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:06,115
I am Lieutenant West
of the New Mexico Police Department.

391
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,887
This man is new under my supervision.

392
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,283
What do you want with the gringo?

393
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,727
He's a wanted man in the United States.

394
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:21,226
I'll be escorting him out of this town.
He is no longer your concern.

395
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,540
What about the money?

396
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:30,203
This money? Are you--?
You making a claim on this money?

397
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:31,904
Yeah.

398
01:09:33,037 --> 01:09:34,710
This money is new state's evidence.

399
01:09:34,872 --> 01:09:38,217
Maybe that money belongs to us. Huh?

400
01:09:41,112 --> 01:09:44,025
Let me explain something to you,
Skeletor.

401
01:09:44,182 --> 01:09:46,059
You make a claim on this money...

402
01:09:46,217 --> 01:09:48,562
...I'm gonna have the DEA in here
to investigate.

403
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:53,328
Something happens to me,
the DEA will be here to investigate.

404
01:09:53,492 --> 01:09:56,029
Either way, the DEA is gonna be here...

405
01:09:56,195 --> 01:09:59,733
...in your small little town, to investigate.

406
01:09:59,898 --> 01:10:04,848
So the smart play is
lower your weapons...

407
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:09,248
allow us to pass, and salute me as I do

408
01:10:17,684 --> 01:10:18,754
Come on.

409
01:10:21,254 --> 01:10:22,928
What did he do?

410
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:24,899
He stole money from a drug dealer...

411
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:27,903
...and he left three of his fellow
police officers to die.

412
01:10:37,104 --> 01:10:38,140
Come on.

413
01:10:49,317 --> 01:10:52,059
You got until midnight. That's it.

414
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,667
- They're gonna make her pay for helping me.
- Shut up.

415
01:10:54,824 --> 01:10:57,634
- You can't just leave her.
- Shut up. It's not my problem.

416
01:10:57,793 --> 01:10:59,602
Come on. Just keep moving.

417
01:11:07,803 --> 01:11:09,976
Is this more of your handiwork?

418
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:11,610
You been a busy bay.

419
01:11:12,876 --> 01:11:14,412
Come on.

420
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:17,123
You gut a jail cell in here?

421
01:11:25,555 --> 01:11:27,193
Oh, we've got better than that.

422
01:11:43,641 --> 01:11:46,213
- Here's your dinero.
- You son of a bitch.

423
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:02,569
Good work, lieutenant. That's for you.

424
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:09,002
Now, this money was supposed to be
delivered two days ago in La Paz.

425
01:12:09,169 --> 01:12:11,206
Do you know where it was headed?

426
01:12:11,371 --> 01:12:12,543
Ah.

427
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:16,819
See that it gets there.

428
01:12:18,045 --> 01:12:19,490
No problem.

429
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:25,130
Apparently, I can trust you more
than any of these incompetent pendejos.

430
01:12:25,286 --> 01:12:26,663
<i>Bunch of pendejos!</i>

431
01:12:27,388 --> 01:12:29,561
You hear that? You're all pendejos.

432
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,039
Yeah, you.

433
01:12:36,431 --> 01:12:40,538
So it was you that set us up in the desert.
Huh? That phony stop and search.

434
01:12:40,702 --> 01:12:43,706
- You ordered those monks to kill us.
- Yep.

435
01:12:45,507 --> 01:12:46,918
They were good cops.

436
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:50,455
This had nothing to do with them.

437
01:12:51,748 --> 01:12:53,625
What the hell are you talking about?

438
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:59,589
This was all about you.
You're too damn good at your job.

439
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:57,858
Do you trust that cop
to deliver the money?

440
01:13:58,018 --> 01:13:59,827
He'll do it.

441
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:02,592
He just saw what happens to cops
that steal our money.

442
01:14:02,756 --> 01:14:03,860
Hmm.

443
01:14:05,459 --> 01:14:08,030
And what should we do
with the pinche gringo?

444
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:10,175
Kill him.

445
01:14:13,868 --> 01:14:15,438
Slowly.

446
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:10,461
Come on.

447
01:15:11,829 --> 01:15:12,899
Son of a...

448
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:19,275
Yes.

449
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:29,355
Hey, what's the problem?

450
01:15:29,781 --> 01:15:32,421
- I'm talking to you, asshole.
- It's the fucking gringo.

451
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:46,134
- He got away.
- Son of a bitch.

452
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:35,454
Motherfucker.

453
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,600
Shit.

454
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:58,683
San of a bitch.

455
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:13,898
Motherfucker.

456
01:17:24,169 --> 01:17:25,580
Come on, West.

457
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:44,091
Son of a bitch.

458
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:53,935
Shit!

459
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,415
Come on!

460
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:10,052
Fucking kill you, West.

461
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,561
Let's get the fuck out of here.

462
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:46,659
Shit. My gun.

463
01:18:53,531 --> 01:18:55,602
Fuck. Come on.

464
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:01,884
Come on. Come on. Come on.

465
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:09,953
Fuck.

466
01:19:14,753 --> 01:19:15,959
Okay.

467
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,739
Three good cops dead.

468
01:21:49,517 --> 01:21:51,360
You got me.

469
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,965
Four cops' lives ruined.

470
01:21:56,558 --> 01:21:59,971
And you take the money and you run,
you son of a bitch.

471
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:03,339
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

472
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,112
Look...

473
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,852
I'm just trying to get out of this war.

474
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:14,186
Same as you.

475
01:22:15,044 --> 01:22:19,117
No. Same war, different sides.

476
01:22:19,682 --> 01:22:22,060
You think you're different from me?

477
01:22:22,952 --> 01:22:24,022
Not at all.

478
01:22:24,387 --> 01:22:28,495
You betrayed your brothers
the moment you took this money.

479
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:39,977
You gonna arrest me?

480
01:22:47,912 --> 01:22:49,858
Attaboy.

481
01:23:31,658 --> 01:23:32,694
No.

482
01:23:36,898 --> 01:23:38,002
No!

483
01:23:40,802 --> 01:23:43,783
You had your chance. Huh?

484
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:54,623
- No! No! No!
- Shh, shh.

485
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,931
No!

486
01:24:07,097 --> 01:24:08,804
No!

487
01:24:22,313 --> 01:24:23,348
Hmm?

488
01:24:29,286 --> 01:24:30,890
<i>Hmm?</i>

489
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:51,980
ESPINOZA
Anita.

490
01:24:52,144 --> 01:24:55,786
It didn't have to end like this, Anita.

491
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:59,687
You could have just taken the money.

492
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:01,965
Like all of these people.

493
01:25:07,827 --> 01:25:11,833
You are more stubborn
than your father was.

494
01:25:27,481 --> 01:25:31,225
We're gonna have to kill you. Huh?

495
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:33,823
You already have.

496
01:25:33,988 --> 01:25:36,161
Shut the fuck up. Hmm?

497
01:25:50,339 --> 01:25:52,012
Came an! Do it!

498
01:26:17,067 --> 01:26:18,376
The man is here.

499
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:20,105
Where is he?

500
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:21,875
There.

501
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,975
Where the fuck is he?

502
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,729
Shoot him. Come on. Shoot him.

503
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:42,962
Come on, shoot him.

504
01:26:47,566 --> 01:26:49,637
Shoot him. Come on.

505
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,675
Come on, shoot him.

506
01:27:11,592 --> 01:27:13,469
Come on, shoot him.

507
01:28:08,251 --> 01:28:11,460
Fuck you and fuck La M.

508
01:28:16,127 --> 01:28:17,162
Thanks, kid.

509
01:28:35,748 --> 01:28:37,785
Come into my town.

510
01:28:39,385 --> 01:28:41,092
Steal my money.

511
01:28:43,055 --> 01:28:45,092
Kill my men.

512
01:29:08,749 --> 01:29:11,320
Scourge of this town.

513
01:29:33,742 --> 01:29:35,484
This is a heroin highway.

514
01:29:38,781 --> 01:29:40,818
You're just a man.

515
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:47,891
There's nothing you can do to stop this.

516
01:29:48,057 --> 01:29:50,037
You can kill everyone in El Fronteras...

517
01:29:50,193 --> 01:29:54,336
...but you can't kill every gangster
in Mexico.

518
01:29:54,498 --> 01:29:56,978
We'll just keep coming
and coming and coming.

519
01:30:00,938 --> 01:30:02,474
Shut the hell up.

520
01:30:03,073 --> 01:30:04,347
Nobody's listening.

521
01:30:20,825 --> 01:30:22,463
Anna.

522
01:30:44,751 --> 01:30:46,890
Shit.

523
01:30:48,155 --> 01:30:49,759
Nice.

524
01:31:43,913 --> 01:31:46,120
Your father would be very proud of you.

525
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:07,515
I'm sorry about the bar, Anna.

526
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,853
It's okay.

527
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:17,594
I'll build a new one.

528
01:32:25,424 --> 01:32:27,233
So, uh...

529
01:32:27,393 --> 01:32:29,566
...this is a lot of money.

530
01:32:30,329 --> 01:32:31,933
What will you do with it?

531
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:36,643
I was thinking about buying
a really big glass of water.

532
01:32:52,619 --> 01:32:54,827
You can keep the change.

533
01:33:14,343 --> 01:33:16,755
- There you go, ladies.
- Thank you.

534
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,942
How about a margarita an the house?

535
01:33:44,642 --> 01:33:46,952
I didn't think they served margaritas
around here.

536
01:33:50,114 --> 01:33:52,390
Can we get another round
over here, please?

537
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:54,461
Of course. I'll be right there.

538
01:33:54,618 --> 01:33:56,120
The tourists request them.

539
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:02,265
A margarita sounds pretty good
right about now.

540
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:04,970
What happened to Acapulco?

541
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:08,912
- Acapulco?
- M m-h m.

542
01:34:09,067 --> 01:34:10,603
- That's a tourist trap.
- Mm.

543
01:34:10,769 --> 01:34:14,307
You wanna go to a nice place,
you go to El Fronteras.

544
01:34:16,242 --> 01:34:18,153
So...

545
01:34:28,321 --> 01:34:29,959
...tell me...

546
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,305
...what's your name, by the way?

547
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:43,343
Well, my name is...
