00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,811
-Come on! Come on!
-OK, all right.

2
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:22,007
Will you hurry up?

3
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:36,057
I'm home.

4
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:37,893
Afternoon, Miss Edna.

5
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,899
Penny, your mother called.

6
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,834
Tracy Turnblad, can't you say
hello to Mrs. Malinski?

7
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:49,307
Every day she's got to watch
that Corny Collins Show.

8
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:51,333
Delinquents, if you ask me.

9
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:54,905
It ain't right to be dancin'
on TV to that colored music.

10
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,779
She's just a teenager.

11
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,852
-Good-bye, Mrs. Malinski.
-Good-bye, Edna.

12
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:05,517
Come on, baby,
gonna teach it to you

13
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,992
Mashed potato

14
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:09,518
Feel that groovy beat now

15
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,053
Mashed potato

16
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,224
Come on and move your feet
now, baby

17
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,961
-It's the latest
-Come on, honey

18
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,094
-It's the greatest
-Come on, baby

19
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,434
Mashed potato

20
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:22,199
Could you turn that racket down?

21
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,211
I'm tryin' to iron in here.

22
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:31,840
They found this dance
was so out of sight

23
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:36,151
To When the Lion Sleeps Tonight

24
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:40,182
-Mashed potato
-Mmm, yeah, mashed potato

25
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:47,833
Ladies and gentlemen,
Corny Collins!

26
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,095
Good afternoon, Baltimore ...

27
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,966
and welcome
to The Corny Collins Show.

28
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:54,967
That was Dee Dee Sharp ...

29
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:57,408
and today's bull's-eye hit,
Mashed Potato Time ...

30
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:59,912
and, hey, we've got
our first telegram of the day.

31
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,678
Thank you very much, Tammy.

32
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,709
"Please have Lou Ann Levorowski
and I.Q. Jones lead a dance."

33
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,914
Signed, "Your number one fan
in West Baltimore."

34
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:10,980
Here they come now.
Come on up here, kids.

35
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,889
-Hi, Corny.
-Hi, West Baltimore.

36
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,393
Lou Ann, you're
a pretty darn groovy chick.

37
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:16,088
How long have you been a regular
on the show?

38
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,324
I've been on the council
for five months.

39
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:21,528
-And you, I.Q.?
-Two out-of-sight years.

40
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:22,694
Not bad.

41
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:24,897
God, he's gorgeous, Penny.

42
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:27,736
Look at her hair.
Gosh, I wish mine was that high.

43
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:30,242
And what's your favorite record
from the survey?

44
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,402
-Gravy!
-Gravy!

45
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:34,038
All right. Here's I.Q. Jones
and Lou Ann Levorowski ...

46
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,846
leading our next dance, Give Me
Gravy on My Mashed Potatoes.

47
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,844
Come on, baby, I need gravy

48
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:45,847
Give me, give me, give me,
give me gravy tonight

49
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:49,487
I know you dance
the mashed potato fine

50
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,760
But that don't show me
that you're really mine

51
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:56,462
Once we're dancin',
we'll start romancin'

52
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:59,700
So put that somethin' extra
on the line

53
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,673
Give me gravy

54
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,266
On my mashed potatoes

55
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:05,277
Give me gravy

56
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,176
Come on and treat me right

57
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,147
Give me gravy

58
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:11,173
Baby, you're the greatest

59
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:14,983
So give me, give me, give me,
give me gravy tonight

60
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:20,923
Link, why don't you
tell the home viewers ...

61
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,086
where we're gonna be tonight?

62
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,494
Well, Corny,
we'll be at the Parkville VFW ...

63
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,863
For the Corny Collins
record hop.

64
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,664
Stuck-up little spastic.

65
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,967
She's such a queer.

66
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,098
What do you want to hear, Amber?

67
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,700
Shake a Tail Feather,
by the Five Du-tones.

68
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,677
Here they are,
the Five Du-tones.

69
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:49,544
I heard about this fellow
you been dancin' with

70
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,217
All over the neighborhood

71
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:55,716
Well, why didn't you
ask me, baby

72
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,424
Or didn't you think I could?

73
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:01,730
I know that
the bossa nova's worth a shot

74
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,669
I've seen him do the bird
all night

75
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:07,673
But if that was you and me
out there, baby

76
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:11,074
I would have shown you
how to do it right

77
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:12,271
Do it right

78
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,013
Bend over, let me see you
shake a tail feather

79
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,722
Twist it

80
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:34,165
Shake it, shake it, shake it,
shake it, baby

81
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:37,198
You should be on that council,
not her.

82
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,262
I know I should, Penny.

83
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,364
Hey, I'm going to that hop
tonight.

84
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,533
Oh, let me come.

85
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,975
We'll lie and say we're going
to the library to study.

86
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,638
It's a deal.

87
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,477
We'll meet at eight o'clock,
up on the avenue.

88
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:50,778
OK, young ladies.

89
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,445
I've had just about enough
of this screeching music.

90
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:56,717
Mother, we're watching
The Corny Collins Show!

91
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,986
Penny,
your mother called all frantic.

92
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,617
She said you are punished.

93
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,423
I'm always punished.

94
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:04,953
And, Tracy, I have told you
about that hair ...

95
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,899
all ratted up
like a teen-age Jezebel.

96
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,027
Oh, mother, you're so fifties.

97
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,300
Tracy's flamboyant flip
is all the rage, Miss Edna.

98
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,638
Jackie Kennedy, our first lady,
even rats her hair.

99
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:19,736
But Tracy ain't no first lady,
are you, Tracy?

100
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,476
No, sirree, she's a hairhopper.
That's what she is.

101
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:27,008
Now I've got nothin'
but hampers of ironing to do ...

102
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:29,419
and my diet pill is wearing off.

103
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:33,084
Tracy, I want you to go
to your room and study ...

104
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,855
and, Penny,
don't you be listening ...

105
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,419
to every bit of nonsense
that my daughter tells you.

106
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:41,229
lf I didn't know better,
I'd swear she was mental.

107
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:46,534
Now what? More soiled laundry
for mommy, I suppose.

108
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,541
Come in.

109
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,839
Edna, have you seen Penny?

110
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:54,438
Good lord, Prudy,
she's right over there.

111
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,606
Hi, mom.

112
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:58,674
Penny Pingleton,
you know you were punished.

113
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:01,448
From now on, you're wearing
a giant "P" on your blouse ...

114
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:02,613
every day to school ...

115
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:05,681
so that the whole world
knows that Penny Pingleton ...

116
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:08,785
is permanently, positively
punished!

117
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,188
-Eight o-clock.
-Bye, Miss Edna.

118
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:13,529
Bye, honey.

119
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:28,906
Oh, stop! Stop!

120
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:30,671
What is it?

121
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,735
Oh! Oh, my God!

122
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,675
-What's the matter?
-No, get off of me!

123
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:37,876
Don't look at me!

124
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,882
What's the matter?

125
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,552
I happen to have a blemish!

126
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,361
You had three good close-ups
today, period.

127
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,493
Why can't you dance up front
where the voters can see you?

128
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,436
Leave me alone, mother.
I have a pimple.

129
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,098
Ugh. And you had to choose
a colored record ...

130
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,731
as your favorite song,
didn't you?

131
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:03,742
That's nice for the neighbors.

132
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:06,370
You got something against
Connie Francis?

133
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:09,438
Shelley Fabares?
I love Shelley Fabares.

134
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,744
Amber, are you listening to me?

135
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:16,853
We have to have a little talk.

136
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,187
You know,
if your father is forced ...

137
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:22,456
to integrate Tilted Acres,
we're out of business ...

138
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,362
so, at least act white
on television.

139
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:26,660
Leave me alone, mother.

140
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,065
Shake a Tail Feather
is a wild song.

141
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,229
It's got a good beat,
and you can dance to it.

142
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,794
Oh, God, of all nights!

143
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,172
A Corny Collins record hop,
and I've got craters.

144
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,677
Oh, just pop it! Pop it!

145
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:40,736
Just relax. Relax.

146
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,578
Don't be ridiculous.
Take it easy.

147
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,585
Tension is the worst thing
for a complexion.

148
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:49,417
Come on. Lie down. Lie down.

149
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,013
No moping.

150
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,184
Mother is here.

151
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:57,459
You have beautiful skin, Amber.

152
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:05,268
There ... it's gone.

153
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:08,762
Now it's time for you know what

154
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:11,368
Mother, I know all the dances.

155
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,539
Come on. Get up. Get up!

156
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,377
Practice makes perfect.

157
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,316
I ought to know.

158
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:21,411
Don't forget,
I was Miss Soft Crab in 1945 ...

159
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,752
and that title wasn't handed
to me on a silver platter.

160
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,417
I worked for it.

161
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,824
Now come on. A-one, two ...

162
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,919
a-one, two, three, pony!

163
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:33,789
Mashed potatoes!

164
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:36,665
Faster!

165
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,600
Amber, l'd like to talk to you.

166
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:44,166
Yes, daddy?

167
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,145
-Don't stop. Cha-cha.
-I'm tired.

168
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,377
One, two, cha cha cha.
One, two, cha cha cha.

169
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,908
I had some new campaign fliers
made up today ...

170
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:56,945
all for daddy's little girl.

171
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:00,254
I want you to hand those out
at the hop tonight to everyone--

172
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:02,352
each and every one of those.

173
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:04,863
-Twist!
-Oh, daddy.

174
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:07,422
No lip from you, Miss lngrate.

175
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,935
This campaign is costing us
an arm and a leg.

176
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:13,427
New gowns,
hairdresser three times a week!

177
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,805
Why, your hairspray bill alone
is enough to eat up ...

178
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,867
all the profits
from the tilt-a-whirl.

179
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,172
You'll do as daddy says ...

180
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,679
or we'll send you
to catholic school ...

181
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,180
where you belong,
right, Franklin?

182
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,740
That's right. Catholic school.

183
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:28,379
Pass the macaroni and cheese ...
please.

184
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,480
Did you take that appetite
suppressant I gave you ...

185
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,218
on Dr. McKenzie's orders?

186
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,852
Mother, I'm a growing teenager.
I need food.

187
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:37,021
Let her eat, Edna.

188
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,964
Tracy, did you do your chores
around the house today?

189
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:44,594
Not Miss Tracy,
Cyd Charisse herself.

190
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:48,903
She's too busy ratting her hair
and doing the Ubangi stomp.

191
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:52,377
Tracy, we all have
responsibilities in life.

192
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,402
You may think owning
the Hardy Har joke shop ...

193
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,142
is all drudgery--

194
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:59,709
unwrapping dribble glasses,
checking doggie doo inventory--

195
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,014
but I wuv it.

196
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,148
You'll see. Work can be fun.

197
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:09,719
Can I please be excused
to go to the library to study?

198
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:13,190
Are you ready?

199
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:16,030
Let's have a ball
at the hall tonight

200
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,400
We'll groove and jerk
till the early light

201
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:21,372
Make the scene
with the record machine

202
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,103
And we'll dance and party
tonight

203
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:25,770
Come on ...

204
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,472
What's the problem, officer?

205
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:30,073
-This is a white establishment.
-Oh, come on.

206
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,947
Hey, listen,
we just came to dance.

207
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,948
-That's not fair.
-Open your purse, please.

208
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:41,415
And everything's all right

209
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,393
Go.

210
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,228
And every night
is Saturday night, yeah!

211
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:50,292
Let's go round,
bristol stompin', too

212
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,736
Hold me now
like it's all brand-new

213
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:55,502
Any dance that you want to do ...

214
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,608
Boys and girls,
stay on the dance floor.

215
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:04,843
Here comes
the hottest tune of the day ...

216
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,546
and it started
right here in Baltimore.

217
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,149
And where did you
see it first, kids?

218
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:18,061
The Corny Collins Show!

219
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,894
A big, strong line,
ladies and gentlemen.

220
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,196
It's Madison Time!

221
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,468
I can do that dance.

222
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,335
It's madison time. Hit it.

223
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,876
You're looking good.
A big, strong line.

224
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,815
When I say hit it, I want you
to go two up and two back ...

225
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:47,587
with a big, strong turn,
and back to the madison.

226
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,489
Hit it.

227
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,019
No. You dance better
than all of them.

228
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:53,463
Go ahead! Go!

229
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:55,864
You're looking good.

230
00:15:58,537 --> 00:15:59,868
Now when I say hit it ...

231
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:03,136
I want you to go two up
and two back, double cross ...

232
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,938
come out of it
with The Rifleman.

233
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,869
Hit it.

234
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:19,150
Crazy.

235
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:20,715
Now when I say hit it ...

236
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,228
I want the big, strong "M",
erase it ...

237
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:24,490
and back to the madison.

238
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:27,759
Hit it.

239
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:34,138
Walk on. You're lookin' good.

240
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:45,981
Now, then, when I say hit it,
it'll be T-time.

241
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,280
Hit it.

242
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,023
Big, strong line.

243
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,192
Now when I say hit it ...

244
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,098
I want the big, strong
basketball ...

245
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,898
with a Wilt Chamberlain hook.

246
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,868
Hit it.

247
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,709
Two points.

248
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,340
Now this time
when I say hit it ...

249
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:19,783
I want the big, strong
Jackie Gleason ...

250
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,184
and back to the madison.

251
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:25,546
Hit it.

252
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,457
And away we go.

253
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:32,329
Crazy.

254
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:34,094
When I say hit it,
go two up and two back ...

255
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,828
double cross, and freeze.

256
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,028
Hit it.

257
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,906
And hold it right there.

258
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:56,450
All right. Hold on to your hats,
all you continental rockers ...

259
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,286
'cause
it's dance contest time ...

260
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:01,384
and we've got the wildest judge
in town.

261
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,622
You listen to her every night
on WEDD ...

262
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,960
and she hosts Negro Day
on The Corny Collins Show ...

263
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,590
the last Thursday
of every month.

264
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,966
A warm welcome for
the queen of Baltimore soul ...

265
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:14,370
Miss Motormouth Maybelle
herself, ladies and gentlemen!

266
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:17,501
Let's hear it, Baltimore--
Motormouth Maybelle!

267
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:21,946
All right, here she comes,
looking very fine.

268
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:27,783
Ooh whee! Tiddley papa!
I am a whopper!

269
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:32,788
Motormouth Maybelle

270
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:35,953
and, sweetheart,
dancin' is my game.

271
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:45,904
All right!
Chubby Checker and Pony Time!

272
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,305
It's pony time! Get up!

273
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,837
Hey, now, let's party

274
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,746
ln the Union Hall

275
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:59,808
It's pony time

276
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,547
When you hear this call

277
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,981
So get with it

278
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:06,616
Don't quit it

279
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:07,819
Get up

280
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:12,225
OK, fatso,
let's see what you're made of.

281
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:15,563
Or it'll make boss lines

282
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:18,263
But any way you're doin' it

283
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,329
You're gonna look real fine

284
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,531
So get with it

285
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:25,567
Don't quit it

286
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,771
Get up

287
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:32,014
Now you turn to the left
when I say gee

288
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:34,849
You turn to the right
when I say haw

289
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,856

00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:55,371
Gonna see little Suzy

295
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:57,500
Who lives next door

296
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,546
She's doin' the pony

297
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,344
She's takin' the floor

298
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:07,011
Yeah, so get with it

299
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,451
Don't quit it

300

All right!

301
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:19,890
All right, Motormouth,
just three couples left.

302
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,832
Tammy,
bring on the applause meter.

303
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,527
Isit going to be
couple number one?

304
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,902
Or is it couple number two?

305
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:38,717
Or shall it be
couple number three?

306
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:50,489
All right.

307
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,020
I think we have a winner ...

308
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:54,999
and that winner is ...

309
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:59,494
I love 'em tender,
Tracy and Fender.

310
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:00,903
All right!

311
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,341
Tracy Turnblad and Fender.

312
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:12,015
Tracy Turnblad, you are
the queen of the hop tonight.

313
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:13,814
Listen, we're holding auditions
for the council tomorrow.

314
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,717
You ought to come down
and strut your stuff.

315
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,984
Oh, Corny, do you really think
I'm good enough?

316
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:19,183
What do you think, kids?

317
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:25,255
I hear ya.
Thanks for comin' down, Tracy.

318
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,457
We'll see you tomorrow.

319
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,159
Now, Motormouth,
I think it's time ...

320
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,363
we slowed things down a little
with Mr. Gene Pitney.

321
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:35,396
You can't hide your face
in this godforsaken place.

322
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:40,037
Here in your own city,
there's a town without pity.

323
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,876
Gene Pitney,
ladies and gentlemen.

324
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,763
When you're young
and so in love as we

325
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,601
And bewildered
by the world we see

326
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:10,040
Why do people hurt us so?

327
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:12,942
Only those in love would know

328
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:18,473
What a town without pity can do

329
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,179
Whore.

330
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:36,730
How can we keep love alive?

331
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:39,897
How can anything survive

332
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:45,570
When these little minds
tear you in two?

333
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:51,675
What a town without pity can do

334
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:54,914
No, it isn't very pretty

335
00:22:54,953 --> 00:23:09,960
What a town without pity can do

336
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:59,341
Thank you, girls.

337
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,750
And now it's time to move on
to a little something ...

338
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:03,846
we call the spotlight.

339
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:12,357
OK. First girl--Miss Pingleton?

340
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,124
I'm just a little nervous.

341
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:18,295
This is show business,
young lady.

342
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:20,032
lf you think
you're nervous now ...

343
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:22,700
Ha!
Wait till you're on the air.

344
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:25,437
OK, first question?

345
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:29,837
Are you now,
or have you ever gone steady?

346
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:32,009
Well, I'm not going
with anybody now ...

347
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,950
but l'd love to date
a council member.

348
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:36,513
Yeah, right.

349
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:38,455
Come on!

350
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,720
Exactly how many sweaters
do you have?

351
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,388
Gee, I never counted.
I guess about five.

352
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,090
-Five?
-Five?

353
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,963
Next.

354
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:54,666
Nadine Carver,
Eastern High School.

355
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:55,900
Are you aware that Negro Day ...

356
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,738
is the last Thursday
of every month?

357
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:00,677
Yes.
I've been on it a few times.

358
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:04,705
I feel the show
should be integrated every day.

359
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,240
Yeah, right.

360
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:09,777
Can you relate
to Leslie Gore's music?

361
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:12,586
Look,
she ain't no James Brown ...

362
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:16,788
but I can dance to Lawrence Welk
if I have to.

363
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:20,560
-Lawrence Welk?
-Thank you, Nadine.

364
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,726
Tracy Turnblad.

365
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:32,869
Would you do a pimple cream
commercial on camera ...

366
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,879
if Corny asked you to?

367
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:36,278
I'd be proud to.

368
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,250
Luckily, I've never been cursed
with acne ...

369
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:40,581
like others ...

370
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:43,315
but I realize the devastating
effect of skin blemishes ...

371
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,346
on the social life of teenagers.

372
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:49,559
Would you ever swim ...

373
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:51,756
in an integrated swimming pool?

374
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,287
Oh, my God.

375
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:55,732
I certainly would, lggy.

376
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:59,533
I'm a modern kind of girl.
I'm all for integration.

377
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,005
Aren't you a little fat
for the show?

378
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,405
That's enough, Amber.

379
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:05,740
I would imagine
that many of the home viewers ...

380
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:08,041
are also pleasantly plump
or chunky.

381
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,981
Oh, come on. The show's
not filmed in cinemascope.

382
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,210
You're out of line, Amber.

383
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:16,551
Corny, Tammy, can't you see?
This girl's a trash can.

384
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:17,953
That's five demerit points.

385
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,423
You're suspended
from the show today.

386
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,686
Pack up your things and go home.

387
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:22,717
Oh, my God.

388
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:24,490
But I was supposed to lead
the ladies' choice.

389
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,394
I'm sure we can find
a replacement.

390
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:31,499
Please wait outside.

391
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,800
The council
will now meet in secret ...

392
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,741
debate your personality flaws,
and come to a final decision.

393
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,777
Miss Edna! Miss Edna!

394
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,876
Penny Pingleton,
you'll wake the dead.

395
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,478
Tracy's not home yet.

396
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:52,217
Plus, your mother called,
and she's on the warpath.

397
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:54,088
I know, Miss Edna.
Can I come in?

398
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,219
There's something
you've both got to see.

399
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,229
Well, yeah, come on up ...

400
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:01,664
but I've got ironing,
and Wilbur's working.

401
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,361
Mr. Turnblad!

402
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,808
It's not war with Cuba, is it?

403
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:15,506
-Or more negro problems?
-No. You'll see.

404
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,573
Did poor Debbie Reynolds
have a nervous breakdown?

405
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,050
This better be good.

406
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:23,612
Broad daylight, and
I'm sittin' in front of a TV.

407
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:25,748
I've seen The Corny Collins
Show, thank you, Penny.

408
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:26,917
Just watch.

409
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:30,395
I just lost
a $2.69 Silly Putty sale.

410
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,694
-This better be worth it.
-Wait, you'll see. Just watch.

411
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:35,097
-What's your name?
-I'm Ruby.

412
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,828
-And you?
-Dee Dee!

413
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:38,233
-And what about you?
-I'm Lucille.

414
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,170
Now, where are you gonna be
appearing tonight?

415
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:42,366
We'll be at the Royal Theater ...

416
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:45,740
-At Motormouth Maybelle's ...
-All Soul Review.

417
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:47,108
All right,
ladies and gentlemen ...

418
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,875
a big hand for Baltimore's own
Trinklettes.

419
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:52,008
I closed up shop for this?

420
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,415
Just wait.

421
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:54,919
All right,
let's keep the music playing ...

422
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:57,080
and the hits a-turning
with Mr. Gene Chandler ...

423
00:27:57,122 --> 00:28:00,387
because the Duke of Earl
loves to cha-cha.

424
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:02,484
Duke, duke, duke of earl

425
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:05,587
There! There! Look! It's Tracy!

426
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,259
Oh, my God.
She's all peroxided up.

427
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,896
I'll be damned. Tracy's on TV.

428
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:14,599
With a triple process, yet.

429
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,802
But Tracy was accepted
on the Corny Collins Council.

430
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:21,836
Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad,
your daughter's a star.

431
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,347
Duke of earl

432
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,977
And you, you are my girl

433
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,510
And no one can hurt you

434
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:31,283
Oh, no

435
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:34,190
Oh, see?
She's already getting close-ups.

436
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:37,457
Does she get paid for this?
Big as a house!

437
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:39,657
I think she looks pretty, Edna.

438
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:48,265
'Cause I'm the duke of earl

439
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,867
Yes, I'm watching her now.

440
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,709
You are? Well, thank you.

441
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,908
Yes. Good-bye.

442
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:01,778
That was Hilda
from up Conklin Street.

443
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,685
She's going to send a telegram.

444
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:07,049
Oh, God! There she is!

445
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:13,293
Yes, l ...

446
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:15,094
Oh, I'm gonna love you

447
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,804
Nothing can stop me now

448
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,173
'Cause I'm the duke of earl

449
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,411
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to introduce ...

450
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:40,016
someone very special--
a brand-new council member ...

451
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:41,582
making her first appearance
on the show ...

452
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:42,888
and we already have telegrams.

453
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:44,190
Why don't you introduce
yourself?

454
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:48,165
Hi, Corny! I'm Tracy Turnblad,
and I go to Mervel High!

455
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:54,371
Well, Tracy,
someone out there likes you.

456
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,466
"Please have the new girl
lead a ladies' choice."

457
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,909
I was supposed to lead
the ladies' choice!

458
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,537
Tell me, Tracy,
are you going steady?

459
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,175
No, I'm not, Corny, but there is
somebody I've got a crush on.

460
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:08,152
Who, l'd like to know?
She's just a child.

461
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:11,822
Well, let's see
who the lucky guy is.

462
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:14,485
Ladies and gentlemen,
a ladies' choice.

463
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,892
Hi, Tracy! It's me, Penny!

464
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:18,725
She can't hear you.

465
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,701
Oh, she better hadn't dare!

466
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:32,502
lf you should lose me

467
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:36,010
Oh, yeah

468
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,607
You'll lose a good thing

469
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:47,889
lf you should lose me

470
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,951
Oh, yeah

471
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:53,954
You'll lose a good thing

472
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:00,737
You know I love you

473
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,866
Do anything for you

474
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:07,837
Oh, God!

475
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:10,939
He's violated the oath
of the friendship ring!

476
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,811
Aw, don't cry, honey.

477
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:21,121
You'll lose a good thing

478
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,961
I'm givin' you one more chance

479
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,697
For you to do right

480
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:37,033
lf you'll only straighten up

481
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:39,066
We'll have a good life

482
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,078
That fat girl's no competition!

483
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:43,512
White trash, plain and simple!

484
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:47,211
For all we know,
that girl could be high yellow.

485
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,516
Oh, mommy, daddy ...

486
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:52,318
I'll still be the queen
of the auto show, won't l?

487
00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:54,348
Aw, honey.

488
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:16,605
No, she's not here.

489
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:19,082
Well, I'm sure
she loves you, too.

490
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:22,245
Yes, thank you. Good-bye.

491
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:23,914
This is amazing!

492
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:26,185
She's so popular already!

493
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:29,091
She could be one
of the June Taylor dancers.

494
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:42,395
Well, yes,
I am Tracy Turnblad's agent.

495
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,032
Give me a pencil! Quick! Quick!

496
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:49,809
How may I help you?

497
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,914
Oh, Tracy, you were wonderful!

498
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,583
Honey, we're real proud of you.

499
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,119
Oh, sweetie, listen.

500
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,787
Tomorrow, if you could get up
just a little bit closer ...

501
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,352
so we can see you better, OK?

502
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:08,457
And maybe even give
the Hardy Har a little p-p-plug.

503
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,866
Oh, mom, dad ...

504
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:13,530
Oh, Penny, my best friend ...

505
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:15,562
I'm so happy!

506
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:18,098
Finally,
all of Baltimore knows--

507
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:22,045
I'm big, blonde, and beautiful.

508
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,741
You're a teen leader now!

509
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:26,273
And the show biz offers
are pouring in.

510
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:28,115
Tonight, we have an audition ...

511
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,745
and, honey,
this is only the beginning.

512
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:32,450
Stick with me, and
we'll claw our way to the top!

513
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,821
Oh, God!

514
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:38,386
Fame, fortune, glamour ...

515
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,261
and to top it off ...

516
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,468
I'm in love!

517
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:49,365
Wow, Tracy, you're really tough!

518
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:09,384
Ooh, Tracy, what do you think
about this one?

519
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:10,553
I like it.

520
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:12,722
Wilbur would kill us
if we spent that much money.

521
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,494
You look gorgeous, Bertha,
simply exquisite!

522
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,865
Oh, I don't know, Pinky.

523
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:19,130
Have an eclair.

524
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:23,307
Eat up, girls, eat up.
Big is beautiful.

525
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:24,740
Tracy Turnblad!

526
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:27,870
Welcome to the Hefty Hideaway
house of fashion ...

527
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:30,574
for the ample woman.
Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky.

528
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:36,211
Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business
manager, Edna Turnblad.

529
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:38,017
Well, it's a pleasure to meet
the both of you.

530
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:40,547
Here, we cater to the big-boned
gals like yourself ...

531
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:42,822
who are stylish and
at the same time frustrated ...

532
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:45,261
by the lack of sizes
in the department stores today.

533
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:47,594
I saw you on TV.
I want you to be my model!

534
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:50,726
Would she be paid for this?

535
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,396
One free outfit a month.

536
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:53,734
You start tomorrow.

537
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,467
I hope there's no diets
in the works ...

538
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:56,633
because I want to design ...

539
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:59,336
your Miss Auto Show
coronation gown myself!

540
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,538
Could you throw in a pair ...

541
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,308
of complimentary pettipants
in the deal?

542
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:06,442
You drive a hard bargain,
Miss Edna, and rightfully so.

543
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:08,042
Pettipants, pettigirdle--

544
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,951
you just let Tracy
take her pick.

545
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:12,650
How about a fabulous frock
just for me?

546
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,851
Tracy'll have to work
one extra day for free.

547
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:17,555
It's a deal!
Thank you, Mr. Pinky.

548
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:20,325
I'm going to make you a star!

549
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:27,702
I hope your father likes this.

550
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,934
He's going to love it.
You look beautiful.

551
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:31,373
It's the new you.

552
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:34,003
Mom, come on! Come on!

553
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:35,376
Go in the beauty shop?

554
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:37,313
Yes!
You haven't done that in years.

555
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:39,077
Come on, mom. You deserve it.

556
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,585
-No. Wilbur will kill me.
-Come on!

557
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,712
Oh, OK.
You really think I should?

558
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:57,531
Come on, mom.

559
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:03,874
Mama, welcome to the sixties.

560
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:08,475
Listen, I'll talk to you
after biology.

561
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:10,310
See you after P.E., guys.

562
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:11,713
ln the figure shown ...

563
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:17,051
line segment AB
and line segment CD ...

564
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:19,249
are chords of the circle.

565
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,249
Line segment PA
and line segment PC--

566
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:26,422
What is the problem, Mr. Davis?

567
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,900
I can't see through her hair.

568
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:32,266
I can't help it if he's short.

569
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:33,964
Your ratted hair
is preventing ...

570
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:37,270
yet another student's
geometry education.

571
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:40,038
It's feathered, not ratted.

572
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:44,014
Whatever you call it,
it's a hair-don't.

573
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:46,380
You've been warned repeatedly.

574
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:50,478
I want you to take a little walk
down to the principal's office.

575
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,456
Let's see what he has to say.

576
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:12,768
Anyway,
she was right in the car ...

577
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,179
in plain sight of just everybody
at the hop.

578
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:18,512
She was nude.

579
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,677
-No.
-That fat thing?

580
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:23,380
Tracy Turnblad is a whore.

581
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:28,549
-Happy now?
-But, mom, I didn't do--

582
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:31,721
-Don't "But, mom" me.
-l didn't! He's lying!

583
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:34,357
Ow! What was that for?

584
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,264
I'll give you something
to whine about.

585
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,633
Might as well just forget
that TV.

586
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,899
Miss Turnblad?

587
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,407
Have a seat.

588
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:55,976
Yes, sir.

589
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:04,854
Once again, your hairdo
is getting you in hot water.

590
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:08,798
Didn't two weeks in hairdo
detention have any effect?

591
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:12,132
I happen to be
the height of teen fashion.

592
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,765
You're on a one-way ticket
to reform school.

593
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:19,265
I'm afraid we're just going
to have to change your homeroom.

594
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,509
Starting today, you report
to class 10-D, room 108.

595
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:25,880
Special ed?

596
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:29,444
Yes, Miss Turnblad,
special education.

597
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:31,045
But that's for retards ...

598
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:33,717
and the black kids
you try to hold back.

599
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:36,522
Here, you will be taught
by specialists ...

600
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:38,995
trained to deal
with hairdo scofflaws ...

601
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,793
in high school society.

602
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:42,322
Mr. Davidson!

603
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,562
That will be all, Miss Turnblad.

604
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:48,470
The city of Baltimore has
an interesting Catholic history.

605
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,804
It was named after
Lord Baltimore.

606
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:54,744
He founded the Maryland colony
for Catholics and others ...

607
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:57,247
who could not practice
their religion in England.

608
00:39:05,356 --> 00:39:07,381
Hey, don't touch my stuff!

609
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,222
I'll kick your ass!

610
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,591
Take it back!

611
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,871
Teach us how to dance, honey.

612
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,642
Come on,
show us what you've got, honey.

613
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,352
Go! Go! Go!

614
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:47,257
Good morning, class.

615
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:49,732
Good morning, Mrs. Shipley.

616
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:54,204
Now let's all stand and say
the pledge of allegiance.

617
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:05,707
I pledge allegiance
to the flag ...

618
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,082
of the United States
of America--

619
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:13,920
And one and two ...

620
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,255
and three and four.

621
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,853
Let's warm it up.

622
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,954
Come on, Amber,
can't we just be friends?

623
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:23,623
You're acting like a child.

624
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:25,829
Here we go with jumping jacks.

625
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,065
Let's go and one ...

626
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:29,903
and two and three ...

627
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,773
Now, as you all know, today
is special education's turn ...

628
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,437
at the dodgeball tournament.

629
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,610
So let's get
into the locker room ...

630
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,811
put on those gym outfits ...

631
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,480
and show them
that special education ...

632
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:45,682
is nothing to laugh about.

633
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,351
And three and four--

634
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:50,360
Hey, look! It's special ed!

635
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:59,500
This is special ed?

636
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:13,148
Special ed in the red!

637
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:17,748
All right, ladies, let's go.
Let's play dodgeball.

638
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:22,421
Penny, they put me in special ed
just 'cause of my hair!

639
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:27,029
Hey, I saw you
on The Corny Collins Show.

640
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:29,157
Where'd a white girl
learn how to dance like that?

641
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,394
Just practicing.

642
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:33,198
Oh, and watching Negro Day
on Corny Collins.

643
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:35,831
Hey, thunder thighs,
this one's for you!

644
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:38,933
-Grow up, Amber.
-God, I love this game!

645
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:41,206
My mama says Negro Day
ain't nothin' but segregation.

646
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,940
-Your mama?
-Yeah.

647
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,847
None other than
Motormouth Maybelle herself.

648
00:41:45,883 --> 00:41:47,145
I'm Seaweed.

649
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:51,312
Hey, Penny, see
the colored boy--the cute one?

650
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:53,880
His mother
is Motormouth Maybelle!

651
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,688
He's gorgeous!

652
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:02,896
I'll get the fat retard!

653
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,700
Game over!
Let's hit the showers!

654
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:16,670
Did you see that?

655
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,177
Aw, you're all right, girl.

656
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:22,516
Are you sure she's all right?

657
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:25,587
She'll be OK.

658
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:28,524
It's not who wins.
It's how you play the game.

659
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:33,689
Tracy,
would you go steady with me?

660
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:39,127
Come on, everybody

661
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,637
Clap your hands

662
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,935
Ah, you're lookin' good

663
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:44,805
I'm gonna sing my song

664
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,309
It won't take long

665
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:49,575
We're gonna do the twist,
and it goes like this

666
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:52,310
Come on, let's twist again

667
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,841
Like we did last summer

668
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:57,980
Yeah, let's twist again

669
00:42:58,022 --> 00:43:01,048
Like we did last year

670
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:03,754
Do you remember when

671
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:06,262
Things were really hummin'?

672
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:09,425
Yeah, let's twist again

673
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,697
Twistin' time is here

674
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:15,962
Round and round and up and down

675
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:18,669
We go again

676
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:23,373
Oh, baby,
make me know you love me so

677
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,611
And then twist again

678
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:29,211
Like we did last summer

679
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:32,381
Girl, let's twist again

680
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:35,051
Like we did last year

681
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:38,061
Come on and twist again

682
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:41,428
Twistin' time is here

683
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:48,235
Five, four, three, two, one.

684
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:49,762
You're on the air.

685
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,900
Fatty, fatty, two by four.

686
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:53,535
Can't get through
the dressin' room door?

687
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:56,102

00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:33,673
She's prettier

704
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:35,447
Thank you, Mr. Pinky.

to the bottom of the well

799
00:49:18,002 --> 00:49:19,526
He swear by the devil that he--

800
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,902
I'm not gonna say that!

801
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:23,600
Move on ahead

802
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:26,508
lf he ain't a hit,
you better holler till he go

803
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,138
Don't anybody come near me!

804
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:35,879
I'm armed, and
I'm prepared to protect myself!

805
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:39,819
Oh, God, mother!

806
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:44,556
I know you were snatched, Penny,
and I've come to save you!

807
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:47,655
Ooh, papa tuney, we got a loony.

808
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:52,863
Don't you try any of your voodoo
spells on me, you native woman!

809
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:54,871
We're just dancing.

810
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,736
Mrs. Pingleton,
stop acting crazy!

811
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:58,139
These are our friends.

812
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:00,370
Don't act ignorant,
Tracy Turnblad.

813
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:02,311
-Come on, Penny.
-Mother!

814
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:05,076
Come on. Run! Run!

815
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:06,844
Run for your life!

816
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:11,714
Don't push, please. Don't push.

817
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:14,087
Settle down. It's hot. Please.

818
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:16,684
lf you'll just stay still,
you won't be so hot ...

819
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:21,692
You're gonna do terrific,
all right?

820
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:23,632
Oh, it's gonna be a lot of fun.

821
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:34,141
Come on, come on

822
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:36,510
And do the fly with me

823
00:50:37,348 --> 00:50:40,078
Hey, come on, everybody

824
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:43,416
And do the fly with me

825
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:46,116
Well, if you don't know
how to do it

826
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:48,454
Just watch and see

827
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,987
You got to shake your hands
all around

828
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:54,589
Like a fly in the sky ...

829
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:09,807
What the hell?

830
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,872
What are they doin' here?

831
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:13,439
Look what she's wearing.

832
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:16,180
Hurry up, but watch your step.

833
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,653
-You all together?
-Yeah.

834
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:20,156
Well, I'm sorry, but preteen day
is a white only show.

835
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,714
Negro day
is the end of the month.

836
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:23,989
Now, you can come on in
or get out of line, all right?

837
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:25,756
You mean you're gonna
turn this little girl away?

838
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:27,957
Look, I don't make the rules,
all right?

839
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:30,990
Aren't you aware of the supreme
court ruling on segregation?

840
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:34,401
I just want you to either
come in or don't, all right?

841
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:36,531
I have a dream.

842
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,632
You heard the man.
You're holding up the line.

843
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:41,576
Segregation never!
lntegration now!

844
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:43,341
Cut it out! Knock it off!

845
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:48,579
Sarge, come here. Come here.
Hold 'em. All right.

846
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:51,949
Ok, all you little tykes.

847
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:53,854
We got a real treat
in store for you.

848
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:56,086
A local group
with a big hit record.

849
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:58,686
Let's have a warm welcome,
come on, for The Lafayettes.

850
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,530
-Mother.
-Go on.

851
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:06,900
What are you waitin' for?

852
00:52:12,075 --> 00:52:14,942
Well, life's too short

853
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:16,411
And you're too sweet

854
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:20,378
Every day of your life, child

855
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:22,282
You gotta spend with me

856
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,116
Now let me tell you about Sally

857
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:29,216
She's really tough

858
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:31,819
Girl, you're no boss to me

859
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:34,057
Mr. Collins,
there's some trouble outside.

860
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:36,190
There's a little black girl
who wants to be on the show.

861
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:37,996
Well, let her in, for God sakes.

862
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:41,198
The station management says no.
She's with some agitators.

863
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:42,796
I'm afraid a demonstration's
in the works.

864
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,671
OK, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

865
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,102
-Stop. Where are you going?
-Wait, I gotta go. Mother!

866
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:50,443
Tracy, you're a teen helper.
You can't go.

867
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:53,279
You can't change
the world's problems in one day.

868
00:52:59,923 --> 00:53:02,391
l--l keep a-tellin' you

869
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:15,268
I said I told you, baby

870
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:18,274
Two, four, six, eight.
TV's got to integrate!

871
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:20,799
Tracy, please sit down
and stop this, please.

872
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:22,869
Hey, you, can I ask you
a personal question?

873
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:24,039
No, you can't.

874
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:27,710
-Isyour daughter mulatto?
-Why, you!

875
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,446
Look at this!

876
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:32,717
How dare you call my daughter
a mulatto!

877
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:34,690
Tracy! Tracy, come back here!

878
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:37,751
Two, four, six, eight.
TV's got to integrate!

879
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:07,121
Now, kids, we're gonna get
real lovey-dovey.

880
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:08,556
I know this is
one of your favorite records ...

881
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:09,718
and it's one of mine, too.

882
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,354
Leslie Gore,
sing your heart out.

883
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:25,774
Can I have this dance?

884
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,071
Sure.

885
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:30,274
You don't own me

886
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:32,509
What difference does it make,
Mr. Hodgepile?

887
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:33,811
One little black girl?

888
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,909
Who are you--the N.A.A.C.P.?

889
00:54:35,953 --> 00:54:39,286
But it's an easy way
to integrate without trouble.

890
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:41,052
Absolutely not!

891
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:44,288
Baltimore is not ready
for integrated dancing!

892
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:47,496
Who do they think they are?

893
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:50,466
Please, when I go out with you

894
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,867
Don't put me on display

895
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:58,364
'Cause you don't own me

896
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:02,936
Don't try to change me
in any way

897
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,074
Two, four, six, eight.
TV's got to integrate!

898
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:08,016
Aah! That's the fuzz!

899
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:11,252
Well, that's it for today, kids.

900
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:14,485
See you tomorrow at 3:00,
live at Tilted Acres.

901
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:16,424
I don't tell you what to say

902
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,590
I don't tell you what to do

903
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:59,394
I wanna tell all you people

904
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:01,734
I dropped a penny in the well

905
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:04,673
Hoping you would come back soon

906
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:08,041
I couldn't believe what I heard

907
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:10,171
My fortune teller told me

908
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:13,410
My love with you was doomed

909
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,715
I hope her reading was wrong

910
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,721
I hope she was wrong

911
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:21,087
'Cause you've been gone too long

912
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:22,648
Oh, come home

913
00:57:01,264 --> 00:57:06,201
Black Baltimore, your mother
is ready to show her might ...

914
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:08,727
and fight, fight, fight!

915
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:14,376
All right, now.

916
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:16,971
After school,
you know where to go--

917
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:18,878
Tilted Acres, for the show.

918
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:20,075
Segregation?

919
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:42,538
All right, now. I want
to introduce you to my main man.

920
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:44,164
I'm his biggest fan.

921
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,038
All the way from Louisiana ...

922
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:48,510
just to see me,
the big mamma jamma.

923
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:52,606
Now, I want a ball in this hall,
because he's a real doll.

924
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:56,016
Talkin' about Toussaint McCall.

925
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:19,635
I moved your picture

926
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:24,841
From my wall

927
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:29,409
And I replaced them

928
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:32,444
Both large and small

929
00:58:34,157 --> 00:58:38,856
And each new day

930
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:42,695
Finds me so blue

931
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:47,231
Nothing

932
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:52,831
Takes the place of you

933
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:58,337
And, oh, my darling

934
00:58:58,381 --> 00:59:01,373
I'm so blue

935
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,945
Because nothing

936
00:59:05,989 --> 00:59:08,685
Oh, nothing

937
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:12,161
Takes the place of you

938
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:18,390
As

939
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:21,336
I write this letter

940
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:26,269
It's raining

941
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:29,642
On my window pane

942
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:36,613
And

943
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:40,186
I feel the need of you

944
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:44,791
Because without you

945
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:49,894
Nothing seems the same

946
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:54,863
So I'll wait

947
00:59:57,374 --> 01:00:00,002
Until you're home

948
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:05,609
Again I'll love you

949
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:10,115
But I'm all alone

950
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:15,657
And, oh, my darling

951
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:22,258
Oh, Link. This is so romantic.

952
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:26,493
I wish ...

953
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:28,731
I wish I was dark-skinned.

954
01:00:32,742 --> 01:00:35,233
Our souls are black ...

955
01:00:35,278 --> 01:00:37,405
even though our skin is white.

956
01:00:41,785 --> 01:00:45,118
Oh, Seaweed,
will integration ever come?

957
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:49,251
Oh, Penny,
my little white lily ...

958
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:54,252
we're outcast from both
societies--black, white.

959
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:56,162
Our love is taboo.

960
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:58,429
Oh, go to second. Go to second.

961
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:10,476
Seaweed, look!

962
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:16,252
Tracy Turnblad, it's your mommy!

963
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:18,811
Oh, my God, it's my mother!

964
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:20,755
-She's gonna kill us!
-I'm gonna die!

965
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:24,321
Where are they?

966
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:26,955
Don't run, Tracy! You'll fall!

967
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:28,965
You have heels on!

968
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,398
You'll fall, honey!

969
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:35,294
Oh, thank God. Can we please
come in for a little while?

970
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:36,896
-Open up!
-Please!

971
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,932
Oh, come on. Open up!

972
01:01:39,976 --> 01:01:41,409
Can we come in?

973
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:43,275
Come on, guys! Come on! Come on!

974
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:49,177
Like, hi, cats.

975
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:50,743
Sit down.

976
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:54,716
You got the fuzz chasin' you?

977
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:56,453
No, we were--

978
01:01:56,493 --> 01:01:59,360
Wow, you cats are real beatniks.

979
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:00,522
Just like New York.

980
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:04,499
Day-o, day-o

981
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:07,935
Daylight's a-comin',
and he wanna go home

982
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:12,765
You two checkerboard chicks?

983
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:14,572
What?

984
01:02:14,611 --> 01:02:17,808
You know, black and white,
salt and pepper.

985
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:22,307
Well, yes, I'm
a checkerboard chick, I guess.

986
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:30,359
I'm an integrationist.

987
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:32,725
We shall overcome someday.

988
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:34,491
Not with that hair, you won't.

989
01:02:35,732 --> 01:02:38,530
You look like a hairhopper
to me.

990
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:42,834
I mean,
your hair is really uncool.

991
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:47,502
How do you get your hair
so straight and so flat?

992
01:02:47,544 --> 01:02:49,341
With an iron, man.

993
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:51,574
I play my bongos,
listen to Odetta ...

994
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:54,583
and then I iron my hair, dig?

995
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:57,651
I think
we'd better get going now.

996
01:02:57,687 --> 01:02:59,917
The coast looks clear.

997
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:01,116
Let's do some reefer.

998
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:03,523
We'll get high,
and I'll iron the chicks' hair.

999
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,221
Reefer?

1000
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:09,158
Drugs?

1001
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,632
Locoweed.

1002
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:14,125
When I'm high, I am Odetta.

1003
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:17,933
Let's get naked and smoke.

1004
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,134
Cool.

1005
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,803
Don't breathe it in.
You'll be addicted.

1006
01:03:22,846 --> 01:03:25,076
Later, sister, later ...
Much later.

1007
01:03:25,115 --> 01:03:26,912
"l saw the best minds
of my generation ...

1008
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,748
"destroyed by madness,
starving, hysterical, naked ...

1009
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:34,348
"dragging themselves
through the naked streets ...

1010
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:36,984
"...burning up for the ancient,
heavenly connection..."

1011
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,660
-Oh, hi, dad.
-Dad?

1012
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:48,102
Don't "Hi, dad" me. The whole
world saw you on the news.

1013
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:50,504
Penny, this is Dr. Frederickson.

1014
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:54,237
He's a psychiatrist, and he's
going to make you all better.

1015
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:56,939
Feeling depressed, Penny?
Want to talk about it?

1016
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,414
Think of all the white boys
in school ...

1017
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:01,542
and how much
you'd like to date one.

1018
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:03,711
Be a good little girl
and slip this on.

1019
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:05,220
I'm telling you,
shock treatments are the answer.

1020
01:04:05,255 --> 01:04:06,813
Come here, Penny.

1021
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:08,414
What are you doing?

1022
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,824
Good girl. Good girl.

1023
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,452
I love you, Seaweed!

1024
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:14,326
-Shut up!
-Get her in the car!

1025
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:16,332
It's gonna be all right,
dumpling. Get her, doc, quick!

1026
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:18,698
Prudy,
this is totally unnecessary.

1027
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:20,396
Come on, honey. Time to go home.

1028
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:21,926
You can see Link tomorrow.
Come on.

1029
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:23,495
We've been worried sick
about you.

1030
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,906
This neighborhood is
certainly no place for a star.

1031
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:27,773
Now, get in that car
before someone sees you.

1032
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:42,017
Tilted Acres is not fair--
racist people everywhere.

1033
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:50,861
Get out of here!

1034
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,527
Go back where you belong!

1035
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:55,129
Well, personally,
I have nothing against them.

1036
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:58,368
It's merely a matter
of economics.

1037
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:00,876
Tilted acres
will never be integrated.

1038
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:03,970
-Segregation today.
-Segregation tomorrow.

1039
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:05,878
Segregation forever!

1040
01:05:53,162 --> 01:05:56,825
One black face gets on camera,
this show's off the air.

1041
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:59,357
The kids don't care
if blacks dance on the show.

1042
01:05:59,402 --> 01:06:01,097
Can't you see
this is ripping the city apart?

1043
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:03,833
Motormouth Maybelle is
out there, and she's our friend.

1044
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:07,138
We've done hops together
for years. The kids love her.

1045
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:09,508
Look, The Corny Collins Show
remains white ...

1046
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:10,842
Or you're all fired!

1047
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:18,320
Good afternoon, Baltimore ...

1048
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:20,822
and welcome
to The Corny Collins Show.

1049
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:22,848
Yes, we are live
from Tilted Acres ...

1050
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:25,156
so hop in the car
and bring the whole family out.

1051
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:26,752
Right now
I want to introduce to you ...

1052
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:29,026
the top contenders
in the Miss Auto Show contest--

1053
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:32,034
Amber Von Tussle
and Tracy Turnblad.

1054
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:38,003
Now, I understand you're both
going to introduce ...

1055
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:39,770
a brand-new dance
on the show today.

1056
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:42,972
Yes, I am, Corny.
It's called the limbo rock ...

1057
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:46,743
and I bet some people
will find it quite difficult.

1058
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:49,251
Here it is--the limbo rock.

1059
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:01,963
Every limbo boppin' girl

1060
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:04,558
All around the limbo world

1061
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,034
Isgonna do the limbo rock

1062
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:10,096
All around the limbo clock

1063
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:12,903
Jack be limber, Jack be quick

1064
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:15,001
Jack go under limbo stick

1065
01:07:15,044 --> 01:07:17,569
All around the limbo clock

1066
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:20,810
Hey, let's do the limbo rock

1067
01:07:23,353 --> 01:07:25,150
Limbo lower now

1068
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:31,893
Good afternoon, Penny.

1069
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:33,486
Feeling better?

1070
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:35,895
Getting in touch
with your anger?

1071
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:37,797
Go, Tracy! Go!

1072
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,325
Limbo ankle, limbo knee

1073
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,998
Bend back like a limber tree

1074
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,872
Jack be limber, Jack be quick

1075
01:07:45,908 --> 01:07:48,672
Jack go under limbo stick

1076
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:50,941
All around the limbo clock

1077
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,607
Hey, let's do the limbo rock

1078
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:56,345
I watch that tramp,
and I'm embarrassed to be white.

1079
01:07:56,386 --> 01:07:59,378
You know, Edna, I've been
readin' about these kids.

1080
01:07:59,422 --> 01:08:02,983
Maybe Tracy could be
some sort of campus leader.

1081
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:07,689
Wilbur, it's the times.
They're a-changin'.

1082
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,324
Something's blowin' in the wind.

1083
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,493
Fetch me my diet pills,
would you, hon?

1084
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:18,803
Get yourself a limbo girl

1085
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:21,332
And then shoot the limbo whirl

1086
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:30,682
Go back to Africa
where you came from !

1087
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,449
Your kind's not wanted here!

1088
01:08:34,056 --> 01:08:35,956
Well, Baltimore,
you saw it here first.

1089
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,823
The limbo rock.
Thank you very much, Amber.

1090
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,987
I'm a winner, Corny.

1091
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:41,155
Well, Amber,
you won the dance ...

1092
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:42,391
but let's check
the election results ...

1093
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:43,592
to see how you're doin'.

1094
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:48,593
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have an upset!

1095
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:50,469
For the first time,
Tracy Turnblad ...

1096
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:52,098
is number one with a bullet.

1097
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:55,167
What do you have to say
for yourself, Tracy?

1098
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:58,977
lf elected, I plan to represent
all of Baltimore ...

1099
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:01,506
and today l'd like to
introduce a brand-new dance ...

1100
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:03,781
and dedicate it
to some of my special friends ...

1101
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:06,118
who, because
of small-minded people ...

1102
01:09:06,155 --> 01:09:07,782
can't be here with me today.

1103
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:09,348
My dance is called the waddle.

1104
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:11,553
That girl's got roaches
in her hair.

1105
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:16,361
Roaches?
My little Tracy's a clean teen.

1106
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,128
There's no bugs on our baby.

1107
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,533
I'm not kidding. I just saw one.

1108
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:22,800
Ha ha!
Amber, you're such a comedienne.

1109
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:25,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tracy Turnblad and the waddle.

1110
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:04,772
You all make me sick!

1111
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,018
What is going on here?

1112
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:11,986
Look,
we had nothing to do with it.

1113
01:10:13,322 --> 01:10:15,153
Seaweed! Come on!

1114
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:21,124
Tracy, just keep dancing.

1115
01:10:21,163 --> 01:10:23,131
Move it around here.
What, are you crazy?

1116
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:25,099
Come on! Move out!

1117
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:27,659
That's why
I would like to humbly state--

1118
01:10:27,703 --> 01:10:29,295
Daddy! Mommy!

1119
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:31,966
Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!
There's a riot going on!

1120
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:34,977
-A riot?
-A race riot!

1121
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:36,911
-Yo, I'm talkin' to you!
-Look, I have no--

1122
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:44,612
Everybody just stay calm !
Stay calm--

1123
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:54,490
You leave my boyfriend alone,
you witch!

1124
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:58,229
-You scum !
-Stay back! Stay back!

1125
01:10:58,267 --> 01:10:59,529
Police brutality!

1126
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:03,335
Negroes.

1127
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:07,805
Black boys.

1128
01:11:07,843 --> 01:11:09,777
Police brutality!

1129
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:27,324
Police brutality!

1130
01:11:28,864 --> 01:11:30,456
Hey, let her go!

1131
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:50,651
Good evening.
Friday, June 5, 1962.

1132
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:53,621
Racially tense
Tilted Acres amusement park ...

1133
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:55,385
long a tradition
of Baltimore fun ...

1134
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,554
-Penny! How are you?
-What are you doing here?

1135
01:12:02,598 --> 01:12:04,031
What happened to your head?

1136
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:05,693
It happened at Tilted Acres.

1137
01:12:05,735 --> 01:12:07,965
-Get me out of here!
-OK.

1138
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:16,038
Come on.

1139
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:19,778
Thanks for coming.

1140
01:12:22,084 --> 01:12:23,244
Come on!

1141
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:25,920
Be careful!

1142
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:31,017
Girl, they gonna flip
when they see the new you.

1143
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,857
... including Link Larkin.

1144
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:35,022
That's Link Larkin,
my boyfriend!

1145
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:36,998
Ooh! Boyfriend!

1146
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:39,524
... common-law boyfriend
of Miss Turnblad ...

1147
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:41,263
was listed in fair condition ...

1148
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:43,203
at Union Memorial Hospital
tonight ...

1149
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:45,434
recovering from
two fractured kneecaps ...

1150
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:48,034
received in one
of many incidents of violence ...

1151
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:49,601
that erupted today.

1152
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:54,109
I love you, Tracy.

1153
01:12:56,252 --> 01:12:59,153
Tracy Turnblad
is a human roach nest.

1154
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:00,883
Is this
the caliber of teenager ...

1155
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:03,687
we want representing Baltimore
at the auto show?

1156
01:13:05,961 --> 01:13:08,691
Amber will be so proud of us.

1157
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:10,392
We're going to go down
in the history books ...

1158
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:12,367
for this one, Velma.

1159
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:16,394
Tracy's parents had an emotional
appeal for their daughter.

1160
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:19,306
Tracy, honey,
we know you are innocent.

1161
01:13:19,341 --> 01:13:22,742
-It's Miss Edna.
-Has she always been that big?

1162
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:24,939
We joined the N.A.A.C.P.

1163
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:28,074
And we will fight in every way
possible to get you released ...

1164
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:30,950
and back in front of the cameras
where you belong.

1165
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:35,890
God! It's mother!
You've got to hide!

1166
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:37,153
Where?

1167
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:39,559
Under the bed! Under the bed!

1168
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:44,589
It is time that black and white
take hands ...

1169
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:46,794
-Hey, it's motormouth!
-Mom !

1170
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:50,465
We will not stand for racism !

1171
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:53,134
Free Tracy Turnblad!

1172
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:06,785
Now, darling ...

1173
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,915
aren't you glad
that you were punished ...

1174
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:11,426
and under psychiatric care?

1175
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,428
You could have been killed
today.

1176
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:16,260
I wish I was at a hootenanny
in Harlem.

1177
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,334
-What was that?
-Just the TV.

1178
01:14:19,368 --> 01:14:20,767
I heard somebody laugh.

1179
01:14:22,138 --> 01:14:24,868
Oh, my God! There are
colored people in my house!

1180
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:27,307
I'm gonna make
a citizen's arrest!

1181
01:14:27,343 --> 01:14:28,776
Stop! Stop!

1182
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:33,480
-Paddy, stop them !
-What the--

1183
01:14:35,384 --> 01:14:37,477
Come on, Penny!

1184
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,420
Penny Pingleton,
I'm calling the cops!

1185
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:40,683
You are no longer my daughter!

1186
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:43,385
You are punished
even after you die!

1187
01:14:57,339 --> 01:14:59,739
Corny, it's a real pleasure
to be here today ...

1188
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:02,335
in the city of Baltimore
at this wonderful auto show.

1189
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:05,814
Thank you. I have my aide here
with the scissors ...

1190
01:15:05,848 --> 01:15:07,475
and we're going
to take this opportunity ...

1191
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:11,316
to open the show here
in the city of Baltimore.

1192
01:15:11,353 --> 01:15:13,014
-There we are.
-Thank you, governor.

1193
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:15,523
Wonderful to see you again.

1194
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,048
How are you doing?

1195
01:15:20,296 --> 01:15:21,888
Well, how do you do, governor?
So nice meeting you.

1196
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:23,922
You've got some spinach
on your tie.

1197
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:26,196
Hardy har har!

1198
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,260
Free Tracy Turnblad!

1199
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,849
Segregation never!
lntegration now!

1200
01:15:40,883 --> 01:15:42,510
Free Tracy Turnblad!

1201
01:15:50,492 --> 01:15:52,255
Now, just remember ...

1202
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:56,094
if Amber loses,
she walks off the set ...

1203
01:15:56,131 --> 01:16:00,534
and then you throw the bomb.

1204
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:03,504
Who the hell is Tracy Turnblad?

1205
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,803
She's
an upper lower-class teenager ...

1206
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:08,139
who was arrested
in yesterday's demonstration ...

1207
01:16:08,177 --> 01:16:10,168
and is currently being held
at Montrose.

1208
01:16:10,212 --> 01:16:12,271
She is a hairhopper.

1209
01:16:12,314 --> 01:16:13,611
A what?

1210
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:16,243
Free Tracy Turnblad!

1211
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:19,880
Jesus Christ!
More integration pickets.

1212
01:16:19,922 --> 01:16:23,619
This is a political hot potato,
and I wasn't even warned!

1213
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:24,956
This came out of nowhere.

1214
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:27,121
We had no idea
of her grass roots support.

1215
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:29,289
You keep
the goddamn cops away ...

1216
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:31,060
before this makes
the national news.

1217
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,727
Free Tracy Turnblad!

1218
01:16:38,107 --> 01:16:41,543
Governor, we must have
some answers right now ...

1219
01:16:41,577 --> 01:16:42,908
for our vast
television audience.

1220
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:44,276
The voters
are demanding answers ...

1221
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:46,372
from right here
at the governor's mansion.

1222
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:48,576
This demonstration's
gonna turn nasty.

1223
01:16:48,617 --> 01:16:49,914
We've got to get answers.

1224
01:16:51,387 --> 01:16:52,684
Hey, no police. No police.

1225
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:54,348
Good evening, governor.
May I speak with you?

1226
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:55,789
How are you, my dear?
Nice to see you.

1227
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,519
What are you doing?
What is this?

1228
01:16:57,559 --> 01:16:59,083
What's with the handcuffs?

1229
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,862
Hi, honey. I'm - I'm home.

1230
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:10,030
Well, Baltimore,
today's the big day.

1231
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:11,801
We're here live
at the new armory ...

1232
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,071
for the grand opening
of the 1963 auto show.

1233
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,941
And who will be
the dancing princess ...

1234
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:18,947
from our council
to be crowned queen?

1235
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:20,676
We'll know right after this.

1236
01:17:20,716 --> 01:17:23,116
No cops. No cameras.

1237
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:27,282
We're gonna work this thing out
ourselves, aren't we?

1238
01:17:27,323 --> 01:17:29,621
Madame,
you do have the key to these?

1239
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:32,991
We'll talk about the key
after you release Tracy!

1240
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:39,334
Stinky, stinky, stombo.

1241
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:41,336
Tombo, tombo, tombo.

1242
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,133
Alla, balla, basso.

1243
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,399
Well, the moment of truth has
arrived, ladies and gentlemen.

1244
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:47,909
-You the audience ...
-Excuse me.

1245
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:49,274
... has made your decision ...

1246
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:52,940
and here to announce the results
we have Mr. Arvin Hodgepile ...

1247
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:57,078
president of WZZT studios,
ladies and gentlemen.

1248
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,019
Thank you. Thank you.

1249
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:03,553
We have a difficult situation
with the votes tabulation.

1250
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:05,958
The results were quite close.

1251
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:20,336
Technically, the winner
is Miss Tracy Turnblad.

1252
01:18:33,722 --> 01:18:36,885
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Quiet!

1253
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:40,326
Shut up,
or we're goin' off the air.

1254
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,330
Now listen carefully.

1255
01:18:42,364 --> 01:18:45,333
Since Miss Turnblad
is in reform school ...

1256
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:47,927
the judges
have found her ineligible.

1257
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:51,565
I would like to announce,
on behalf of WZZT ...

1258
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:55,134
the winner
of the Miss Auto Show 1963--

1259
01:18:55,177 --> 01:18:57,304
Amber Von Tussle!

1260
01:19:36,685 --> 01:19:38,118
Let's talk this over!

1261
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:39,848
We can discuss this.

1262
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:42,118
Oh, what!

1263
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,091
-Let's talk it over!
-Leave him alone!

1264
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:45,286
I'll call!

1265
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:49,321
Well, Amber, like it or not ...

1266
01:19:49,364 --> 01:19:52,697
you're officially
Miss Auto Show 1963.

1267
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:55,461
Any words for your opponent ...

1268
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,995
who many feel
was the more popular winner?

1269
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,908
I'd like to lead a dance
and dedicate it to that loser.

1270
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:04,811
Tracy Turnblad,
I hope you're watching ...

1271
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:06,781
because this one's for you.

1272
01:20:06,815 --> 01:20:08,339
It's a brand-new dance--

1273
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:11,216
one that I'm sure
you'll know how to do.

1274
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:12,618
It's called the roach.

1275
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:15,122
Too bad you can't be here
to do it.

1276
01:20:15,157 --> 01:20:18,558
I'm the winner!
Leave me alone!

1277
01:20:18,594 --> 01:20:21,188
Amber Von Tussle and the roach.

1278
01:20:29,338 --> 01:20:31,033
There's a dance

1279
01:20:31,073 --> 01:20:32,870
They're callin' the roach

1280
01:20:32,908 --> 01:20:36,139
It's buggin' all the kids
from coast to coast

1281
01:20:36,178 --> 01:20:40,046
Well, now, form a big line

1282
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:42,812
-To the floor,
-Ooh, roach, roach

1283
01:20:42,851 --> 01:20:45,547
Everybody now, squish

1284
01:20:45,587 --> 01:20:47,646
Ooh, squash

1285
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:48,951
Kill that roach

1286
01:20:51,093 --> 01:20:54,688
Yes, there's a roach
upon my floor

1287
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:57,392
For Christ's sakes,
pardon Tracy Turnblad!

1288
01:20:57,432 --> 01:20:58,831
All right!

1289
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:00,496
Free Tracy Turnblad!

1290
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:05,496
You stomp, step, skip, two,
three, four, five, six, seven

1291
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:11,104
Squish

1292
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:13,137
Ooh, squash

1293
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:14,581
Kill that roach

1294
01:21:14,616 --> 01:21:17,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, now

1295
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:32,797
Squish

1296
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:34,802
Ooh, squash

1297
01:21:34,836 --> 01:21:36,133
Kill that roach

1298
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:39,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey, now

1299
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:54,349
Squish

1300
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:56,357
Ooh, squash

1301
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:57,915
Kill that roach

1302
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:04,164
Well, I was takin' a bath
the other night

1303
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:07,225
Checked my hair,
it was lookin' a fright

1304
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:10,830
Well, I went down to the store

1305
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:12,669
To get some hair-on

1306
01:22:17,346 --> 01:22:18,472
Squish

1307
01:22:18,513 --> 01:22:20,378
Kill that roach

1308
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:23,679
Let me at him

1309
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:25,118
I'm gonna kill him

1310
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:31,053
I got something for you.

1311
01:22:36,064 --> 01:22:37,964
Wait. Hold on.

1312
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:43,364
Baltimore, you are seeing
history being made today!

1313
01:22:43,405 --> 01:22:48,206
White and black together
for the first time on local TV!

1314
01:22:48,243 --> 01:22:50,643
I hate you, Tracy Turnblad!

1315
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:52,203
The Corny Collins Show
is now integrated!

1316
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:54,772
Yes! All right!

1317
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:10,456
Amber,
we're going home right now!

1318
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:12,399
No, mommy! No!

1319
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:35,483
Stop! Get away from me!
Get away!

1320
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:37,287
Come on!
I'm a married man with a family!

1321
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:38,691
Don't hurt me, please!

1322
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:46,265
Thank you. Thank you.

1323
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:48,394
I love you, Baltimore!

1324
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:58,140
I don't know about you,
but I feel like dancing.

1325
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:02,873
I've got the bug.

1326
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,229
Everybody's jumpin',
movin' around

1327
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:17,993
Nobody's standing still
or keeping their ground

1328
01:24:18,033 --> 01:24:21,196
You can't tell what'll happen
when they pass it around

1329
01:24:21,236 --> 01:24:22,396
It's the bug

1330
01:24:24,339 --> 01:24:27,604
You got it, you got it,
you're all on your own

1331
01:24:27,642 --> 01:24:31,408
Somehow it seems better
when you do it alone

1332
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:32,708
What are you doing?

1333
01:24:32,748 --> 01:24:35,876
Give me that! Ow!
You little ... Oh!

1334
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:40,652
Well, come on, baby,
let's do the bug

1335
01:24:40,689 --> 01:24:44,147
Come on, baby, and give me a hug

1336
01:24:44,192 --> 01:24:46,990
Come on, baby,
my turn's long due

1337
01:24:47,028 --> 01:24:48,928
I wanna bug, bug

1338
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:50,488
A hole in my shoe

1339
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:53,558
Real bugs bug me,
no matter what size

1340
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:55,399
Come down! Come down!

1341
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:56,734
Itching powder!

1342
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:01,074
It's that old bug

1343
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:14,909
Let's dance!

1344
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:25,909
