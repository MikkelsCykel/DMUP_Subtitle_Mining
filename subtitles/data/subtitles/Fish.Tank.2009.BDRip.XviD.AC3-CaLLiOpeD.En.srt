Keeley its me.
What are you doing?

3
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:01,520
I've left three messages.
I said sorry didn't I?

4
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:04,186
You know me. I was pissed off
.

5
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,894
Get back to me, bitch.

6
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,108
Tyler, what are you doing?

7
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,934
What does it look like?

8
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,403
Yields, Mia!
Keeley is not there.

9
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:57,946
I have a message for her.

10
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:01,698
His father is a big motherfucker!

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,625
I'll get you one day!

12
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,544
You'd be so fucking lucky!

13
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,783
You waited a long time

14
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,907
Now I'm here

15
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,076
I know I should not have

16
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:48,169
Making you wait that long

17
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,873
I had much to do

18
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:55,208
But I imagined
All I want you to

19
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,213
I know all the guys

20
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:02,382
s Story  through me
Like no other girl

21
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:05,470
They know I'm good

22
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,729
They fantasize about me

23
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,686
But you're the only
What I want today

24
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,856
And you want me too

25
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,457
What's your problem?

26
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,826
You dance like a dung.

27
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,407
Do not bother, Mia.

28
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:31,464
So Keeley
you hang with tuna?

29
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:33,834
You've seen, dirty gypsy?

30
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,796
You're going to complain?

31
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:38,590
Get out!

32
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:42,219
Get out, bitch!

33
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:45,435
If you want more,
Come get me!

34
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:48,478
Bitch!

35
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:49,854
Get out!

36
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:26,324
What are you doing?

37
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:27,287
You think?

38
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:28,282
Get out!

39
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:50,978
Hello. It's me.

40
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:57,521
Police looking for you.
This girl has a broken nose.

41
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:00,193
- I have not started!
- Dirty liar!

42
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,649
- It's his fault.
- You bet! You'll see ...

43
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:04,030
Let me go, Mom.

44
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:05,407
Let me go!

45
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,030
I let you go, little bitch!

46
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,209
What's your problem?

47
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,128
It is you, my problem!

48
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:13,027
is my beautiful room.

49
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,111
Joanne will kill you.

50
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:25,162
The headboard is beautiful.
It was carved for me

51
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,463
heart shape.
I love hearts.

52
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,884
There,
is my casual clothes.

53
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,934
Y  all my jeans,
and I have a max.

54
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:37,804
You had to stay here.

55
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:39,640
My sexy tracksuit  ...

56
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,153
Do not be afraid.

57
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,201
Hello.

58
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,415
- It's private property.
- My ass!

59
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,371
She wants to have fun.

60
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,250
We gonna party.
In addition, she has enough booze.

61
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,546
- Why did you that?
- To nail you dick.

62
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:36,424
You mijotes something.

63
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:38,922
Give me that!

64
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,554
We'll have fun.

65
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:41,848
Let me go!

66
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:49,892
Calm.

67
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:53,405
It is not partying.

68
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:03,030
Touch me!

69
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:05,500
It has a little fun.

70
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,165
Leave me!

71
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,583
Let me go!

72
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,596
Let me go, assholes!

73
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,968
Go ahead, mug it.

74
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,016
Stop fidgeting.

75
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:27,976
Let me go, fuck!

76
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:29,597
We just want to laugh.

77
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:48,597
Do not worry about me, continue.

78
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,014
I enjoyed it.

79
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:51,599
Exactly.

80
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,658
You make eggs?

81
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:00,615
No.

82
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:03,948
For what, water?

83
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:07,619
I make tea.

84
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:15,876
I am a friend of your mother.

85
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,920
You dance like a Black.

86
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:22,880
It's a compliment.

87
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,463
Where'd you get that?

88
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:28,178
I watch videos,
like everyone else.

89
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,805
And it makes you a specialist?

90
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,015
You're answer to everything?

91
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,410
What's your name?

92
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:44,276
As you wish.

93
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,243
You know your world charm.

94
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:14,022
See you later.

95
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:34,461
I met one of your daughters.

96
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:36,249
And you're still around?

97
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:41,009
You made me tea!

98
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:15,542
What are you doing?

99
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:17,214
Never mind, little bitch.

100
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,922
Never mind yourself, big bitch.

101
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:28,922
I'm already late.

102
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:31,018
Go, stay.

103
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,937
See you later.

104
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,156
- You play what?
- At the door.

105
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,075
I can go out?

106
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,411
Must pay to open the door.

107
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,285
- How?
- 2 lbs.

108
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:54,872
Holy shit, is not given.

109
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,955
Here.

110
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:10,304
Stop!
Give me the money!

111
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:11,930
I want a discount.

112
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:14,933
Okay. A book, dirty rat!

113
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:16,726
OK. Deal.

114
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,068
I love you.
I'll kill you last.

115
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:28,987
Tyler! Let me go.

116
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,239
He said, "See you later."

117
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,078
Your lovely kid coming back?

118
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:20,498
I invited some friends.

119
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,128
You go into your room
or outside.

120
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:24,505
One like the other.

121
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:29,840
It has nothing to fuck
of your friends.

122
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,848
They're all fat morons.

123
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:40,185
You look like a giggle!

124
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,192
Bitch!

125
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,449
Call SOS Children Beaten.

126
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:50,285
You too, you're a slut!

127
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:23,520
You got the nerve to come back.

128
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:27,194
Shut up.

129
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,316
Good.

130
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:33,575
You're the pot
my brothers are not there.

131
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,366
They took my business.

132
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,352
That's not what you think.
She is old.

133
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,644
You've dropped your dog express
yesterday?

134
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:04,851
He is strong.

135
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,314
Did you get the bowl
not bite you.

136
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,654
That's right, sucker.

137
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,949
My guests are there,

138
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:19,241
finished but I prepare myself.

139
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:22,583
They make themselves up to death.

140
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,546
It's super gross.

141
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:29,836
It must be his house.

142
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:31,425
You see?

143
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:33,931
It is his mother?

144
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:35,683
Damn, the big pile!

145
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:39,301
They are tainted.

146
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:43,649
His smile is atrocious
She has yellow teeth.

147
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,399
Definitely green.

148
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,448
Soon they will be pink.

149
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:52,986
She might like it.

150
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,616
When I enter the tent

151
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,081
and be admired,
will be magic.

152
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:02,126
This cider is perfect,
There's no denying it.

153
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:03,961
There will be short.

154
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,000
Hello shame!

155
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,877
Dirty bitch friquée.

156
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,673
Fat bitch.

157
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:12,251
Shut up, Mia.

158
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:15,010
You, your mouth.
I leave in a minute.

159
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:48,372
Hello, beautiful.

160
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:50,759
You're a big acorn.

161
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:54,006
If it was so large
I could convert.

162
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:55,384
Can I come?

163
00:22:57,016 --> 00:22:58,640
're Unrecognizable, dressed.

164
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:00,892
- You're really a dick.
- I know.

165
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:10,101
You're late.

166
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:11,270
But I'm here.

167
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:13,779
- I'm more.
- I had to change.

168
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:20,367
In your room.

169
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,118
We recognize it
when she sleeps.

170
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:14,165
- Shoot it.
- It's good.

171
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:16,332
I'll handle this.

172
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:18,248
You're too nice.

173
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:21,341
At the end of the corridor.

174
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:32,012
She treats me like a kid.

175
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:34,104
At your age,
we live with my mom more.

176
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:35,857
I was kicked out of my house.

177
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:46,482
Go get dressed.

178
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:49,282
I am dressed.

179
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:50,946
You're almost naked.

180
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,625
You do not care, usually.

181
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,090
Here, it bothers me.
Go get dressed.

182
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:03,962
Why do you take that voice?

183
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,294
It moves?

184
00:29:06,597 --> 00:29:08,305
- You go where?
- Nowhere.

185
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,386
So why did you say,
"It moves?"

186
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:14,222
We will drive around.

187
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:15,553
Want to come?

188
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:18,271
- Both?
- Forget it.

189
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:19,398
I want to come.

190
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:21,438
It goes nowhere.

191
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:24,229
I do not care, I want to come.

192
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:26,446
Go get dressed.

193
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:28,820
Thank you.

194
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:33,697
And you?

195
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,698
It said nothing.

196
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:38,539
Check in 20 minutes.

197
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:40,251
You're better to do.

198
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,297
You know what? That tells me much.

199
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:56,016
- Where are we going?
- Good question.

200
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:57,435
At the orphanage.

201
00:29:58,191 --> 00:30:00,148
That sucks, you're not nice.

202
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:03,946
First
'd have at least been able to shave.

203
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:04,938
Why?

204
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,316
Out of respect for me.

205
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:10,452
- I like that you like me?
- You got too much hair.

206
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:13,741
Me, I think you're beautiful.

207
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:14,823
Thank you.

208
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:18,583
What?

209
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:22,416
You're weird stuff.

210
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,581
Anything.

211
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:25,046
Really weird.

212
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:27,585
Bobby Womack
is anything but bizarre.

213
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:29,008
You're how old?

214
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:30,385
The age thing.

215
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:35,974
I will have to
your education.

216
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,895
Mets thoroughly.

217
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:44,526
At your command.

218
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:57,624
leaves are brown

219
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:04,045
And the sky is gray

220
00:31:06,135 --> 00:31:08,044
I walk aimlessly

221
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:12,507
By a winter's day

222
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:16,766
It would  sweeter

223
00:31:18,814 --> 00:31:20,937
If I  L.A.

224
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:25,560
I dream  California

225
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:29,779
For this winter's day

226
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:34,745
I saw a church

227
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:38,615
I stopped

228
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:44,413
I knelt

229
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,668
And I began to pray

230
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,762
The priest blesses the cold

231
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:55,722
Because he knows that I'll stay

232
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:09,315
It's called an airship.

233
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:11,814
It's too good!

234
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:12,984
Mom!

235
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:14,824
I have seen.

236
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:16,986
We see more.

237
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,281
Look.

238
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,415
Too good.

239
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:24,123
It's super cool.

240
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:29,749
In what animal
you want to be reincarnated?

241
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:31,085
In monkey.

242
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:33,044
In white tiger.

243
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:35,009
Somewhat bitch.

244
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:37,345
What kind of dog?

245
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,842
Race.

246
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:40,473
You're already a bitch.

247
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:42,436
Stop!

248
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:45,768
Me, I'd be an eagle. "
Your animals are terrestrial.

249
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,611
You would not fly?

250
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:50,779
You'd get shot.

251
00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:51,820
Why not?

252
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:54,572
We could shoot you,
true.

253
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:56,613
I want to pick blackberries.

254
00:32:56,913 --> 00:32:58,193
I want a drink.

255
00:32:58,498 --> 00:32:59,280
It is.

256
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,796
Let me show you something.

257
00:33:12,012 --> 00:33:13,672
- Come.
- We show what?

258
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:14,885
Come on, moron!

259
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,678
Wait.

260
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:36,362
So, you like it?

261
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:39,823
I would have been better in flip flops.

262
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:42,246
You are perfect like that.
Come here.

263
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:45,492
Hey, lovers!

264
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:52,837
It's nice here!

265
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:57,848
There must be millions
dégueus insects.

266
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:13,313
Stop! You're not interested!

267
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:16,233
There's a dragonfly, Mia!

268
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:18,901
Look there.

269
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,660
On the worksheet. You see?

270
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,750
Mashed, it has six legs!

271
00:34:25,544 --> 00:34:26,707
1, 2, 3 ...

272
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:31,590
- Shut up.
- I see it.

273
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:33,459
Soaring.

274
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:35,511
I'll catch a fish.

275
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:38,177
- Are you kidding?
- I go. You coming?

276
00:34:38,474 --> 00:34:39,754
You're dreaming!

277
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:41,720
Without me, thank you.

278
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,134
Sissies.

279
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:48,061
You're grounded.

280
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:55,104
I need help.

281
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:56,439
You can scratch you.

282
00:34:56,742 --> 00:34:59,233
- We'll end up with water.
- No way!

283
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,651
No way.

284
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:04,124
Nobody ever comes here.

285
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,409
Fish are animals,
will be easy.

286
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:07,790
I expect to see.

287
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:10,001
Super.

288
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,246
Come on.

289
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,210
Always ready, that one.

290
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:23,431
It is dirty?

291
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:27,767
Running Your cost me 20 pounds.

292
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,310
It is not possible.

293
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,315
Bravo.

294
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:40,575
Come.

295
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:42,987
Go gently.

296
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,570
She can not swim!

297
00:35:51,506 --> 00:35:53,913
Your feet atrocious
will drive them away!

298
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,672
They believe
it's a fish-off

299
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,380
who comes to eat!

300
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,764
Moving slowly toward me.

301
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:05,225
Did he affected?
You'll have a poissonite!

302
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:10,597
You see the fish?

303
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:14,524
You go ahead ...
Not yet.

304
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:19,780
Slowly.

305
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:31,542
Stop.

306
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,983
He caught one!

307
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:11,079
He glides, that bastard!

308
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,842
He died?

309
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,972
You think he dances, woodcock?

310
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,026
What are you doing?

311
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:42,614
- It's brutal.
- It's better for him.

312
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,823
You bet!

313
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:44,819
We eat?

314
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,947
I would not even touch.

315
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:48,825
It's like fried fish.

316
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,497
No, he is whole and full of shit.

317
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:53,751
- I do not eat it.
- I do.

318
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,121
Bravo.

319
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,841
It would have surprised.

320
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:00,301
Help! AIDS!

321
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,097
Watch.

322
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:08,639
You will survive.

323
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:15,097
Mom hates blood.

324
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,939
Your socks will have AIDS,
Connor.

325
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:22,611
Who's Kelly?

326
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,740
On your arm.

327
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,581
Just one example.

328
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:40,539
There's a spider.

329
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:42,549
Mia

330
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:45,052
Wait.

331
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,297
Climb on my back.

332
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:57,940
You all right?

333
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,643
I have nothing more to say.

334
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:36,722
We made the turn.

335
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:39,516
I do not know.

336
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:44,687
Well, okay.

337
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,153
Pass me a while ago.

338
00:40:01,174 --> 00:40:01,839
You okay?

339
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:05,717
The family bullshit.
We'll have to go.

340
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:08,089
You've promised to cook the fish.

341
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:11,138
- Your mother was not bored.
- I know.

342
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,139
I'll drop you.

343
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:17,644
We just drink a nightcap?
Please. Go!

344
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,809
Go. It's me who pays.

345
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,526
Okay, a little manipulative.

346
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,198
I hurry.

347
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:43,215
See if you can dance it.

348
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,877
It is zero!

349
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,924
This is not true. I saw it.

350
00:40:58,232 --> 00:40:59,228
Can you do that?

351
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,028
I'm barefoot.

352
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:05,816
What a stupid excuse!

353
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:18,036
This is not dancing!

354
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:20,035
Move!

355
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:42,765
It will not be accepted?

356
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:46,780
I'm going to pee.

357
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,856
Continue!

358
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,106
Shut up!

359
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,819
It was nice to you.

360
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,740
I do not care.
I have the right not to love.

361
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:56,574
It's a pain in the ass, I told you.

362
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:59,496
- She thinks not.
- I love you not!

363
00:41:59,794 --> 00:42:03,543
There is no mates in two days!
You know us!

364
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:06,457
She is barefoot.

365
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:08,918
It's not far off, it will kill it.

366
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:35,109
I like dogs.

367
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:38,201
We'll talk
when you have eaten the arm.

368
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,007
There's someone down for you.

369
00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:53,504
Stand!

370
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:56,889
All right.

371
00:42:58,228 --> 00:42:59,509
I'm up.

372
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,312
Do not bother, I come!

373
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:12,989
Here it is.

374
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:18,781
Good morning. I'm Carrie.

375
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:20,577
Will you talk about?

376
00:43:21,043 --> 00:43:21,789
What?

377
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:23,580
In ancient history, cretin.

378
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:27,213
- I can drink before?
- Sure.

379
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:30,167
You're making
in this special school.

380
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:34,382
When she was born,
she cried for days.

381
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:38,924
One would think she had
malice in the blood.

382
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:41,396
You have another daughter?

383
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:43,477
Yes. Tyler.

384
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:45,972
She sticks the same cotton.

385
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:49,566
It too would
by being kicked out of school.

386
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,690
It's hard when you're alone.

387
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,159
You can tell.

388
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:56,947
The place where she goes,

389
00:43:58,748 --> 00:43:59,328
like?

390
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:02,621
How far?

391
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:04,283
I have no car.

392
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,620
Come back here!

393
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,971
You kidding me?

394
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:27,149
I will enter this shop
and when I go out,

395
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:28,818
I'm different.

396
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:30,476
Different!

397
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:33,063
You dig? Different.

398
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:37,199
Unlike other, you,
worldwide.

399
00:44:40,832 --> 00:44:43,667
Club Luxury
seeks talented young dancers

400
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:55,146
Is it me or it schlingue here?

401
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:56,444
It beats serious.

402
00:45:56,742 --> 00:45:58,818
Some of us should
take a bath.

403
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,491
You got the eye swelling.
Your father missed your mouth?

404
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:02,868
You bars?

405
00:46:03,165 --> 00:46:06,700
Touch me or I'll
another black eye!

406
00:46:07,002 --> 00:46:08,033
Get out!

407
00:46:08,337 --> 00:46:10,163
You got that face!

408
00:46:50,212 --> 00:46:51,126
Hello.

409
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,085
I was passing by.

410
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:57,009
How did you know where I work?

411
00:46:57,887 --> 00:46:58,800
You said.

412
00:47:01,974 --> 00:47:04,845
What's New?
I thought you hated me.

413
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:07,682
You're a puzzle balls.

414
00:47:08,397 --> 00:47:09,179
Thank you.

415
00:47:10,232 --> 00:47:11,146
Not enough.

416
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:14,023
And your foot?

417
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:15,358
Okay.

418
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:21,405
Hold on.

419
00:47:35,716 --> 00:47:36,961
Take off your shoes.

420
00:47:38,803 --> 00:47:41,720
- I can do.
- Not as good as me.

421
00:48:02,577 --> 00:48:04,320
That ever happen to wash?

422
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:23,718
It is like new.

423
00:48:28,478 --> 00:48:30,138
What are you doing with your days?

424
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:36,986
I have things planned.

425
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,792
You are going?

426
00:49:03,764 --> 00:49:05,721
- I know.
- Go ahead, you're good.

427
00:49:11,063 --> 00:49:12,640
Say nothing to my mother.

428
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:14,685
I'll have what in return?

429
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:18,313
You need a camcorder?

430
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,403
They say to send a demo.

431
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:23,609
I can lend you my camera.

432
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:27,574
On one condition.

433
00:49:28,997 --> 00:49:30,029
Which?

434
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:34,118
You'll smile on the video.

435
00:49:35,462 --> 00:49:37,206
You're pretty when you smile.

436
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:46,466
I'm back to work.

437
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,092
I will chum with you
some time.

438
00:49:49,977 --> 00:49:51,092
Does it bother you?

439
00:49:51,896 --> 00:49:53,354
Your mother has fired?

440
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:55,137
More or less.

441
00:50:25,137 --> 00:50:27,593
It's me, Tennents big moron.

442
00:50:34,438 --> 00:50:37,143
Is not blocking you
you cut it there-

443
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:53,618
You go on Guarded Centre
in 2 weeks.

444
00:51:02,383 --> 00:51:03,759
You've got a camcorder?

445
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:06,090
You scared me.

446
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:07,799
Give me one second.

447
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:21,145
Who's the best?

448
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:23,359
Thank you.

449
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,328
- How does it work?
- It's easy.

450
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:44,623
You light up here.

451
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,506
Forget not to lower the cache.

452
00:51:50,265 --> 00:51:51,890
Red button to record.

453
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,137
You press and it filmed.

454
00:51:56,104 --> 00:51:57,646
You will take the shot quickly.

455
00:51:58,774 --> 00:51:59,805
Awesome.

456
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:32,046
How do you think?

457
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,517
Honestly?

458
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,019
Sure.

459
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:42,817
From fox piss.

460
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,772
You deserve a beating, girl!

461
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,696
For me spied.

462
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:53,405
For your insolence.

463
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:55,828
To be planted
social worker.

464
00:52:56,415 --> 00:52:57,329
Connor!

465
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,742
You worry tires cheap,
this time.

466
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:01,000
Dinner.

467
00:53:01,295 --> 00:53:03,371
I'm coming.
I was spinning my camcorder to Mia.

468
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:05,083
She'll break it.

469
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,340
If she does that, look out the beating.

470
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:11,210
It smells good.

471
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,432
I've done a good steak.

472
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:24,395
My name is Mia Williams.
My number is 07700 900 542.

473
00:54:55,744 --> 00:54:59,362
My name  Mia Williams.
My number is 07700 ...

474
00:56:36,596 --> 00:56:37,971
Have you nearly finished?

475
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:40,347
What I meddle, microbe?

476
00:56:40,641 --> 00:56:42,100
I'm going to pee.

477
00:56:43,478 --> 00:56:44,972
Go ahead, I look at it.

478
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:48,312
No.
Or you close your eyes.

479
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:51,354
I can not, I might cut myself.

480
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:02,556
Wait for me.

481
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:04,715
You follow me?

482
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:06,592
Yes, so what?

483
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:09,980
How is your mare?

484
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:13,724
Did you hear?

485
00:58:14,903 --> 00:58:16,362
That's not what you think.

486
00:58:17,155 --> 00:58:18,318
I think what?

487
00:58:18,615 --> 00:58:20,524
Let her starve.

488
00:58:20,826 --> 00:58:22,368
It seems, anyway.

489
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:25,077
She is old, I told you.

490
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:27,821
Where you going?

491
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,622
Search for something.

492
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:32,708
What thing?

493
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:35,672
You're as curious girl.

494
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,468
Can I come with you?

495
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:41,419
If you want to.

496
00:58:47,603 --> 00:58:48,765
Give me that.

497
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,851
Take support here.

498
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,001
It is not bad.

499
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:19,426
It's just a show.

500
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:25,344
What are you looking?

501
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,890
A Volvo 940.

502
00:59:29,729 --> 00:59:31,057
It looks like what?

503
00:59:31,355 --> 00:59:32,897
In a Volvo 940.

504
00:59:33,608 --> 00:59:35,185
Very clever, head node.

505
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:51,540
And here. Volvo 940.

506
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:55,493
This is a car like any other.

507
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:56,876
There's not often.

508
01:00:00,635 --> 01:00:02,378
They are super strong.

509
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:12,469
You want more?

510
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:17,693
Keep watch.

511
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:36,754
I like not here!

512
01:00:37,464 --> 01:00:38,874
I for one minute.

513
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:43,842
I know where to find the Bethune
to buy a drink.

514
01:00:46,056 --> 01:00:49,092
I know where to find the Bethune
to buy a drink!

515
01:00:52,437 --> 01:00:53,386
Good!

516
01:01:01,905 --> 01:01:02,818
I.

517
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,324
You have much luck, you know.

518
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,985
Come on.

519
01:01:09,371 --> 01:01:10,651
We will tear.

520
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:17,917
Hold on.

521
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:20,119
All right, get up.

522
01:01:23,468 --> 01:01:24,749
Fuck your mother!

523
01:02:14,645 --> 01:02:15,427
Gotcha!

524
01:02:16,272 --> 01:02:17,102
Descend.

525
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:22,397
Come down.

526
01:02:25,031 --> 01:02:26,276
You're not funny.

527
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:28,365
I'm supposed to work there.

528
01:02:30,077 --> 01:02:31,109
What do you want?

529
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:33,830
We need Bethune.

530
01:02:34,582 --> 01:02:35,578
Oh yeah?

531
01:02:38,502 --> 01:02:39,534
You're stuffed?

532
01:02:43,007 --> 01:02:44,287
You got a 5 bill?

533
01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:46,715
I paid
to transfer the pochetrons.

534
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:47,877
Do not shit.

535
01:02:48,763 --> 01:02:50,257
I have nothing on me.

536
01:02:53,518 --> 01:02:56,187
Look.
This boy is very thin.

537
01:02:56,604 --> 01:02:59,522
It was the slab, we must eat.
I'll pay you back.

538
01:03:15,874 --> 01:03:18,162
- I'm not a kid.
- That I know.

539
01:04:11,304 --> 01:04:12,549
There's something to eat?

540
01:04:12,973 --> 01:04:15,843
Have you seen the time?
Do you believe in coffee?

541
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,745
In Thailand? Aggressiveness zero.

542
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,496
Japan? Same story.
But in Russia  ...

543
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:48,254
we feel first in Russia,
is anger.

544
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,549
I hate nothing but think again.

545
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,144
You're still my camcorder?

546
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:02,894
You want it?

547
01:05:04,024 --> 01:05:05,435
So it is safe ...

548
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:08,148
He is.

549
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:12,819
Some streets
stink of money, full nose.

550
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,397
snow.

551
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,240
The chicks are covered
to the eyes ...

552
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:19,581
You go out with this boy?

553
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:23,665
Why?

554
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,504
It looks a bit old for you.

555
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,123
It is 1 9.

556
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,421
It has never been a guy.

557
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,466
I just hit me up there.

558
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,633
It is elegant.

559
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,720
You can talk.

560
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,020
It goes to bed?

561
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,900
In bed, the Sleeping Beauty.

562
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,242
Is your new school.
You'll live.

563
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,297
You'll be able to type
all the lads that you want.

564
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,724
It's smart.

565
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,437
I will not go.

566
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,896
They may teach you
politeness.

567
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:35,694
It's none of your business.

568
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,371
Did you need discipline.

569
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:44,489
You've already said.
Who are you to lecture me?

570
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,982
It's only two weeks.

571
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,362
I can not believe it.

572
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,158
It is super easy to live.

573
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:37,135
There's this thing ...
As soon as I saw him I knew.

574
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,217
Stop your bullshit!

575
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:44,097
Anything.

576
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,978
They are only good for one thing

577
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:50,273
and I can tell you
it assures that side.

578
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,733
I know!

579
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,733
I know!

580
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:01,577
Stop angst around,
you meet someone.

581
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,283
Are you going to Ann Marie?

582
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:09,331
At 21 pm?

583
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:15,044
At any hour.

584
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:22,840
You have a new message.

585
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:26,976
Mia Williams
Your demo we liked.

586
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:30,851
Can you hear
next week

587
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:35,646
Remember us at 01708 665 001.

588
01:08:35,947 --> 01:08:36,693
I'm Val.

589
01:10:54,962 --> 01:10:56,124
Put your arm here.

590
01:10:57,423 --> 01:10:59,214
It's good. The other arm.

591
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:05,044
Climbs the stairs.

592
01:11:05,347 --> 01:11:06,462
Sorry.

593
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:08,511
I took one.

594
01:11:08,809 --> 01:11:09,509
I know.

595
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:13,891
I must sleep.
You think it'll be tomorrow?

596
01:11:14,982 --> 01:11:18,149
Do not worry.
It will be fine tomorrow.

597
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:21,018
You swear?

598
01:11:21,322 --> 01:11:22,318
I swear.

599
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:15,782
You're still standing?

600
01:12:16,377 --> 01:12:17,836
I had stuff to do.

601
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:27,548
We again become friends?

602
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:28,381
What?

603
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:33,101
You were weird with me.

604
01:12:33,978 --> 01:12:35,058
You, you were weird.

605
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:38,103
Really?

606
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:42,525
Maybe.

607
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,749
Your mother is in the polish.

608
01:12:57,127 --> 01:12:57,708
As usual.

609
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:05,463
You like booze in the family.

610
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,721
It's pretty, your hair loose.

611
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:19,889
It's better than your ponytail
usual.

612
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,196
I got a hearing.

613
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,236
Bravo.

614
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:31,907
It surprises me not.

615
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,161
I've borrowed a CD.

616
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:40,458
What song?

617
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:42,875
California Dreamin '.

618
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:46,415
You had spent in the car.

619
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:49,425
This is my favorite song
the world.

620
01:13:53,726 --> 01:13:55,101
You show me?

621
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:56,932
You're dreaming!

622
01:13:57,521 --> 01:14:00,273
Go.
If not you'll get there before me,

623
01:14:01,442 --> 01:14:03,849
how will you
before all these people?

624
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,854
Especially since I found
you-insured

625
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:08,610
You know.

626
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,527
I licking this evening.

627
01:14:12,703 --> 01:14:14,245
It is not yet ready.

628
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,029
It was to help.

629
01:14:21,754 --> 01:14:23,082
It's up to you.

630
01:16:47,192 --> 01:16:48,984
I am only here for now.

631
01:16:51,864 --> 01:16:52,777
Come here.

632
01:17:00,372 --> 01:17:01,238
Come here.

633
01:17:13,302 --> 01:17:14,582
It was really good.

634
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:19,724
You say it like that.

635
01:17:20,017 --> 01:17:21,096
I'm serious.

636
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:24,809
If it were me, I advise.

637
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:22,132
I bet it's not like that
with your boyfriend.

638
01:19:37,656 --> 01:19:39,316
Its tail is as big?

639
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,065
I'm drunk.

640
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:30,071
We screwed up.

641
01:20:31,919 --> 01:20:32,784
No.

642
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:46,800
It must remain between us.

643
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:49,968
I know.

644
01:21:22,053 --> 01:21:24,010
I'd better go to bed.

645
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:26,261
I'm wiped.

646
01:21:32,647 --> 01:21:33,892
We'll talk tomorrow.

647
01:22:27,202 --> 01:22:28,447
Connor is gone.

648
01:23:05,532 --> 01:23:06,647
Connor!

649
01:23:29,849 --> 01:23:32,304
I told you that I almost
abort you?

650
01:23:35,187 --> 01:23:37,061
I even made an appointment.

651
01:23:50,328 --> 01:23:51,870
You're going to call?

652
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:58,706
It will not.

653
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:00,242
You know shit.

654
01:24:00,671 --> 01:24:02,794
Si I'm going to tell Mom.

655
01:24:03,049 --> 01:24:04,460
I have nothing to fight.

656
01:24:16,437 --> 01:24:19,557
Here  Connor. Leave a message
and I'll call you.

657
01:24:32,078 --> 01:24:34,284
118 008.
Can I help you?

658
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:35,950
Wickes, Barking.

659
01:24:36,207 --> 01:24:38,532
moment.
I put you in relationship?

660
01:24:43,548 --> 01:24:44,413
Mia

661
01:24:45,508 --> 01:24:46,671
I was looking for.

662
01:24:46,926 --> 01:24:48,586
Wickes, Barking. I listen.

663
01:24:48,845 --> 01:24:51,632
Me want to talk to Connor
it is a security officer.

664
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:52,720
Where are you going?

665
01:24:52,974 --> 01:24:55,263
Connor O'Reilly
He is on leave.

666
01:24:55,518 --> 01:24:56,799
It is when?

667
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:58,433
next Friday.

668
01:24:58,688 --> 01:25:00,645
- When?
-  Next Friday.

669
01:25:05,654 --> 01:25:07,693
Where's that, Tilbury?

670
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:10,357
It is on the A13 in that direction.

671
01:25:11,701 --> 01:25:12,816
Can I come?

672
01:25:13,078 --> 01:25:16,198
I have personal stuff to do.
See you later.

673
01:25:56,705 --> 01:25:58,912
Excuse me. Danton Road?

674
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,871
In the new subdivision,
on the right.

675
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:29,506
Damn!

676
01:27:30,341 --> 01:27:31,255
Come here.

677
01:27:32,093 --> 01:27:32,793
Come

678
01:27:37,223 --> 01:27:39,893
How you found me?
It is not smart.

679
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:42,518
You do not answer the phone.

680
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:44,099
I have more battery.

681
01:27:46,691 --> 01:27:48,020
I was going to call you.

682
01:27:48,276 --> 01:27:49,984
You're not even my number.

683
01:27:54,949 --> 01:27:56,942
You know I love you.

684
01:27:57,202 --> 01:27:58,945
Why you're gone, then?

685
01:28:05,085 --> 01:28:06,413
You know very well.

686
01:28:08,588 --> 01:28:09,751
You have 15 years.

687
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:13,091
It's irrelevant if you're in love.

688
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,641
I'll take you to the station,
we speak in the car.

689
01:28:21,935 --> 01:28:23,892
Wait for me. Hold on.

690
01:28:48,253 --> 01:28:49,878
When is the audition?

691
01:28:50,839 --> 01:28:51,835
Tomorrow.

692
01:28:53,175 --> 01:28:54,290
You'll provide.

693
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:19,988
I have no money.

694
01:29:34,008 --> 01:29:36,047
That should be enough to return.

695
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:00,154
Come here.

696
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:08,114
Fits well.

697
01:30:09,293 --> 01:30:10,836
I'll call you tomorrow.

698
01:31:29,374 --> 01:31:30,572
Shoot!

699
01:34:30,515 --> 01:34:31,760
Come on, sweetie.

700
01:34:32,059 --> 01:34:33,054
It's yours.

701
01:34:35,354 --> 01:34:37,097
Keira sings for Dad.

702
01:34:41,276 --> 01:34:44,313
I said no to love
and its torments

703
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:48,987
I tried my luck
whenever vain

704
01:34:49,243 --> 01:34:53,192
The days marched
and my heart froze

705
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:59,498
But something new
happened with you

706
01:35:00,379 --> 01:35:03,214
My heart back to life,
the evidence was there

707
01:35:03,465 --> 01:35:06,419
people around me
cry to dementia

708
01:35:08,929 --> 01:35:12,678
No matter what they say,
is you I love

709
01:35:12,933 --> 01:35:14,890
They can not

710
01:35:15,144 --> 01:35:16,638
cons obviously

711
01:35:50,221 --> 01:35:51,217
Bravo

712
01:35:54,725 --> 01:35:55,674
Mouse candy.

713
01:35:58,271 --> 01:35:59,895
Make a smile for Dad.

714
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:37,924
Keira! Not on the road.

715
01:38:38,182 --> 01:38:39,131
I know.

716
01:38:45,523 --> 01:38:46,388
Keira.

717
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:57,526
Your mom told me
to take you to buy an ice cream.

718
01:38:57,785 --> 01:38:58,698
Come.

719
01:38:58,953 --> 01:38:59,783
Let's go.

720
01:39:01,455 --> 01:39:03,199
Race you?

721
01:39:10,506 --> 01:39:12,084
We'll go through it.

722
01:39:13,885 --> 01:39:14,715
Give.

723
01:39:17,555 --> 01:39:18,670
My scooter!

724
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:22,217
It is not practical here.
You will take to return.

725
01:39:26,064 --> 01:39:26,846
Mom!

726
01:39:27,857 --> 01:39:30,811
It's a game
Quickly, you must run.

727
01:39:31,486 --> 01:39:32,944
- Keira?
- Mom!

728
01:39:37,533 --> 01:39:38,233
Advance.

729
01:39:38,493 --> 01:39:39,691
I do not want!

730
01:39:39,953 --> 01:39:42,788
Forward or I'll shoot.

731
01:39:59,431 --> 01:40:01,756
I want to go home!

732
01:40:05,562 --> 01:40:06,842
Keira, advance.

733
01:40:11,276 --> 01:40:12,900
Enough. Advance.

734
01:40:23,538 --> 01:40:25,697
You're scaring me!

735
01:40:30,629 --> 01:40:31,459
Hurry!

736
01:40:36,343 --> 01:40:38,252
Stop it. Climb.

737
01:40:43,475 --> 01:40:45,681
- Raise your legs, brothel.
- Shut up!

738
01:40:46,228 --> 01:40:46,974
Go.

739
01:41:52,378 --> 01:41:53,540
Wait for me!

740
01:41:54,338 --> 01:41:55,204
Stop!

741
01:42:02,805 --> 01:42:04,299
Stop run away!

742
01:42:07,643 --> 01:42:09,102
You think that's smart?

743
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:12,141
Poor little idiot.

744
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:14,101
I can do the same.

745
01:42:55,859 --> 01:42:57,650
Stop run away!

746
01:43:01,906 --> 01:43:02,855
Let me go!

747
01:43:09,164 --> 01:43:11,489
You're no better than your father!

748
01:43:14,419 --> 01:43:15,830
Stop hitting me!

749
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:16,847
You okay?

750
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,391
I'm cold.

751
01:44:20,903 --> 01:44:21,768
You're cold?

752
01:44:40,714 --> 01:44:41,995
Go on, get.

753
01:48:58,349 --> 01:49:00,425
It was sublime, honey.

754
01:49:01,144 --> 01:49:03,813
Absolutely sublime.
You shall be called.

755
01:49:04,355 --> 01:49:05,684
Thank you for coming.

756
01:49:07,692 --> 01:49:10,230
- It is great.
- Who's Next?

757
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:14,729
Is that Mia is there?
Mia Williams?

758
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:30,208
What song?

759
01:49:30,465 --> 01:49:31,580
17.

760
01:49:41,935 --> 01:49:44,806
You can remove your hair,
please?

761
01:49:57,117 --> 01:49:59,786
It's much more feminine.

762
01:50:01,997 --> 01:50:03,277
You do not have a body?

763
01:50:04,666 --> 01:50:05,662
Shorts?

764
01:50:07,252 --> 01:50:08,415
It's okay.

765
01:50:09,171 --> 01:50:10,084
Go.

766
01:50:42,204 --> 01:50:43,782
What is this story?

767
01:51:22,203 --> 01:51:23,068
Hello.

768
01:51:25,706 --> 01:51:26,869
It's your car?

769
01:51:28,876 --> 01:51:30,668
Still missing parts.

770
01:51:38,594 --> 01:51:40,137
You forgot your hat.

771
01:51:51,524 --> 01:51:52,805
And your mare?

772
01:51:58,031 --> 01:51:59,193
She was sick.

773
01:52:00,533 --> 01:52:01,909
He took it down.

774
01:52:48,039 --> 01:52:49,450
She was 16.

775
01:52:51,918 --> 01:52:53,543
She had outlived its usefulness.

776
01:53:16,652 --> 01:53:19,569
Should see
if the engine goes the distance.

777
01:53:22,324 --> 01:53:24,198
I know people in Cardiff.

778
01:53:25,285 --> 01:53:26,484
Wales.

779
01:54:15,670 --> 01:54:17,627
Why do you take all this?

780
01:54:19,549 --> 01:54:20,829
If.

781
01:54:26,347 --> 01:54:28,423
And Center
of Special Education?

782
01:54:30,768 --> 01:54:32,179
I leave my place.

783
01:54:32,437 --> 01:54:35,687
I want to.
There's that Gogol there.

784
01:55:10,517 --> 01:55:11,892
I'm going.

785
01:55:14,354 --> 01:55:15,978
It's one of your CDs.

786
01:55:20,694 --> 01:55:21,689
Not bad.

787
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:26,528
Is Nas. It is good.
Keep it.

788
01:55:32,622 --> 01:55:33,488
Go.

789
01:55:35,208 --> 01:55:36,287
Fuck off.

790
01:55:37,961 --> 01:55:39,336
What you waiting for?

791
01:57:10,179 --> 01:57:11,638
Where are you going already?

792
01:57:13,265 --> 01:57:14,808
Wales.

793
01:57:23,025 --> 01:57:24,935
You have not changed my mind, then?

794
01:57:30,032 --> 01:57:31,740
This is my sister, Tyler.

795
01:57:31,993 --> 01:57:32,823
Hi, Tyler.

796
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:35,036
You're a gypsy?

797
01:57:35,288 --> 01:57:36,319
Shut up.

798
01:57:36,581 --> 01:57:37,530
Bitch.

799
01:57:39,876 --> 01:57:41,251
I hate you!

800
01:57:45,798 --> 01:57:46,830
I hate you too

801
01:58:05,735 --> 01:58:06,898
See you later boy

802
01:58:08,863 --> 01:58:09,859
See you later

803
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,199
All right?

804
01:58:34,681 --> 01:58:35,677
Hello, bitch!

805
01:58:35,932 --> 01:58:37,426
Dont forget to text me

806
01:58:37,684 --> 01:58:40,140
Say hello to the welsh for me

807
