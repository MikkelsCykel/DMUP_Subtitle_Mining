1
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:21,163
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

2
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,373
Where is that little joker?

3
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,805
Breathe deep, Mrs. Dunne.

4
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:30,938
That's it. That's it.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,675
Push.

6
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:34,240
Push, that's it.

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,752
Keep pushing,
you're doing great, Mrs. Dunne.

8
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,549
You're doing great.
Okay, that's it.

9
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:41,523
There's the head,
I can see it now.

10
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:44,425
Okay, congratulations...

11
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,985
It's a...

12
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,554
Okay, it went back in.

13
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:51,158
I think he'll be good
at hide and seek, Mrs. Dunne.

14
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,671
Okay.

15
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:58,936
Well, you got yourself
a shy one here.

16
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,944
Okay, come on out,
you little bastard.

17
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,037
Ow!

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,310
He bit me!

19
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,524
Attention all units,
man trapped in a well.

20
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:21,086
919 Hill Street.

21
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,860
Captain Rob!

22
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:25,527
Captain Rob, can you hear me?
Grab the rope!

23
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,395
Can you help him?

24
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,408
Harry, no. This is...
this is not a real well.

25
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,535
We can't keep coming out here
trying to get

26
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:36,841
your imaginary
friend out of trouble.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,747
Well, thanks for saving him.
Coming, Captain Rob!

28
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,842
We didn't really
save anybody.

29
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:43,011
I'm sorry, Dave.

30
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:45,885
It's okay, he just has
an overactive imagination.

31
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:49,153
Don't worry, he'll grow out of it.
They all do.

32
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,593
Captain Rob, come on out,
I give up!

33
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,359
Where is he?
Where are you, Captain Rob?

34
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:58,663
Honey, he's gone.

35
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,499
He must've known you were
starting school today.

36
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,904
Mom, do I have
to go to regular school?

37
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,238
- Yes, honey.
- But you're a good teacher.

38
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:09,268
Thank you, sweetie. I think it's time
you made some new friends.

39
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,041
You know, friends
your own age.

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,344
- I'm just not ready.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

41
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,351
Captain Rob
left this for you.

42
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,822
He said to count your steps
very carefully.

43
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,791
Wow, a treasure map!

44
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,987
- What's the treasure?
- It could be anything.

45
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:28,259
Honey, you're going to discover a whole
new world when you get to school.

46
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,697
Like Marco Polo.

47
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,362
The guy who invented
the swimming pool.

48
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,929
Of course.

49
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,703
- I better get going.
- Now remember, Harry,

50
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,233
there's a friend out there
waiting just for you.

51
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,007
You're a good kid, Lloyd.

52
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,776
And good looking, too.

53
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:47,214
You make a father proud.

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,184
- Thanks, Pop.
- Okay, now let me finish...

55
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,618
Dad, watch the ears.

56
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,951
Aah. Okay,
there you go, gigolo.

57
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,251
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,781
- Looks good?
- Like fresh-cut grass.

59
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,157
Okay, now come on.
Let's get ready,

60
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,560
school's going to open real soon now.
Let's go.

61
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,088
- Oh, keys please.
- Here you go.

62
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,862
It's good to be
a janitor's son.

63
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,564
- Love ya!
- Love you.

64
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,170
Ice, ice, baby

65
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,777
Ice, ice, baby

66
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,215
All right, stop,
collaborate and listen

67
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,310
Ice is back
with my brand new invention

68
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,344
Something grabs ahold
of me tightly

69
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,253
Flow like a harpoon
daily and nightly

70
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,315
- Will it ever stop?
- Yo, I don't know

71
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,554
Turn off the lights
and I'll glow

72
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,585
To the extreme I rock
a mic like a vandal

73
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,598
Light up a stage
and wax a chump like a candle

74
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,190
Ice, ice, baby

75
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:41,696
- Vanilla
- Ice, ice, baby

76
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:47,275
- Vanilla
- Ice, ice, baby

77
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,440
- Vanilla
- Ice, ice, baby

78
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,813
- Vanilla
- Now that the party is jumpin'...

79
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,444
With the bass kicked in
and the vegas are pumpin'

80
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,477
Quick to the point
to the point no fakin'

81
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,614
Cooking MCs like
a pound of bacon

82
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,625
Burning them if you ain't
quick and nimble

83
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,650
I go crazy when I hear
a cymbal

84
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:06,924
And a hi-hat
with a souped up tempo

85
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:08,794
I'm on a roll,
it's time to go solo

86
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,856
Ice, ice, baby,
too cold

87
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:15,103
- Vanilla
- Ice, ice, baby, too cold

88
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:17,333
Too cold

89
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:18,362
Ice, ice, baby.

90
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:21,172
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
look at you!

91
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,203
You're looking real sharp there
in your new back-to-school outfit.

92
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:26,772
- Ooh, ooh.
- Here, Dad.

93
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,044
Okay. Whoa, whoa.
One sec.

94
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:30,609
Let's see if anyone
lost a camera.

95
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,985
Oh, look at this.

96
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,887
Okay ready?
Smile for papa. Come on.

97
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:37,324
Ready?
Yee-aah!

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,850
Okay, wait, wait, wait!

99
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,988
Okay, if you're gonna
go to school you need a book.

100
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,395
Okay? Okay, ready?
Okay, okay.

101
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:43,831
Look pretty.
Pretty, pretty.

102
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,834
Pretty... boy!

103
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,927
I got to catch my bus.
See you, Pop!

104
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,838
Yeah, but you're already
at school!

105
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,864
Hope they like my new jacket!

106
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:56,036
We go through this every year.

107
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,180
Got to get to school.

108
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,879
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

109
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,581
Hi. Hi.

110
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,419
- Sorry.
- You're going the wrong way, loser!

111
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,824
Can't miss my bus.

112
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,988
Okay, so follow the map
and find a friend.

113
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,761
So what's the apple for?
This is too distracting.

114
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,861
One of you has to go.

115
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:27,342
I'm sorry it's you.
Now...

116
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:30,835
take your seeds
and grow into a beautiful pie.

117
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:35,909
31, 32, 33...

118
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,254
Hey, whoa!

119
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,156
- Sorry about that, mate.
- Nice car, Frenchie.

120
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,262
Hey, cute puppy.

121
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:58,034
Aww.

122
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:00,042
Rarr!

123
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:02,405
Whoa, whoa!

124
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,245
Bad dog! Don't get me,
don't get me!

125
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,814
Aaah!
Bad doggie! Bad doggie!

126
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,547
Whoa, whoa!

127
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:14,617
No, no, no!

128
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:27,725
Oooh!

129
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,280
Somebody chipped my tooth.

130
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,881
How do you think I feel?

131
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,858
Someone bit me
in the forehead.

132
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,590
Oh, no!

133
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,596
You could've saved that
for the tooth fairy.

134
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,258
That's stupid. I happen to know
my mom is the tooth fairy.

135
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,291
- Your mom is the tooth fairy?
- Yeah.

136
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,359
Wow, that is so cool.

137
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,268
She must do all the flying
around when I'm asleep.

138
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,364
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:06,705
- Harry Dunne.
- Harry Dunne?

140
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,300
Why does that not
sound familiar?

141
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,405
- Probably because we've never met?
- No, that's not it.

142
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:13,813
Anyway, yeah,
Lloyd Christmas.

143
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,251
Here I am bragging
my mom's the tooth fairy

144
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,311
- And you're Santa's kid?!
- No, no.

145
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,549
- Yeah!
- Yeah? No, I'm not.

146
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,750
- I knew it!
- No, I'm not.

147
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,224
- I bet you are.
- No, I bet I'm not.

148
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,093
- I know you are.
- Why have I never seen you here before?

149
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,155
Home school,
till today.

150
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,359
Home school.
What's that?

151
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,960
I go to school
where I live.

152
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,937
Me too!
Seriously!

153
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,372
- No?
- Yeah!

154
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,069
Whoa, that's my bus! Hey! Hey!

155
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,737
No, wait!
No, wait!

156
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,336
Hi! Hello!

157
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,110
I missed it.
Now I have to walk.

158
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,983
It's right over there.

159
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,180
- Is that what I think it is?
- Nope, it's a treasure map.

160
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,654
Cool.

161
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,919
My mom says it's
somewhere in the school.

162
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,983
I don't know, I'm pretty
familiar with the school

163
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:00,518
and I've never seen
that X before. Mm-mmm.

164
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,554
Ooh, but I do
know something.

165
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,463
- What?
- Yeah.

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,798
You're it.

167
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,463
I'm it?

168
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,062
What's it?

169
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,574
I don't really know,
you know, but whatever it is,

170
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,099
it's something you
don't want to be, and right now...

171
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,112
yeah, you are.

172
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:18,909
Wait, so if I touch you,
you're it?

173
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:21,212
- Yeah, that's how it works, Harry.
- You're it!

174
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,512
- No, Harry!
- See you later!

175
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,019
Wait... ahh!

176
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,647
Hello, my yellow friend.
Sorry I missed ya.

177
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:30,090
So high school's all about looking cool,
Harry, so stick with me.

178
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:32,720
Why are those girls
dressed in matching outfits?

179
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,162
They're cheerleaders, Harry.
It's a dangerous cult.

180
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,632
- Don't let them talk to you.
- Don't we want them to talk to us?

181
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,828
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- Why not?

182
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,234
Besides cooties and other
medical reasons,

183
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,500
they're not in the cool crowd, which
I am, which you want to be a part of.

184
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,066
- You know what I mean?
- No. Hey.

185
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,404
- What about her?
- She's a total dork.

186
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,177
I mean, just look
how she dresses.

187
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,380
Check out that skirt. I mean,
it's so short. Where's the flood?

188
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,719
And that sweater... it's so tight,
her milk-bubbles are popping out.

189
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:01,745
Loser.

190
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,759
Oh my gosh, she's not
wearing underwear.

191
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,318
Yeah, how dorky is that.
I'm wearing two pair right now.

192
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,353
Me too.

193
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,898
This is my Mohawk friend, Turk.

194
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,958
He's part of the cool crowd.
Hey, Kimosabe!

195
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:14,526
Shut up, ass-face.

196
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,437
That's the Iroquois name he gave me
for having the strong face of an ass.

197
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,532
Looks like we're going
to go have a pow-wow!

198
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,678
Ooh. Hi.

199
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:26,307
I hope the carpet
matches the drapes.

200
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:27,680
Excuse me?

201
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,446
You know, in the library.

202
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,783
Oh. Yeah.

203
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,687
I don't think it does.

204
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:37,591
- You're new here, right?
- Depends on how you define new.

205
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,322
You're the kid
who was home schooled.

206
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,353
Yeah.
How'd you know?

207
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,661
I was assigned to write
an article for the school paper.

208
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:44,893
It was either
a feature on you

209
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,993
or the new four-color ink pens
at the student store.

210
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,300
Four colors in one pen?

211
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,068
No! That's impossible.

212
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,405
Yeah, well,

213
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:56,172
I'd rather be writing a hard-hitting
investigative piece

214
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,874
but nothing ever happens around here.
I'm Jessica Matthews.

215
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,882
Hi.

216
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:04,681
- Harry Dunne.
- What's going on here?

217
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,448
Hey, freakshow,

218
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,583
did Jessica give you
that banana in your pants?

219
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,115
No, my mom did.

220
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,718
- Gross.
- You want a bite?

221
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:15,128
Hey, smells like cheese. Whoo!

222
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:17,997
- Turk, leave him alone.
- "Turk, leave him alone."

223
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,661
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

224
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,330
- Oh boy.
- Harry, I'll talk to you later.

225
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,397
Pretty colors.

226
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,170
Ride's not over yet, pal.

227
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,370
Hey, can my friend
Harry come too?

228
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:31,107
- Yes, he can.
- Hi, Harry.

229
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,172
So were you held back
two years like Lloyd?

230
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,876
No, I was held back three.

231
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,511
By your mom?

232
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,351
All you got
to feel it, all right.

233
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,253
And Principal Collins,

234
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,124
you'll be pleased to know
that this year

235
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,187
Wednesday's are
"South of the Border" days.

236
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,393
We'll be serving
a spicy tuna tamale

237
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:54,028
along with a three-cheese
quesadilla.

238
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,005
Sounds like it's going
to be another...

239
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,700
hot year in the kitchen.

240
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,917
- Hello?
- Yes? What is it?

241
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,945
Sir, it's time
for morning announcements.

242
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,650
Yes, l...
I'm aware of that.

243
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,386
Yes. Um...

244
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,122
why don't you make
the announcements this morning, dear?

245
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:21,390
But what should I announce?

246
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,831
- Tell her about the quesadillas.
- Make something up!

247
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:25,891
Okay.

248
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,737
Well, that was
a mood breaker.

249
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,402
You know, honey...

250
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,105
I think I've finally
figured out a way

251
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,205
to bilk this school
out of enough money

252
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:42,046
to get us that condo
in Waikiki.

253
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:44,314
How, sweet baby?
You've done it all.

254
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,218
Small potatoes.

255
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,519
This is the big one.
This is visionary.

256
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,957
This idea is genius.

257
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:52,927
Look at this.

258
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,193
The Richard Moffitt
Special Needs Grant.

259
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:02,295
This Moffitt guy used to be
in a special needs program,

260
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,397
and then he learns to string
a couple of sentences together

261
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,340
and now he's some
big hotshot.

262
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,276
Anyway, the state is giving
100 grand in his name

263
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,577
to every school that has
a special needs class.

264
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,212
- This is fantastic!
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,222
All we have to do
is kill this Moffitt guy

266
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:21,780
and we get all the money.

267
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,156
No, no.

268
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:28,789
What we need is to set up
a fake special needs class.

269
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,322
We start our own class.

270
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,803
Problem is,
where do we find kids...

271
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,506
we can pass off
as special?

272
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,337
Okay, that's high enough!

273
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:44,812
- Thanks, Turk.
- I'm flying! Woo-hoo!

274
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,214
So this is what a flag
sees all day.

275
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,445
- Yeah.
- And your friend Turk is totally great.

276
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,044
Yeah, he's aces, huh?

277
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,079
Hey, thanks, Turk!
We're so high!

278
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,658
Bingo.

279
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,061
Welcome to special needs
orientation.

280
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:04,895
I'm Ms. Heller,
the lunch lady.

281
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,799
And it...
damn.

282
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,304
I mean, your new teacher.

283
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,806
Yeah.

284
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:16,437
Now the reason you two are here
before class officially starts

285
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,141
is because you're...

286
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,648
extra special.

287
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,148
Thank you.

288
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:26,518
And were personally selected
by Principal Collins.

289
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,580
Who's Principal Collins?

290
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,854
- He's the principal.
- Wow.

291
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,588
Your first assignment

292
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,858
is to pick
the rest of the class.

293
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,422
Hey!

294
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,731
Find students that are
just as special as you two.

295
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,066
Special.

296
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:44,666
What?

297
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,273
Is... is this gonna be
on the midterm?

298
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:52,576
No.

299
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:02,121
You know, you're the first person
I ever brought here, Harry.

300
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:05,092
- Is this your special place?
- No, I just usually eat in the crapper.

301
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:07,391
Yeah, saves time.
Out with the old, in with the new.

302
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,330
- Could we eat there tomorrow?
- Yeah, but first we need to find kids

303
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,494
that are special, needy, and classy enough
to be in our special needs class.

304
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:16,027
It'll be like taking
candy from a stranger.

305
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,006
- "Har-ery"?
- The second "R" is silent.

306
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,633
Oh, that makes
much more sense.

307
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,611
Oh, little crippled boy.
Look.

308
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:26,376
Our first recruit.

309
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:30,545
- His curse is our blessing.
- Careful, Harry, don't scare him.

310
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,645
Hey, little guy.
Hey little orphan buddy.

311
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,986
- What happened?
- Skateboard.

312
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:38,255
- One day, they'll find a cure.
- You brave little soldier.

313
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,852
What?

314
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,988
No, man, it's nothing.
The cast comes off in a few weeks.

315
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:45,489
He's obviously in denial.
Maybe we can help.

316
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:48,367
We're part of a special class
taught by the lunch lady.

317
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,895
I mean, Ms. Heller.
You should join up.

318
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,567
It doesn't
require any walking.

319
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,599
No one will make fun
of your horrible deformity.

320
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,270
- How much homework is there?
- That's the downside.

321
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,975
- There's none.
- Dude, dude.

322
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,414
Wait a minute, I can spend
the whole year

323
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,181
in a class taught
by the lunch lady?

324
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,620
Yeah.

325
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,456
- Can I bring my girlfriend?
- You can bring whatever you want.

326
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,654
All right.

327
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,096
Yeah

328
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:19,896
Here we go

329
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,880
It's a new day,
but it all feels old

330
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:36,009
- It's a good life
that's what I'm told

331
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:41,250
But everyday,
it all just feels the same

332
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,884
At my high school,
it felt more to me

333
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,690
Like a jail cell,
a penitentiary...

334
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,596
- Harry Dunne, Special Needs.
- He's with us.

335
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:51,566
You deserve him.

336
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,092
- I guess I owe you this one.
- I don't ever want to be like you

337
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,503
I don't want to do
the things you do

338
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,269
I'm never gonna hear
the words you say

339
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,641
And I don't ever wanna,
I don't ever wanna

340
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,976
Be you

341
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,209
Don't wanna
be just like you...

342
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,682
Go, go, go!

343
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,277
This is the anthem,
throw all your hands up

344
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,220
You...

345
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:15,223
He's out.
Put him on the disabled list.

346
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,860
That means you're
one of us now.

347
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,425
You...

348
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,367
We already have
a special slogan.

349
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,773
Harry,
what are you doing?

350
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,367
She's a foreign
exchange student.

351
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,345
She obviously doesn't
speak the English.

352
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,041
Ching chong ching
chingy chong ching chong ching.

353
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,915
You

354
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,511
Don't want to be just like you

355
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,419
What I'm saying is
this is the anthem

356
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,549
- Throw all your hands up
- Ching chongen ay.

357
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,752
Y'all got to feel me,
sing if you're with me...

358
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,388
Get your car washed
and support the Stallions.

359
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,092
- Aah.
- Whoa!

360
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:58,394
The half boy/half horse.

361
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,164
Oh! That's more
of what we're looking for.

362
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:04,730
- He's super special.
- Well...

363
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,537
I mean, I got to get
a job anyway.

364
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:10,067
So if l...
if I sign your thing,

365
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,273
I can just come and go
whenever I want to?

366
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:14,441
You were born free,

367
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,280
and free
you shall remain.

368
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,752
Well, okay.

369
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,520
Ah!

370
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:22,546
Easy, easy.

371
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:23,888
Easy, boy, easy, boy.

372
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:27,293
Easy, boy. It's okay.
You're in!

373
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,697
- We did it!
- Yes, we did, Harry.

374
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,567
Special needs class, 1986.

375
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:39,370
We are the chosen ones,
all present and accounted for.

376
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,970
...football player,
the crippled kid...

377
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,946
What about Lewis,
the half horse boy?

378
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,973
- He really had me fooled.
- Here we go.

379
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:50,484
Hey, thanks
for the grub, Mrs. D.

380
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,852
- You're welcome, Lloyd.
- Hey, where's Mr. D?

381
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,416
Oh, he passed away
a few years ago.

382
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:00,053
He missed
one great pot of stew.

383
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:03,121
Actually, it's meatloaf, but you just
put everything in your soup.

384
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,792
I like it a lot.

385
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:10,934
Harry, I am so proud of you
making a real friend.

386
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,600
Is it okay
if he spends the night?

387
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,940
- Lloyd, have you asked your parents?
- I left my dad a note.

388
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,674
"Pop, I'm sleeping
at Harry's tonight.

389
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:23,378
Love, Lloyd.
P.S., you're out of ketchup."

390
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:26,785
Good kid,
but you could've just called.

391
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,055
Got any crazy eights?

392
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,460
Go fish.

393
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,191
Nothing.

394
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:38,199
Four.

395
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,970
Ha! Now you have to move
your peg seven spaces

396
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,529
and put your shirt
on backwards.

397
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,939
Wow, you really suck
at this game.

398
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,375
Yeah, well, I almost always
beat Captain Rob.

399
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,005
- Who's Captain Rob?
- Just a guy I hang out with.

400
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,345
I know the type. Lives in the basement,
smells like a sponge.

401
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,681
No, Captain Rob's seven feet tall,
wears an eye-patch,

402
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,879
- Got a hook for a hand.
- Wow, sounds like a pirate.

403
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,254
What? No. He's got a parrot on his
shoulder, buries treasure.

404
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,657
- Yeah, that's a pirate.
- I don't think so.

405
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:08,686
This guy drinks rum from a barrel,
says, "Yo, ho, ho," has a peg leg.

406
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,130
- A peg leg?
- Yeah, go-cart accident.

407
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,466
Here... we... go!

408
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:17,529
Be careful, Captain Rob.

409
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:24,874
- Ooh.
- Three, two, one.

410
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,381
Aah, you landed on Candy Land.
Now you have to swallow it.

411
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,441
Ready?

412
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:31,475
Swallow!

413
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,617
That's good top hat.

414
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,749
Hey, fellas,

415
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,817
it's getting kind of late.
Come on.

416
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,954
- Can I be on top?
- Only if I can be on bottom.

417
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,430
- All right!
- Yeah!

418
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:48,164
Airplane into the hangar.
Zzz... ow!

419
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,034
All right, pumpkin,
night night.

420
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:52,006
'Night, Mom.

421
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,565
- 'Night Mrs. D.
- Good night, Lloyd.

422
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,506
Thanks for being
a friend to my Harry.

423
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,447
All right, boys, sleep tight.

424
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,006
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

425
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,610
- Hey, hey...
- Ohh. Huh!

426
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,589
- What was that?
- What?

427
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,495
Your mom just totally
made a move on me.

428
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,998
- She did not.
- Yeah, she did, Harry.

429
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,161
Maybe soon
I'll be your new daddy.

430
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,172
- Lloyd, she's my mom.
- Listen, I can't help my heart.

431
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,175
That's right, when I'm your new dad,
you're gonna have to do what I say.

432
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,198
Will not.

433
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,473
Don't you take that tone
with me, young man.

434
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,537
- Shut up.
- I will stop this car right now.

435
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:34,811
- You're not my real dad.
- You take that back!

436
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,216
- Be quiet, buttlick!
- Ohh!

437
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:40,346
- Where did you learn that word?
- I learned it from...

438
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,380
listening to you!

439
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,483
- I hate you!
- Kids.

440
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,929
Thank you, Principal Collins...

441
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:50,625
For our specially needy class!

442
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,258
- They're perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:55,202
Well, you should all
be very proud of yourselves.

444
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:58,263
You are the pioneers here
at Providence Hill High,

445
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,571
the very first
special needs class.

446
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,509
And to commemorate
this occasion,

447
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,705
we're going to take
a class photo.

448
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,737
So let's cover this up
just for the picture.

449
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:10,218
Hold this very high.
That's it.

450
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:12,686
And let's all form a group
under the sign. Quickly.

451
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,416
Now, now,
now, now, now.

452
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:16,390
Beautiful.
Big smile.

453
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,949
Here we go.

454
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,598
Do you remember why
we're here?

455
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:32,698
I'm supposed to take a picture
for Superintendent Zimmer?

456
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,368
And?

457
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,173
- You want me to take it?
- Yes, yes!

458
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,975
- Oh.
- Okay.

459
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,538
Okay, here we go.
Ready?

460
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,209
Cheese!

461
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,150
- Cheese.
- Cheese!

462
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,215
- What stinks?
- That'd be me, sir.

463
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:51,555
- Wife made the stew last night.
- Shut up, Lloyd.

464
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,458
- You're not married yet.
- Will be.

465
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,588
I hope you'll all enjoy
your new classroom.

466
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,929
This is not it. It's a special wing
in back of the school we've built for you.

467
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,832
Why don't you go back
and take a look at it now?

468
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,360
Quickly, now.
Just head back there. That's it, now.

469
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,568
Principal Collins,
what about the crippled boy?

470
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,099
- Yes, take him with you.
- "Confirmitive."

471
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,977
Easy. Lloyd, Lloyd, Lloyd.
No, no, no.

472
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:15,108
I can... I'll just walk,
all right? Is that all right?

473
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,414
Collins is a great man.

474
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,250
Yeah, that's why he was
elected principal.

475
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,756
- That's it. On your way.
- Your Highness.

476
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:28,092
That's good.
Well, so far so good.

477
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,462
I do think we need
some more pictures, though.

478
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:33,229
Why don't you take the kids
on a field trip tomorrow?

479
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,293
And...?

480
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:38,101
- And take some more pictures.
- Okay.

481
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,767
Yeah, okay.

482
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:42,333
Well, don't you have
a phony class to teach?

483
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:45,244
I put in for a sub.

484
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,305
Was that naughty?

485
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,150
I think I need a "panking."

486
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:52,983
Pank, pank, pank.

487
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:54,682
You gonna give me
a panking?

488
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:56,554
Clap your hands...

489
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,359
Hello, class.
My name is Mr. Christmas.

490
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,364
Mrs. Heller had to attend
some serious and urgent business,

491
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:06,196
so I will be
your substitute teacher.

492
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:09,499
It's gonna take me a while to learn
everyone's names, so please be patient.

493
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:12,268
- Me, me. Pick me!
- Uh... you.

494
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,798
- Harry.
- Harry. Oooh.

495
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:17,437
You look familiar.
Oh, did I have your brother?

496
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,209
- No.
- No, okay. Any other questions?

497
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:22,148
- Was there one...?
- Yo!

498
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:24,618
What's with horse boy?
Now he's a bright shiny sun.

499
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,314
Yeah, don't look
directly at him.

500
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:28,948
I'm just handing out fliers
at the tanning salon, guys.

501
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,857
- It's a part-time job.
- No, that's... congratulations.

502
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:33,986
Did you have a question there,
bright eyes?

503
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:37,362
Yeah, my question's when
the old teacher lady coming back?

504
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,993
I am your teacher lady for today.

505
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:47,035
Lloyd, can I have
a word with you for a minute?

506
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:50,044
Oh, take this time
to study amongst yourselves.

507
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:52,603
Obviously there must be some
sort of family emergency,

508
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,774
otherwise there's no reason
my father would be

509
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,841
interrupting me
while I'm working.

510
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,648
- Coming. What the...?
- That's your dad?

511
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,382
Yeah.
What was your name again?

512
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:03,414
- Harry.
- Harry. Come with me, Harry.

513
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,621
- What's up, Pop?
- We need to talk.

514
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,858
So you must be in the air force.
I like your flight suit.

515
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:13,390
- I'm a custodian.
- Well, then...

516
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,164
aye aye, sir!

517
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,668
Okay, what are you crazy boys
doing in my tool shed?

518
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,538
We're not crazy, Dad,
we're special.

519
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:23,442
And Principal Collins wants us
to have our own special classroom.

520
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:27,073
My boy's special,
how 'bout that?!

521
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:30,607
I knew you
were different! Ohhh!

522
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:32,643
I'm taking the day off.

523
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:35,053
Come on, come on.

524
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,388
All right, guys,
now that teacher lady's gone,

525
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:39,552
um... I have a question.

526
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:42,586
Do you guys know why
our class is in the tool shed?

527
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:45,532
Who cares, Lewis?
It's better than real school.

528
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,034
If we don't mess this up,

529
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,127
we can go a whole year without
doing any real work at all.

530
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,402
Yeah, man, we can do
anything we want.

531
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,101
Anything.

532
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:56,133
Anything?

533
00:24:56,178 --> 00:25:01,115
So if I had a girlfriend like Terri,
I could bring her here and...

534
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:03,413
do stuff with her?

535
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:04,975
You got it, jerk-off.

536
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,920
Then I'm in.
Yeah.

537
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:12,291
But I came here to learn
about America.

538
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,454
Listen, baby,

539
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,487
there is nothing more American

540
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:19,261
than not doing anything
and getting away with it.

541
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:21,201
Ohh.
Then I'm in.

542
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:24,171
- Just like jerk-off.
- Lewis.

543
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:28,233
Carl?

544
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:33,708
- He's snapping out of it.
- We need him.

545
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:35,648
I know.
Come on, kid!

546
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,584
- Come on, come on!
- Go get some!

547
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:44,817
Carl?

548
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:47,327
Oh, wow.

549
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,397
Who is Benjamin Franklin again?

550
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:53,026
He's the pilgrim who used
penicillin to kill Godzilla.

551
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,002
Right.
How'd you get so smart?

552
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:56,469
Public school.
Yeah.

553
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:59,098
When you live in the basement,
you breathe in a lot of chalk dust.

554
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,040
It writes all the answers
all over your brain.

555
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,407
- You're so lucky.
- Ooh, now...

556
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,912
- How 'bout a Slushee?
- A. Slushee.

557
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:07,540
Don't tell me.
Abraham Slushee...

558
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:11,040
I know this... third President
of the United States!

559
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:13,213
That's right, Harry.

560
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:16,315
And this is the frozen delicious treat
he was named after.

561
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,020
- Nice jugs.
- Yeah.

562
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,894
Hey, your mom's
got jugs like these.

563
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:26,230
Yeah, but they
never been in a magazine.

564
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,327
They ought to be.
They're beautiful.

565
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,367
Ooh, Harry,
I just realized something.

566
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:36,343
- What?
- You're it!

567
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:39,108
- Oh no, you're not getting me again.
- "Victoria's Secret," huh?

568
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:41,081
- Those clothes are for chicks.
- $2.50.

569
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:43,243
- You're it.
- Oh, you wanna go?

570
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:45,116
You wanna go,
huh, Harry?

571
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:46,814
Jousting,
14th century!

572
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,122
- You're it!
- You're it.

573
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,524
Invisibility shield.
Booo!

574
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,289
I know where you are!

575
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,196
- I know where you are!
- Please pay me the $2.50.

576
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:58,631
I know where you are!

577
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,658
- I know where you are!
- You're it.

578
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,499
Seriously, stop for a second.

579
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,562
Come here, Harry,
seriously, for a second. You're it!

580
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:05,903
Oh!
No, you're it!

581
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,602
Harry, buns!
You're it!

582
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:11,510
You're it!

583
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,844
- You're it!
- No, I'm not.

584
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,850
Yeah, you are.

585
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,511
He touched you.

586
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,452
You're it until
you touch someone else.

587
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:22,854
I know the rules, I'm just not
playing your stupid game.

588
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,722
Now pay me $2.50.

589
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:29,760
You're it.

590
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:30,822
You're it.

591
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,059
- You're it.
- No, you're it.

592
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,533
- No, you are.
- You're it.

593
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,729
You're it.

594
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,106
Enough!
You're it!

595
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:46,079
And no touch-backs,
no do-overs,

596
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:48,742
no erasies,
and in this whole store

597
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,717
is home free!

598
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:56,657
Lloyd, can he do that?

599
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:58,818
Oh yeah, Harry.

600
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,658
He can...
and he did.

601
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,561
And now...

602
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,229
it's on
like Donkey Kong.

603
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,397
Pay the man.

604
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,736
Pay the man.

605
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,570
- Good.
- Yeah.

606
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,411
I thought we
handled that pretty well.

607
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,246
These are really cold, huh?

608
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,616
That's why you got
to drink 'em fast, Harry, trust me.

609
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,825
Drink it, Harry.
Come on, buddy!

610
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:37,331
Drink, drink, drink!
Go, Harry, go!

611
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,424
Whoo-hoo!

612
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,064
Oww.

613
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,367
Refreshing.

614
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,932
Ohh! So what do you
want to do today, Harry?

615
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,240
I don't know.

616
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:52,246
Oww!
It hurts so good.

617
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,872
Ahh!

618
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:56,042
No, Harry, you're not
drinking it fast enough.

619
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,143
You got to drink faster.
You got to go fast. Go fast!

620
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:01,019
Go fast, go fast, go fast!
You got to drink it fast, Harry,

621
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:02,682
before it melts!

622
00:29:07,562 --> 00:29:09,223
Tastes so good.

623
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:11,357
I can't feel my face.

624
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:16,632
Didn't hurt.

625
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,229
Didn't hurt.

626
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:21,799
I felt that.

627
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:25,106
Mmmm...

628
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:32,015
Harry, my mouth is frozen.

629
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:35,784
I can't...
I can't feel my lips.

630
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:39,055
- Harry, they're frozen.
- I don't feel good.

631
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:40,856
Oh, Harry,
here comes trouble.

632
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:45,899
Oh, hey guys.

633
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,528
Your milk bubbles look nice,
Jessica.

634
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,970
Good one, Harry.

635
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:53,064
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

636
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:04,211
I can't believe she's
wearing that outfit.

637
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:07,244
Yeah, last time
I wore those shorts, I got beat up.

638
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:10,214
Beat up?

639
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:23,160
Guess what's
under these coconuts?

640
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:26,034
What?

641
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,237
It's a surprise.

642
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:32,474
Well, I've got
a little surprise for you.

643
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:35,581
You got the extender?

644
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,443
No.

645
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:42,945
No, I talked to Superintendent
Zimmer this morning.

646
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,858
- Oh.
- He's sending Richard Moffitt himself

647
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:47,862
to our Thanksgiving Day parade,

648
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,625
check in hand.

649
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:52,394
Oh, monkey,
this is too exciting.

650
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,264
Our dream is coming true.

651
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:56,429
Smile, sweetheart.

652
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:04,107
More pictures
for the chest.

653
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:09,950
What do you keep
in there?

654
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:11,952
Oh, things.

655
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:16,218
Photos, tapes.

656
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:19,420
I tape everything
that goes on in this office.

657
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,655
Just like the President.

658
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:24,187
Just like
the President.

659
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:26,223
Come here, monkey.

660
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:30,031
- Whoo.
- Hey, it's upside down.

661
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:32,335
Here, hold my sack.

662
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:33,806
All right, according
to the map,

663
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,502
we're almost at school.

664
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,807
Yeah, but we still
haven't found any treasure.

665
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,437
Harry...

666
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,614
Hallelujah,
hallelujah...

667
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,620
We may have found
something even better.

668
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,246
Come on.

669
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:51,289
It's our own
special bus, Harry!

670
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,161
How do you know
it's for us?

671
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:59,792
Because cool kids always sit
in the back of the bus, Harry,

672
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,597
and here, every row
is the back.

673
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,627
We're all cool.
Come on!

674
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:09,168
Careful, Harry, it's short!

675
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,973
Hey, Harry, I'm in the front
of the bus!

676
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,378
- I'm in the back!
- I'm in the front!

677
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:16,579
Turk, what are you
doing here?

678
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,678
- Special needs class.
- Being a jerk doesn't make you special.

679
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:23,282
You're just jealous.
This is the best class ever.

680
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,258
So don't ruin it!

681
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:30,557
Sorry, special needs only.

682
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:32,759
Look, Ms. Heller,
there's something fishy here.

683
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,791
And I don't think
it's Friday's special.

684
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,201
Hmm. Well,
I wouldn't know,

685
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:38,228
since I'm just
the teacher and all.

686
00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:40,638
Now less talking
and more sitting, huh, gang?

687
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:44,406
Let's go, Margie,
the museum ain't gonna teach itself.

688
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,710
This is a much bigger story
than four-color pens.

689
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,563
Every day I get in the queue

690
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:06,897
- Too much, magic bus
- To get on the bus that takes me to you

691
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,061
- Too much, magic bus...
- You want a scoop?

692
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:10,092
I'll give you a scoop.

693
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,969
You think we're gonna stop for ice cream?

694
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,702
No. Maybe.

695
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,074
- Your house is only another mile...
- Lose her.

696
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:19,579
Too much, magic bus...

697
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,614
- Slug bug. Slug bug.
- Ow! Ow!

698
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:27,120
Can it be the same one?
Slug bug!

699
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:28,679
- Ow!
- Slug... I can still see you.

700
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:31,123
- That's not how you play!
- Playing Australian rules.

701
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,820
Don't let her pass!

702
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,589
I don't care
how much I pay

703
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,395
Too much, magic bus...

704
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,665
- Scissors, scissors.
- This is too.

705
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:50,908
- What's that?
- It's an eagle.

706
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,470
- This is a barracuda.
- Fish can't eat a bird.

707
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:00,820
Ha, ha, too big to make the turn!

708
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:03,483
- You can't squish a bird with a paper cut.
- Yeah, you can.

709
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:05,992
- Yeah, you can.
- You can't squish... No, you can't.

710
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:11,165
- Punch buggy.
- Ow!

711
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,298
Margie, look out!

712
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:21,497
Help me!

713
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:35,019
I said, now I've got
my magic bus...

714
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:40,152
Now I've got my magic bus

715
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:43,163
Too much, magic bus.

716
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:46,724
Everyone find a partner.
You're no good to me dead.

717
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:49,328
- Harry, get back here!
- I'm back, I'm back.

718
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,962
- I'm going.
- Harry? Harry!

719
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,200
Spin faster,
we'll go back in time!

720
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,334
I'm right behind you.
I'm right behind you.

721
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:57,401
No, no, no!
Aaah!

722
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,413
We got to partner up.

723
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:02,575
- What do you say, you and me?
- Dream on, desperado.

724
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:05,177
Right, field trip partner
is kind of a big commitment.

725
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,380
I'm joking. Of course I'll
be your partner.

726
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:10,788
You got some serious self-worth issues,
my pudgy, ugly little friend.

727
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,986
Stop it, you're
embarrassing me.

728
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,655
Okay, say "fajitas."

729
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,459
- Fajitas!
- Good, got it.

730
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:19,523
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

731
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,900
Now... excuse me. How long does the
average field trip take here?

732
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:27,237
Well, to fully experience all we
have to offer, it takes two hours.

733
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:29,505
Two. Okay.
You know, I'll be back in four.

734
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,069
So why don't you give the tour twice,
and speak slowly?

735
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:34,138
- Oh, we don't take tips here.
- Oh, sure you do.

736
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:36,377
I know you don't make much.
Don't be proud.

737
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:38,681
Don't be proud. It's going away.
It's going away.

738
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,153
It's going away. It's okay.
That's what I thought.

739
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,851
- That's what I thought.
- Okay.

740
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:50,924
I like your outfit,
Mr. Polar bear.

741
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:54,924
Hmm. Okay, I'm just
going to turn and walk away.

742
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,867
Ha!

743
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,999
Okay...

744
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:03,567
I'm watching you.

745
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,442
Harry?

746
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:07,606
Who told you my name?

747
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,115
Harry?

748
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,516
Harry?

749
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:14,077
Ms. Heller said
not to talk to you.

750
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:16,385
That's because Ms. Heller
doesn't want you to know

751
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,585
this whole thing is a scam.

752
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,423
I knew it was a fake.

753
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,827
- You did?
- Yeah. Those Eskimos?

754
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:25,992
I'm sure at least
one of them is a mannequin.

755
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,796
Harry, you're so funny.

756
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,395
But listen, I have to ask you
a question that might...

757
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,996
put you in
a delicate position.

758
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,064
You want to talk
about your delicates?

759
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,703
Are you trying to be funny,
or you actually re...

760
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,679
special?

761
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:42,842
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd
and I chose for the class is special.

762
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:44,476
You and Lloyd chose
the class?

763
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:45,780
Mm-hmm.

764
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,482
This is all starting
to make sense.

765
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:50,183
Could you come
to my house tonight?

766
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,920
- Excuse me?
- We need to talk.

767
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,928
- Come over around 7:00?
- O'clock?

768
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,953
Yeah.

769
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:58,795
Okay.

770
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,530
A date.

771
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:06,036
She said something
about something.

772
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:08,064
That's perfect, Harry.
Then what?

773
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,670
Then she said "7:00"
and I said, "O'clock!"

774
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:17,446
Sorry about that, buddy. It's my
first time bringing a friend up there.

775
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,816
- You okay?
- Yeah!

776
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,447
So you gotta
help me out, Lloyd.

777
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,582
A real live date
with a real live girl.

778
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,285
Who cares?
Chicks are for fags.

779
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,954
I think she wants me to come over
to put me in the right position

780
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,622
to check out
her delicates.

781
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,428
- Whatever that means.
- Oh yeah, you're gonna get some.

782
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:33,831
- Some what?
- You know.

783
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,927
She'll be all over you
like a barrelful of monkeys

784
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,699
with that short skirt
and that tight shirt.

785
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:39,672
Ooh, it's so faggy I can't
even think about it.

786
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:42,198
- Come on, Lloyd.
- Okay, if you're gonna do this,

787
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:45,144
bring her something special.
Buy her some chocolate...

788
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,476
the best you can find.

789
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,539
Seems simple enough.

790
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,660
Knock, knock, knock.

791
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,559
Hello, Jessica.

792
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:03,722
It's nice to see you,
Jessica.

793
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,164
That's not right.

794
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,431
Hi, Jessica.
Do you remember me from before?

795
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,301
I'm Harry

796
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,364
That's stupid!
Okay.

797
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:16,706
Hello, Jessica.
Harry... Mrs. Harry Jessica.

798
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:19,304
Mr. Harry Jessica.

799
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:21,645
- J-e-s-s-i-s-s-i...
- Harry?

800
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:22,910
Harry, hi.

801
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,111
Do you want
to come inside?

802
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,545
Okay. Wipe your feet.
My parents are totally anal.

803
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,251
Oh, that's gross.

804
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:34,420
- Would you like something to drink?
- Yeah, but I'm buying.

805
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:37,363
Harry, I have a lot of questions
to go over with you,

806
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,956
so let's just
go upstairs.

807
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,959
Good plan.
I'm not really ready for downstairs.

808
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:45,029
Harry, you're so funny.

809
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,336
Really?
I'm not even trying.

810
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:51,539
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

811
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,480
I'll race ya!

812
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:57,916
- Harry, stop horsing around.
- Oh, boy.

813
00:38:57,952 --> 00:39:00,250
Okay, there's a lot
to go over, Harry,

814
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:01,982
so it may get
hard for you.

815
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,287
Hard for me?
Hard for me?

816
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,587
Hard for me?

817
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:06,991
Harry, do you want
to sit down?

818
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:09,622
- No, no, I'm okay.
- Okay.

819
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:12,655
I think Collins and Heller are
embezzling money from the school,

820
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,395
and I think it's
been going on for years.

821
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,426
I just have to figure out
some way to prove it.

822
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,461
I mean, it doesn't make
any sense to me.

823
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:21,202
But I guess there's got
to be a good explanation.

824
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:23,802
Heller wore
a coconut bra...

825
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:27,610
Wow, she's really
making me feel hot.

826
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:33,080
What's worse is I think the entire
special needs class is a scam.

827
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,281
But... I need proof.

828
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,450
I don't know how much longer
I can stand it.

829
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,756
I didn't think the first time
would hurt so much.

830
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,889
- Especially in the ass!
- What?!

831
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:47,924
Harry, I'm in a position
where I really need your help.

832
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,799
P-position?

833
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:51,498
Great.
Have you a bathroom?

834
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,632
Yeah, down the hall.

835
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,506
I'll be back in a jiff.

836
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,691
Okay, okay. Water!

837
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,831
Oh, I couldn't.
I didn't.

838
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:27,340
No, no, no, no.
Oh, what's in there?

839
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,238
Mmm.

840
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,888
No, it can't be.

841
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:48,795
Ohh.

842
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:52,599
Oh! No.

843
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,066
Oh, I didn't...

844
00:40:57,004 --> 00:40:58,369
Oh, no, no, no!

845
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:01,672
Oh no, no, no...

846
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,114
Harry? You've been
in there a while.

847
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,049
- Are you okay?
- Are you kiddin'?

848
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:11,449
I couldn't be more okay.

849
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,453
My mom wants to know
if you can stay for dinner.

850
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,682
Are you kiddin'?
Coming.

851
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,884
Okay.

852
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:21,818
I was walking down the street
on a sunny day

853
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,727
Hubba, hubba,
hubba, hubba

854
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,789
A feeling in my bones
says I'll have my way

855
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,233
- Hubba, hubba...
- Look out, waxer coming through.

856
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:29,566
I'm a happy boy, happy boy

857
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:31,571
I'm a happy boy,
happy boy

858
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:34,096
Oh ain't it good when things
are going your way?

859
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:35,608
Hey, hey...

860
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,146
Harry, are you coming down?

861
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:42,740
Just cleaning up!

862
00:41:57,731 --> 00:41:59,562
Harry! Harry!

863
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,160
Lloyd, what are you doing here?

864
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:03,727
I came to check on you, buddy.

865
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,762
I kinda screwed things up.

866
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,330
I'm sure you're overreacting.

867
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:09,171
I don't think so.

868
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,304
Harry, why are you
covered in poo?

869
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:14,507
l... I don't know!

870
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:17,039
- Okay.
- She asked me to stay for dinner.

871
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:19,177
I don't know
what to say to her.

872
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,688
Oh, okay, I got an idea!
I saw this in a movie once.

873
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:24,156
It was a good one.
Go down to this window right here,

874
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:26,250
open it up, and then
say whatever I say.

875
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,193
Okay, thanks.
I got to find some clothes.

876
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,526
All right.

877
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:35,694
Perfect,
a businessman's suit.

878
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,499
Harry, what are
you wearing?

879
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:42,668
I changed for dinner.

880
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,975
I get dressed for all my meals,
except for breakfast and...

881
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:47,674
spazz meal.

882
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:51,674
Boy, it's hot in here.
Do you mind if I open a window?

883
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,277
Be my guest.

884
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:56,983
- Harry, can you hear me?
- Yes.

885
00:42:57,024 --> 00:43:00,152
- Yes what?
- No, don't answer me, say what I say.

886
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:01,957
Okay.

887
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,659
- Okay what?
- You have beautiful eyes.

888
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:08,691
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Thank you.

889
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:11,967
Oh, hey.

890
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,702
- Where'd you come from?
- Hey, where'd you come from?

891
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:16,869
I was born in St. Louis.

892
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,400
Do you want me
to pet your head?

893
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:19,969
Do you want me
to pet your head?

894
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,073
- I bet you want your head scratched!
- I bet you want

895
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:23,606
- Your head scratched.
- No, why?

896
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:25,414
We still have a lot
to talk about.

897
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:27,386
I bet you want...
don't you snap at me!

898
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:30,049
You're lucky
I don't punch you right in the face!

899
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,059
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky
I don't punch you in the face.

900
00:43:33,093 --> 00:43:37,894
I remember you. How could I forget
those big, hairy nipples?

901
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:40,627
I remember you. How could I forget
those big, hairy nipples?

902
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:42,966
I can almost smell your
stinky "fenuter" from here!

903
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:45,130
I can almost smell your
stinky "fenuter" from here!

904
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:46,264
Harry!

905
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:48,241
Now what are you staring at,
you ugly monkey?

906
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,300
Now what are you staring at,
you ugly monkey?

907
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:53,211
- Jessica, who's this?
- It's Harry, Dad.

908
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:56,910
- Why is he talking to you like that?
- He's... special.

909
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,510
Oh.

910
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,180
Hi, Harry.

911
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,587
Hi.

912
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:05,683
Bark, bark!

913
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,715
Dinner's ready.

914
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,955
What are we doing
sitting around yapping?

915
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:12,329
- Let's eat!
- Right.

916
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:18,937
Hey, Harry, be confident!
You look lovely!

917
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:21,133
Oh! Yaa!

918
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:24,911
Lloyd?

919
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,077
What are you doing here?

920
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,583
You live here? I didn't...
I thought Harry was just...

921
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:32,778
visiting his accountant.

922
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,184
So you like
your butter, do you?

923
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:42,195
We got some margarine, if you want.

924
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:45,130
- You could scoop it out of the tub.
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

925
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:50,268
- Oh!
- This is... Harry.

926
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:52,636
- Hello.
- Hi.

927
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:55,233
You know, they make that
in a woman's suit, too.

928
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:01,212
Jessica, we're eating!

929
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:02,806
Meet me at the front door.

930
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,045
Yeah, I was just
gonna go there anyway.

931
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:06,916
Well, I see you like
my rolls.

932
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,422
Sure, I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

933
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:17,496
Well...

934
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:19,658
So Charlie,
what business are you in?

935
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,463
The name's Walter.

936
00:45:25,072 --> 00:45:26,437
- Lloyd, hi.
- Jessica, yeah.

937
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,634
So, did you
give him some yet?

938
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:31,109
- Some what?
- You know, some.

939
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,443
Lloyd, Harry and I
have been talking about school.

940
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,243
In fact, I want to ask
you something.

941
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:37,512
Yeah, I know.
You want to go for a ride.

942
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:40,111
Pretty sweet waxer, huh?

943
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,123
- Where did that come from?
- I live with the janitor.

944
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,148
Yup, I got a key
to every room in the school.

945
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,387
So can you get us
into the principal's office?

946
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:50,022
Principal's office?
Yeah, I could probably swing that.

947
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:52,793
Lloyd, that's it!
Maybe now I'll get my story!

948
00:45:54,535 --> 00:45:57,163
- What?!
- Aah!

949
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:02,808
Two-timing slut! And you,
I thought you were from St. Louis?

950
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,505
I don't ever want
to see you again!

951
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:11,212
Oh my God.

952
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,082
And I'm leaving!

953
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:17,556
He shit everywhere.

954
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:21,219
There's shit everywhere!

955
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:22,694
Damn it!

956
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:24,526
There's shit
on the windows!

957
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:28,228
Oh my God,
my house is full of shit!

958
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:30,327
He shit everywhere!

959
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,930
Look what he did.
He shit all over the wall!

960
00:46:32,973 --> 00:46:34,941
- When can we do it?
- Get up here!

961
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:36,408
Uh...

962
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:38,104
- How about tonight at 8:00?
- Okay.

963
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:40,079
- Great, thanks.
- My house if full of bile!

964
00:46:40,113 --> 00:46:42,809
Thank you, Lloyd. I got to go upstairs.
You got to leave.

965
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,715
See you at 8:00.

966
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:47,447
- Calm down, just calm down!
- Whoo-hoo!

967
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,547
Date with Jessica!
Yeah!

968
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,421
There's shit
all over the wall!

969
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,519
I'm right on time.

970
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,430
Won't be long now.

971
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:03,993
This is gonna be great.

972
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:07,034
I can picture it now.

973
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,302
Lloyd, Lloyd

974
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:11,243
Super cool Lloyd...

975
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:15,112
Oh, ladies, and that's why
God created women with two breasts

976
00:47:15,148 --> 00:47:17,548
instead of three.
Although you're cute, too.

977
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,678
Yes, you are.
You should see her asses.

978
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:26,792
Lloyd, I finished
all your homework.

979
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:29,489
Oh, thanks, Jessica.

980
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,054
Get lost, sister,
he's mine.

981
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,293
In your dreams.
I saw him first!

982
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,268
Oh! You just want him
for his hot rack!

983
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:40,137
You just want him because he's a genius,
like Albert Frankenstein.

984
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,905
Girls, girls,
girls, girls!

985
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,109
All right, there's only
one way to solve this.

986
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:50,912
Make out contest.

987
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,997
How was that, Lloyd?

988
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,379
Lloyd, what are you doing?
That's Jessica.

989
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:27,816
- And my mom?
- Hi, sweetie.

990
00:48:27,854 --> 00:48:29,845
- Hey, Mom.
- Harry, this is my fantasy,

991
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:33,018
and I suggest you leave right now,
before I imagine something horrible.

992
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,425
- But, l...
- Harry!

993
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:37,624
Your fantasies are
so much cooler than mine.

994
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:43,797
Hey, thanks for the jet pack!

995
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:51,911
- Oopsie-daisy.
- Lloyd, did you just fart?

996
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:55,039
Maybe.

997
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:56,845
Well, something stinks.

998
00:48:56,883 --> 00:49:00,148
Maybe it's this...
mix tape I made you.

999
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,916
Or maybe these flowers.

1000
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:04,924
- Uh... thanks Lloyd.
- Yeah.

1001
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:08,223
So are you ready to take me
to the principal's office?

1002
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:11,788
Yeah. So no small talk, huh?
Yeah. Good,

1003
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:14,630
because I'm not
a big fan of the small talk.

1004
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:16,158
So how about this weather?

1005
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:23,506
Hey, Jessica,
I'm coming!

1006
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:32,175
So I see
you've started without me.

1007
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,711
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1008
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:38,384
Let's just do it
and get out of here.

1009
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:41,518
Wow, straight to the business.
Okay.

1010
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,324
Let me just get ready.

1011
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,695
Aah, I can't
get it off.

1012
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,360
I'm so close
I can feel it.

1013
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,038
I never should've
switched from Velcro!

1014
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,734
Oh, wait,
I got it!

1015
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:58,233
- I got it.
- That's it. I'm done.

1016
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:00,542
This just didn't work out
like I thought it would.

1017
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,140
Did you at least
enjoy yourself?

1018
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:05,913
No, it was
a complete waste of time.

1019
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:10,421
This is...
this is embarrassing.

1020
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:12,049
This has never happened
to me before.

1021
00:50:16,296 --> 00:50:18,730
- That's my boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?

1022
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,893
What was all that talk
about you riding on my waxer?

1023
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,563
Thanks, Lloyd, but I didn't find
what I was looking for.

1024
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:29,007
And can you do me a favor
and clean this place up?

1025
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,306
Principal Collins
can't know that we were here.

1026
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:33,278
Yeah, no problem.
I don't kiss and tell!

1027
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:35,679
Huh!

1028
00:50:35,716 --> 00:50:37,741
Ooh.

1029
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,081
Dirty girl.

1030
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,852
Oh my God,
a treasure chest.

1031
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:48,620
I found Harry's treasure.

1032
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:50,061
Ohh!

1033
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:54,700
Oh, it's heavy.
It must be fully loaded.

1034
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:56,669
Harry!

1035
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:21,321
Harry!

1036
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:23,226
Hey, I found the treasure.

1037
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,255
- Go away, ass-face!
- Did you hear what I said, Harry?

1038
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:27,823
The treasure,
like on your map.

1039
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:30,666
Yeah, right. Why don't you go
show it to your girlfriend?

1040
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:32,672
Jessica and I
are through, Harry. Yeah.

1041
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:35,504
I couldn't stand being with her
knowing that you liked her.

1042
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:37,271
It just wasn't worth
our friendship.

1043
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,540
Oh, you know, and also
she had a boyfriend.

1044
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:41,240
Did you hear something,
Captain Rob?

1045
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:45,980
- Captain Rob came back?
- Yeah, he does sound like a rat-fink.

1046
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:50,012
Hey th... there's no reason
to use that kind of language.

1047
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:54,516
Good one, Captain Rob.
He does look like a you-know-what.

1048
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:56,893
We're telling
inside jokes, are we now?

1049
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:00,628
You know what?
That's it.

1050
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:02,965
We're through!
You're out of the cool club!

1051
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:06,336
The next time Turk's passing out
wedgies, you're not gonna get one!

1052
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,364
Nu-uh.

1053
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:11,377
We're done, pal!
Finito! The end!

1054
00:52:13,613 --> 00:52:15,672
"Auf wiener schnitzel!"

1055
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,546
Mazel tov.

1056
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:25,952
Y...

1057
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:32,496
I know just how
to whisper

1058
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:36,730
And I know
just how to cry

1059
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,137
I know just where
to find the answers

1060
00:52:40,173 --> 00:52:43,768
And I know
just how to lie

1061
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,143
I know just how
to fake it

1062
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,173
And I know
just how to scheme

1063
00:52:51,218 --> 00:52:54,312
I know just when
to face the truth

1064
00:52:54,354 --> 00:52:57,915
And then I know
just when to dream

1065
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:01,519
And I know
just where to touch you

1066
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:05,224
And I know just what
to prove

1067
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,598
I know when
to pull you closer

1068
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:11,968
And I know
when to let you loose

1069
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:15,566
But I don't know
how to leave you

1070
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:20,876
And I'll never
let you fall

1071
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:24,543
And I don't know
how you do it

1072
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:29,453
Making love
out of nothin' at all

1073
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:32,549
- Making love
- Outta nothin' at all

1074
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,287
Making love

1075
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:37,353
- Outta nothin' at all
- Making love

1076
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:39,365
Outta nothin' at all

1077
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:40,889
Making love

1078
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:42,333
Love

1079
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,166
Lo-ove

1080
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:48,334
Outta nothin' at all...

1081
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:54,506
Making love.

1082
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:03,982
Come to Pete's Seafood Shanty...

1083
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:05,924
Lloyd!

1084
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:09,360
Do I know you?

1085
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:11,523
Do you know me?
Yeah, you know me.

1086
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,293
I'm in your class, stupid.

1087
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,665
Oh my God,
I can't believe it.

1088
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:20,002
It's... it's really you.
You're Harry's friend, aren't you?

1089
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,406
Well, I wouldn't call us friends,

1090
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:24,273
but we're all right.

1091
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:27,109
You... you really
are a pirate.

1092
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:29,240
Well, yeah.
You like it?

1093
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:31,682
So I'm an arsehole,
eh, Captain Rob? Huh?

1094
00:54:31,718 --> 00:54:34,312
What are you talking about?

1095
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:38,089
Whatever.

1096
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:40,592
- Come to Pete's...
- I want my friend back!

1097
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:45,891
Hey, buddy! Hey, Harry!

1098
00:54:45,932 --> 00:54:47,832
Hey, buddy,
you gotta see this!

1099
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,232
Harry, are you in there?

1100
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:52,204
Harry! Hey!

1101
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,433
Buddy! Woo!

1102
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:57,910
Harry, I got a surprise for you!

1103
00:55:00,146 --> 00:55:03,047
You took the polar bear
out of its natural habitat.

1104
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,074
Yeah.

1105
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:08,751
Mommy, where's
the daddy polar bear?

1106
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:11,848
He was shot by a hunter,
just like your father.

1107
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:15,554
Lloyd,
I can't believe you!

1108
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:18,758
Just when I thought I couldn't
get any madder at you,

1109
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:20,322
you do something
like this.

1110
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:24,235
Get that polar bear
out of my yard

1111
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,738
- And up to my room!
- Okay, buddy!

1112
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,510
- I got it!
- What I want, you've got

1113
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:35,446
And it might
be hard to handle

1114
00:55:35,482 --> 00:55:38,315
Like the flame
that burns the candle

1115
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:41,218
And I can't explain

1116
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,688
Oh yeah,
well, well, you

1117
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:45,418
O-oh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1118
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:49,292
You make my dreams
come true

1119
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,229
Yo-ou, you, you

1120
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,198
Ooh, ooh

1121
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:55,292
Well, well,
well, you

1122
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:56,859
O-oh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1123
00:55:56,903 --> 00:56:00,134
Oh yeah, you make
my dreams come true...

1124
00:56:00,173 --> 00:56:01,663
Hey, buddy,
what happened to you?

1125
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,401
I don't want
any problems, okay?

1126
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:09,006
- Listen to this...
- Move! Move!

1127
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:11,847
Excuse me!
Get out of my way!

1128
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:15,218
He must be jealous
of our polar wear.

1129
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:23,462
Where is it?

1130
00:56:26,566 --> 00:56:29,034
Baby, I'm going to spend
the morning at the mall.

1131
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:31,537
- You know, shop for Waikiki.
- Where the hell is it?

1132
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:34,335
A lot of stuff we could
use for the trip.

1133
00:56:34,374 --> 00:56:37,434
- What are you looking for?
- My chest.

1134
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,037
- The chest I keep my papers in?
- What papers?

1135
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,277
The documents, the photos,
the tapes.

1136
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,841
- The evidence.
- Evidence of what?

1137
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:50,154
Sweetheart, keep up
with me for half a minute.

1138
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:53,057
The evidence of every scam
we've ever pulled,

1139
00:56:53,093 --> 00:56:56,824
the evidence that's going
to put us away for 20 years.

1140
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:59,798
- Where is it?!
- I don't know, it's not here.

1141
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,027
Somebody stole it.

1142
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:04,863
Jessica.

1143
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:08,672
- What Jessica?
- That girl...

1144
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:11,302
who tried to follow me
on the field trip?

1145
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,812
- She took it.
- Are you sure?

1146
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:18,079
Yeah. Oh, she's been snooping around,
asking questions.

1147
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:19,710
Hmm.

1148
00:57:19,752 --> 00:57:22,482
Well...

1149
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,047
- I'll take care of her.
- Yeah?

1150
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:27,059
You gonna kill her?

1151
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:34,294
No. No, I'm not...
I'm not gonna kill her.

1152
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:37,826
Honey, why don't you see to it the kids
are ready for the parade, okay?

1153
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,066
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1154
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,036
And I think I'll pay Jessica...

1155
00:57:44,077 --> 00:57:45,704
a little visit.

1156
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:50,180
Thanksgiving Day parade
is almost here.

1157
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:53,014
So, any ideas for a float?

1158
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,849
- Ooh, a raft!
- A blimp!

1159
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,753
- A turd.
- Titanic.

1160
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:58,552
- A platypus.
- Corn dog.

1161
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:02,027
- Message in a bottle.
- No, not things that float,

1162
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:06,054
ideas for a float. You know,
like if you see a parade

1163
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:08,192
and people are...?

1164
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,724
Can I hear
from anyone else?

1165
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:12,704
- Hello.
- Hi, Ching Chung. What do you have?

1166
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,674
Uh...

1167
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,570
...licka licka pow!

1168
00:58:21,614 --> 00:58:24,583
She's saying
"beautiful swan..."

1169
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:30,618
"...flying gracefully
over the rice fields..."

1170
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:34,991
...Roy Orbison.

1171
00:58:35,028 --> 00:58:38,725
...to the tune
of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.

1172
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,733
No, now come on,
you guys.

1173
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,634
Focus, think.
Put your thinking caps on.

1174
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:46,138
What do you think of
when you think of Thanksgiving?

1175
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:49,573
- Like cranberries and Indians.
- Football!

1176
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,600
Football, yeah!
Get some!

1177
00:58:51,644 --> 00:58:53,509
Good for you.
No.

1178
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:56,572
Oh hey, Lewis has got a good idea.
George Washington.

1179
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,981
- Wow!
- Who?

1180
00:58:58,017 --> 00:59:00,781
- He only invented money.
- Very good, Lloyd.

1181
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,780
How about a float of George Washington
crossing the Delaware?

1182
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:07,690
- Ooh, or maybe a river.
- Like the Atlantic.

1183
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:09,922
Okay, so it's settled.

1184
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,090
This is gonna be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.

1185
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:15,498
You mean we have to... we have
to parade around in front of everyone?

1186
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:17,366
On a float
of George Washington?

1187
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:19,803
- We're gonna look like idiots.
- Exactly.

1188
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,933
No chance. We are not doing it.
No effing way.

1189
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,976
Hey!
Hey, did I mention

1190
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:32,383
that if you don't make a float,
it's back to homework?

1191
00:59:32,418 --> 00:59:35,012
And... real grades.

1192
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:37,147
How would you like that?

1193
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:41,058
Oh... and actually having
to attend class.

1194
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:42,857
No.

1195
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:48,128
Which means, you won't be
so special anymore.

1196
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:56,171
Crack that whip

1197
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,237
Give the past
the slip...

1198
00:59:59,279 --> 01:00:02,214
That's what I was
talking about.

1199
01:00:03,616 --> 01:00:05,345
Break your
momma's back

1200
01:00:05,385 --> 01:00:07,319
Now whip it

1201
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,752
Into shape

1202
01:00:08,788 --> 01:00:10,517
Shape it up

1203
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:12,183
Get straight

1204
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:13,715
Go forward

1205
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,193
Move ahead

1206
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:17,594
Try to detect it,
it's not too late

1207
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,188
To whip it

1208
01:00:19,232 --> 01:00:20,893
Whip it good.

1209
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:31,534
Hey, guys, check it out.

1210
01:00:35,648 --> 01:00:38,617
Thanks, Principal Collins,
for giving me this interview.

1211
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:41,620
Anything I can do to help.
So, you had some questions?

1212
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:43,144
Yes, actually.

1213
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:45,123
Last year, Toby was
in AP English,

1214
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:46,785
and Lewis won
the science fair.

1215
01:00:46,826 --> 01:00:49,192
What are they doing in this
new special needs class?

1216
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,957
Well, that's
a poor question.

1217
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:54,160
It's wordy, pedantic... a good
question gets right to the point.

1218
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,101
Example...
where's my chest?

1219
01:00:57,136 --> 01:01:00,697
Chest? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1220
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,106
Oh, I think you do.

1221
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,107
You know, my parents
are gonna wonder where I am.

1222
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:14,677
One phone call from the principal
will take care of that, my dear.

1223
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:17,883
Hello, it's me, Brenda.

1224
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,018
Jessica's friend?

1225
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,120
Yeah, we're going to be
pulling an all-nighter

1226
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:26,393
in the library tonight,

1227
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:31,529
'cause we have a big exam tomorrow.
Macro... economics,

1228
01:01:31,571 --> 01:01:34,438
and it's really hard.

1229
01:01:34,474 --> 01:01:37,102
Ooh, they still have
my two favorite flavors,

1230
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:38,906
cherry and green.

1231
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,470
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey, fellas.

1232
01:01:41,514 --> 01:01:43,505
You want some of this?
Yeah.

1233
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:45,744
Oh, it's gonna be good.

1234
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,015
You know what?
I'm gonna go crazy.

1235
01:01:48,054 --> 01:01:51,785
I'm gonna have two flavors.
Suicide of deliciousness.

1236
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:54,258
- That looks so tasty, Harry.
- Oh God, I want that.

1237
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,421
- He's mixing them.
- Oh, it's gonna taste so good.

1238
01:01:59,565 --> 01:02:01,465
I was right.
It's really good.

1239
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:04,436
He's so lucky.

1240
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,529
Mmm, mmm.

1241
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,333
Suck it.

1242
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:13,368
I want one.

1243
01:02:13,413 --> 01:02:15,506
We can't go in there.
We'll be it.

1244
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:21,177
You're right...
we can't.

1245
01:02:22,554 --> 01:02:24,419
Come here.

1246
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:27,618
Hey, hey, little buddy.
Hi, how ya doin'?

1247
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:29,058
Hey, you want
to make $2?

1248
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:31,152
- Sure.
- Yeah?

1249
01:02:31,196 --> 01:02:35,360
All you got to do is go in there
and get us two Slushees.

1250
01:02:36,467 --> 01:02:39,868
- Okay.
- Okay, as in we got a deal?

1251
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:42,202
Yeah, deal.

1252
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,901
But first,
give me the $2.

1253
01:02:43,942 --> 01:02:46,467
I said "doll hairs."

1254
01:02:46,511 --> 01:02:49,002
Psych. But a deal's a deal.
In you go, little buddy.

1255
01:02:49,047 --> 01:02:51,481
- Come on.
- Fine, give me the doll hairs.

1256
01:02:53,852 --> 01:02:55,911
- Harry?
- A deal's a deal.

1257
01:02:55,954 --> 01:02:59,014
Would you take
five bucks instead?

1258
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:07,059
Good thinking, Harry.
Good thinking.

1259
01:03:07,098 --> 01:03:08,395
All right, be cool.
Be cool.

1260
01:03:08,433 --> 01:03:10,594
Be cool.

1261
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:13,661
Yeah, and she's like,
"You better call my mom."

1262
01:03:13,705 --> 01:03:15,798
And I'm like, "Whoa,"
and she's like, "Oh."

1263
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,705
And I'm like, "Whoa,"
and she's like, "Oh."

1264
01:03:17,742 --> 01:03:19,733
And I'm like...

1265
01:03:19,777 --> 01:03:23,406
it's Brenda.
I'm new.

1266
01:03:26,117 --> 01:03:28,608
Oh! Ice, ice, baby.

1267
01:03:34,325 --> 01:03:37,624
Yeah, I peed in those.
Enjoy.

1268
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:42,161
Grow up.

1269
01:03:47,405 --> 01:03:49,339
- You're it.
- Are not.

1270
01:03:49,374 --> 01:03:50,864
- Are too.
- D2.

1271
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:52,638
- Chewbacca.
- Ooh, good one, Harry.

1272
01:03:52,677 --> 01:03:53,871
Hey, it's Jessica.

1273
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:56,574
Harry, I thought
we worked through this.

1274
01:03:56,614 --> 01:03:58,912
No, it's Jessica.

1275
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:01,783
Oh, must be her boyfriend's car.

1276
01:04:01,819 --> 01:04:05,550
- It's Principal Collins!
- Principal Collins is Jessica's boyfriend?

1277
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,148
Oh, that totally makes sense.

1278
01:04:07,191 --> 01:04:08,818
That's why she didn't
want him to know

1279
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,521
we were in his office
the other night.

1280
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:12,552
He can't see us here.
Quick, be conspicuous!

1281
01:04:12,597 --> 01:04:13,894
Conspicuous?

1282
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:22,101
No wonder we both
struck out with her.

1283
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,734
How can we compete with
the sexual power of the man

1284
01:04:24,776 --> 01:04:26,937
who occupies
the highest office in the land.

1285
01:04:26,978 --> 01:04:28,309
Yeah, he's like the Pope, Harry.

1286
01:04:28,346 --> 01:04:30,143
Like we're gonna
snake a chick from the Pope.

1287
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:34,748
Here he comes.

1288
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:36,253
Harry, switch.

1289
01:04:36,287 --> 01:04:38,517
Harry.
Jeez, Moses and Mary.

1290
01:04:46,597 --> 01:04:48,224
Hey, let's go spy on them.

1291
01:04:48,266 --> 01:04:49,756
Good thinking, Harry.

1292
01:04:51,636 --> 01:04:54,764
- Harry, bobsled!
- Lever!

1293
01:04:54,806 --> 01:04:57,434
Hang two!
Harry, go left!

1294
01:04:57,475 --> 01:04:59,170
Go left.
Cease and desist!

1295
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,405
Cease and desist!

1296
01:05:01,446 --> 01:05:03,778
Come on, Harry!
Mush, mush, mush.

1297
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:06,784
Harry, go straight.
Warp speed, Harry. Warp speed!

1298
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,130
Is that the best you've got?

1299
01:05:29,173 --> 01:05:32,006
Hey, that's my cart.

1300
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:38,141
It's the eye of the tiger,
it's the thrill of the fight

1301
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:42,175
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rivals

1302
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,055
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night...

1303
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:49,218
Ice cream?

1304
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,387
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking, Harry?

1305
01:05:51,429 --> 01:05:54,421
- Oh yeah.
- Snack break!

1306
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:08,843
Yummy!

1307
01:06:10,681 --> 01:06:13,115
- Aaah! All right...
- Harry!

1308
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:15,676
- There they are!
- Break's over!

1309
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,917
So what did you tell
my parents on the phone?

1310
01:06:18,956 --> 01:06:20,947
Not to expect you
tonight.

1311
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:23,324
Well, someone's going
to come looking for me.

1312
01:06:23,361 --> 01:06:25,693
Oh, I don't think so,
my dear.

1313
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,961
The eye of the tiger.

1314
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,040
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

1315
01:06:38,076 --> 01:06:40,135
Jessica,

1316
01:06:40,178 --> 01:06:41,975
where's my chest?

1317
01:06:42,013 --> 01:06:43,810
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1318
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:52,815
Don't know what I'm
talking about, hmm?

1319
01:06:52,857 --> 01:06:55,690
You don't know
what I'm talking about?!

1320
01:06:58,096 --> 01:06:59,393
Well, well, well.

1321
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:06,036
What have we here?
It appears to be a tape.

1322
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,164
- That's not your tape.
- Don't play with me, dear.

1323
01:07:09,207 --> 01:07:12,142
You're way
out of your league.

1324
01:07:19,517 --> 01:07:21,678
Jessica!

1325
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:24,813
Harry, Lloyd.

1326
01:07:24,856 --> 01:07:27,882
You guys are a mess.

1327
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:31,258
We were still hungry, so we
decided to get some dessert.

1328
01:07:31,295 --> 01:07:33,160
- It was fun.
- Yeah.

1329
01:07:33,197 --> 01:07:36,689
It was fun until Harry decided
to put his wiener in my ear.

1330
01:07:36,734 --> 01:07:38,429
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

1331
01:07:38,469 --> 01:07:39,936
So it looks like
the best man won.

1332
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:42,599
Why didn't you tell us
your boyfriend was Principal Collins?

1333
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,301
What?

1334
01:07:44,342 --> 01:07:47,243
Jessica!

1335
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:51,806
- You light up my life...
- Is that my mix tape?

1336
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:54,317
It's being used for your seduction?

1337
01:07:54,352 --> 01:07:56,320
I'm flattered.

1338
01:07:56,354 --> 01:07:58,948
Lloyd, when we were
in Principal Collins office,

1339
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,582
did you see any kind
of chest?

1340
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:03,458
You mean like Harry's treasure chest?
Sure, I know where that is.

1341
01:08:03,494 --> 01:08:05,860
You found my treasure?
Why didn't you tell me?

1342
01:08:05,897 --> 01:08:07,558
Three words... I did.

1343
01:08:07,598 --> 01:08:09,589
You were just all mad at me.
You wouldn't even listen.

1344
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:11,659
- Yeah, well, I'm listening now.
- Me too.

1345
01:08:11,702 --> 01:08:14,227
- This is my favorite part.
- Harry, Lloyd,

1346
01:08:14,272 --> 01:08:16,365
listen to me, I only have
time to say this once.

1347
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:18,671
God, she's so cute.

1348
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:20,540
Look at her teeth.

1349
01:08:20,578 --> 01:08:23,172
I bet she can
bite through anything.

1350
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:25,478
Yeah, she could.

1351
01:08:25,516 --> 01:08:28,542
You gotta get what's in the chest,
and make sure everybody...

1352
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:31,111
I wonder what Lloyd's
thinking about.

1353
01:08:31,155 --> 01:08:32,417
Look at all that hair.

1354
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:35,425
She must have millions
of tiny holes in her head.

1355
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:38,519
Otherwise, it would just
bunch up all in her brain.

1356
01:08:38,563 --> 01:08:41,828
So guys,
are you listening to me?

1357
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,164
- Yeah, sure!
- Yeah, yeah.

1358
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:46,227
- I was, you know...
- Yeah, sure.

1359
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:53,573
I'm a Pisces.

1360
01:08:53,611 --> 01:08:56,774
And that's the sign of the badger.
I love picnics...

1361
01:08:56,814 --> 01:08:58,372
You guys gotta go
get that chest,

1362
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:00,543
and show the world
what Collins has been doing.

1363
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:03,554
Don't worry about me. I can
get out of this anytime I want.

1364
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:06,557
And I'm getting the story every
high school reporter dreams of.

1365
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:08,957
Come on, Jessica.

1366
01:09:08,993 --> 01:09:11,427
Don't push me,
'cause I'm...

1367
01:09:11,462 --> 01:09:12,952
Go, get out of here.

1368
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:21,869
- Gotcha, you...
- Stop!

1369
01:09:21,906 --> 01:09:24,272
- What?
- I don't think this is the right thing to do.

1370
01:09:24,308 --> 01:09:27,106
Harry, we don't even know
what's in there. You're overreacting.

1371
01:09:27,144 --> 01:09:29,408
I don't know
who we are anymore.

1372
01:09:29,447 --> 01:09:30,744
You're right.

1373
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:32,908
But I feel like I deserve
much more of this treasure

1374
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:35,441
- 'cause I was the one that found it.
- My mom gave me the map.

1375
01:09:35,486 --> 01:09:38,478
- But I lugged it all over town.
- I made the polar bear pants.

1376
01:09:38,522 --> 01:09:40,717
- I ate your mom's pie!
- I found that rock!

1377
01:09:40,758 --> 01:09:42,555
It was a diamond,
and you swallowed it.

1378
01:09:42,593 --> 01:09:43,924
We were all out
of top hats.

1379
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:46,452
Enough! What has
this cursed chest done to us?

1380
01:09:46,497 --> 01:09:49,057
You know, Lloyd,

1381
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,763
the real treasure
is our friendship.

1382
01:09:52,803 --> 01:09:54,964
Yeah, you're right.
On the other hand...

1383
01:10:00,945 --> 01:10:02,276
Oh.

1384
01:10:07,718 --> 01:10:09,515
What's all this?

1385
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:14,753
Oh...
it's full of files.

1386
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:16,453
There's pictures

1387
01:10:16,494 --> 01:10:18,086
and documents.

1388
01:10:18,129 --> 01:10:20,859
It's amazing!

1389
01:10:20,898 --> 01:10:22,695
Ohhh.

1390
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:27,030
Hey, Lloyd, this looks
like one of your mix tapes.

1391
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,699
Maybe it's from the pirate
who buried this treasure.

1392
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,605
You should go put it on.

1393
01:10:35,946 --> 01:10:38,380
Principal's log, September 23rd.

1394
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:40,077
Check, check, check.
Sound check.

1395
01:10:40,117 --> 01:10:41,948
Hey, it's Principal Collins.

1396
01:10:41,986 --> 01:10:44,784
That makes total sense. I found
the treasure chest in his office.

1397
01:10:44,822 --> 01:10:47,985
...grant money...
- This mix tape isn't as good as yours.

1398
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:49,788
- No.
- Sound, check, check, check.

1399
01:10:49,827 --> 01:10:52,819
- He speaks pretty good Chinese.
- That's not Chinese.

1400
01:10:52,863 --> 01:10:56,196
That's Chinese.

1401
01:10:56,233 --> 01:10:57,860
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

1402
01:10:57,902 --> 01:11:00,803
And that is how l,
Principal Collins,

1403
01:11:00,838 --> 01:11:04,433
became the mastermind
behind this glorious plan.

1404
01:11:04,475 --> 01:11:06,670
It's the crime
of the century.

1405
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:10,545
He's right. We have committed
the crime of the century.

1406
01:11:10,581 --> 01:11:13,641
We never thanked him
for giving us the special needs class!

1407
01:11:13,684 --> 01:11:15,777
But what do we do?

1408
01:11:17,388 --> 01:11:19,652
I have an idea.

1409
01:11:24,962 --> 01:11:27,021
Welcome to
the Providence Hills High School

1410
01:11:27,064 --> 01:11:28,759
Thanksgiving parade!

1411
01:11:28,799 --> 01:11:31,427
Aren't you glad
you're not watching football?

1412
01:11:31,469 --> 01:11:34,302
This year's theme,
white meat or dark?

1413
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:40,039
Floats and exhibits from
all classes and organizations.

1414
01:11:40,077 --> 01:11:42,671
So enjoy.

1415
01:11:42,713 --> 01:11:44,772
What the hell is that?

1416
01:11:44,815 --> 01:11:46,476
What did you morons do?

1417
01:11:46,517 --> 01:11:49,179
Where's George Washington?
What do we do with this?

1418
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,051
- Looks great, doesn't he?
- No.

1419
01:11:51,088 --> 01:11:52,453
What were you guys thinking?

1420
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,516
Why'd you give him
a makeover?

1421
01:11:57,461 --> 01:11:59,986
Sorry I'm late.
Woke up tied to the bed.

1422
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:02,965
Somebody cut my hair
while I was sleeping.

1423
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,161
Hey, that's my hair!

1424
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:10,466
It's the marching band's
musical tribute to stuffing.

1425
01:12:12,009 --> 01:12:15,467
Please do not throw cigarettes
at the floats.

1426
01:12:15,513 --> 01:12:18,346
I've searched everywhere
and no luck.

1427
01:12:18,382 --> 01:12:20,145
The chest is
still out there.

1428
01:12:20,184 --> 01:12:23,085
That's why we get the check
as soon as Zimmer shows up

1429
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,556
and blow this pop stand before
anybody finds out anything.

1430
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:28,558
The band
sounds terrible.

1431
01:12:28,592 --> 01:12:32,153
I know, I sold all
the wind instruments.

1432
01:12:32,196 --> 01:12:34,357
Hawaiian Air,
business class.

1433
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,427
- You like your new coat?
- I love it.

1434
01:12:37,468 --> 01:12:41,302
That's why our mascot
isn't a stallion anymore.

1435
01:12:41,338 --> 01:12:43,829
- This is horse?
- No, no, no, I sold the horse,

1436
01:12:43,874 --> 01:12:46,843
- To pay for the...
- I didn't know horse could feel this soft.

1437
01:12:46,877 --> 01:12:49,903
That's not horse, honey.
Yes, yes, it is soft.

1438
01:12:51,048 --> 01:12:52,572
So what do you think
of the float?

1439
01:12:52,616 --> 01:12:55,210
- Guys, this is much better.
- Yeah.

1440
01:12:55,252 --> 01:12:57,277
Principal Collins is
a way greater American

1441
01:12:57,321 --> 01:12:59,084
than George Washington
will ever be.

1442
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:01,057
I don't get it.
Why'd you make him a pirate?

1443
01:13:01,091 --> 01:13:03,889
I'll tell you why.
You won't believe these documents.

1444
01:13:03,928 --> 01:13:07,557
They provide evidence of a long history
of fraud and embezzlement

1445
01:13:07,598 --> 01:13:10,931
from the school by Principal Collins
and Ms. Heller,

1446
01:13:10,968 --> 01:13:12,993
A.K.A. the lunch lady.

1447
01:13:13,037 --> 01:13:15,471
- Huh?
- My God, can you believe your ears?

1448
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:17,838
Yeah, no clicks
and whistles.

1449
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,638
She speaks the English
perfectly.

1450
01:13:19,677 --> 01:13:21,440
Lloyd, you're
a great teacher.

1451
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:24,448
Ching Chong, what happened
to your beautiful Asian accent?

1452
01:13:24,482 --> 01:13:27,610
Oh, actually my name
is Cindy.

1453
01:13:27,651 --> 01:13:29,983
The accent just
helps me meet boys.

1454
01:13:31,188 --> 01:13:32,849
You want it back?

1455
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:36,054
You got it, Joe.

1456
01:13:37,628 --> 01:13:40,620
Look at this. Collins took $2000
that was supposed to go to

1457
01:13:40,664 --> 01:13:43,827
a new state-of-the-art
stallion mascot uniform.

1458
01:13:43,868 --> 01:13:46,029
Wait, what?
Let me see.

1459
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:49,631
Why have I been wearing this one
with puke in the head?

1460
01:13:49,673 --> 01:13:51,368
- You serious?
- Am l... smell.

1461
01:13:51,408 --> 01:13:53,842
We got to tell people
about Collins.

1462
01:13:58,983 --> 01:14:01,451
- Hey, Superintendent.
- I'm not sure I can do this.

1463
01:14:01,485 --> 01:14:03,510
We got to nail this guy.
You'll be fine.

1464
01:14:03,554 --> 01:14:05,749
Just make sure
he takes that check.

1465
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:08,690
Detective, you know,

1466
01:14:08,726 --> 01:14:11,820
he's gonna be expecting
Moffitt to be... special.

1467
01:14:11,862 --> 01:14:14,956
Don't worry about it. I studied
acting at the police academy.

1468
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:18,025
- Police academy?
- You'll be fine.

1469
01:14:18,068 --> 01:14:20,434
Just remember your lines.
It's show time.

1470
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:30,412
- Principal Collins.
- Superintendent Zimmer.

1471
01:14:30,447 --> 01:14:31,539
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

1472
01:14:31,582 --> 01:14:33,550
I'd like to introduce you
to Richard Moffitt,

1473
01:14:33,584 --> 01:14:36,917
former special needs student,
now American success story.

1474
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:39,684
- Well...
- Go ahead.

1475
01:14:39,723 --> 01:14:43,557
It's a very great
pleasure to meet you, sir.

1476
01:14:43,594 --> 01:14:45,926
Very...

1477
01:14:45,963 --> 01:14:47,225
very great pleasure.

1478
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:53,166
Well, is that
what I think it is?

1479
01:14:53,203 --> 01:14:55,535
Your little gift
for the school?

1480
01:14:55,573 --> 01:14:57,438
Yes.

1481
01:14:57,474 --> 01:14:59,339
I drew this.

1482
01:15:00,644 --> 01:15:02,441
Special needs.

1483
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:05,414
- Time for french fries now.
- Oh, yes.

1484
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:08,509
But the check will be
presented this morning?

1485
01:15:08,552 --> 01:15:10,918
I'm very strong.

1486
01:15:10,955 --> 01:15:14,447
Yes, you are.
I have your check right here.

1487
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:16,652
But I think Mr. Moffitt is
interested in seeing

1488
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:18,457
the special needs float first.

1489
01:15:18,495 --> 01:15:22,693
I can turn on
all the faucets in my house.

1490
01:15:22,733 --> 01:15:24,860
Even the hose.

1491
01:15:24,902 --> 01:15:26,369
But we don't drink
from the hose, do we?

1492
01:15:26,403 --> 01:15:27,233
No.

1493
01:15:27,271 --> 01:15:29,262
There's the special needs float.

1494
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:32,241
Oh, here they come! Wait till you see
what the children have done.

1495
01:15:32,276 --> 01:15:34,107
Yes.

1496
01:15:34,144 --> 01:15:36,476
This is visionary.

1497
01:15:36,513 --> 01:15:38,947
I think I've finally figured
out a way to bilk this school

1498
01:15:38,983 --> 01:15:43,249
out of enough money to get us
that condo in Waikiki.

1499
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:46,620
- Baby, you've done it all.
- Small potatoes.

1500
01:15:46,657 --> 01:15:48,557
The Richard Moffitt
special needs grant.

1501
01:15:48,592 --> 01:15:51,117
The state is giving
100 grand in his name

1502
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:54,824
- To every school that has...
- That sounds like you!

1503
01:15:54,865 --> 01:15:56,628
Oh my God,
they got the chest.

1504
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:59,227
- You got the extender?
- No.

1505
01:15:59,269 --> 01:16:01,829
Nothing they do makes any sense,
which is... which is...

1506
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:06,434
which is why we created
the special needs class...

1507
01:16:06,477 --> 01:16:08,411
You're going down, Collins!

1508
01:16:08,445 --> 01:16:10,436
and why we need that check.

1509
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:12,813
He stole the school's money!

1510
01:16:14,151 --> 01:16:15,982
Pony.

1511
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,988
Hey, there's Principal Collins!

1512
01:16:22,426 --> 01:16:23,950
Please remain seated.

1513
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:25,325
Somebody stop him!

1514
01:16:26,363 --> 01:16:28,092
Huh, he's coming back.

1515
01:16:33,737 --> 01:16:35,796
Whoa, whoa!

1516
01:16:35,839 --> 01:16:38,330
Wow! Go!

1517
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:40,707
Hey, hey!

1518
01:16:40,744 --> 01:16:42,678
Hey!

1519
01:16:42,713 --> 01:16:45,477
Check in hand.

1520
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:48,880
All I wanted
was a condo in Waikiki.

1521
01:16:48,919 --> 01:16:51,444
- Watch your hands, piggy!
- Get in the car.

1522
01:16:51,488 --> 01:16:54,321
Wow, they get
their own police escort.

1523
01:16:54,358 --> 01:16:56,087
Whoa.

1524
01:16:56,126 --> 01:16:57,718
All our hard work pays off.

1525
01:16:57,761 --> 01:16:59,991
- Yeah?
- He's going to jail for a long time.

1526
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:02,624
Principal of jail?
Wow, that's a promotion.

1527
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:04,531
- Yeah, those inmates are lucky.
- Yeah.

1528
01:17:04,568 --> 01:17:07,401
- Hey, Jessica!
- Hi!

1529
01:17:07,438 --> 01:17:09,235
l... I guess
I'll see you guys later.

1530
01:17:11,008 --> 01:17:13,499
Oh my God.
She's two-timing Principal Collins.

1531
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:15,512
Yeah, with that complete loser.

1532
01:17:15,546 --> 01:17:18,515
- He's probably a jock.
- Jessica, what are you thinking?

1533
01:17:18,549 --> 01:17:20,847
Check out those stupid
butt-ugly jeans.

1534
01:17:22,186 --> 01:17:24,450
You know what, Harry?
This whole experience

1535
01:17:24,488 --> 01:17:26,251
has soured me
on women forever.

1536
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:28,815
Yeah, we should never let
a woman come between us again.

1537
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:32,090
That's not going to happen.
We learned a very valuable lesson here.

1538
01:17:32,129 --> 01:17:34,188
- We're not ever gonna forget that.
- Yeah.

1539
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:39,200
Excuse us.
You're Harry and Lloyd, right?

1540
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:42,672
- Actually, I'm Harry and he's Lloyd.
- Lloyd.

1541
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:44,799
Well, we're the Felchers.

1542
01:17:44,842 --> 01:17:46,833
My name's Freida,
and this is Rita.

1543
01:17:46,877 --> 01:17:50,005
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

1544
01:17:50,047 --> 01:17:52,743
We're gonna go check out
the all-girls college.

1545
01:17:52,783 --> 01:17:54,114
Do you guys wanna come?

1546
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:56,517
- Sure!
- No, wait, Harry, Harry!

1547
01:17:56,553 --> 01:17:58,111
Just a second.
We're just gonna...

1548
01:17:58,155 --> 01:18:01,318
Listen, we got to figure out who gets who,
all right? No more competition.

1549
01:18:01,358 --> 01:18:03,724
- Right.
- Okay, so... ahem. Pick one.

1550
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:09,127
The one on the left.

1551
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:11,225
- What's wrong?
- That's the one that I wanted.

1552
01:18:11,268 --> 01:18:12,963
- No.
- Yeah.

1553
01:18:13,003 --> 01:18:16,097
She's one of a kind.

1554
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,370
Try one in a million.

1555
01:18:18,408 --> 01:18:20,342
What should we do?

1556
01:18:20,377 --> 01:18:23,403
- You take her.
- No, I'm not going to do that to you.

1557
01:18:23,447 --> 01:18:25,142
It's okay, Harry,
I'll find somebody.

1558
01:18:25,182 --> 01:18:28,151
I'm not doing it.
Remember,

1559
01:18:28,185 --> 01:18:30,415
chicks are for fags.

1560
01:18:30,454 --> 01:18:32,285
That's a good one, Harry.

1561
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:35,456
I'll handle this.

1562
01:18:37,494 --> 01:18:40,429
Yeah. Why don't you go ahead
and go on without us?

1563
01:18:40,464 --> 01:18:42,091
What?
What do you mean?

1564
01:18:42,132 --> 01:18:45,727
Someday you might meet somebody
as special as my friend Harry up there,

1565
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:47,964
but I doubt it.

1566
01:18:48,005 --> 01:18:51,304
Oh and uh...
your little friend over there,

1567
01:18:51,341 --> 01:18:54,572
she's... she's nice too.

1568
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:58,504
What?!

1569
01:19:01,318 --> 01:19:02,444
Look out, Harry!

1570
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:05,678
Oh, Harry! Oh God, Harry!

1571
01:19:05,722 --> 01:19:07,451
Oh God, Harry!

1572
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:09,789
Losers!

1573
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:13,126
Oh! Oh, that was close,
huh, Harry?

1574
01:19:13,163 --> 01:19:15,358
Oh! I got dirt on my shirt.

1575
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:18,857
How gross is this?
Harry?

1576
01:19:18,902 --> 01:19:20,130
Ohh!

1577
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:24,004
Harry? You got to look
both ways, buddy.

1578
01:19:29,546 --> 01:19:31,013
Charlie!

1579
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:34,179
- Oh my God.
- Hey.

1580
01:19:34,218 --> 01:19:36,186
It's you.

1581
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,552
You're the guy
that crapped up my house!

1582
01:19:38,589 --> 01:19:41,251
What are you...
you're covered in shit!

1583
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:44,488
What are you...
my car's covered in shit!

1584
01:19:44,528 --> 01:19:47,088
- No, no, it's not that.
- Oh my God! No, stop!

1585
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,825
- What are you doing?!
- Not helping.

1586
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:52,859
- There's shit all over my car!
- Harry, Harry, let's go.

1587
01:19:52,903 --> 01:19:54,200
What is wrong with you?!

1588
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:55,671
- You okay, buddy?
- Yeah.

1589
01:19:55,706 --> 01:19:58,197
- There's poo all over my hood!
- What's up with that guy?

1590
01:19:58,242 --> 01:19:59,834
Beat's me.
He's Jessica's dad.

1591
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:02,903
- She says he's really anal.
- Ohh, ooh!

1592
01:20:02,946 --> 01:20:05,005
- That's gross.
- I know.

1593
01:20:05,048 --> 01:20:07,812
There's shit everywhere!
Hey, come back here!

1594
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:10,820
I'm not cleaning this up!
I'm gonna have to have this towed.

1595
01:20:10,854 --> 01:20:13,414
Come back here!
Are you out of your minds?!

1596
01:20:13,457 --> 01:20:16,585
What is it with you
and fecal matter?!

1597
01:20:16,627 --> 01:20:17,889
Look at this!

1598
01:20:19,329 --> 01:20:22,355
Four, tres, two, uno.

1599
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:24,367
That's enough!

1600
01:20:24,401 --> 01:20:26,335
That...

1601
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:28,235
- That's enough!
- Aaah!

1602
01:20:28,272 --> 01:20:31,139
- Class dismissed!
- Come on, Harry.

1603
01:20:34,311 --> 01:20:37,178
- Lewis!
- Slow, easy boy!

1604
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:39,239
Oh, snaps!

1605
01:20:39,283 --> 01:20:42,309
Hi.

1606
01:20:44,087 --> 01:20:47,318
Mrs. D., you sure have
a great looking pie.

1607
01:20:47,357 --> 01:20:50,588
You put your meat
in my mom's pie.

1608
01:20:50,627 --> 01:20:53,960
You're it!
And no tap...

1609
01:20:53,997 --> 01:20:56,465
It was him.

1610
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,833
Enou... oh shit,
I'm sorry.

1611
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,565
Get back, get back.

1612
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,035
- Why are you dressed like that?
- 'Cause you said!

1613
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:07,703
- No, Harry, I said,
"Don't dress like a queen!"

1614
01:21:07,744 --> 01:21:08,768
Oh.

1615
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:13,572
Get up, get up,
get up, get up!

1616
01:21:15,886 --> 01:21:18,446
Uh... so...

1617
01:21:18,488 --> 01:21:21,582
you're not in the store, huh?

1618
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:23,957
Yeah, we're closed.
Get outta here.

1619
01:21:23,994 --> 01:21:26,155
Actually, we have
something for you.

1620
01:21:26,196 --> 01:21:29,324
You're it.

1621
01:21:29,366 --> 01:21:31,163
Are we even filming?

1622
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:32,429
Don't you...

1623
01:21:32,469 --> 01:21:34,164
don't you snap
at me like that.

1624
01:21:34,204 --> 01:21:36,263
Don't you snap at me like that.
You're lucky...

1625
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:37,773
Don't you snap
at me like...

1626
01:21:41,211 --> 01:21:43,270
That is shit!

1627
01:21:43,313 --> 01:21:46,111
Oh, God, aaah!

1628
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:48,947
Harry...
Stop!

1629
01:21:48,986 --> 01:21:51,648
- Harry, Lloyd...
- Cut!

1630
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:55,954
Why've I been...

1631
01:21:57,894 --> 01:21:59,828
Okay, back to one.

1632
01:21:59,863 --> 01:22:02,058
You want me to say
shit or poo?

1633
01:22:02,099 --> 01:22:04,567
Oh my God!
Ohh!

1634
01:22:09,673 --> 01:22:11,140
Oopsie-daisy.

1635
01:22:11,174 --> 01:22:15,167
Lloyd?
Did you just fart?

1636
01:22:18,115 --> 01:22:19,207
Cut it.

1637
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:38,562
How many words can you
fit inside a suitcase?

1638
01:22:38,602 --> 01:22:42,197
Packed it so tight
that you couldn't sing a tune

1639
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:46,073
You fell down the stairs
'cause you didn't tie your bootlace

1640
01:22:46,109 --> 01:22:49,636
Given a choice
could you choose?

1641
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:53,410
You went for a walk and you
came across a cool place

1642
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:57,284
Rested your head
with a vodka by the pool

1643
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,915
You went for a swim and you
found that you were sinking

1644
01:23:00,957 --> 01:23:04,586
Don't you know pools
are for fools?

1645
01:23:04,628 --> 01:23:07,290
Given the choice
could you choose?

1646
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:10,993
Groovin' along
all alone in the park

1647
01:23:11,034 --> 01:23:14,663
Singing a song 'cause you're
afraid of the dark

1648
01:23:14,704 --> 01:23:18,640
Running away from a world
that can't walk

1649
01:23:18,675 --> 01:23:24,204
Swinging your hips
so you don't have to talk...

1650
01:23:29,052 --> 01:23:32,647
Showing your girl
'bout a natural way of living

1651
01:23:32,689 --> 01:23:36,489
Got bit in the ass
by a tiger at the zoo

1652
01:23:36,526 --> 01:23:40,189
And when you got home
you just passed out in the kitchen

1653
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:43,165
Now you got no one to lose

1654
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,761
Ran to the store and they
sold you on the future

1655
01:23:46,803 --> 01:23:50,534
Bit in your lip and you
start to crack a smile

1656
01:23:50,574 --> 01:23:54,305
Come up with a plan,
but that doesn't really matter

1657
01:23:54,344 --> 01:23:58,178
When you got no reason why

1658
01:23:58,215 --> 01:24:02,948
Given a choice could you try?
