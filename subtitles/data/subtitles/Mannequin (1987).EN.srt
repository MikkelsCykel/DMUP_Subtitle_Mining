1
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,493
Ema Hesire, I know you're in there.

2
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,191
The wedding has been all arranged.

3
00:00:56,702 --> 00:01:00,465
Please, gods. Please get me out of this.

4
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,243
You turned down the jeweler.
You turned down the grain merchant.

5
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:08,381
You turned down the Pharaoh's food taster.
There's only one man left who'll have you:

6
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:09,914
You'll marry Hazzi-Ra.

7
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,912
So what does he do?

8
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,417
He's a fuel merchant.

9
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,958
-Mother.
-All right, so he sells camel dung.

10
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,889
-Forget it.
-You forget it.

11
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,564
Mother, I don't want to settle down.
I want to do things and invent things.

12
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:28,668
I want to try things
that nobody's ever tried before.

13
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:30,536
-I want to fly.
-Sure.

14
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:33,833
And I want to smoke
and tell your father to go to hell.

15
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:38,444
Emmy, if I thought we women...

16
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:42,648
...could any way change anything,
don't you think I'd encourage you?

17
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:45,951
No. Don't. These are the times we live in.

18
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,387
Mother, there's got to be a better way.

19
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:51,557
Please, gods. Please help me find it.

20
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:56,195
Sure, the Nile is overflowing.
There is a wheat shortage.

21
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,330
The Pharaoh has hemorrhoids.

22
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,593
The gods have bigger things
to worry about than you.

23
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:36,312
What would you say if I told you,
you get more beautiful every day?

24
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:39,018
What was that?

25
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:43,059
Arms and legs?
God, how thoughtless. I'm sorry.

26
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,164
"I've got sunshine

27
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:56,141
"On a cloudy day

28
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,310
"When it's cold--"
She needs a 10.

29
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,347
"Cold outside--"
What do you think?

30
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:03,048
Speak up. Don't be shy, now.

31
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:05,582
"I got the month of May"

32
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,114
Wrong sex!

33
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:15,928
Now, that's the ticket.

34
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,496
Nothing beats a great pair of legs.

35
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,303
"What can make me feel this way"

36
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:25,392
Popeye look.

37
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:39,818
"I got so much honey

38
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:42,546
"All the bees envy me

39
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,991
"I got the sweetest song that I can hear--"

40
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,286
Boss! Hi! Great.
I was just coming to see you.

41
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:52,228
You know, you could get
the dummy of the week award, Switcher.

42
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:56,760
-Yeah, she turned out pretty real.
-I wasn't talking about her.

43
00:05:58,237 --> 00:06:00,306
What do you think?
It only took me six days.

44
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,641
I could turn out three or four a month.

45
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:06,712
You're supposed to knock off
three or four of these a day, Switcher!

46
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:09,181
-Now, get back to work!
-What about quality, boss?

47
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:11,216
Style and grace. These things take time.

48
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:12,840
That's it! You're fired!

49
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:15,976
Fired?

50
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:19,425
Okay, but can I finish her?

51
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:22,728
I'm a sculptor. I'm trying to be a sculptor
and she's my work of--

52
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:23,817
Beat it!

53
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:25,585
Now!

54
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,033
There you go.

55
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:38,410
Have fun.

56
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,673
You guys having a good time?
Having fun at the party?

57
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,616
That's my boy.

58
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:50,988
Here you go.

59
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,550
Just one second. Here you go. Bye-bye.

60
00:06:56,795 --> 00:07:00,632
Want a giraffe for the birthday boy?
A monkey?

61
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:02,701
A pony? A tiger?

62
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:06,071
-How about a hint?
-I want the big one, stupid.

63
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:09,575
That's the official Flights of Fancy balloon.
How about a poodle?

64
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:13,379
Listen, biscuit-brain,
my old man is paying for this party.

65
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,969
One giant balloon, coming up.

66
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:21,520
There you go. Have fun.
Now, what do you want?

67
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,609
Daddy!

68
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,862
Biscuit-brain,
what the hell do you think you're doing?

69
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:31,953
Take your hands off my kid!

70
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,932
-My balloon!
-You're fired.

71
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,770
-Trimming the hedges long, Switcher?
-Actually, no.

72
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,775
I'm really a sculptor.

73
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,577
But there's not too much work
for us these days.

74
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:47,941
But no reason why hedges
can't become art.

75
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,244
You're fired!
Get your paycheck and get out of here!

76
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,505
What do you think?

77
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,608
What do I think?

78
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,439
I'm fired!
Pick up my paycheck and get out.

79
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:46,866
-Look. The road warrior.
-Hi, Roxie.

80
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:50,899
His Jag's in the shop. Hi.

81
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,552
It'd be nice if you'd pick me up
in something with doors.

82
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:03,422
-Come on.
-So where are we going to dinner?

83
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:04,490
I'm not that hungry.

84
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,860
I thought maybe we'd grab a hot dog,
go for a walk, look at the moon.

85
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,595
You lost your job again?

86
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:13,398
No, I didn't lose it, I know where it is.
Just somebody else has got it.

87
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:14,466
Can we get out of here?

88
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,202
-Good night, Mr. Wert.
-Nice work, children.

89
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,004
-Good night, B.J.
-See you tomorrow.

90
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,640
-Who's that?
-That's B.J. Wert, the regional manager.

91
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,109
He is Illustra.
Can we get this bucket of junk to go?

92
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,198
Yeah, I'm trying.

93
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:30,243
-Good night, Roxie.
-Good night.

94
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:34,444
Must be nice having your own limo.
Go from any funeral right to dinner.

95
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:42,628
This job at Illustra
is destroying your sense of humor.

96
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:44,029
You gotta quit.

97
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,298
I'm not the one that can't deal with reality.

98
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,559
Reality is very disappointing.

99
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,538
I really do care about you.

100
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:55,807
But I think if we sleep together tonight,
we'd only confuse things.

101
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,643
I think you should see a professional.

102
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:59,478
Professional? You mean a hooker?

103
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:01,613
No, a psychiatrist.

104
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,415
I can't afford a psychiatrist.

105
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:06,185
Then call one of those shrinks on the radio.

106
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:10,122
They're only good for little problems
that fit between commercials.

107
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:11,348
Good night.

108
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:14,014
Wait--

109
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:17,617
My God! It's you!

110
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:22,255
I wanted to take you,
but they wouldn't let me.

111
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,530
You're the first thing I've created
in a really long time...

112
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,860
...that made me feel like an artist.

113
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:38,507
No!

114
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,035
See you tomorrow.

115
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,282
Good morning! What a gentleman.

116
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,980
They're putting up the sign!

117
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,016
How fun!

118
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,720
It's a skosh crooked.

119
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:34,633
Isn't this exciting!
A customer lined up to get into our store.

120
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,369
-Tell me, do you like our new sign?
-It's very nice.

121
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:42,007
-You've really been here 100 years?
-Not personally, but the store, yes.

122
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:45,143
It was built by my grandfather,
Tough Teddy Prince.

123
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:47,746
My father ran it
until he passed away recently.

124
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:48,835
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,050
He was very old.
And he died the way he wanted to.

126
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,310
In women's lingerie.

127
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:55,854
Pardon me?

128
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:59,324
Heart attack,
walking through the women's department.

129
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,949
They don't have that sign quite right yet.

130
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,394
-Look out!
-Sorry, man.

131
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,888
Watch yourself!

132
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:12,592
I got it!

133
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:14,627
Maybe.

134
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:23,448
Young man, I'm sorry!

135
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,175
No, that's no problem!

136
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:31,323
-lf I can make it up to you in any way.
-Yeah! I could use a job!

137
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:34,659
-What do you do?
-Anything!

138
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:37,922
-When can you start?
-As soon as I finish this!

139
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:42,401
-Young man, what's your name?
-My name? Jonathan Switcher.

140
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,902
You're hired!

141
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:45,936
Thank you! My lucky day.

142
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:51,810
Every time I walk through these doors,
I feel like I'm home.

143
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,969
I practically grew up here.

144
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:59,518
Greta Garbo used to get
her makeup right over there.

145
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:03,054
Of course, you probably don't know
who Greta Garbo is.

146
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:05,679
Sure, I do. Ninotchka, Grand Hotel.

147
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:09,528
I don't sleep much at night.

148
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:10,562
Neither do I.

149
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:14,199
At least, not in the two weeks
since I've been in charge here.

150
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,291
I don't know how we're going to make
this store great again.

151
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:22,098
Looks fine to me. What time do we open?

152
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:26,574
We are open.

153
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:34,110
I'm sure things'll pick up by lunch.

154
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,349
Yes, B.J....

155
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:42,961
It's all going according to plan.
It's like a ghost ship around here.

156
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:46,665
They're gonna be begging
to sell this place within a month.

157
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:49,325
No, Timkin is no threat.

158
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:53,162
B.J., she's here.

159
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,767
Mr. Richards.

160
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,038
Do you know
what this young man just did?

161
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:02,380
-Shoplifting?
-He saved my life!

162
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,116
Those incompetents you hired
nearly got me killed.

163
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,844
If I were paranoid,
I'd swear this was sabotage.

164
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:11,223
It's not as if I was turning away
Harvard graduates.

165
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:14,292
If you know someone
you feel is qualified to work here....

166
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:18,021
Yes! Jonathan Switcher.
Let's show him our gratitude.

167
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:20,899
$5 should do it.

168
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,662
No! I want you to give him a job.
Take good care of him.

169
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,459
Thank you.

170
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,672
Switcher?

171
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:33,378
What kind of work experience
have you had?

172
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:35,912
I've had just about every job there is.

173
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:40,051
Briefly, I'd like to do something creative.

174
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,320
Maybe with, say, mannequins.

175
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,758
Please. Listen, I pride myself
on being able to size up a job applicant...

176
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:50,157
...and see just what kind
of executive potential he has.

177
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:53,497
I have just the job for you.

178
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:09,748
So, you got a new job.
That's terrific. What is it?

179
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:12,617
Let's just say that thousands of dollars
of merchandise...

180
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,953
...go through my hands every day.

181
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,489
I'm taking you out for a celebration dinner.

182
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,859
-All those panties, up to lingerie.
-Panties. I'm into it.

183
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:23,328
-Did you say panties?
-Panties?

184
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:25,363
Can't talk now. Pick you up at 8:00.

185
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:26,987
-See you then.
-Bye.

186
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,536
I've seen him pick you up.
That little pissant!

187
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:37,542
You can't tell me
that he's satisfying you sexually.

188
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,444
That's none of your business.

189
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:41,346
I would like to make it my business.

190
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:44,540
I would love to sink
my teeth into your little bottom.

191
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,145
What?

192
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:50,488
Did Armand say something bad?
Forgive me.

193
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:53,758
English and me, it's new.
My tongue, it slides.

194
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:56,161
Look, our relationship is strictly business!

195
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:58,388
-You got that?
-Yes.

196
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:00,926
Of course.

197
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,726
I have some reports to get out
by noon o'clock.

198
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:39,404
-See anything you like?
-I was just looking for panties.

199
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:40,472
You found them.

200
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:44,872
However, my friend, you missed
the lingerie department by four floors.

201
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,844
-Get going.
-Right.

202
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,873
Asshole.

203
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:51,539
What was that?

204
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,813
Nice hall.

205
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:20,877
I must be losing my mind.

206
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:26,813
All artists must fall in love with
their creations, but you seem so special.

207
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,013
God.

208
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,390
Roll over, Bill Shakespeare.

209
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,260
That's the sweetest sentiment
these ears have ever heard.

210
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,130
-No, I was rehearsing a play.
-I always find it best not to explain.

211
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,934
It adds a certain mystique
to one's reputation.

212
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:46,731
No. I'm a regular kind of guy, okay?

213
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:48,873
Don't disappoint me.

214
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:50,975
When you're finished your conversation...

215
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,744
...bring her to window number 3.

216
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:57,281
-Sure. You got it. I'm Jonathan Switcher.
-Hollywood.

217
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,816
Hollywood Montrose. Doesn't it just sing?

218
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:04,189
It sings, yeah.

219
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:07,959
I'm a window dresser here.
We're going to have fun.

220
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,220
I am so glad you're working here.

221
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:13,398
-You are?
-Why, of course I am, honey.

222
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:15,864
I never thought they'd hire
anyone stranger than me.

223
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,400
Hello?

224
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:34,106
Halt!

225
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:39,048
-Identify yourself.
-Jonathan Switcher, new stock boy.

226
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:41,192
Yeah.

227
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,528
Mr. Richards told me all about you.

228
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:46,664
I am Capt. Felix Maxwell,
night security commander.

229
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:49,234
It's my responsibility
to secure the perimeter here...

230
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:52,303
...at Prince and Company.

231
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,406
I didn't know there was danger of invasion.

232
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:58,441
There's no danger,
as long as me and Rambo are on patrol.

233
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:02,242
-Rambo?
-Yeah.

234
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:06,311
I call him that because he likes to draw...

235
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:08,651
...first blood.

236
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,059
Just what is your assignment
here tonight, boy?

237
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,854
I'm helping Hollywood with the window.

238
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:21,528
The little Mary has an assistant now?

239
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,203
-Where do you people come from?
-Ohio.

240
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:26,292
Ohio?

241
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:29,866
You mean they got them in Ohio?

242
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:34,601
So, you like your new assignment?

243
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:38,912
Could have been worse.
Could have put me on with a bigoted jerk.

244
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:45,182
Hold it there, boy!
Did you have anybody particular in mind?

245
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:50,055
You think he meant anybody
in particular, Rambo?

246
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:54,966
Don't let Felix get to you.

247
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,502
He just has a bad case of Miami Vice.

248
00:20:57,502 --> 00:20:58,870
I gotta go, okay?

249
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,167
I promised my girlfriend
I was gonna take her out tonight.

250
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,070
What happened? What did I say?

251
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:10,381
Albert left me, that bitch.
He said my thighs are too fat.

252
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:12,183
-Do my thighs look too fat to you?
-No.

253
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,443
You didn't look!

254
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:18,456
I don't know about men's thighs.
They look fine to me. They really do.

255
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,545
Thank you.

256
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:22,794
Albert called me "cellulite city."

257
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:26,564
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I should have my hips lifted.

258
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:29,267
No! If you want to lose weight, just diet.

259
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,936
Diets are no use.
It's those jelly doughnuts.

260
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:34,239
They call to me in the middle of the night:

261
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:39,244
"Hollywood. Come and get me."
I can't stay away from them.

262
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:43,280
-It's like you and women's dressing rooms.
-No, that was a misunderstanding.

263
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:46,084
Have any of your friends
ever been vacuumed out?

264
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:48,086
I heard those doctors in Beverly Hills...

265
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:51,723
...they just open you up
and suck those fat cells out of there.

266
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:53,091
It sounds nice.

267
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:57,389
I wonder if you could do it yourself,
with a vacuum cleaner or something.

268
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:02,901
Albert's been off work for an hour now.

269
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:06,037
There's just no telling
what he's gotten himself into.

270
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:11,042
Take it easy, okay? Just go home
and get yourself some rest. You'll be fine.

271
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:14,168
An artiste does not leave
his work unfinished.

272
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,744
No, it looks fine to me.

273
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:20,408
In that case, I'm a dream that once was.

274
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:25,390
Look out, Albert,
because Hollywood is on your case.

275
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,718
Yeah, go get him.

276
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:30,325
Good grief.

277
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:36,757
What's the matter?
Don't you like your new scarf?

278
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:38,670
Not especially.

279
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,794
Shit!

280
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,163
What a funny way to say hello.

281
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,003
What the hell's going on?

282
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:48,512
My name is Ema Hesire,
but you can call me Emmy.

283
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:51,382
This is a joke, right?

284
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:54,218
A Prince and Company initiation?
Who hired you? Hollywood.

285
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:57,088
Nobody hired me, Jonathan.
You know who I am.

286
00:22:57,088 --> 00:22:59,019
No, this can't be happening.

287
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:03,428
I know! The sign, the electricity.
My brain synapse, it was destroyed.

288
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:06,656
I felt so sorry for you last night.
You looked so lost and Ionely.

289
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,197
Last night, you saw me?

290
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:14,339
No. You can't be her.

291
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,975
When you made me,
didn't you feel inspiration?

292
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:20,311
Almost like your hands were being moved
by a force not of this world?

293
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:23,147
You made this body
so that I could come to life!

294
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:25,783
Am I in the twilight zone or am I just nuts?

295
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:27,285
I'm so glad I picked you!

296
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:30,047
I'm gonna create someone
who doesn't like me?

297
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:34,359
So, tell me your life story.
It seems to have slipped my mind.

298
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,727
It's a long story.

299
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:38,763
See, I was born in 2514 B.C. in Edfu, Egypt.

300
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:42,633
-I'll be 4,501 next April.
-I'll bake a cake.

301
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,635
Back then, I wasn't allowed to do anything.

302
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:46,304
Do you know I was supposed to marry?

303
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:48,634
-Who?
-A camel dung dealer.

304
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:55,847
Would have been my guess. I'm stressed.
I'm having a hallucination caused by stress.

305
00:23:55,847 --> 00:24:00,884
Does this feel like a hallucination?
Come on, let's go have some fun.

306
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:06,884
Food additives. It's food additives.

307
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:09,857
Come on!

308
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,898
Except for early morning clouds...

309
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:17,568
...the weather for the Greater Philadelphia
area should remain the same....

310
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:18,736
Damn him.

311
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:20,701
...with a slight increase in temperature.

312
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:34,052
The things I could've done
with these tools!

313
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:37,789
-You like to work with your hands?
-Yes. I love to build and invent things.

314
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:42,493
-Back in Edfu, I even made a pair of wings.
-And I'm sure you flew.

315
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:44,959
That's right. Almost.

316
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:48,861
You still don't believe I'm real, do you?

317
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,625
I'm open for discussion.

318
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:57,039
Why don't we stick to good,
old-fashioned hand tools for now.

319
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:02,513
-You've got good hands.
-Thank you.

320
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:05,776
I like the way they felt
when you were putting me together.

321
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:13,524
Tonight we'll do something different
and special.

322
00:25:13,524 --> 00:25:16,160
Something this store
has never seen before.

323
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,795
I wish you didn't look so worried.

324
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:21,065
Easy for you to say.
As a mannequin, you'll always have work.

325
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:23,634
Me, I'm gonna wind up
in the nuthouse after this.

326
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,671
I wonder if insanity is covered
in the employee health plan?

327
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:29,069
That's the dress
I should wear in the window.

328
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:36,335
Don't do that.

329
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:39,484
You weren't so shy
when you were creating me.

330
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:40,573
You weren't so real.

331
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:45,515
Good God, who are you?

332
00:25:49,894 --> 00:25:52,690
Good morning, boys and girls.
I don't see Zingy.

333
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:55,928
She just bit smiling Alan.

334
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:34,639
You look foxy! Can I ride you?

335
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:39,301
-I'll be walking to work. Thank you.
-No! Don't be silly!

336
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:41,112
Wait!

337
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:44,515
I thought our plans were for 8:00 last night.
My mistake.

338
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:47,685
-I've got to talk to you.
-We have nothing to talk about.

339
00:26:47,685 --> 00:26:48,986
Take a hike, wussy pants.

340
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:50,321
Something happened last night.

341
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:53,057
I'm going crazy.
I saw things that couldn't have happened.

342
00:26:53,057 --> 00:26:55,593
Where were you?
You look like you slept in the street.

343
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:58,629
-Prince and Company.
-Prince and Company! Your big job!

344
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:01,132
You know the mannequin that I made?

345
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:03,723
She's there. She came to life.
She knew who I was.

346
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:07,238
You could have told me
you just decided to stand me up.

347
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:10,474
Instead, you come here to me
lying with this ridiculous story!

348
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:12,565
No, I'm not lying, I'm insane.

349
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:14,805
Armand, let's get out of here.

350
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,221
Mom, when I was growing up,
did I ever do anything really strange?

351
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:36,524
Yeah, I know I was always different.

352
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:38,936
Let me ask you this:

353
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:41,372
Is there any history of insanity
in the family?

354
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,840
I mean, Grandma--

355
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,910
Grandma and Grandpa weren't
half-brother and sister?

356
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,602
No, I'm fine, Ma.

357
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:52,846
You know, you're alone a lot.
You start inventing things.

358
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:55,953
Women, you know, a beautiful woman....

359
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:58,089
Enough about me. How are you?

360
00:27:58,089 --> 00:27:59,679
You ever have hallucinations?

361
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:27,485
This is America.
You do not set the pace by redecorating.

362
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:30,554
-You demolish.
-Of course. I'll remember that.

363
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:32,990
We'll build the best Illustra yet
on that site.

364
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,192
And when I move up...

365
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:38,921
...someone will have to take my place here.

366
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,234
I'll be keeping my eye on you.

367
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:46,103
B.J.! You won't believe it!

368
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:49,070
Prince and Company has
the most incredible window.

369
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:53,878
I'm talking fabu.
People were lined up outside to get a peek.

370
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:54,945
At what?

371
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:57,515
I passed it coming back
from the tanning session.

372
00:28:57,515 --> 00:29:00,379
It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

373
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:02,107
Really?

374
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:06,957
You know, it really wasn't that great.

375
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:09,855
It was interesting.

376
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,025
In a jejune way, at best.

377
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,923
I didn't care for it myself.

378
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:20,198
You know....

379
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:27,578
You should have seen it!
It was beyond brilliant!

380
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:30,548
There was 20 mannequins
with tennis rackets coming out of....

381
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:32,917
Beej, he's just a twerpy stock boy!

382
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,541
That window was a fluke.

383
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,518
When I move up,
somebody will have to take my place here.

384
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:42,420
But if you let that stock boy screw
things up, it sure won't be you.

385
00:29:42,993 --> 00:29:48,132
I've worked on this deal too long
to have it ruined by some snot-nosed punk.

386
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:49,426
I can handle him.

387
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:52,937
I meant you!

388
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:55,706
Of course you did.
But you know that the board meeting...

389
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:59,543
...is today.
I guarantee the sale will go through.

390
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:03,748
Under your inspired leadership,
Illustra will reach new heights. So we--

391
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:04,882
Richardsl

392
00:30:04,882 --> 00:30:07,418
Where in the hell did you learn
to kiss ass like that?

393
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:09,086
Did you take a class?

394
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:12,121
No, sir. That's a God-given gift.

395
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:15,626
Beej? B.J., are you there?

396
00:30:15,626 --> 00:30:20,331
We'd all love to know what possessed
Switcher to create such a window display.

397
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:22,800
Did you see those crowds
gaping on the sidewalk?

398
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,231
It's an embarrassment!

399
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:32,076
Never you fear, your Hollywood is here.

400
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:35,479
Rumor Control has it that the board
wants to fire your little behind.

401
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,314
You let me in there at those so-and-sos.

402
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:40,918
I'll straighten them out, tout de suite.
How can they think of firing you?

403
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:42,052
They're business people.

404
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:44,488
They won't appreciate an emotional appeal.

405
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:45,489
You're right.

406
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:49,593
I was hoping to avoid this,
but this is an hour of desperation.

407
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:52,062
This is not the way to approach this, okay?

408
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:53,686
You don't think so?

409
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,401
Please don't tell anyone
you saw me dressed like this.

410
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,136
I have a reputation to uphold.

411
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:02,206
My lips are sealed.
I appreciate this demonstration.

412
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:04,708
That's it! A demonstration!

413
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:08,345
I'll create a media event.
Call the newspaper, boys and girls.

414
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:11,949
The headline will read:
"If Jonathan is fired, Hollywood flies."

415
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:15,286
Excuse me while I step out
onto the window ledge.

416
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,375
No!

417
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,779
Come on.

418
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:26,692
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

419
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:29,733
-I do get carried away sometimes.
-No, not you.

420
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,069
That Richards, he gives men a bad name!

421
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:36,073
No! Mr. Richards
said he was gonna fix everything for me.

422
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:37,274
What arrogance!

423
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:41,445
That worm of a stock boy has created
an affront to the dignity of this store.

424
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:43,180
I'll have it taken down immediately...

425
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,350
...and make sure that lunatic
never works in this town again.

426
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,919
What say,
shall we move on to the sale to Illustra?

427
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,115
Just a minute, Mr. Richards.
I believe we're onto something here.

428
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:57,127
Maybe people will come to see
our bold, new window displays.

429
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:59,363
If they come to look, they'll stay to buy.

430
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:02,399
With all due respect,
Mrs. Timkin, it's a little late for that.

431
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,935
And we do have the firm offer from Illustra.

432
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:07,538
For one tenth the value of the store!

433
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:10,708
Besides, I can't bear the thought
of selling this place...

434
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,277
...especially to that awful B.J. Wert.

435
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:15,546
We know how much
the store means to you, ma'am...

436
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:18,979
...but, 10 percent is better than bankruptcy.

437
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:24,321
I think Mrs. Timkin is right.
I move we postpone the sale for six weeks.

438
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:25,615
I second the motion.

439
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:27,613
All in favor?

440
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,752
All opposed?

441
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:32,126
This meeting is adjourned.

442
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:36,934
-Harris, would you bring Mr. Switcher in?
-What? No, wait.

443
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,023
I think--

444
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,142
Good news.
We've not only decided to keep you on...

445
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:48,040
...but I'm promoting you
to visual merchandiser.

446
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,638
You're kidding! That's great!

447
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:53,050
What is it?

448
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,176
Just keep doing what you did last night
and you'll be fine.

449
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:00,457
I'm not sure I can do it again.

450
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:02,787
Last night might have been
a one-time inspiration.

451
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:07,898
Don't doubt yourself. Go with it. Feel it.

452
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,728
You're doing the job you were meant to do.

453
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:15,372
You must lead a charmed life.

454
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:18,134
It was all I could do
to save your skin in here.

455
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:21,202
No thanks are necessary.

456
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:36,426
Good evening, Mr. Richards, sir.

457
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:40,264
Listen, that new stock boy,
Switcher, has been promoted.

458
00:33:40,264 --> 00:33:41,732
He'll be doing windows at night.

459
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,001
Just keep an eye on him for me.

460
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:48,401
Do you suspect pilferage, sir?
I'd be happy to strip-search him.

461
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:51,542
You people that work at night scare me.

462
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:55,346
I just want you to let me know
what he's up to, how he works.

463
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:58,677
Yes, sir. His M.O.
Would you like that in a written report?

464
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:00,543
You write?

465
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:05,045
No. Rambo does.

466
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:10,385
-Just watch him.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:14,554
Come on, Rambo.

468
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:18,790
We have got ourselves a mission.

469
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:29,942
Jesus Christ, Rambo!

470
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:36,952
Hi, it's me! Jonathan, remember?

471
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:43,151
I guess it was just temporary insanity.

472
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:44,862
"O ye of little faith."

473
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:46,697
You're back! I thought--

474
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:48,632
You remind me of my old boyfriend, Chris.

475
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:50,668
He didn't have any confidence, either.

476
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:53,804
-Chris? Who's Chris?
-Just a sailor.

477
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:57,340
I told him that the world was round
and I never saw him again.

478
00:34:57,841 --> 00:35:01,399
Christopher Columbus? You knew him?

479
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:06,417
So, you didn't come here directly
from Edfu?

480
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:11,454
No. I tried out different times and places
but none of them ever seemed right.

481
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,626
You didn't happen
to run into Michelangelo?

482
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:18,388
Michelangelo. Yes!

483
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,398
He wasn't very interested in me.

484
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:24,331
He was involved
with some guy named David.

485
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:27,732
-Come on.
-Were you there?

486
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:33,944
Mrs. Timkin loved what you did last night,
but they think I did it.

487
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:36,046
They want me
to keep doing brilliant windows.

488
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,273
-You've gotta help me.
-Of course.

489
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:46,446
You are magic.

490
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:52,862
Where do they hide all the musicians?

491
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:14,043
-Come on, let's dance!
-No. I can't.

492
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:03,620
Shake that thing!

493
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,416
Great. I want you to meet somebody.
This is Emmy.

494
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,558
Very nice.

495
00:39:08,558 --> 00:39:12,129
Maybe I can get G.I. Joe,
and we can double sometime.

496
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:13,931
No! You don't understand. She--

497
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,432
Don't say nothing. It's cool.

498
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:19,703
It's obvious to this country girl
that you're an A-number one creative freak.

499
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:23,106
Imagine pretending to be a stock boy
when you're a major artiste.

500
00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:24,969
I am so jealous.

501
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:29,780
Some people may find you strange,
but not me. I respect that.

502
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,973
Create, honey, create!

503
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:35,752
I'll leave you two alone
and go meet Albert for dinner.

504
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,786
-I hope he doesn't mind.
-No.

505
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:54,371
Just when I think you're real, you vanish.
What's with you?

506
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:56,340
-What's with me?
-Didn't I tell you?

507
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,976
You're the only one
who can see me like this.

508
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,874
-That's not exactly fair, is it?
-Talk to them.

509
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:14,549
Do you hear something?

510
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:16,787
Wait a minute.

511
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:21,193
Okay, you Rambo, get ready.

512
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:23,857
Attack!

513
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:31,475
Rambo.

514
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:33,577
What? Stay there!

515
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:36,271
Easy, Felix. I don't think she's armed.

516
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:46,289
You can fool Rambo,
but it won't work with me, Switcher!

517
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:48,220
My brain is quicker than a--

518
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:54,887
I think that we've outdone ourselves.

519
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,490
Yeah, this one's kind of fun.

520
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,730
-Ready?
-Let her rip.

521
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,335
Very nice.

522
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:26,263
-Good morning, Mrs. T.
-Good morning, Jonathan.

523
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:29,733
What do you think?
It's hot, there's gonna be meltdown.

524
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:32,903
Yes! Hot, smoking,
burning, churning, whatever!

525
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:34,265
Oh yes!

526
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:52,622
Hello?

527
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:54,691
Hi, Jonathan. Hi.

528
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:56,426
It's me, Roxie.

529
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,495
I thought you weren't talking to me.

530
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:01,231
I wanted to see you.
I want to know you're all right.

531
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:03,900
I gotta get some sleep.
I work nights now, okay?

532
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,093
All right, but get up in time for lunch.

533
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:10,006
I'm taking you to Chez Jacques at 1:00.

534
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,675
You know where it is.

535
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:15,512
Yeah, I was fired from that place once,
I almost burned that joint down.

536
00:42:15,512 --> 00:42:17,614
It'll be just like old times.

537
00:42:17,614 --> 00:42:19,883
And please don't stand me up again.

538
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:21,251
Yeah, okay.

539
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:22,443
Bye.

540
00:42:26,957 --> 00:42:28,615
He'll be there.

541
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,287
Love that gal.

542
00:42:38,235 --> 00:42:39,536
Hi, Tony.

543
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:40,604
Hi, Hans!

544
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:44,401
I see you're wearing the nighttime
hair at lunch now. Looks good.

545
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,204
It's you.

546
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:50,746
The flambe terrorist.

547
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,151
Will you not be satisfied
till you burn the whole place down?

548
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:55,385
It was an accident.

549
00:42:55,385 --> 00:42:58,088
I tried to show the customer a little flair.

550
00:42:58,088 --> 00:42:59,923
Jonathan!

551
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:02,325
-You're here to dine?
-That's right, old boy!

552
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:05,262
By the way,
the eyebrows are growing back nice.

553
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:06,863
Sorry I'm late, I overslept.

554
00:43:06,863 --> 00:43:09,557
That's okay. You're only an hour late.

555
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,566
Just glad you made it.

556
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:14,871
I love this place. It's so romantic.

557
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:17,874
Yeah! Boy, they did a good job
rebuilding the balcony.

558
00:43:17,874 --> 00:43:19,771
It went up like a Roman candle.

559
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:23,013
Jonathan,
it seems like I was all wrong about you.

560
00:43:23,013 --> 00:43:25,582
And I have a way of making it up for you.

561
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:29,584
How would you like to be
the chief window dresser at Illustra?

562
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:32,622
You're kidding.

563
00:43:32,622 --> 00:43:34,491
Word is out, Jonathan. You're hot.

564
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:37,827
Can you imagine being at Illustra?

565
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:40,191
-They want me?
-We want you.

566
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,066
What if I told you I had a little help?

567
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:46,436
Fine. There's two of you?
You can bring him along.

568
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:49,869
And what if I told you
it was a very beautiful woman?

569
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:54,038
I wouldn't mind. Not in the least.

570
00:43:55,011 --> 00:43:56,079
I can't do it.

571
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,615
-Monday, we'll work together.
-You're not listening.

572
00:43:58,615 --> 00:44:00,250
You can drive me to work.

573
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,986
I miss that quirky little motorcycle
of yours.

574
00:44:02,986 --> 00:44:06,544
-I'm not taking the job.
-What? Why not?

575
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:09,285
If I'm one thing, I'm Ioyal.

576
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:12,796
Jonathan,
you're not seriously turning me down?

577
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:16,566
I'm not the same guy I used to be.
I finally found a place where I belong.

578
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:18,133
I'll see you around.

579
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:24,599
I got it! Don't panic! It's just a little one!

580
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,076
Bye, Roxie!

581
00:44:35,452 --> 00:44:37,053
There's something strange...

582
00:44:37,053 --> 00:44:39,823
...going on in the store
at night, Mr. Richards.

583
00:44:39,823 --> 00:44:43,226
Every time Rambo sees a mannequin,
he gets so scared...

584
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:46,296
...his little pug tail
comes right out his little mouth.

585
00:44:46,296 --> 00:44:49,799
-Felix, you were in the war, weren't you?
-Airborne. Yes, sir!

586
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:52,836
Did you jump out of a plane
and land on your face?

587
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:54,233
Yes, sir!

588
00:44:54,704 --> 00:44:56,906
I don't see what it has to do with Rambo.

589
00:44:56,906 --> 00:44:59,743
Isn't it obvious
Switcher is behind all of this?

590
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:01,144
That skunk!

591
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:06,349
An eternal failure is putting together
the most magnificent displays in town.

592
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:07,438
The bum.

593
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:10,320
You say you hear voices,
there's no one there.

594
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,921
Just him and his dummies.

595
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:13,690
Is someone helping him?

596
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,588
Is he a ventriloquist?
Some kind of mad genius?

597
00:45:17,594 --> 00:45:19,685
Good questions all, sir.

598
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:22,098
Find out the answers!

599
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:24,564
Yes, sir! What about little Rambo?

600
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:26,501
Screw your dog!

601
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:34,411
Let's go, people, clear out.

602
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:37,844
-Clear out, lady!
-Stop pushing, okay? I'm going.

603
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:44,015
Come on, Rambo.
Tonight we nail that little fart blossom.

604
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,893
On behalf of Capt. Clark and the crew...

605
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:52,462
...we'd like to thank you
for flying with Eastern.

606
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:55,690
And we hope you enjoy
your fun-filled day in the Caribbean.

607
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:59,135
We deserve this vacation.

608
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:01,604
The sun feels pretty strong.

609
00:46:01,604 --> 00:46:04,138
I could use some suntan lotion...

610
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:08,940
...if someone were willing to rub it on.

611
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:16,377
It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it.

612
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:46,480
We are alone.

613
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,545
Okay.

614
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:55,892
So, listen, we find him,
get a picture of whoever this woman is...

615
00:46:55,892 --> 00:46:57,394
...and get out.

616
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:01,396
If we can't hire Jonathan,
maybe at least we can buy her out.

617
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:05,568
I don't know about you,
but I've always wanted to make love...

618
00:47:05,568 --> 00:47:07,670
...in the ladies' shoe department.

619
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,499
The smell of fine leather.

620
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:16,139
Can I show you something in your size?

621
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:18,236
What?

622
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:20,908
You mean you took me serious?

623
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,293
You're gonna pay for that.

624
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,861
Stop it! Don't!

625
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:44,841
Mayday!

626
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:46,476
Mayday, Rambo.

627
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:47,644
Okay, boy.

628
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:50,680
Okay. Show 'em what you're made of.

629
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,804
Go get 'em!

630
00:47:52,749 --> 00:47:57,650
Rambo! This way!
This means a court-martial!

631
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,321
You hear that? That must be them.

632
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:04,461
I wish it was us.

633
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:06,586
Come on. We've got them.

634
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:11,126
-Give up?
-Never.

635
00:48:17,707 --> 00:48:19,138
Switcher.

636
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:21,940
You are one sick puppy.

637
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:27,912
So this is the young lady
he dumped you for?

638
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:30,110
Nice.

639
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:33,579
Beauteous!

640
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,091
I really should have listened
when he asked me for help.

641
00:48:38,428 --> 00:48:41,156
Tell me,
when you were making love to him...

642
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:45,322
...did you ever scream,
"Don't stop, woody"?

643
00:48:48,638 --> 00:48:50,399
My camera.

644
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:54,606
No, this is how I get my inspiration.
I create.

645
00:48:55,545 --> 00:48:58,982
I can tell by looking at you,
you're not the artistic type.

646
00:48:58,982 --> 00:49:03,041
You know, Mr. Richards told me
to keep an eye on you, but...

647
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,680
...I think I'm gonna handle things...

648
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:08,955
...my own way.

649
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:15,428
You want to move your sweetheart?

650
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:22,931
That one was for Rambo.

651
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:42,083
Switcher, this is for my Mama!

652
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:51,466
Switcher.

653
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,741
Switcher, I'm gonna knock you
into the middle of next week!

654
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:11,588
How'd you do that?

655
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:13,849
I was standing behind him,
he didn't see me.

656
00:50:15,758 --> 00:50:18,258
Teach him to mess with
a man and his mannequin.

657
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,070
Where'd you go?

658
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:41,367
This is your last chance.
We take him or we die trying!

659
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:22,418
I did it! I flew!

660
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:24,087
I really flew!

661
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:27,714
-Are you all right?
-Terrific, incredible, I feel great!

662
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:30,215
Did you see how high I was?

663
00:52:34,964 --> 00:52:36,463
I just had a thought.

664
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,330
You think we should
name our first kid Pinocchio?

665
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:47,776
Jonathan...

666
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:50,747
...are you sure this is right for you?

667
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:52,405
I'm positive.

668
00:52:53,483 --> 00:52:56,347
What about you?
You've waited a long time.

669
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:01,023
How do you know you're not missing
something better 5,000 years later?

670
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:03,921
Nothing could ever be better
than being here with you.

671
00:53:04,827 --> 00:53:06,554
This is one guy...

672
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:09,623
...who's never gonna leave your side.

673
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:12,298
The window!

674
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:18,099
Come on.

675
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,549
It's almost sunrise.
We can't possibly finish it!

676
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:27,950
Don't worry about a thing.

677
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:30,450
But we'll never dress
the mannequins in time!

678
00:53:31,454 --> 00:53:33,021
That's right!

679
00:53:50,006 --> 00:53:52,308
Absolutely scintillating!

680
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:53,643
Beyond genius!

681
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:55,074
It sucks.

682
00:53:55,745 --> 00:53:56,869
Fool.

683
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:16,696
I don't believe it's lunch yet.
Let's not dally.

684
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:21,327
Felix!

685
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,308
What happened?

686
00:54:25,308 --> 00:54:27,710
Why don't you tell me?

687
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:28,834
Where's Rambo?

688
00:54:30,847 --> 00:54:32,782
It's that Switcher.

689
00:54:32,782 --> 00:54:35,646
I caught him doing awful things
to a half-naked dummy.

690
00:54:36,586 --> 00:54:39,088
Richards,
is this your idea of a security guard?

691
00:54:39,088 --> 00:54:42,646
-I assure you I had nothing to do--
-You hired him, you fire him.

692
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,761
What if he's telling the truth?

693
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:47,226
How can you think that?

694
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:51,901
The man is a lunatic,
but I've never known him to lie.

695
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:53,402
He's absolutely right.

696
00:54:53,402 --> 00:54:56,539
Mr. Richards, this store
has never been more successful.

697
00:54:56,539 --> 00:54:58,334
It's all due to Jonathan Switcher.

698
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:02,345
He can put a rubber glove on his head
and run naked in the store yelling:

699
00:55:02,345 --> 00:55:03,746
"Hi, I'm a squid!"

700
00:55:03,746 --> 00:55:05,711
Hi. 'Morning, Mrs. T.

701
00:55:06,816 --> 00:55:08,184
Hello, Jonathan.

702
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:11,420
This morning's window
is your most brilliant yet.

703
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,750
Thank you. What happened here?

704
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,691
God only knows.

705
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:19,028
Felix, did you try and take
Omaha Beach all by yourself, again?

706
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:22,832
-I was doing what Mr. Richards told me to.
-I never said anything.

707
00:55:22,832 --> 00:55:24,934
Is that right? Richards...

708
00:55:24,934 --> 00:55:27,503
...when you take Felix
to get his last paycheck...

709
00:55:27,503 --> 00:55:28,865
...get your own as well.

710
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:32,642
Mrs. Timkin,
you may be our grande dame...

711
00:55:32,642 --> 00:55:34,510
...but I've had serious doubts...

712
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:37,647
...about a woman your age
running this store.

713
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:39,282
I'll appeal to the board.

714
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:41,784
I can't imagine
you're appealing to anybody.

715
00:55:41,784 --> 00:55:44,910
Don't mess with this old chick, mister.
Just pack it up.

716
00:55:45,688 --> 00:55:47,415
Jonathan, let's go.

717
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,922
And get that dog out of the tree.

718
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,030
You can't do this!

719
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,732
We'll file a grievance with the union!

720
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:59,562
You're not in a union, you idiot.

721
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:49,034
Hi there, Jonathan.
I didn't know you were in there.

722
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:51,413
Excuse me.

723
00:56:51,413 --> 00:56:53,071
That's lovely.

724
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:08,230
What the hell are you people doing?

725
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,663
Have you seen the latest figures, children?

726
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:13,566
89 percent.

727
00:57:14,203 --> 00:57:16,828
Sales are down 89 percent!

728
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,909
Prince and Company
is going through the roof!

729
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,444
All right.

730
00:57:22,444 --> 00:57:26,981
Now, I want this to stop, children.
And if it doesn't, so help me God!

731
00:57:27,483 --> 00:57:29,574
You are all dead meat!

732
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:35,758
Jonathan, it is my honor to inform you
that starting Monday morning...

733
00:57:35,758 --> 00:57:39,461
...you'll be the youngest vice president
ever at Prince and Company.

734
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:42,530
-Congratulations.
-Hear, hear!

735
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,469
-I don't know what to say.
-Say, "Thank you."

736
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:48,871
Thank you!

737
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:51,405
Long live Prince and Company.

738
00:57:52,174 --> 00:57:54,003
Cheers.

739
00:57:56,378 --> 00:57:58,002
Son of a gun.

740
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,980
So, Richards was telling the truth.

741
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,619
I've been in this business 20 years.

742
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:07,746
Hell, half the guys in this store
probably wear lace underwear...

743
00:58:08,257 --> 00:58:10,052
...but, this....

744
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:14,556
We're talking a Sunday drive
into some serious dementia.

745
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:20,469
It's our move now.

746
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:22,671
I'd do anything for Illustra...

747
00:58:22,671 --> 00:58:26,901
...but these pictures could
kind of ruin his life.

748
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:29,809
Roxie, I'd never ruin anyone's life.

749
00:58:30,813 --> 00:58:34,249
I would,
but only if it were absolutely necessary.

750
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:37,786
Roxie, you're not developing
a conscience on me, are you?

751
00:58:37,786 --> 00:58:39,751
No, I don't think so.

752
00:58:40,756 --> 00:58:41,824
Good.

753
00:58:41,824 --> 00:58:44,484
Anyway, I don't want to ruin his life...

754
00:58:45,294 --> 00:58:47,329
...I just want to hire him.

755
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:48,760
And...

756
00:58:50,632 --> 00:58:52,063
...now I know how.

757
00:58:55,137 --> 00:58:56,499
Hi, Gord.

758
00:59:03,846 --> 00:59:06,882
-Miss Thomas, hi.
-Please, Jonathan, it's all yours.

759
00:59:06,882 --> 00:59:11,320
-Thanks. Men's room is broken.
-Of course, dear, whatever you say.

760
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,479
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

761
00:59:19,428 --> 00:59:22,759
You won't believe what Mrs. Timkin
and the board just told me.

762
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:27,166
-Vice president.
-Jonathan, that's wonderful!

763
00:59:27,836 --> 00:59:31,235
Tina, Moni,
he's talking to the dummy again.

764
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,011
Nobody deserves it more.

765
00:59:36,011 --> 00:59:37,635
I knew this would happen for you.

766
00:59:38,046 --> 00:59:42,708
Creative freedom, practically my own boss,
maybe some World Series tickets.

767
00:59:44,586 --> 00:59:46,889
All right, I'm sorry. I'm going on and on.

768
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:48,590
I couldn't do this without you.

769
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:51,159
I won't take the job
unless we can be together.

770
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:52,556
Jonathan...

771
00:59:53,161 --> 00:59:56,196
...you can't worry
about what will happen to us.

772
00:59:57,499 --> 00:59:58,861
What does that mean?

773
01:00:08,377 --> 01:00:10,546
Girls, please, let's not be catty.

774
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:13,916
I simply will not tolerate
eavesdropping unless I'm a part of it.

775
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:15,984
I assume my Jonathan is in there.

776
01:00:15,984 --> 01:00:19,521
You can't go in. He's got company,
if you know what I mean.

777
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:22,055
And who do you think introduced them?

778
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:32,768
At least she'll never say
your hips are too fat.

779
01:00:32,768 --> 01:00:35,302
Hollywood! Jeez, listen.

780
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:40,165
You know I would never bother you
when you're getting a piece of wood...

781
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:44,146
...but this is muy importante.
Your Hollywood needs help.

782
01:00:44,146 --> 01:00:47,238
-What's up?
-I need your creative muse.

783
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:52,087
I've always thought of myself as hot stuff,
the very best at what I do.

784
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:55,384
But seeing you, let's just say it, I'm dirt.

785
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:59,728
Mold me. Shape me. I'm a fast learner.

786
01:00:59,728 --> 01:01:02,531
Please, Jonathan,
do not let them turn me out...

787
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:04,433
...into that dark night alone.

788
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:07,402
We can talk about designs and stuff...

789
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:09,595
...but when I work, I gotta work alone.

790
01:01:10,472 --> 01:01:13,063
Of course. I understand perfectly.

791
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:17,279
You're an artiste,
and that's the way you work.

792
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:19,074
I can respect that.

793
01:01:21,149 --> 01:01:24,386
Jesus. Hollywood, listen, don't worry.

794
01:01:24,386 --> 01:01:27,944
You can work as long as you want here,
I'm a vice president now.

795
01:01:35,631 --> 01:01:37,065
Who's crying?

796
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:41,101
It's either our new vice president,
the fairy or the dummy.

797
01:01:43,972 --> 01:01:46,802
Emmy, please, you've gotta help me.

798
01:01:47,275 --> 01:01:51,680
I can't come alive in front of Hollywood.
Besides, you can do it on your own.

799
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,383
How can you say that?
We do everything together!

800
01:01:54,383 --> 01:01:56,652
You can't hold yourself back
because of me.

801
01:01:56,652 --> 01:01:58,982
Now, come on. Hollywood's waiting.

802
01:02:00,355 --> 01:02:02,184
You'll do a masterpiece tonight.

803
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:03,915
Emmy....

804
01:02:08,263 --> 01:02:10,558
I'll be waiting in the window.

805
01:02:17,773 --> 01:02:21,900
Jonathan, how about a picture?
Mom will think I've switched.

806
01:02:25,047 --> 01:02:26,748
Hollywood, you're a genius!

807
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:28,684
I am? Yes!

808
01:02:28,684 --> 01:02:30,619
Okay, we need to make a list.

809
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:32,287
Fire away.

810
01:02:32,287 --> 01:02:34,014
30 feet of black nylon cord....

811
01:02:34,756 --> 01:02:36,925
Sounds like my kind of list.

812
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,220
Easy, sugar. Okay....

813
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:42,230
You personally vouch for this guy?

814
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:45,067
He's worked at Prince and Company
for 15 years.

815
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:46,635
I think he'll be just fine.

816
01:02:46,635 --> 01:02:48,430
He's an imbecile, but....

817
01:02:49,805 --> 01:02:51,429
This is him.

818
01:02:52,107 --> 01:02:55,665
Felix, come in. This is Mr. B.J. Wert.

819
01:02:56,878 --> 01:02:58,570
Mr. Wert, sir!

820
01:03:00,248 --> 01:03:01,450
It's fine.

821
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:05,120
Felix, there are hundreds of mannequins
at Prince and Company.

822
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,456
Will you be able to identify the one...

823
01:03:07,456 --> 01:03:12,127
...Jonathan Switcher has
a romantic interest in?

824
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:15,924
Absolutely, sir.
I never forget a name or a face, Mr. Nertz.

825
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:18,054
Good.

826
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,903
Felix, we need your help,
and if you succeed...

827
01:03:21,903 --> 01:03:25,741
...you will have a cushy new job
right here at Illustra.

828
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:27,976
We want to get Switcher's mannequin...

829
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:30,712
...out of the store
and bring her here, secretly...

830
01:03:30,712 --> 01:03:32,211
...of course.

831
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:36,309
A covert operation.

832
01:03:37,419 --> 01:03:41,156
I would be happy and proud
to lead this mission, sir!

833
01:03:41,156 --> 01:03:42,245
Good!

834
01:04:17,793 --> 01:04:20,157
It's the most beautiful
window I've ever seen.

835
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:21,751
It's all you.

836
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:24,596
-Not this time.
-Every time.

837
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,701
You're part of me now. I got you in here.

838
01:04:30,005 --> 01:04:32,407
Come on. You ready to go?

839
01:04:32,407 --> 01:04:34,242
Are you sure you wanna do this?

840
01:04:34,242 --> 01:04:37,279
Absolutely. You've been
cooped up in that store too long.

841
01:04:37,279 --> 01:04:39,281
Besides, who cares what people think?

842
01:04:39,281 --> 01:04:42,475
Just put your arms around me
and hold on tight.

843
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:44,517
With pleasure.

844
01:04:49,024 --> 01:04:50,148
Jonathan!

845
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:56,298
Look, Jonathan,
I know about your problem.

846
01:04:56,298 --> 01:04:57,399
What problem?

847
01:04:57,399 --> 01:05:00,802
You're riding with a mannequin
on the back of your motorcycle.

848
01:05:00,802 --> 01:05:02,802
What is wrong with this picture?

849
01:05:03,338 --> 01:05:05,207
Right, you two haven't met.

850
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:07,576
Roxie, this is Emmy. Emmy, Roxie.

851
01:05:07,576 --> 01:05:10,445
Nice to meet....
My God, what am I saying?

852
01:05:10,445 --> 01:05:12,681
Jonathan,
I wanna give you one last chance.

853
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:14,583
Now, come to Illustra!

854
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:17,853
What is in this for you, Roxie?
An office with a view?

855
01:05:17,853 --> 01:05:21,089
I don't need Illustra or you.

856
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:22,952
I got friends here, people who care...

857
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:25,925
...and someone who
makes me feel good about myself.

858
01:05:26,728 --> 01:05:28,159
Bye, Roxie.

859
01:05:31,366 --> 01:05:35,303
You'll be sorry!
You're making a big mistake!

860
01:05:35,303 --> 01:05:36,427
Roxie....

861
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:40,542
He's out of his mind! B.J. was right.

862
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:43,245
When I get that dummy,
I'm gonna tear her hair out!

863
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:47,549
You know what you need to do right now?

864
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:50,886
You need to put him and this whole
nasty affair out of your mind.

865
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:53,511
Now, how is the best way to do that?

866
01:05:54,456 --> 01:05:57,726
By having a night of distasteable sex...

867
01:05:57,726 --> 01:06:00,495
...with someone that you care
absolutely nothing about.

868
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:03,393
And proudly, I would like to be that person.

869
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:06,268
Fine, let's just go to your place.

870
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:07,535
Really?

871
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:10,365
Drive fast before I have second thoughts!

872
01:06:12,474 --> 01:06:14,269
Armand is the wind!

873
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:24,552
Mr. Richards,
you'd better put some camouflage on, sir.

874
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:28,110
I am not going to put
shoe polish on my face, thank you.

875
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:31,324
Now, could we please get into the store,
Felix?

876
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,984
Yes, sir.

877
01:06:37,299 --> 01:06:38,833
Look at him with a dummy!

878
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:40,924
Who are you to criticize?

879
01:06:44,906 --> 01:06:48,176
It's him! It's her! That little prevert!

880
01:06:48,176 --> 01:06:49,978
He's stealing her before we can!

881
01:06:49,978 --> 01:06:51,413
Don't do anything rash!

882
01:06:51,413 --> 01:06:54,215
We'll follow them,
and at the right moment, grab her.

883
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:57,218
Don't worry, Mr. Richards,
I'm an expert at surveillance.

884
01:06:57,218 --> 01:06:58,342
Hang on!

885
01:07:02,223 --> 01:07:03,558
Where'd he go?

886
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:05,023
That way.

887
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:14,868
That is it!
No more of this surveillance crap.

888
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:17,172
Capt. Felix Maxwell...

889
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:19,206
...takes this from no mannequin!

890
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:23,878
No!

891
01:07:23,878 --> 01:07:26,648
Get us out of here
before he gets out of the car!

892
01:07:26,648 --> 01:07:28,316
Watch out!

893
01:07:28,316 --> 01:07:30,077
Hang on!

894
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:38,454
You're finished, Switcher!

895
01:07:47,535 --> 01:07:50,160
You may as well hang up
your jockey strap!

896
01:07:52,307 --> 01:07:55,501
Let me go! No, Mr. Richards! No!

897
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:10,214
-Be careful, you maniac!
-I know!

898
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:18,732
This is for you, Rambo.

899
01:08:29,144 --> 01:08:30,412
We got him!

900
01:08:30,412 --> 01:08:33,003
-I want to get out.
-Geronimo!

901
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:53,101
I don't understand it.

902
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:56,102
This never happened to Armand before.
Never!

903
01:08:57,806 --> 01:09:00,542
It must be you. You're so cold.

904
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:02,542
You're so unfeeling.

905
01:09:04,045 --> 01:09:06,409
Where can I get a mannequin, too?

906
01:10:32,634 --> 01:10:34,031
Jonathan.

907
01:10:43,278 --> 01:10:45,505
What are you thinking about?

908
01:10:46,481 --> 01:10:47,912
The window.

909
01:10:49,017 --> 01:10:51,585
Turned out pretty didn't it?

910
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,917
It was breathtaking.

911
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:55,978
Emmy...

912
01:10:57,592 --> 01:10:58,989
...Ema Hesire...

913
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:02,562
...you inspire me.

914
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:06,694
I feel like I could do anything.

915
01:11:07,936 --> 01:11:10,061
Windows are only the start.

916
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:14,302
I think we could design an entire city.

917
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:18,971
No one takes the time to build things
that have character and dignity.

918
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:22,439
People need that.

919
01:11:23,585 --> 01:11:25,676
We could give it to them.

920
01:11:27,855 --> 01:11:29,183
I love you, Emmy.

921
01:11:31,059 --> 01:11:33,184
I love you, too, Jonathan.

922
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:41,094
I better get into the window.

923
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:17,071
That peckerhead doubled back on me.
I saw his motorcycle out front.

924
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,696
That dummy of his has got to be here!

925
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:34,022
This is the one!

926
01:12:34,022 --> 01:12:35,223
You're positive?

927
01:12:35,223 --> 01:12:36,483
Absotively!

928
01:12:37,225 --> 01:12:38,626
Wait a minute.

929
01:12:38,626 --> 01:12:41,058
This one kinda looks like her, too.

930
01:12:43,197 --> 01:12:45,629
I've put my future
in the hands of a vegetable.

931
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:51,764
Just get the mannequin.
Get the mannequin.

932
01:13:06,454 --> 01:13:08,556
-It's over there!
-No, this is the door.

933
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:11,392
This is not the door!

934
01:13:11,392 --> 01:13:13,016
This is the door.

935
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:16,464
Wait. Mr. Richards...

936
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:19,567
...did you ever notice
how they all sort of look alike?

937
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:21,259
Look at that one.

938
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:23,898
Maybe this is her.

939
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:40,150
This is really interesting.

940
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:43,889
This is art.

941
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:48,119
-It's like theater.
-I get it!

942
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:02,568
Excuse me.

943
01:14:05,213 --> 01:14:06,714
Good morning, starshine.

944
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:09,884
I sleep alone these days, too,
but I am not about to advertise it.

945
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:10,952
Get my clothes?

946
01:14:10,952 --> 01:14:13,821
Spent the night? You slept through
the whole how-do-you-do.

947
01:14:13,821 --> 01:14:15,013
What do you mean?

948
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:18,793
All the girl mannequins disappeared
from the windows last night...

949
01:14:18,793 --> 01:14:20,661
...film at 11:00. Yes, my dear...

950
01:14:20,661 --> 01:14:22,430
...your favorite, she is gone.

951
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,519
Emmy?

952
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:26,926
Jonathan.

953
01:14:28,136 --> 01:14:30,067
That was great!

954
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:36,611
I'm sorry, but you know us special people...

955
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:38,312
...are destined for heartache.

956
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:41,716
You know what works best for me?
Crying shamelessly.

957
01:14:41,716 --> 01:14:44,751
Don't do anything drastic! Me, my!

958
01:14:56,164 --> 01:14:57,629
Okay, now.

959
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,528
Wait a minute.

960
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:02,361
Yes. My car cover, darling.

961
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:07,696
Yes.

962
01:15:10,711 --> 01:15:11,800
Yes, girl.

963
01:15:13,381 --> 01:15:15,711
Jonathan, wait!

964
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:18,386
Roxie.

965
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:19,454
Roxie Shield.

966
01:15:19,454 --> 01:15:21,155
-Can I help you?
-Roxie Shield.

967
01:15:21,155 --> 01:15:22,957
-She's in conference--
-Thank you.

968
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:24,820
You can't go in there!

969
01:15:25,226 --> 01:15:26,725
Security.

970
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:30,898
Jonathan!
We were hoping you might drop in.

971
01:15:30,898 --> 01:15:32,967
Can I get you something to drink?

972
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:34,435
Where is she, Roxie?

973
01:15:34,435 --> 01:15:36,170
She's perfectly safe.

974
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:40,041
Jonathan,
let's talk about your future here at Illustra.

975
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,809
I think it'll be wonderful...

976
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:43,945
...to have the team back together again.

977
01:15:43,945 --> 01:15:47,381
-What'd you do with her?
-Relax, it's just a mannequin.

978
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:50,885
How does $55,000 a year sound to you?

979
01:15:50,885 --> 01:15:54,222
-You son of a bitch!
-All right, $60,000.

980
01:15:54,222 --> 01:15:56,324
I don't think he's of Illustra fiber.

981
01:15:56,324 --> 01:15:57,391
Where is she?

982
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:59,560
-You'll never see her again!
-Where you going?

983
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,963
We also have a very nice
profit-sharing plan.

984
01:16:01,963 --> 01:16:03,965
We have extremely incriminating photos...

985
01:16:03,965 --> 01:16:05,828
...of you and that little....

986
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:09,499
Get up, Richards! Get him!

987
01:16:14,175 --> 01:16:15,640
Sorry, gotta run.

988
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:19,145
Security alert! Man in leather jacket!

989
01:16:20,248 --> 01:16:21,679
Come on! Get....

990
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:32,693
All units, code 2.
Perpetrator on main floor.

991
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:34,662
Roger. Over and out.

992
01:16:34,662 --> 01:16:37,094
Come on, Terminator. Duty calls.

993
01:16:41,235 --> 01:16:42,393
Excuse me.

994
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:45,029
Roxie!

995
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:49,577
Call the police!

996
01:16:49,577 --> 01:16:50,871
The SWATteam.

997
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:00,943
Go away.

998
01:17:06,427 --> 01:17:08,062
Felix!

999
01:17:08,062 --> 01:17:09,697
Switcher.

1000
01:17:09,697 --> 01:17:11,566
Terminator...

1001
01:17:11,566 --> 01:17:12,928
...lunchtime.

1002
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,101
Get him!

1003
01:17:18,773 --> 01:17:20,308
Nice dog.

1004
01:17:20,308 --> 01:17:21,397
Shit!

1005
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,806
Switcher!

1006
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:36,718
Where did he go?

1007
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,143
There he is!

1008
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:01,303
No!

1009
01:18:08,956 --> 01:18:11,820
-Get him!
-You're finished, Switcher!

1010
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:22,132
You've had it, Switcher!

1011
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:33,973
Get me out of here!

1012
01:18:59,306 --> 01:19:02,143
Put me down, you idiot!

1013
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,267
Let's go.

1014
01:19:12,653 --> 01:19:17,053
You've had it, Switcher!
I'm gonna get you!

1015
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:27,894
You're finished, little Switcher!

1016
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,956
Yoo-hoo boys!

1017
01:19:58,566 --> 01:20:00,434
Way to go, buddy!

1018
01:20:00,434 --> 01:20:02,303
Two things I love to do:

1019
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,566
that's fight and kiss boys. Come on!

1020
01:20:11,345 --> 01:20:13,347
Come and get me, Sister Maryella.

1021
01:20:13,347 --> 01:20:16,177
What's the matter, honey? Come on.

1022
01:20:31,966 --> 01:20:34,296
This is what being a man is all about,
honey.

1023
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,498
You can't come in here.

1024
01:20:45,646 --> 01:20:46,804
Emmy!

1025
01:20:48,883 --> 01:20:51,178
Mine's bigger than yours is.

1026
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:46,165
Why can't we get
that damn water turned off?

1027
01:21:52,313 --> 01:21:53,641
Shit.

1028
01:21:54,448 --> 01:21:56,413
Go!

1029
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:00,247
Shoot him!

1030
01:22:03,023 --> 01:22:05,359
Jonathan, you saved me.

1031
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:07,154
It's nothing, really.

1032
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:10,831
I'm alive.

1033
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:12,091
What?

1034
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:15,703
He can see me and I'm still alive!

1035
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:16,895
You are!

1036
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:19,306
Thank you!

1037
01:22:19,306 --> 01:22:21,809
-Thank you.
-What is it?

1038
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:25,675
-You're gonna have to love me forever.
-I always have, I always will.

1039
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,594
Move!

1040
01:22:40,594 --> 01:22:43,993
-Get out of the way, doofus!
-Move, damn it!

1041
01:22:57,177 --> 01:22:59,905
It's a miracle!

1042
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:08,482
Stop it!

1043
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:19,791
You little creep! Stop touching me!

1044
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:23,760
Get away from me!
Please don't touch me!

1045
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:27,664
Roxie.

1046
01:23:32,246 --> 01:23:34,143
-Jesus, it's the heat!
-Hollywood.

1047
01:23:35,316 --> 01:23:37,077
Now, this is Emmy.

1048
01:23:37,952 --> 01:23:41,954
Mama, put the coins on my eyes, 'cause
I sure don't believe what I am seeing.

1049
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,355
There he is.

1050
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:48,996
Arrest that man. Who's she?

1051
01:23:48,996 --> 01:23:50,464
She's who I came for.

1052
01:23:50,464 --> 01:23:51,997
She's the dummy!

1053
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,169
I said, "Arrest that man!"

1054
01:23:55,169 --> 01:23:56,737
Keep your hands off him!

1055
01:23:56,737 --> 01:23:59,473
Claire, thank goodness you're here.
These people....

1056
01:23:59,473 --> 01:24:02,676
Shut up! B.J., you really screwed up.

1057
01:24:02,676 --> 01:24:04,778
What are you talking about?

1058
01:24:04,778 --> 01:24:08,649
When I fired this idiot the other day,
I decided to replace him...

1059
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:11,151
...with one of those camera
surveillance systems.

1060
01:24:11,151 --> 01:24:14,321
I have Richards
and this moron on videotape.

1061
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:17,992
I was sure you were behind this.
You greedy snake!

1062
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:19,116
Claire!

1063
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:23,330
I want those two arrested
for breaking and entering and grand theft.

1064
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,432
I'll get you later for conspiracy.

1065
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:27,901
You can add kidnapping to that, too.

1066
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:30,170
-Kidnapping? Who?
-Me!

1067
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,805
Who are you?

1068
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:33,841
She's the dummy!

1069
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:36,377
This poor man is having a breakdown.

1070
01:24:36,377 --> 01:24:38,112
Get him out of here!

1071
01:24:38,112 --> 01:24:40,948
She's the dummy!

1072
01:24:40,948 --> 01:24:43,684
-She's the dummy!
-Please, don't use force.

1073
01:24:43,684 --> 01:24:46,086
Mamal I want my mamal

1074
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:49,019
Mrs. Timkin, those video cameras,
did they pick up...

1075
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,517
...everything last night?

1076
01:24:51,959 --> 01:24:54,289
I only saw what I needed to see.

1077
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:57,965
Just where did you come from?

1078
01:24:57,965 --> 01:25:00,898
Roxie, you would never understand.

1079
01:25:06,607 --> 01:25:08,108
Claire....

1080
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:11,645
There must be some arrangement
we can make?

1081
01:25:11,645 --> 01:25:13,212
Cram it, clown!

1082
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:16,350
-Come on, now.
-No, boys.

1083
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:19,153
You know, I see executive potential here.

1084
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:22,122
Roxie, you're fired!
You'll never work in this town again!

1085
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:26,682
How am I gonna pay my bills, my rent,
my new watch, my car....

1086
01:25:27,682 --> 01:25:37,682
