Good.

How'd you sleep?
Very well.

What are you guys doing?

470
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:15,657
Um, we go to Elysian Park
every morning and eat
a little breakfast...

471
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:18,427
and take some photos
for a few hours.

to images of nature.

Then I have less to do
next week, so--

Did you guys
see my shoes?

-[ Cyrus, Molly ] No.
- They were right here.

want you, you know,
to obsess on this.

this conversation
at 1:30 in the morning?

Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea
what time it was.

But the more I think
about the shoes,

gave me seems really weird.

being friendly but--
- Yeah.

and meet them...

overcompensate sexually.

Come here.
[ Sniffles ]

773
00:51:54,353 --> 00:51:55,854
It's gonna be okay.

774
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:57,356
No, it's not.

775
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:07,366
I know it seems just weird
that it was so fast, but it
really is gonna be all right.

776
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:09,368
No, it's not okay!
Okay.

Yeah.

Listen, I know you're tired
of me saying this.

780
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:39,398
So don't say it.

781
00:52:40,399 --> 00:52:43,151
And it's upsetting
to hear.
It is.

782
00:52:43,186 --> 00:52:45,904
But it's not
gonna be all right.

783

That's true.

not gonna be okay.

Thank you.

I want to wake up
in the morning at your house...

instead of waking up
at my house going,

"I gotta get over to her house.
I miss her."

What do you think?

00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:04,983
Did you just ask to move in?

800
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:07,486
Yes. I did.

801
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,959
So, hold on. Hold on. But...

802

is blowing with Cyrus.

And I don't know
how he's feeling.
Yeah, of course.

804

how he's feeling and--

Hi.
Yeah.

Uh, were you planning on
coming over?

We didn't get a message.

there, huh?

really tough tonight.

Okay.

He's been having
panic attacks.

00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,015
Oh, no.

Hmm.

838
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:33,358
The weird thing is,
it was his decision, you know?

839
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:35,127
He is an adult and--
I mean--

840
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:36,827
But these
are panic attacks,

841
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:39,364
and that doesn't
have anything to do
with being an adult or not.

842
00:57:39,399 --> 00:57:40,866
Yeah.
An adult, that's--

No. I know, I know.

We should talk.

with all your shit in my room?

I was gonna apologize
to you both.

But after this shit
you just pulled? You just
fucked yourself, John.

You gonna hide my belt now?

What do you think
your mom would say if she
could hear you right now?

Who's going to
tell her? You?

Who do you think
she's gonna believe?

864
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:37,482
Her son, who needs her now
more than ever after his battle
with panic and anxiety,

865
00:59:37,983 --> 00:59:40,986
or this new guy who clearly
wants her kid out of the way?

You listen to me,
you little weirdo.

I'm gonna mess with you
right back.

I was feeling
a little panicky.

872

I was talking to John about
how happy I am to be around
you guys right now.

873

The thought of going back
to that house...

874
01:00:07,712 --> 01:00:10,180
makes me all...

875
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:11,681
fluttery and nauseous.

01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:15,220
You don't have to
go back there, sweetie.

You know, um,

01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:25,730
I've never told anybody
this before, but, uh,

879
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:29,234
I used to get
anxiety attacks.

880
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:31,201
You did?
Yeah.

881
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:33,203
So I know how scary
they can be.

01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:36,741
Wow.
Did you have a good family
to help you get through it?

883
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:38,208
You know, I didn't.

884
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,245
I couldn't imagine
going through this alone.

885
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,711
Yeah, but I did.

886
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:44,499
It was terrifying.
I didn't know what was going on.

887
01:00:44,534 --> 01:00:47,252
They didn't even call them
anxiety attacks back then.

888
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:49,754
I just thought
I was going crazy.

889
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:51,721
I almost left college.

890
01:00:51,756 --> 01:00:54,224
But I decided to tough it out.

891
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:57,262
And that decision
made me who I am.

892
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:01,231
This could be that
moment in your life.

893
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:03,733
Where you go from
being a boy to being a man,

01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:07,272
and you say, "You know what?
You're not gonna beat me."

to come home?

another place.

what the right thing to do is.

01:01:41,806 --> 01:01:43,308
I decided that it--

904
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,311
I decided that
coming back here...

905
01:01:46,346 --> 01:01:49,279
was not defeat,

906
01:01:49,314 --> 01:01:52,317
but, in a way,
like a weird victory.

01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:55,319
And if it's okay
with you, John,

to come back home.

I can't.
I can't do that.
Why?

920
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:46,871
Because if I do,

it's just gonna be between me

Oh, um,

930
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,908
I forgot to ask.
John, do you have
an extra tie I could borrow?

931
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:25,875
A what?

932
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:29,414
A tie.
I want to try and look nice
for the wedding tomorrow.

933
01:03:30,915 --> 01:03:32,917
Uh, yeah. I think I do.

934
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:38,423
I've got a bunch of ties,
so I'll find one for you,
if you need it.

935
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,425
Thanks.
All right, good night.

936
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:54,439
Um, wow.
I didn't know that Cyrus
was coming with to the wedding.

937
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,941
Oh.

938
01:03:57,942 --> 01:04:00,444
Yeah. Yeah. I-I--

939
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:02,947
I-I know it's a lot,

940
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:07,452
but he's going through
a lot, so--

941
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:09,954
Yeah.
Okay?

942
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:10,955
Okay.

943
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:14,424
Um,

944
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,461
I don't know
how to put this.

945
01:04:19,964 --> 01:04:21,466
Uh,

946
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:25,219
do you ever feel like...

947
01:04:25,254 --> 01:04:27,972
Cyrus is not being...

948
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,978
a hundred percent genuine?

949
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,981
How do you mean?
I don't know.

950
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:40,985
I know he's going
through a lot, and I'm not
trying to deny that.

951
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,456
Um,

952
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:47,957
I mean, like--

953
01:04:47,992 --> 01:04:49,493
I'm sorry.
Spit it out.

954
01:04:49,528 --> 01:04:50,960
No. Uh--
You're just--

955
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:54,499
He's behaving in a way
that I think...

956
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:57,001
is--

957
01:04:57,036 --> 01:04:59,003
um--

958
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:02,972
All right,
I don't know how else to--

959
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:06,010
I wasn't gonna tell you
about this, but, whatever,
I'll show you.

960
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,522
My shoes were
in Cyrus's closet.

961
01:05:20,024 --> 01:05:21,526
Hidden.

962
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:30,034
So, what--
what does that really mean?

963
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,002
I don't know.

964
01:05:33,037 --> 01:05:35,039
You know,
sometimes I think--

965
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:40,044
and I want to put
this exactly right--

966
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:43,548
he might be...

967
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,049
acting...

968
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,519
out...

969
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:51,556
with this behavior.

970
01:05:54,058 --> 01:05:56,310
How long have you
felt like this?

971
01:05:56,345 --> 01:05:58,528
Do I feel that way?
I don't know.

972
01:05:58,563 --> 01:06:03,568
I'm just unearthing things
in my own head right now.
I just--

973
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:05,837
You know what?
This is too important.

974
01:06:05,872 --> 01:06:08,072
We should have Cyrus
come in here.
No.

975
01:06:08,107 --> 01:06:10,039
Let's talk about this.
No, no, no.

976
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:13,578
Trust me.
It will really put him
on the spot.

977
01:06:13,613 --> 01:06:16,045
He's having panic attacks.

978
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,583
We'll have a great time
at the wedding.
Are you sure?

979
01:06:18,618 --> 01:06:21,586
Yeah. Yeah.

980
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,092
[ Softly ]

Shh, shh, shh.

It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

983
01:07:06,165 --> 01:07:07,597
Cyrus. Shh.
It's me.

984
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,133
Are you all right?
Am I all right?

985
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,135
Yeah.
What are you
doing in my room?

986
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,137
I want to talk to you.

987
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,142
Listen, I know why
you want to come to
the wedding tomorrow.

988
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:24,614
This wedding is really,
really important to me.

989
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:29,654
And my ex-wife's feelings
are really, really
important to me.

990
01:07:31,155 --> 01:07:33,157
And I know we've been messing
around with each other,

991
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:37,662
and it would be a great time
for you to mess things up
for me and your mom.

992
01:07:37,697 --> 01:07:39,128
I agree.

993
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,165
But here's the thing.

994
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:45,134
Do you know what it feels like
to be knocked unconscious?

995
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:49,673
Because if I sense for
one second that anything weird
is going on,

996
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:54,178
or you're even thinking
of pulling some shit,
I will knock you out.

997
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:56,681
Do you understand?

998
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:01,150
Yeah.
Good.

999
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:03,688
Then let's have a great time
at the wedding tomorrow, okay?

1000
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:38,689
How you doing, Roger?
Good. Good.
You look great.

1001
01:08:38,724 --> 01:08:39,690
Thank you.

01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:50,166
Um,

you know this is a big day
for John, right?

Yes.

Okay.

1006
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:09,185
I choose you to be mine.

1007
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,722
To live with you
and laugh with you.

1008
01:09:12,723 --> 01:09:17,228
To stand by your side
and sleep in your arms.

1009
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:23,734
To be joy to your heart
and food for your soul.

1010
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:26,737
To bring out the best
in you always.

[ Chuckles ]
Cyrus, are you drunk?

1028
01:11:32,029 --> 01:11:33,531
What happened?
How did you get drunk so fast?

1029
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:37,500
I saw the way you
looked at her, John.

1030
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:41,539
You can't marry her.
You'll never,
ever marry her ever.

I just saw my son
on the floor being hurt.

From the moment
that I met you,

1061
01:13:57,341 --> 01:14:02,346
as soon as your son
became aware of it, he made it
his mission to split us up.

1062
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:05,314
Every step of the way,
every overture I made,

1063
01:14:05,349 --> 01:14:09,854
every time I tried to be
understanding and reach out
to him, he's shut me down.

1064
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:11,320
He hates me, Molly.

1065

-He hates me.
- He's having a really
tough time.

01:14:13,893 --> 01:14:15,359
He's not having a tough time.

1067
01:14:15,394 --> 01:14:16,861
Your son hates me.

And I gotta say,
I fucking hate him too.

Nothing here
between us that's...

1070
01:14:40,384 --> 01:14:43,387
worth taking
another look at?

You and I--

1072
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:48,392
We do have something.

1073
01:14:50,394 --> 01:14:52,396
And I know how rare it is,

1074
01:14:52,897 --> 01:14:54,899
because it's
been a long time...

1075
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:58,903
since I had anyone
close to someone like you.

1076
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:04,373
But I am not prepared...

1077
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:08,162
to get deeper into it and
hoping it's gonna work out,

1078
01:15:08,197 --> 01:15:11,916
and then two years down the line
it's not gonna work out,

1079
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:14,418
and you guys have each other,

1080
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,888
and I'm alone again.

1081
01:15:18,923 --> 01:15:23,427
I just think
there's so much here
between us and--

1082
01:15:26,931 --> 01:15:29,934

I've missed a few things
in our relationship.

letting another person...
