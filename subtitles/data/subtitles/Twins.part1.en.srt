00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,700
On his 35th birthday,

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
l decided to tell Julius Benedict...

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the truth about himself.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,500
Julius already knew
that he was the product...

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,000
of a scientific experiment...

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,400
conducted by the American government.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,600
A top-secret experiment designed
to produce a physically,

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,500
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,200
He knew that,
unlike other little boys,

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,100
he had not one, but six fathers--

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,500
All very distinguished men...

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,600
And of course,

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,900
he knew about Mary Ann Benedict,

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,600
the remarkable young woman...

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,500
who was selected to be his mother.

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,400
Sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,200
that his mother died
while giving birth to him.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
Now, what Julius did not know,

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
not until this very moment,

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,300
was that about a minute
after he was born...

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,100
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy.

23
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,600
l have a brother?

24
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,900
Ya.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,600
He was sent to an orphanage
in Los Angeles...

26
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,000
at the same time
l brought you here to the island.

27
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,700
Julius had spent his entire life
here on the island,

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,300
helping me with my research.

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,700
l always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,900
How wrong l was.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,100
l must find him.

32
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,600
Julius, Julius!
Wait, wait.

33
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,300
l couldn't believe he was going.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,400
He wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.

35
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,000
All of his knowledge was from books.

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Julius could speak 12 languages.

37
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,600
He excelled in history, science,

38
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,300
mathematics, literature.

39
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,200
He was pure in body and in spirit.

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,300
Ahhh!

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
But for the first time,

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,700
Julius would not listen to me.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,300
He's probably just like me.

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,100
The nearest island with
an airport was 27 miles away.

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,100
But Julius did not care.

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
He had become obsessed
with the idea...

47
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,400
that his brother, Vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...

48
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,800
and desperately needed his help.

49
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,900
Honey, l'm home!

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,100
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

51
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,700
- Get going!
- l'm going.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, hello, hello!

53
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,600
Oh, my goodness!

54
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,800
Good-bye.

55
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
- We're gonna be late for work.
- l need my horoscope.

56
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,900
- Yeah, horoscope.
- ''Your judgment is at its peak today.

57
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,100
Use it wisely,
and romance will follow.''

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,800
- Ooh, good one.
- l hope so.

59
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,100
Ladies!

60
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,300
- Vince!
- l thought you broke up with him.

61
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
l did, l did!

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
- You don't mind if l talk
to your sister, do you?
- She doesn't mind.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Don't give him any money.

64
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,100
Uh, no, no, l promised Marnie
l wouldn't give you any money.

65
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,300
Don't look at me like--

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,200
Don't do that thing
with your eyes.

67
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,900
l'm not even supposed
to be here with you.

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,400
You are here,
and so am l.

69
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,100
Maybe millions
of people go by,

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
but they all
disappear from view.

71
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,200
l only have eyes
for you, Linda.

72
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,200
l only have
eyes for you.

73
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,200
Mmm.

74
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,300
- lt's the baby Klane!
- What?

75
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,500
- Can l help you?
- Uh, yeah.

77
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Where's the little shit?

78
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,800
You'll have to be
more specific...

79
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,300
concerning the clientele.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Benedict.

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Oh, he wouldn't come in here.

82
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,800
- lsn't that right, Marnie?
- Who, Vincent?

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,100
That weasel? That creep?

84
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,800
l wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

85
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,000
Take out the papers
and the trash

86
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,600
Or you don't get
no spending cash

87
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,400
lf you don't scrub
that kitchen floor

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,900
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

89
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,300
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

90
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,000
l knew you were trouble
the second l laid eyes on you.

91
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,700
Excuse me. l just have never
heard this kind of music before.

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,300
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

93
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
Take out the papers

94
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,100
Take out the papers

95
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,900
Take... out...
the... papers

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,600
Take out the papers
Take out the papers

97
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,500
Take... out...
the... papers

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,100
And the trash
Trash

99
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,800
La-la-la
La-la-la

100
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,000

Thank you.

112
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,600
Hey, Vince!

113
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,700
Listen, Al,

114
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,900
you gotta help me out.

115
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,500
l'm into the Klane
brothers for $20,000.

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
- You borrowed money from a loan shark?
- What do you got?

117
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,200
Got anything for me?
See what you got.

118
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,800
We're doing this
too often, Vince.

119
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,000
l'll give you something.

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,200
l got a nice BMW
up on 4, stall 20.

121
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Vince, l'll take all
of these you can get.

122
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,200
All right, Tony.

123
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,700
- For you.
- Thanks, Tony.

124
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,700
Yeah.

125
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,700
Whoa, Tony!

126
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,300
There's only $4000 here.
For a car like this is $6000.

127
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,000
We're in a recession.
Everything's tough.

128
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,800
You wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.

129
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,200
No, l just could've
used some more.

130
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,900
- You okay, Vince? You seem worried.
- Yeah.

131
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,300
Your bowels troubling you?

132
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,400
What an amazing country.

133
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,300
Hey.

134
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,300
Gotta light, pal?

135
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, excuse me.
l don't smoke, pal.

136
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,500
Yeah. Ha-ha.

137
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,500
Yeah, good stuff, huh?

138
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,200
- Pickin' up something
for the girlfriend?
- l don't have a girlfriend.

139
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,700
Do women really
wear those things?

140
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
lf you're lucky, they do.

141
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
l can't believe it.

142
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,800
- You're from out of town?
- Yes.

143
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
As a matter of fact, l come from
an island in the South Pacific.

144
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,600
Whoa!

145
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,500
What the hell did
you do to him, man!

146
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,700
l did nothing.
The pavement was his enemy.

147
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Let me check him out.
A light concussion.

148
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,500
Uh-oh.

149
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,900
- l carry him to a hospital.
- No!

150
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,300
l think you should
just take off, man.

151
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Find your horse
you came in on.

152
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,300
l'm so sorry about this.

153
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
- l feel terrible.
- Me, too. Thanks a lot.

154
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
- Sorry.
- Yeah, l'm sorry.

155
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
The next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.

156
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Yeah, have a nice day.

157
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,600
You don't have to buy them.
Just don't say they're cheap!

158
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,300
These are quality socks.

159
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,800
What a day it's been.
Oh, no, no, no!

160
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
Oh, oh! Jesus Christ!

161
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,200
$53! Are you
out of your mind?

162
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,700
Your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,100
So, do l look
normal to you?

164
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
You don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.

165
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh, come on.
You don't need a sticker.

166
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,600
Handicapped, my ass!

167
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,500
l'll need your
driver's license, sir.

168
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,200
Look, l'm sorry
l lost my temper.

169
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,200
Driver's license,
please.

170
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,200
- Look, l had a very bad day.
- Driver's license... please.

171
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,900
You've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, Mr. Benedict.

172
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,200
You just had your birthday.
Your driver's license expired.

173
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Happy birthday.
Watch your head.

174
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,400
Thanks.

175
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,200
Come along, now.

176
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,800
So this is where
my brother grew up.

177
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,500
l'm so happy he had so many
children to play with.

178
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,300
And that's where
he must have slept!

179
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes, it was.

180
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,000
How did you know?

181
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,200
lt's the one l'd have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher.

182
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,200
ln case of a fire,

183
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,700
l could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,200
We've had only one fire
in here at St. Charlotte's.

185
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,600
Vince Benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.

186
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,600
Tell me a little bit
about Vincent.

187
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,500
Was he a great athlete?
lnterested in chess and poetry?

188
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,400
l'm certain God had a purpose
when he created Vince Benedict,

189
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,200
but it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.

190
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
Oh, l'm sorry.

191
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,300
Odd, the contents
of his files are missing.

192
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,200
That is Vince?

193
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
He looks so happy.

194
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,300
He should.
That's Sister Maria,

195
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,900
- his biology teacher.
- l always liked biology.

196
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,900
So did Vincent.

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,300
He disgraced Sister Maria,

198
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
who had to leave the order.

199
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,300
Then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.

200
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,300
l must find my brother.

201
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
Do you know
where he might be?

202
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,800
Jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.

203
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,000
You're full of goodness, Julius.
l pray you never find him.

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Benedict, visitor.

205
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,500
- l'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
- You got him.

206
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,600
l have rowed halfway
across the world--

207
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Wrong, l just rowed a day--

208
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,300
l've been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.

209
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,900
l've been on my island,
l'm telling you.

210
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,900
This is incredible that--
l have looked for--

211
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,300
You've gotta talk
into the phone, Bozo.

212
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Vincent.
Yes, Vincent...

213
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,300
l know you don't
know who l am.

214
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,000
- But believe me, l came--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

215
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,600
l've got another six hours
to pay the money back.

216
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,900
Tell the Klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer...

217
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,200
is beneath even them,
all right?

218
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,500
l don't know any Klane brothers.
l'm your brother, Julius.

219
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Huh? Come again?

220
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,300
My name is Julius,
and l'm your twin brother.

221
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Oh, obviously.

222
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,200
The moment l sat down, l thought
l was looking into a mirror.

223
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,700
We are not
identical twins.

224
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,900
- Oh, no?
- No.

225
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,700
l wouldn't be
too sure, pal.

226
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,700
l don't lie.
l am your brother.

227
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,200
You must let me help
you get out of here.

228
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,800
You want to
help me get out?

229
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,400
Yes, right now.

230
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,300
Well, money talks,
and bullshit walks.

231
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,200
How can bullshit walk?
That's slang, huh?

232
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
Yeah.

233
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,800
l'm in fast company here.

234
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,400
Take a look over there.
See that man?

235
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,600
Pay him money, all right?
They let me out.

236
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,200
l'll be anything you want,
your aunt, uncle, sister...

237
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
your cousin,
brother-in-law, anything.

238
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,500
- All right?
- Okay, l pay right now.

239
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
- You pay now.
- Okay, Vince.

240
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,400
Okay. Go pay.

241
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
All right, pay him.

242
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,100
What is this,
''Candid Camera''?

243
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,100
Ahhh, oof!

244
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
Twinny, l hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets,

245
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,000
because l'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car.

246
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
- l have more money.
- You do?

247
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,300
l'm glad to help you.
Vincent, l'm your brother.

248
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,700
- l love you.
- Whoa!

249
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Look, ease up
on the love talk,

250
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,900
because l'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.

251
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,100
Tossing your cookies?

252
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Oh, that's more slang!

253
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,900
Where the hell is it?

254
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,300
- This is your car, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's it.

255
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,900
You pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.

256
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,100
- How'd you know this was my car?
- We're twins!

257
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,700
l'm so excited. Now we can
go to museums together,

258
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
talk philosophy together,
read books together.

259
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,300
- Play chess together.
- Get lost together.

260
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,200
Vincent!

261
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,900
He's so full of energy.

262
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,400
Blue Sedan DeVille.

263
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,900
This is beautiful.

264
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
Where you guys going,
out to Hawaii?

265
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,200
- Catch some of them big waves?
- Yeah, something like that.

266
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
We have plenty
of room on level 4.

267
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,600
l'll call you
next Saturday.

268
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,100
Whoa, where you going
with my desk?

269
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,100
Takin' back this
furniture, man.

270
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,600
- You're six months behind.
- You're behind!

271
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
Six months behind.
That's the problem.

272
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,400
There's no trust
in the world anymore.

273
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,000
l tried to stop them,
Mr. Benedict.

274
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,200
That's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.

275
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Vincent Benedict lncorporated.

276
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,700
- Sports agent...
- Airborne!

277
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,000
- Mr. Benedict?
- Yeah?

278
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,000
- lt's Al.
- lt's Al? Ooh, Al, Al, Al.

279
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,900
Look, Miss Busby, uh--

280
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,800
Al, hang on a second.

281
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,900
The corporation's in
a transitional period right now.

282
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,200
Take a couple of days off.
When we regroup, l'll call you.

283
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,700
Whatever you think is best.

284
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
- All right.
- l'll take this.

285
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,800
Yeah, go ahead.
Take that.

286
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,000
Before l forget,
happy birthday.

287
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
Oh, how sweet.

288
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
That's very,
very nice of you.

289
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
- Aqua Velva?
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,600
You shouldn't have.
Stacey.

291
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,500
l'll give you
a call, okay?

292
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,200
All right, all right.

293
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Al, save me!

294
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Brand-new Caddy on level 4.

295
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
l'll be there!
Don't move! Bye.

296
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,900
Whoa!

297
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,700
Time's up, Vincent.

298
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Did you hit me?
Because l didn't feel a thing.

299
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,300
l felt that.

300
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,000
You gotta understand
something, Benedict.

301
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
l like my work.

302
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,900
These are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.

303
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,100
l don't know
what the problem is,

304
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,300
but l'm sure it
can be resolved...

305
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,700
- without resorting to violence.
- Yeah.

306
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,400
Okay?

307
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,900
Okay.

308
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,300
- You moved too soon.
- He did?

309
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,400
Ahhh!

310
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
A little chest pain?

311
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,000
The first rule
in a crisis situation:

312
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,300
You negotiate first
and you attack last.

313
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,300
You negotiate first,
then you attack.

314
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
- You never negotiated.
- Na-hah!

315
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,300
You don't know what
kind of an enemy l am.

316
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,200
- Who are you?
- l'm Vincent's brother.

317
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,400
- We're twins.
- That's right.

318
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,800
- You're firewood!
- Axe, Axe, Axe!

319
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,100
You have no respect
for logic.

320
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,600
- But he's got an axe!
- Ahhhh!

321
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,700
And l have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.

322
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
You're a very stupid person.

323
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,800
You tell your brother,

324
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,100
he messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!

325
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,200
l love it when you
hit people, Julius.

326
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,600
Boom!

327
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
That was great!

328
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
Actually,
l hate violence.

329
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
But you're so good at it!

330
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,600
l've got an idea. We should
go into business together.

331
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,000
You could be a boxer.
l could be your manager.

332
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,600
- l don't think l could fight for money.
- No problem!

333
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,000
You do all the fighting,
l'll keep all the money.

334
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,600
l'm really worried
about you, Vincent.

335
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,600
How much money
do you owe?

336
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Don't lie to me.
We're twins.

337
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,600
- l can feel your pain.
- Why do you keep saying that?

338
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
We're not twins.
We're not brothers.

339
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,600
We're nothin'!

340
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,300
Twenty thousand.

341
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,900
Due this morning.

342
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Come on.

343
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,300
Don't worry about
anything, Vincent.

344
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,200
As long as l'm with you,
l won't let anyone harm you, okay?

345
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,200
Well, you're
a good guy, Julius.

346
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,700
Now, hang on
to your seat!

347
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,600
You know what?
l completely forgot.

348
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,300
l promised this
friend, Sammy,

349
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,600
that l'd pick his car up
from the airport.

350
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,600
Put it in the slot.

351
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,800
Would you do me
a big favor?

352
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,000
Would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?

353
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, l would love to.

354
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,200
Good, that would
really be a big help.

355
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,800
Do you have a manual, please?

356
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,500
- A manual?
- Yeah.

357
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
- lt's in the glove compartment.
- Oh, yeah.

358
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,900
There it is.

359
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,300
- What are you doin' with the finger?
- Learning to drive.

360
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,100
Whoa!

361
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,100
lt's not up here.

362
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,500
Maybe it's under
the back tire.

363
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,900
Look... l mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tire.

364
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,700
- Geez!
- What's the matter?

365
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,400
That dopey Sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.

366
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,400
No. Oh, well.

367
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,400
A lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.

368
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,600
Handicapped children?

369
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,100
This car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.

370
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,700
Oh, well. Let's go get
something to eat.

371
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,900
Maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.

372
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
Do you really think
we should do that?

373
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,900
lt's for children.

374
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,100
You got a point.

375
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,200
l saw a guy from
the Auto Club do this once.

376
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,900
What do you know,
beginners luck!

377
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,100
These cars have
terrific alarms!

378
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
l'll get it in a minute.

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,100
Just a second, Jules.

380
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,100
Whoa!

381
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

382
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,500
lf you lift the rear end at an angle
greater than 45 degrees...

383
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,500
the mercury switch activates
the automatic cut-off system,

384
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
so that the alarm's
computer thinks...

385
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,400
that the car is being
towed and shuts off.

386
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,500
Can l have the keys
to your car?

387
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,500
You know,
the keys to your car?

388
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No yodeling.

389
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400
Lovely day.

390
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,900
Come on, Julius.

391
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Step on it!

392
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,700
Yeeeoow!

393
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,200
Oh, my God!

394
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,600
- l am amazed at how well it's going.
- You're doing good.

395
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,300
Don't use both feet
at the same time.

396
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,400
- Just use the gas.
- Okay, one foot.

397
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
- One pedal at a time.
- Okay! l will do it!

398
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,500
Pick up the phone,
the phone.

399
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,500
The little thing down on
the right that's making noise.

400
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,800
This is Vincent's car.
Can l help you, please?

401
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,500
- Julius!
- Vincent, where are you?

402
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,200
Look in your rear-view mirror.
You see that little dot?

403
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,300
That's me.

404
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,200
Hello, yeah. Hello!

405
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,700
What are you
doing back there?

406
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,900
There's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.

407
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,200
- Supermarket.
- Take your foot off the gas.

408
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,800
Apply it to the brake.
lt's the thing next to the gas.

409
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
The brake pedal.

410
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,000
- Very gently.
- You got it.

411
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,400
Bye, Vincent.

412
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,600
All right.

413
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Okay, it's a supermarket.

414
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,000
Ohhh!

415
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,900
Ohhh!

416
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,800
That's what l call fun.

417
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,000
Did you see me
with the two wheels?

418
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,700
l can teach
you that, Vincent.

419
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,200
Julius, let me tell you
something about America.

420
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,400
Nobody likes
a smart ass, all right?

421
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,500
So, what do you think?

422
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,700
Angel's food
or devil's food?

423
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,700
Devil's.

424
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,300
- You know what
l really love about Vince?
- What?

425
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,100
He's a force of nature.

426
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,000
- You're outta control.
- No, l'm not.

427
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,800
That poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.

428
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,800
l know. Geez,
you think l don't know that!

429
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
- l don't think you know that.
- Well, l do.

430
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,700
lt's this style thing.
That's how he expresses himself.

431
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,200
And he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.

432
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,300
- Vince has a truly romantic soul.
- l can't hear this anymore.

433
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,300
Well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like l have,

434
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,900
you'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...

435
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and you'd get laid.

436
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,500
- Ah!
- Excuse me.

437
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,400
Excuse me.

438
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
She's not bad.

439
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,300
l had no idea
that these magazines...

440
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,700
had things like
this inside, inside them.

441
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,600
You didn't? Where've you been?
A desert island?

442
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,700
l come from a tropical island
in the South Pacific.

443
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,500
lt's around 300 nautical miles,
south, southwest of Fiji.

444
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,000
l just got here yesterday
and l already found my brother.

445
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,900
Your brother?

446
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,000
That's right.

447
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
My twin brother, Vincent.

448
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,300
- Twins?
- Vince!

449
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,300
- Linda.
- Hi.

450
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,200
Oh, you look gorgeous
in this light.

451
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
- You do.
- Really?

452
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,000
Hi. Who's this guy?

453
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,000
This is Vincent's brother.

454
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,500
- l didn't know you had a brother.
- Me, either.

455
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,300
You know each other?

456
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,000
Allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.

457
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,900
- This is Linda.
- Hi.

458
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,900
- Hello.
- Her charming sister, Marnie.

459
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,100
Sisters?

460
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,300
Twins?

461
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,900
Are you sure
this guy's all right?

462
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
He's okay.
He's helping me out.

463
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,800
He's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.

464
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,800
Okay, well, great seeing ya.

465
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,600
Catch ya later.

466
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,600
Great seeing ya.
Catch ya later.

467
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Oops!

468
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,300
l've only been
driving an hour.

469
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,000
- Linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
- Yeah, kinda.

470
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,400
- ls Marnie your girlfriend, too?
- Marnie?

471
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Marnie hates my guts.
She kinda likes you, though.

472
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,500
- Me?
- Yeah.

473
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,300
- She hardly knows me.
- That's the best way.

474
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,900
You see,
women love men...

475
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,300
who are mysterious
and devious.

476
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Keeps them on their toes.

477
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,700
-lt excites them. You know what l mean?
-No.

478
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,400
- You do like women?
- Very much so.

479
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
They're strange
and sensitive.

480
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
They have compassion.

481
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
l have the highest
respect for women.

482
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,600
You're a virgin!

483
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,600
That's private.

484
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,000
A 230-pound virgin.

485
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,200
lt's all right.
lt's something--

486
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,100
lt's just one
of those things.

487
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,800
Oh, Julius.
My little baby poodle.

488
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,600
Such a baby cat.
Look, did l neglect you?

489
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,000
Not anymore. Come on.

490
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,200
That's a good little pussy cat.
This is sweet Julius.

491
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,400
Okay, here you go.

492
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,800
You named
your cat Julius?

493
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,200
The secret to take-out eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.

494
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,000
- There we go.
- That much cheese?

495
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,400
Oh, yeah.
The more cheese, the merrier.

496
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
There you go.

497
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,700
l know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...

498
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,400
and spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland,

499
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,200
we just nuke it.

500
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,700
That's it. Here we go.

501
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,600
Feast your eyes.
Dinner is served.

502
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,100
- Yummy.
- Yeah.

503
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,100
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

504
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,500
Through the lips, over the gums,
look out--

505
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,900
Look out stomach, here it comes.
Ta-dum!

506
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,700
- Julius!
- Oh, l like nuked food.

507
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,700
- Mm-mmm!
- Mmm!

508
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,500
Now let me get
this straight.

509
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,100
One of our fathers was
a famous football player?

510
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,100
- Yes!
- And another one was...

511
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,100
- a physicist at M.l.T.?
- Yes, he won the Nobel Prize.

512
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,500
Naturally! All of our dads
were these big shots.

513
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,600
And Mom...

514
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,600
was like... superwoman.

515
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,100
But she didn't survive
the delivery.

516
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,800
And l was sent
to an orphanage,

517
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,500
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise...

518
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,300
by a scientist who
you do research for,

519
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
but who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.

520
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,900
Did l leave anything out?

521
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,900
l think it's important we try
to find our fathers.

522
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,700
Oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...

523
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,100
to the sperm milk shake.

524
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,500
Why are you being so immature
about all this?

525
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Do you know how many times
l've heard stories like this?

526
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,300
lt's every
orphan's fantasy.

527
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,800
My real mom and dad
were rich...

528
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
and beautiful.

529
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,700
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

530
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,800
and l got switched
with another baby.

531
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,500
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

532
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,600
and there they'll be...

533
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,300
with open arms,
crying, ''My darling.

534
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,500
''My treasure.
We didn't know.

535
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,800
How can we make
it up to you?''

536
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,500
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

537
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
lt's a crock.

538
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,400
l liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

539
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,300
Here it is.
Read it and weep.

540
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,800
''Dear Sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

541
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,900
- ''for Vincent Benedict has been denied.
- Denied, yeah.

542
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,200
''According to our files,
his mother did not die...

543
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,200
- ''during birth.
- She's not dead.

544
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,700
''We have a current
address for her at...

545
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
''172 Canyon Glen Drive,
Los Angeles.

546
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,800
''Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment,

547
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,700
and as such,
he's ineligible for aid.''

548
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,300
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

549
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,600
This letter was written
30 years ago.

550
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,200
We were five years old.

551
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,300
Our mother didn't die
when we were born!

552
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,900
You knew all this time
where she was...

553
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,200
and you never
contacted her?

554
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,800
l don't know about your mother,
''Miss Perfect, 1952,''

555
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,100
but my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive,

556
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
l hope she's
in a lot of pain.

557
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,200
She dumped me once.

558
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,800
There is no way l'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

559
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,800
lf they have lied to us about Mama
for all these years,

560
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,100
maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

561
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,900
- We have to check this address.
- You do what you want.

562
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
l got a cash-flow problem.

563
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,900
- Hello.
- Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

564
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,400
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

565
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,800
Or else what, you blimp?

566
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh, we're rollin'.

567
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,400
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

568
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,400
- Mr. Garfield, there's a man--
- Not now.

569
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,700
- Who are you?
- l'm Webster.

570
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,900
- lt's okay!
- Christ! You were never
supposed to come here.

571
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,100
We were never
supposed to meet.

572
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,500
- You're supposed to be--
- Driving that car down to Texas.

573
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,100
l got my driving gloves.
l got my driving glasses.

574
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,000
l got my driving hat.

575
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,600
But l got no car.

576
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,500
The car was there.
The merchandise was in the trunk.

577
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,700
Your instructions
were on the cassette.

578
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,600
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

579
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,400
- He wants more money.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

580
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,900
Sit down.

581
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
l got a reputation
to uphold.

582
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,600
People put their trust in me.

583
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,700
They know l always
deliver the goods...

584
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,100
and l always come
back with the money.

585
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,900
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

586
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,500
- This is bullshit. The car was there.
- That's right.

587
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,200
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

588
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,700
- The parking attendant?
- He liked the car.

589
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,200
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

590
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,900
You know,
l just realized that...

591
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,900
in over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

592
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,900
has ever seen my face.

593
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,800
l don't think that's
a problem. Hey!

594
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
No, please, please!

595
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

596
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,500
- Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?
- Grandpa,

597
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,900
this man wants
to talk to you.

598
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,100
Thank you.

599
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Hello?

600
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Yes, can l help you?

601
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,100
l'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

602
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
l know this may
sound strange,

603
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,500
but l'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

604
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,500
Mary Ann Benedict.

605
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,400
She was my mother.

606
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,600
You're Mary Ann's son?

607
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,500
That looks just
like you, Grandpa.

608
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,800
Honey, why don't
you go inside...

609
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,700
and help Grandma
with lunch, okay?

610
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Dad?

611
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,200
Uh... no!

612
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,400
- But maybe technically speaking.
- Dad!

613
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,600
Dad!

614
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,000
- Wait a minute!
- Dad! lt is you!

615
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,200
This is a big surprise.

616
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,600
Dad, this is incredible.
l don't know what to--

617
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,100
We could use a drink.
Where'd you come from?

618
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,000
One of my fathers! You don't know
what this means to me.

619
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,100
Uh, Mr. Webster, l hope you are
happy with the vehicle...

620
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,700
we chose for
your little journey.

621
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,800
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

622
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,500
and ask for uh, uh,
Beetroot McKinley.

623
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,600
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

624
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,700
Thank you.

625
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,700
Mary Ann Benedict.

626
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,400
l haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

627
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,100
Your mother was...

628
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,600
an amazing woman.

629
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,200
Oh, the times l've wondered what would
have happened if l'd have married her.

630
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,600
Why didn't you?

631
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,400
Oh, l asked her to.
She turned me down.

632
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,100
She said she was afraid...

633
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,800
to have any more children.

634
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,800
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

635
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,600
Who told her we died?

636
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,700
Mitchell Traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

637
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,700
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

638
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,200
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

639
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,600
l'll have to pay
him a visit.

640
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,900
Watch out for him.

641
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,700
He's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what l mean.

642
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,500
Dickhead?

643
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,100
No, l don't.

644
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,400
But... l'm learning.

645
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,400
l'm concerned about the time frame.

646
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,300
That's my private line, honey.
l'll take care of that.

647
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,800
You boys, excuse me.

648
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,600
Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
Who is this?

649
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,500
Uh, Webster.

650
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,600
l'm callin' from California.
l happen to have something--

651
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,200
Some merchandise
that you might want.

652
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,000
Well, bring it to me, son.

653
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Let me enrich you.

654
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,600
Well, uh, Mr. Beetroot,

655
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,900
it's the amount
of enrichment...

656
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,200
that l wanted
to talk about.

657
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,800
Don't try and renegotiate
with old Beetroot, son.

658
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,400
Now look, Beetroot,

659
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,700
if we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

660
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,300
Look, there's no way,
Mr. Beetroot,

661
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,100
that l am going to deliver
any damn Cadillac...

662
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,800
unless l know for sure
that l have...

663
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,300
twenty for my cut.

664
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,500
Twenty! You little
shit-for-brains peckerwood!

665
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
You're out of your
goddamn, greedy mind!

666
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,400
- l guess that seems
a little high for you.
- Yeah!

667
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,900
l'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen?

668
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,500
- The deal is five!
- Five?

669
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,800
l could do better
than five here.

670
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,600
lf you can do better
than five million dollars,

671
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,200
well, then, son,
you take it.

672
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,900
Beetroot,
l'll see you in Houston.

673
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,100
After all, fair is fair.

674
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,100
l'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

675
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,400
Well, good.

676
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,600
Five million!

677
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,000
Five million dollars!

678
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,300
Five mil-l-lion dollars!

679
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,400
Five million dollars!

680
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,900
Five, five million dollars!

681
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,800
Five million dollars!

682
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,100
Five m-m-million!

683
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,300
Cash, lots of cash.

684
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,600
Whoa!

685
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,400
Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

686
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,500
- You scared the living shit outta me.
- l met one of our fathers.

687
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,800
He told me about
a man in New Mexico...

688
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,300
- who probably knows where Mom is.
- Oh, great! Yes!

689
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
- Listen, she didn't abandon you.
- No?

690
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,500
You know what l mean?
She didn't abandon you.

691
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
- She didn't even know you were born.
- Oh!

692
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,000
- They told her that l died.
- No kidding?

693
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,800
Look, Julius,
l'm in a hurry.

694
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,300
- You know Sammy, who gave me this car?
- Yeah.

695
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,500
You remember Sammy? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

696
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,900
- So l'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
- Houston?

697
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Hous--

698
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,100
- Hou-- No!
- You know something?

699
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,100
New Mexico's on
the way to Houston.

700
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,400
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

701
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,400
Use the house,
make some phone calls.

702
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,500
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

703
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,600
We have to see this man, Traven,
in New Mexico.

704
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,600
- No, we don't have to see
this man in New Mexico.
- Yes, we do!

705
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,700
And l'm coming with you.

706
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
We'll go see the man.

707

Okay.

This place is a zoo!

711
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,000
Wait, wait.

712
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,500
- Happy birthday, Vince.

713
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,500
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- God.

714
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,500
- lt's not my birthday.
Better late than never.
- Oh.

715
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,600
Look what Marnie

718
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,700
So-o-o!

719
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,500

720
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,800
- Where you going?
- lnside. Have some coffee?

721
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,800
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say good-bye.

722
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,500
Take out your papers and your trash

723
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,600
Or you don't get
no spending cash

lf you don't scrub
the kitchen floor

725
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,700
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

726
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,300
Yakety-yak yakety-yak
Don't talk back

727
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,000

Excuse me, but l was

Good singing.

730
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,700
l baked you some cookies.

731
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,700
- Cookies?
- l guess it was a dumb idea.

732
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,000
No, not at all. l'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

733
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,000
- l should put on some clothes.

Oh, that's right.

You're twins.

Huh?

739
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,400
Whoa.

740
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,100
What is it?

741
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,200
l don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

742
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,800
- A fortune? That's great!
- Yeah!
