1
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,317
<i>Allez avec bon Dieu.</i>

2
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,361
Christophe!

3
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,910
Christophe!

4
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,881
Christophe!

5
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,385
Christophe!

6
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,487
<i>Field notes. Dr Dennis Alan,
Rio Negro Botanical Expedition,...</i>

7
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,241
<i>.. August 15, 1985.</i>

8
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,661
<i>At the clearing of the shaman An Hango,...</i>

9
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,659
<i>.. regarded as the most powerful
spiritual man in the Amazon.</i>

10
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:41,208
<i>There's something strange in the air
today. Even my pilot's nervous.</i>

11
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,671
<i>If I were superstitious, I'd say
that something was closing in on me.</i>

12
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,339
<i>The shaman senses it too. He decides,
in his own off-the-wall way,...</i>

13
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,514
<i>.. to show me what it is.</i>

14
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,727
Tell him I'm very appreciative.
Harvard thanks him.

15
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:00,185
His potions will make a good medicine
that will be helpful for many people.

16
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,033
Now he wants you to drink it. He says
he has something he wants you to see.

17
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,413
You know what you'll see
if you drink that shit? Stars, amigo.

18
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,079
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

19
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,717
Like I said, for the road.

20
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,391
It's good. It's very good.

21
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,522
Thank you.

22
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,271
Agh!

23
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,419
No! No!

24
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,047
Stop!

25
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,586
Hello?

26
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,386
Julio!

27
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,453
Hey. I thought
you'd taken off without me.

28
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,417
I owe you one, pal.

29
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,428
<i>Something much more evil and powerful
than the shaman or his men...</i>

30
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,806
<i>.. has killed my pilot.</i>

31
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,651
<i>I know this as clearly as I feel
the darkness and cold closing in on me.</i>

32
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,224
Hey.

33
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,849
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

34
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,152
Agh!

35
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:52,211
<i>I'm only home for a week when I get a
call from my old professor and friend,...</i>

36
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,377
<i>.. Earl Schoonbacher.</i>

37
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,956
<i>He's a consultant for
a pharmaceutical company...</i>

38
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,844
<i>.. and says he has
an interesting job offer.</i>

39
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,680
Ah, Dennis. This is Dr Cassedy,
the head of Boston Biocorp.

40
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,268
- How do you do, sir?
- Hi, how do you do?

41
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,272
Boy, it's a pleasure.

42
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,232
I'm impressed. 200 miles
through the Amazon, on foot, alone?

43
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,355
Not alone. They showed him
his animal spirit, his totem.

44
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,446
The jaguar guided him
back to us, safe and sound.

45
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,413
Well, we here at Boston Biocorp,...

46
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,370
.. we deal in science
and medicine, not magic.

47
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,621
So whether you came by Jaguar
or Mercedes-Benz, who cares?

48
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,420
What I care about is you came back
with plants and native medicines...

49
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,590
.. that no one has been able to collect.

50
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,842
What do you know about zombification?

51
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,462
- Pardon me?
- Zombification?

52
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,096
The process of making zombies.
The living dead.

53
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,434
<i>Just what I've seen on the Late Show.</i>

54
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:57,308
This is the death certificate
of Christophe Durand,...

55
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,649
.. and the doctor's report.

56
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:05,941
Mr Durand displayed negative pulse,
no heartbeat, no respirations,...

57
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,368
.. no pupil dilation, no brain waves,
no response to pain, and he was buried.

58
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,871
He was put into a coffin... and buried.

59
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,834
The date on that certificate
is seven years ago.

60
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:24,256
This photograph was taken one week
ago at a clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

61
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:29,762
That man is Christophe Durand.
The same, and very much alive.

62
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,558
Maybe Durand had a twin.

63
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,146
No.

64
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,977
Hospital error. You know,
right name, wrong corpse.

65
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,058
No.

66
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:42,477
No, we had it verified by Dr Duchamp -
the one who sent us the photographs.

67
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,444
If you don't like "zombie",
choose another word.

68
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,826
But the fact is that somebody
brought him back from the grave.

69
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,243
And I wanna know... how they did it.

70
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,457
- You really believe this?
- The Haitians surely do.

71
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,416
A drug.

72
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,304
It has to be a drug then, right?

73
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,003
Anaesthesia. That's what I was thinking.

74
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,142
A new anaesthetic that could
revolutionise medicine.

75
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,890
Now, what if this zombie drug
could be discovered?

76
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,188
40-50,000 lives a year
are lost on the operating table,...

77
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,602
.. not because of surgery,
but because of anaesthetic shock.

78
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:26,066
40-50,000 lives a year could be
saved in the US alone, Doctor.

79
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,159
And more worldwide,
if properly marketed.

80
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,283
It could be
more complicated than drugs.

81
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,498
It could be the proof,
perhaps, of the soul.

82
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,835
Come on, Schoonie,
where is the location of the soul?

83
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,536
Under the hood? Next to the battery?

84
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,042
No, the soul begins
and ends with the brain.

85
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,546
This drug, this is something totally new.

86
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:54,051
We don't have anything that can put
somebody in, then back out, of death.

87
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,604
And all we gotta do is... go and get it.

88
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,441
<i>This is one of
the poorest countries in the world.</i>

89
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:11,116
<i>It has revolution in the air. It's got
a ruthless dictator in the palace.</i>

90
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,661
<i>So I had expected
a certain sense of oppression.</i>

91
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,241
<i>But I hadn't expected that
the dark presence from the Amazon...</i>

92
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,784
<i>.. would instantly come over me here,...</i>

93
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,337
<i>.. as real as a cold hand
falling on my shoulder.</i>

94
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,923
<i>And I also didn't expect
Dr Duchamp to look like...</i>

95
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,675
<i>.. Dr Duchamp did.</i>

96
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,214
<i>- Dr Duchamp?
- Bonjour.</i>

97
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:39,183
<i>- Bonjour, je m'appelle...
- Dennis Alan, I know.</i>

98
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,440
Yes, I guess I am
an easy face in this crowd.

99
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,237
Oh, I would have known you even in...

100
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,398
- Excuse me?
- It would be better if we talk inside.

101
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,365
Those were the Tontons Macoutes.
They know you are here, of course.

102
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,631
Are you sure handcuffs
are the best idea here?

103
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,846
500 patients, three doctors, 15 nurses.

104
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,425
A week's supply of Thorazine.

105
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:23,680
Handcuffs are the only thing Duvalier
makes sure Haiti has enough of.

106
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,308
This is Margrite.

107
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,113
- I was expecting...
- After an illness of three days,...

108
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,945
.. Margrite died and was buried
in a village ceremony.

109
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,912
No death certificate,
but we have witnesses.

110
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,030
That was 15 years ago.

111
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:42,245
Last August, she was found
wandering in the marketplace.

112
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,915
Her brother identified her
by a birthmark.

113
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,753
A classic zombie.

114
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,422
<i>Bonjour, Margrite.</i>

115
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,678
<i>Est-ce que tu te rappelles
ce qui t'est arrivé?</i>

116
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,946
Well, she sure can't tell us anything.

117
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,864
I understand Christophe Durand,
the man whose death certificate I saw,...

118
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,408
- .. he can speak, right?
- Yes.

119
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:30,215
He even speaks English. Christophe is
unique. Much of his memory is intact.

120
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,293
I'd like to see him right away.

121
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,841
<i>A warning,
that's what I felt in those eyes.</i>

122
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,142
<i>I didn't know of what,
but it chilled me to the bone.</i>

123
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:57,157
<i>Marielle took me to see a man who was
very powerful in politics and in voodoo.</i>

124
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:02,528
<i>He's a full voodoo priest, but he also
runs a nightclub for tourists.</i>

125
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:07,079
<i>In fact, Lucien Celine does a bit of
everything, except give out information.</i>

126
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,252
You've come on a good night, Monsieur.

127
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:12,133
Tonight the spirits are happy.

128
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,172
We asked about Christophe Durand.

129
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:21,553
Lucien, why are you being so difficult?
You have people all over the island.

130
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,010
Someone must have seen
Christophe by now.

131
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:29,271
Perhaps. But what people see and
what they say are very different matters.

132
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,320
Haiti is full of contradictions, Dr Alan.

133
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:38,441
These dancers, for instance,
they don't bleed and they don't burn.

134
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:49,336
Tonight we are calling down Erzulie,
the goddess of love.

135
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,132
- You will dance tonight?
- No, Lucien, I will not.

136
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,499
- You will.
- No.

137
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:59,176
- You all right?
- You have business to discuss.

138
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:03,220
If he won't help, we'll go
to Christophe's village tomorrow.

139
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,479
She'll be fine. She'll be fine.

140
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,043
Agh!

141
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,252
Yes, he is the one to watch.

142
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:39,887
<i>Captain Peytraud. He plays at
being a bokor, a black magician.</i>

143
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,599
He is beneath contempt.

144
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,892
He is the Chief of the Tontons Macoutes,
Duvalier's secret police.

145
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,436
You have seen him before perhaps, hm?

146
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,685
- Yeah, someplace.
- Be careful, my friend.

147
00:19:55,362 --> 00:20:00,154
In Haiti, there are secrets
we keep even from ourselves.

148
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,947
<i>Hey.</i>

149
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,125
- Marielle.
- Yes, favourite of Erzulie.

150
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:53,329
For Marielle, possession
is as natural as breathing.

151
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,102
Argh!

152
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,836
Watch it.

153
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,384
Are you all right?

154
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,983
<i>Marielle never mentioned
what had happened the night before.</i>

155
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:03,572
<i>But from what I knew of possession,
she probably didn't even remember it.</i>

156
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,450
<i>Maybe it was just as well.</i>

157
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:11,155
<i>We asked in Christophe's village, but not
even the voodoo priestess would help.</i>

158
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,244
I told you, he is dead.

159
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,499
What should I know about the dead?

160
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,708
<i>The whereabouts of Christophe remained
a mystery, until his sister found us.</i>

161
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,414
<i>Le cimetière.</i>

162
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,721
Let's go.

163
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:56,948
What his sister said makes sense.
Christophe is obsessed with death.

164
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,248
<i>We will find him.</i>

165
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,830
That's what you said
about the last three graveyards.

166
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,807
<i>Christophe?</i>

167
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,396
Christophe!

168
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,150
Christophe!

169
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,873
Christophe!

170
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,219
Well, this is ridiculous.
Let's get outta here. A goat...

171
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,646
Oh, shit.

172
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,818
Are you OK?

173
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,153
- They were just graverobbers.
- Graverobbers, huh?

174
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,869
- That makes me feel a lot better.
- You should have seen your face.

175
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,371
You think this is funny?

176
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,751
Hey, let's stop jacking around, huh?

177
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,797
We won't find Christophe tonight -
if he's even alive.

178
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,462
What do you mean "if"?
You saw the photographs.

179
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,132
For all I know,
they were taken before he died.

180
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:33,220
What are you trying to say?

181
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:36,599
OK, you're my only contact
here in Haiti, right?

182
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:41,638
First you let the evidence go, then
we spend a lotta time getting nowhere.

183
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,024
Do you think I'm doin' this
for my health? I think this is a scam.

184
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:48,735
I'm not blaming you. I've seen
the clinic. I know you need funds.

185
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:52,529
But do you think Cassedy's corporation
will shell out money for nothing?

186
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,660
- You think this is about money?
- Yeah.

187
00:24:55,787 --> 00:25:00,284
The way Schoonbacher spoke of you, it
was as though you could walk on water.

188
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,501
Now I know why. Shit floats.

189
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,626
<i>Yeah, well, why the hell
are you getting involved?</i>

190
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:09,964
- Will you talk to me?
- Christophe!

191
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:24,017
Christophe, it's me. Dr Duchamp.

192
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,183
You remember me, don't you?

193
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,153
I remember.

194
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,774
This is Dr Alan.

195
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,319
He's here to ask you some questions.

196
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,953
Christophe.

197
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,377
I need you to remember
what happened before... you died.

198
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,921
You spoke about it once to me.

199
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,673
I remember... it all.

200
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:58,340
The coffin, the... the burial.

201
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,263
I... I saw it all.

202
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,728
Were you sick?

203
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,183
What was it that you felt?
The symptoms.

204
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,652
I heard the dirt falling, falling over me.

205
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,981
The darkness pressed me down.

206
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:30,667
<i>He says the bokor, the one that made
him like this, beats him with a whip.</i>

207
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,634
<i>The bokor took his soul
and sealed it away.</i>

208
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,512
He makes me do evil things.

209
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:42,676
I'm no longer free.
He sends me into people's dreams.

210
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:48,557
I'll need to... run a blood test
and I'd like to get a thumb print.

211
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:53,188
- No, I cannot take him to the clinic.
- This is my place. Not with the living.

212
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,480
He will find me.

213
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,486
No, Christophe, you're not dead.

214
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:02,571
Whatever they did to you, they did it
to trick you into thinking that.

215
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,956
You have a good memory.
Tell us what you remember...

216
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:09,251
<i>.. so we can stop the bokors
from doing this to anybody else.</i>

217
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,835
Help us, Christophe.

218
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,131
It's a powder.

219
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,513
A poison.

220
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:22,264
It run through the skin...

221
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,476
.. to the soul.

222
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,614
Christophe...

223
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,455
Through the skin.

224
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,667
A powder.

225
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,570
<i>Hé, blanc.</i>

226
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:20,585
Lucien. We need to ask for your help
one more time. We found Christophe.

227
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:24,302
- He told us about the poison...
- Not another word.

228
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,715
Let's go inside.

229
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,853
If you blunder into this,
my people get hurt.

230
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,684
The world should know
what is happening here.

231
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,307
You see? She is an idealist.

232
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:40,655
She simply does not understand how
dangerous these times have become.

233
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:45,407
What I'm after is gonna save
too many lives. I'm not gonna back off.

234
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,989
I know you know the man
that makes the powder.

235
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:55,287
One name. Just one.

236
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:12,103
The one in the hat is our man, I think.

237
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,310
- Louis Mozart?
- This is important?

238
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:22,441
My friend represents powerful interests,
rich American interests.

239
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,490
- American?
- That's right.

240
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:29,236
They have an enemy they would like
to turn into a zombie.

241
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:31,529
A zombie, huh?

242
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,073
- That is all?
- That's all.

243
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,750
$100.

244
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:47,047
You've come to the right place.
Your enemy is as good as dead.

245
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:51,677
I will catch his soul like a spider
catches a fly in his web,...

246
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:54,266
<i>.. and pop it in a canari,...</i>

247
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,221
.. like this one.

248
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,608
You keep the zombie's soul sealed up.

249
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,606
It makes the flesh your slave.

250
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:08,701
It gives you power.
You send it into people's dreams.

251
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,620
Whose soul is that?

252
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,575
This place's previous owner.

253
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,706
Is that right?

254
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,506
$100.

255
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,214
<i>I cast a spell, the coup I'aire, tonight.</i>

256
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,887
It's not the spell that I want.

257
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,639
What I'm after is the powder.

258
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,560
The powder.

259
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,815
Some say there is such a thing.
Some say it.

260
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:51,074
I guess Celine was wrong. This guy
can't help us out. I'm sorry.

261
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:54,786
Celine? Lucien Celine?

262
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,283
Well, of course, of course.

263
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:03,334
Lucien and me, we are like that.

264
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,004
A man should help his friends.

265
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:10,175
$1,000.

266
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,597
$700.

267
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,765
$400, tops.

268
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:20,185
For Celine...

269
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,189
.. $500.

270
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,814
All right. Let's see what you got.

271
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:31,023
I have some powder already prepared.

272
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:48,091
<i>You like it, blanc, huh? It is beautiful.</i>

273
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,053
<i>Come in.</i>

274
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:56,266
With this powder,
you must be very careful.

275
00:32:56,393 --> 00:33:00,889
I make it so there is no second chance.

276
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,939
$500, huh?

277
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,235
How do we know it works?

278
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,856
- You want proof?
- Yeah.

279
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:18,655
<i>Marie!</i>

280
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:29,546
Don't worry. You have enough
for ten zombies, huh?

281
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,641
Yes.

282
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,870
You are very beautiful.

283
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,454
Are you looking for work?

284
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:08,456
He may keep you better,
but I will love you longer.

285
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:15,301
<i>So you see, blanc?
No second chance. So, the money?</i>

286
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,431
The money?

287
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:21,935
That you get tomorrow, when I see
you raise the goat from the dead.

288
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:27,099
I wanna see the goat alive again.
Zombies, remember?

289
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:34,440
<i>It's too dangerous to wait at the hotel,
so we lose ourselves in the pilgrimage.</i>

290
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,698
<i>And though I came for the powder,...</i>

291
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,662
<i>.. I'm getting into
something much, much more.</i>

292
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:44,949
You know, I still have a hard time
putting you and all that stuff together.

293
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:49,213
<i>I was brought up in the faith.
My father was a houngan.</i>

294
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,961
I was dedicated to Erzulie at four.

295
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,543
First ridden - possessed,
if you will - at eight.

296
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:01,768
- There is beauty and compassion in it.
- Oh, yeah, I can understand that.

297
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:05,179
- But you're a psychiatrist first.
- There is no conflict...

298
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:07,556
.. between my science and my faith.

299
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:10,645
You can give it whatever words
you will, but in Haiti,...

300
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:13,026
.. our God is not just in His heaven.

301
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:16,440
He's in our bodies, our flesh.

302
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,739
There's something you should see.

303
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:33,714
What is this ceremony?
Voodoo or Catholic?

304
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:38,760
Haiti is 85% Catholic, but 110% voodoo.

305
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:43,047
For us, Erzulie and the Virgin Mary
are the same.

306
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,809
<i>Blanc.</i>

307
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,941
<i>Blanc.</i>

308
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,866
<i>Blanc.</i>

309
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:52,597
Are you all right, Dennis?

310
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:57,927
Yeah. It was just a dream.
I had a bad dream.

311
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,510
<i>She tells me this is
one of the cathedrals of Haiti.</i>

312
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:33,256
<i>A place not only of great beauty,
but of great spirit as well.</i>

313
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:37,218
<i>And maybe the place is magic.</i>

314
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,138
These waters are healing.

315
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,016
<i>WWBC in Miami reporting.
The word is official now.</i>

316
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:43,470
<i>Responding to months
of demonstrations,...</i>

317
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:48,148
<i>.. the Duvalier government in Haiti
has declared martial law.</i>

318
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:52,357
<i>Police and military units have imposed
a strict curfew from sundown to sunup...</i>

319
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:56,736
<i>It was crazy. One minute
to be in such beauty and peace,...</i>

320
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,783
<i>.. the next surrounded by secret police,
the Tontons Macoutes.</i>

321
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,322
<i>Strangest of all,
in the middle of all this,...</i>

322
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:07,077
<i>.. I couldn't get my mind off
the zombie, Christophe.</i>

323
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:09,703
<i>Why would they do such a thing to him?</i>

324
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,509
<i>Why would they make
anybody a zombie?</i>

325
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,338
Christophe was more than a patient
to you. You knew him before.

326
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:21,430
No, but I knew of him. He was just a
grade-school teacher. No one important.

327
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,265
But he wasn't afraid
to speak out for freedom.

328
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:27,932
He was very much admired.
That's why they made him what he is.

329
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:31,981
Instead of inspiring courage,
now he only inspires fear.

330
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,406
Doctor Alan. Come with me, please.

331
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:42,905
- Doctor Alan, come with me now.
- All right, just take it easy.

332
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,787
I'll be all right.

333
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,866
Ah, Dr Alan.

334
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,996
- That's right.
- Why are you in Haiti, Dr Alan?

335
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,713
Like it says there on the passport,
I'm a tourist. I came to see the sights.

336
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:39,007
Yes, happy, happy, happy island people.

337
00:44:39,138 --> 00:44:41,344
Then why visit an insane asylum?

338
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,638
I'm an anthropologist.

339
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,057
It's a tax write-off.

340
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:50,058
I hope you're not with the IRS.

341
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,732
Did you know this woman,
Marielle Duchamp, is a radical?

342
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,606
So was her father.

343
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,741
He was... misplaced.

344
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,744
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

345
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:10,744
So is this man... Christophe Durand.

346
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:20,760
- Christophe who?
- The man you met in the graveyard.

347
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:24,422
Graveyard?

348
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:27,808
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

349
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:31,140
You're not a very good liar, Dr Alan.

350
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,355
Look, I'm a tourist.

351
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,571
I haven't done anything wrong.

352
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,021
Do you mind if I go now?

353
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:54,953
This country lives on the edge, Dr Alan.

354
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:00,338
One weakness in the wrong place and
over it goes, back into slavery again,...

355
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:02,711
- .. just like with the French.
- I'm not...

356
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:07,923
The United States would like
anarchy here, I'm sure.

357
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:12,011
Well, this isn't Grenada, Dr Alan.

358
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,354
I'm here now.

359
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:19,687
There are people like me
who'd make sure that doesn't happen.

360
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,405
You remember that.

361
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:59,687
You don't have to prove anything. It
wasn't a note slipped under the door.

362
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,821
- We'd better wait another day.
- We haven't got another day.

363
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:04,739
If we're outta the city, we're OK.

364
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,870
Come, come, come, come. Come.

365
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:19,414
We are celebrating my success!
This good fortune, huh?

366
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,215
- So, how's the goat?
- Oh, business before pleasure, huh?

367
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:27,385
The American way, no?

368
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:33,178
You saw it die yourself, but it walks.

369
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,856
Nice animal.

370
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,528
You like him?
I throw him in, no charge, huh?

371
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:52,952
Americans.

372
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,415
The money for the powder,
as we agreed.

373
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,884
You see? Even in America,
they know me.

374
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,096
They come for my work.

375
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,901
You're an idiot.

376
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:33,323
<i>My powders work. Maybe
I cast a spell on you.</i>

377
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,125
You wanna know what
I think of your powders?

378
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:54,092
<i>Careful, blanc. No second chance.</i>

379
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,599
Dennis!

380
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:07,235
It's piss.

381
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,738
You're a dead man.

382
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:24,297
Dennis, just what do you think
you were doing in there?

383
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:28,919
We gotta stall him for a little time.
What do you know about radiator caps?

384
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:31,888
What is it? Some macho death wish?

385
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,965
My God, what if it had been poison?

386
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,718
It was. Rat poison, probably.

387
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:42,057
Give me your hand. See your palm?

388
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:46,276
See the coin? And...

389
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:49,686
.. poof! Oh!

390
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:53,781
See the poison he really gave me?

391
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,195
Tricks of the trade.

392
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,453
Here he comes.

393
00:49:58,582 --> 00:50:00,621
Wait in the car.

394
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,878
You are still alive.

395
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:10,048
Yeah, I noticed.

396
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:15,261
I can make you it. The powder you want.

397
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:20,977
<i>No tricks this time, blanc. $1,000.
The zombie poison. The coup poudre.</i>

398
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:24,556
- All right.
- But there are rules.

399
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:27,147
You must make it with me.

400
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,021
There is no other way.

401
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:50,049
A strong work. Fresh bones. Quickly.

402
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,300
We work here.

403
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,550
You start.

404
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:03,054
Don't worry, they never
bury them deep here.

405
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:05,975
That is why I use this place.

406
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:13,773
- This isn't a kid, is it?
- No, no, this is not a child.

407
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,990
No, no, no.

408
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:28,326
A real prize, this one.

409
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,045
A sorceress.

410
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,630
When she lived, she had great power.

411
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:40,013
Now... she is just easier to carry.

412
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:53,234
Dennis?

413
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,701
- It stinks.
- We will start tomorrow night.

414
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,663
- Now, we get out of here.
- Let's go.

415
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:15,670
I think I still have
some of my father's old shirts.

416
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:18,638
- Maybe one will fit you.
- This shirt's fine.

417
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,803
No, it isn't.

418
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:25,681
Oh! No! No!

419
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:31,230
Get in the jeep.

420
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,185
Dennis!

421
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:07,391
You've got a pretty face.

422
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,812
The girls must like it.

423
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,983
Do you like it?

424
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:20,740
Your pretty white face?

425
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:24,447
I asked you a question.

426
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:29,952
Yeah... I like it.

427
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:34,539
I like it too.

428
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:48,974
I leave the face.

429
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,734
You made your point.

430
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:01,814
I'm on the next plane. I swear.

431
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:06,035
It's not good enough now. It's too late.

432
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:09,078
You were warned.

433
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,748
I warned you.

434
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:16,373
I'm a US citizen. Think about that.

435
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:20,090
I don't see the ambassador here.
Do you?

436
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:25,427
I'm in medical research.

437
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:29,175
There's a lot of money in it.
There's plenty for you.

438
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,351
I don't want money.

439
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,222
Yeah? What do you want?

440
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:37,854
I wanna hear you scream.

441
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:47,949
Oh, no. OK.

442
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:50,743
OK, OK.

443
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:54,247
You wanna hear me scream? I'll scream.

444
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,465
Again.

445
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:08,214
Not good enough.

446
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,702
Dennis!

447
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:55,514
<i>For three days, Marielle
has been my guardian angel,...</i>

448
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,648
<i>.. hiding me, nursing me back to health.</i>

449
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:02,858
<i>The wound Peytraud inflicted
was struck for fear, not injury.</i>

450
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:05,396
<i>I'm alive, intact.</i>

451
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:10,115
<i>She told me this morning that
she wants me to go before they kill me.</i>

452
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,285
<i>But I can't do that.</i>

453
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:14,747
Agh!

454
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:18,042
You shouldn't be out here.
You shouldn't even be walking.

455
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:23,591
Hey, this recipe took a thousand years
to get right. I wanna learn it.

456
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,258
- Oh.
- Rest.

457
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:33,343
He just went through the scrotum, right?
A little pain, a little terror.

458
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,519
He scared me, OK?

459
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:47,781
<i>The ingredients of the powder
are terrifically varied.</i>

460
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:50,660
<i>There is the poisonous sea toad,
Bufo marinus,...</i>

461
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:53,359
<i>.. the same animal
Lucrezia Borgia used,...</i>

462
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:57,495
<i>.. made even more toxic by frightening it
with a stinging sea worm.</i>

463
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:02,039
<i>And the puffer fish, which produces
one of nature's most powerful poisons,...</i>

464
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:03,916
<i>.. tetrodotoxin.</i>

465
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:06,967
<i>Plus a whole pharmacy
of herbs, minerals,...</i>

466
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:11,341
<i>.. charred, then ground and mixed
with a skill that's astonishing.</i>

467
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:16,349
<i>All this is woven together with a net
of magic beyond anything we know.</i>

468
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,316
<i>The process will take
three days and nights.</i>

469
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:34,986
<i>Already there is no doubt in my mind
that for all his joking,...</i>

470
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:38,870
<i>.. Mozart could give any Harvard PhD
a run for his money.</i>

471
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:47,085
<i>You cannot eat the powder
in food. That would kill completely.</i>

472
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,969
The flesh would never rise to serve you.

473
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:12,106
Squeeze. The bones
are brittle. It will come.

474
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:19,705
This is the last. Soon, it is done.

475
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,457
A good work.

476
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:30,758
<i>It is a very frightening thing, blanc.</i>

477
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:33,721
The first time,
you can't tell good from bad.

478
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:39,892
Then, after a while, it is
the very thing that sets you free.

479
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:47,768
It must be buried with her
for one more day.

480
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:59,200
<i>You want this enemy of yours pretty
badly, to go through such pains, blanc.</i>

481
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,581
I'm all right.

482
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,626
- Did he take your woman or money?
- No.

483
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:08,798
Then why would you stand up
to a crazy man like Peytraud?

484
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:12,628
Oh, yes. I hear these things.

485
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:20,131
The poison's not for him.

486
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:22,308
The poison's for nobody.

487
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:29,308
I wanna use the poison for good,
to... help people who are sick.

488
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:37,492
My poison can be used
in such a way, huh?

489
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,821
Yeah, I think so.

490
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:44,626
I think it can be known
all over the world.

491
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:49,544
You will tell them about me? You will
tell them the name of Louis Mozart...

492
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:52,959
.. and they will know
my work all over the world, huh?

493
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:59,471
<i>All right, blanc. Come back in 24 hours
and you will have your powder.</i>

494
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:07,721
<i>24 hours usually doesn't seem
like such a long time.</i>

495
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:11,606
<i>In more relaxed times,
I've felt a day go by like an hour.</i>

496
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:13,943
<i>But, as sweet as Marielle was,...</i>

497
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:17,572
<i>.. the day and night at the beach house
lasted a lifetime.</i>

498
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:03,866
<i>Dennis.</i>

499
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,955
Get outta here!

500
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:37,694
<i>Dr Alan?</i>

501
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:46,995
No!

502
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,036
No!

503
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,391
Agh!

504
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:32,293
<i>Marielle. Marielle.</i>

505
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:35,254
We gotta get outta here.

506
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:03,189
Not this time, Doctor,
we're beyond that now.

507
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:26,092
<i>These canari hold the souls of those who
were masters in the realm of the spirits.</i>

508
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,970
Now their spirits serve me.

509
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,770
She knows I'm telling the truth,
that such things are possible.

510
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:37,899
I know the price you will pay
for what you have done.

511
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:41,562
The photographs we took today
are quite convincing.

512
01:03:41,864 --> 01:03:46,324
If you return, you'll be tried for
the murder of Christophe's sister.

513
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:50,912
The courts will take your life,
but that will be only the beginning.

514
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:54,662
After you're dead,...

515
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:56,702
.. I'll take your soul.

516
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:03,003
What'll happen to Marielle?

517
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:06,089
You go home.

518
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:09,714
She's home. She's Haitian.

519
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:13,053
I have no reason to hurt her
once you're gone.

520
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:17,021
Just... leave, Dennis.

521
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:20,689
It is the only way.

522
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:29,577
By the way, Dr Alan, what did you
dream about this afternoon?

523
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:34,160
The woman in your arms?
The sea at your doorstep?

524
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:36,663
No.

525
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:42,246
You dreamt of me and of the grave.
I know because I was there.

526
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:45,752
And I can be there
every time you close your eyes.

527
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:48,970
The pain I caused you
in the room upstairs...

528
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:53,516
.. is nothing to the pain
I can cause in your own mind.

529
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:57,230
Remember that, Dr Alan.

530
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,700
You promised me $1,000.

531
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:53,862
Did you forget your promise?

532
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:02,245
No, I haven't got it.

533
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:04,419
They took all my money.

534
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,213
Well,...

535
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:14,214
.. take it anyway.

536
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:17,101
<i>But you will tell them about me, blanc.</i>

537
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:20,385
You will make them know my name.

538
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:23,771
I will.

539
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:27,401
I'll let 'em know
you're a man to be trusted.

540
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:35,863
On account, huh?

541
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,078
Fair enough.

542
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,486
- You used baboon?
- I put the powder in the palms.

543
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:11,566
It went into the blood.
20 minutes later they were dead.

544
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:13,987
Or at least, they looked dead.

545
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:16,359
My God, are these numbers accurate?

546
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:18,322
- Oh, yeah.
- The shift seems radical.

547
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:23,829
It's triple-checked. These are
typical brain scans from our sub jects.

548
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:27,495
It's very focused. It targets
only certain areas of the brain.

549
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:31,498
Air and vital functions:
breathing, heart rate.

550
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:34,256
Looks like somebody
turned it off with a switch.

551
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:39,465
But in the areas controlling sensory
awareness, thoughts and emotions...

552
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,218
.. bang.

553
01:07:42,354 --> 01:07:44,810
So the animals know
what's happening to them?

554
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,523
Yeah, the entire time. A man would, too.

555
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:53,528
You'd hear, see, maybe even feel, think.

556
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:57,607
But you couldn't do anything about it.
You'd just lie there, lookin'...

557
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,698
Dead... and be buried.

558
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:04,163
But you'd be alive.

559
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,373
<i>And, I reminded myself,
the tests revealed the powder wore off...</i>

560
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:14,002
<i>.. after 12 hours or so, leaving
the victim completely normal again.</i>

561
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:17,303
<i>Except by then he'd be
six feet under in the airless black,...</i>

562
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:20,716
<i>.. clawing and screaming,
with no one to hear his suffocation.</i>

563
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:22,890
Thanks.

564
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:28,148
<i>It's incredible
how rumour's spreading.</i>

565
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:31,893
It's unbelievable. The company stock
closed up a point and a half today.

566
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,024
All based on rumour about
what Dennis brought back.

567
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:38,111
- Thank you, darling.
- I'm just glad you got out all right.

568
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:41,161
The news says
the whole country is in turmoil.

569
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:43,865
Yeah, I guess it is.

570
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,658
We're kickin' around
a name for the product.

571
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:51,455
I can't believe I employ people who
wanna call an anaesthetic "Zombanol".

572
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:53,883
I mean...

573
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:56,417
It's... really good.

574
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,801
I gotta get some air. I'm sorry.

575
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,722
Excuse me for a moment.

576
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:07,644
I'm sorry.

577
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:11,773
We need to talk.

578
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:17,030
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

579
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:20,111
I've been trying to call
for three days. There's no answer.

580
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:23,577
- She could be away.
- Yeah. She could be in trouble, too.

581
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:26,623
- I gotta go back there.
- Listen to me.

582
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:31,709
There's a door to the mystical,
and you've just walked through it.

583
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:36,584
Right now, you are very vulnerable.
I wouldn't go back to Haiti now.

584
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:40,799
You'd be a grade-school boy
in a world of Nobel Prize winners.

585
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:44,051
I'd stay as far away
from Haiti as I could.

586
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:08,367
What you have done is a major
breakthrough. It's quite mind-boggling.

587
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:13,712
The only thing I don't understand
is how did Christophe Durand survive?

588
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,915
How was he able to speak?

589
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:18,342
Alex?

590
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:23,545
Well, as far as we can tell,
somehow, I don't know how,...

591
01:10:23,682 --> 01:10:27,929
.. someone dug him outta the grave
so no brain damage occurred.

592
01:10:40,032 --> 01:10:43,033
Is something wrong with your soup?

593
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:48,788
No. No, it's all right, I...

594
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,701
- .. I'm not hungry.
- Albert?

595
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:55,661
Dr Alan is finished with his soup.

596
01:10:57,591 --> 01:10:59,963
Perhaps monsieur would like
some salad instead?

597
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:02,501
No, I, uh...

598
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:05,555
.. I've been having
some stomach problems.

599
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:10,060
Occupational hazard -
dysentery, botfly, malaria.

600
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,680
A toast? A toast?

601
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:17,977
To Dennis,...

602
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:21,812
.. to his adventures,
and to this marvellous discovery.

603
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:27,489
He rang to a... a new...

604
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:31,122
- .. to a new...
- Debra? Sit down, Debra.

605
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:53,808
<i>You're going to die.
You've been warned. You're going to die.</i>

606
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:58,853
<i>Debra, Debra.</i>

607
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:34,134
<i>He's gonna get to me,
wherever I am. I know that now.</i>

608
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:36,940
<i>I've stolen his darkest
and most powerful secret.</i>

609
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:41,395
<i>He'll want to get even and if he can't
get me, he'll go for Marielle.</i>

610
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:46,940
Hey, I'm a US citizen!

611
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:49,157
I'm a US citizen! Somebody!

612
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:57,157
Hey, somebody!

613
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,837
Lucien.

614
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:07,210
<i>Lucien snatched me from
under the nose of the Tontons Macoutes.</i>

615
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:14,432
<i>Marielle was safe. She was guarded
by his men at her clinic, he said.</i>

616
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,554
<i>But for Mozart and me,
it was a different matter.</i>

617
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,531
This will give you
some protection, that's all.

618
01:13:32,663 --> 01:13:36,032
Just like your scientific objectivity.

619
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:41,955
In this country, I haven't felt
protected by anything.

620
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:44,959
<i>You don't know what
hasn't gotten to you.</i>

621
01:13:48,137 --> 01:13:50,462
I'm not afraid for myself.

622
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:53,267
A good thing. Up.

623
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:09,487
Remember, when the battle comes,
it won't be fought in the streets.

624
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:12,902
It will be fought
in your mind, in your soul.

625
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:18,241
Marielle was right. This must end.

626
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:22,708
These people, Peytraud, Duvalier...

627
01:14:23,755 --> 01:14:26,840
They're not Haiti, they are mad dogs.

628
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:29,757
The madness must stop.

629
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:35,306
You're makin' a mistake. The president
and me, we are like this... like this.

630
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:49,776
Something's wrong, isn't it?

631
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:03,877
We are in our spirits' hands now,
you and I.

632
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:08,714
Remember, whatever happens,...

633
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:11,751
.. death is not the end.

634
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,718
<i>Lucien.</i>

635
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:39,612
Oh, fuck.

636
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,181
Help me. Please, help me.

637
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:09,357
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

638
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:59,700
Don't... don't let them bury me.

639
01:17:00,454 --> 01:17:02,945
I'm not dead.

640
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:20,388
Anything? Pressure? Pulse?

641
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:22,555
Nothing.

642
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:27,977
We've lost him.

643
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:33,398
Write the time on the tag.

644
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:38,948
- We'll notify the embassy tomorrow.
- No need for that, Doctor.

645
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:41,781
I've made all the arrangements.

646
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,079
Whatever.

647
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:53,463
He's dead. I trust somebody on your end
will take care of the proper paperwork?

648
01:17:57,553 --> 01:18:01,135
No, no, no. No rest.

649
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:05,348
You'll see it all. You'll feel it.

650
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:08,431
The cold in the coffin,...

651
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:13,107
.. it is worse... much, much worse.

652
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:32,038
<i>Lucien Celine, the great houngan...
He serves me now, too.</i>

653
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:35,997
Lucien can't protect you.
I hold him fast!

654
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:39,509
Lucien will turn your blood to worms.

655
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:42,673
<i>Oh, yeah? Do you hear me, blanc?</i>

656
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:45,594
Her head will be taken
as an offering tonight.

657
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:48,051
No, wait.

658
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:59,186
To keep you company.

659
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:57,871
<i>When you wake up,
scream, Dr Alan. Scream all you want.</i>

660
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:00,462
There is no escape from the grave.

661
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:43,875
Ohh! Oh, God.

662
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:02,565
<i>Here!</i>

663
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:09,569
Here! Here!

664
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:13,113
Agh! Agh!

665
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:15,701
Oh, God.

666
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:33,431
You're alive.

667
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,142
You're alive.

668
01:21:49,827 --> 01:21:52,033
I know it's bad, the poison.

669
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:54,826
You see things the living can't see.

670
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:24,193
<i>This is WWBC in Miami reporting.</i>

671
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:26,354
<i>We've just received word from Haiti...</i>

672
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:29,857
<i>.. that "Baby Doc" Duvalier,
his wife Michelle and his family...</i>

673
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:31,865
<i>.. are en route to the airport.</i>

674
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:34,319
<i>It's happening in the middle
of the night,...</i>

675
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:37,028
<i>.. and no one knows
what it means for sure.</i>

676
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:42,331
<i>It is confirmed now
the Duvaliers are fleeing.</i>

677
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:46,246
<i>The scene at the airport
was one of barely controlled panic.</i>

678
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:52,388
<i>Word is that revolution
is sweeping the country,...</i>

679
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:56,346
<i>.. as news reaches
the smaller towns and villages.</i>

680
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:51,526
<i>Liberté! Liberté!</i>

681
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:59,325
<i>- Liberté!
- Where is your power now?</i>

682
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:02,790
<i>The loas themselves
are having their vengeance.</i>

683
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,746
<i>Liberté! Liberté! Liberté!</i>

684
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:51,622
Your soul is mine.

685
01:24:55,387 --> 01:25:00,382
Get up, Dr Alan.
I control your thoughts now.

686
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:02,557
Get up!

687
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:52,854
<i>Dennis! Dennis!</i>

688
01:25:53,946 --> 01:25:55,737
Help me.

689
01:25:57,741 --> 01:25:59,947
- Marielle.
- Help me.

690
01:26:00,536 --> 01:26:02,908
- Help me.
- Marielle.

691
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,207
Help me.

692
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,920
Dennis.

693
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:17,382
It's your fault.

694
01:26:17,678 --> 01:26:21,675
- It was your work...
- It was your work...

695
01:26:21,807 --> 01:26:27,726
- .. that caused this.
- It was your work that caused this.

696
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:30,522
Argh!

697
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:32,732
Argh!

698
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:22,148
Argh!

699
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:49,682
Peytraud?

700
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:23,007
Peytraud.

701
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:26,302
<i>Dennis?</i>

702
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:50,620
Argh!

703
01:28:51,707 --> 01:28:54,032
Argh!

704
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:58,245
Peytraud.

705
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:04,833
- No.
- Help us, Lucien, please!

706
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:05,919
No!

707
01:30:57,583 --> 01:31:01,711
Hold on a second. I'm not gonna
leave that thing in one piece.

708
01:31:22,274 --> 01:31:23,852
No rest for you!

709
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:27,062
<i>No rest for you, blanc!</i>

710
01:31:27,196 --> 01:31:29,235
You're coming with me!

711
01:31:30,616 --> 01:31:32,822
You're coming with me to hell!

712
01:31:35,996 --> 01:31:38,665
Son of a bitch!

713
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:42,201
I'm tired of this shit.

714
01:32:15,077 --> 01:32:19,240
- What do you want?
- I wanna hear you scream.

715
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:27,744
No!

716
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:28,912
Yes.

717
01:32:50,404 --> 01:32:51,815
Den?

718
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:53,812
Are you all right?

719
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:59,619
<i>- Liberté! Liberté! Liberté!
