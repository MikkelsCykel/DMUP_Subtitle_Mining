<i>Long ago, the Duke of Milan</i>
<i>commissioned a little-known artist...</i>

2
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,632
<i>to erect a mammoth statue</i>
<i>of a horse.</i>

3
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,801
<i>The time was 1481.</i>

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,505
<i>The artist was Leonardo da Vinci.</i>

5
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,182
<i>The guy on the donkey</i>
<i>is just a guy on a donkey.</i>

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,984
<i>Anyway, they called this statue</i>
<i>the</i> "Sforza"...

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,891
<i>and it was going to be</i>
<i>the largest bronze statue ever built.</i>

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,019
<i>But wouldn't you know it?</i>

9
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:07,089
<i>War broke out,</i>
<i>and bronze became scarce...</i>

10
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,659
<i>so da Vinci decided</i>
<i>to create a machine...</i>

11
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,468
<i>to change common lead</i>
<i>into bronze.</i>

12
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,477
<i>But when da Vinci finally turned</i>
<i>this machine on...</i>

13
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,879
<i>it was to give him something</i>
<i>more than he expected.</i>

14
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,248
<i>Something much more than bronze.</i>

15
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,812
Leonardo!

16
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,652
- Gold?
- Gold.

17
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,037
<i>Exactly 500 years later...</i>

18
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,839
<i>an artiste of a different field...</i>

19
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,812
<i>the one of cat burglary...</i>

20
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,782
<i>was getting out of Sing Sing.</i>

21
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:30,154
<i>He was known as the Hudson Hawk.</i>

22
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:30,256
Got a coat, hat.

23
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,123
Got a coat, hat.

24
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,752
Here's your personal items.

25
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,921
Here's your wallet.

26
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,262
You'll find everything in there.
Want your receipt?

27
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,932
Keep it. Ready?

28
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,698
I got it, Charlie.

29
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,603
Eddie! Eddie!

30
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,608
So the Hudson Hawk is getting out!

31
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,167
Remember all the reporters here
when you came in?

32
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,080
"World's Greatest Cat Burglar."
Now who gives a fuck?

33
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,278
- Got a proposition.
- Answer's no, Gates, even if you bathe.

34
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,322
As your parole officer,
I found you a job.

35
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,949
- No way.
- It's a terrific job.

36
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,017
An auction house.
One night's work, and you're free.

37
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,428
No checking in with a shrink,
no community service.

38
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,867
But I want to do community service,
to teach a handicapped to yodel.

39
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,928
I ain't stealing no more, Gates.

40
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,474
Ten years later, you're still
impressed with yourself.

41
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,103
Same old coat, same old hat.
You're extinct, Hawk.

42
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,204
From you that's a powerful statement.

43
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,476
Aren't you supposed
to stop me committing crimes?

44
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,383
"Book 'em, Danno,"
"Give a hoot, don't pollute"?

45
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,943
You ain't out yet.

46
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,014
I can set you up and send you back
anytime I want.

47
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,858
It's a very fine line
between ex- con and escaped con.

48
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,460
Gates, do it yourself.

49
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,996
Hey, he's got my key!
I'll be seeing you, Hawk.

50
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,238
Open the gate.

51
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,714
- See you around, Mike.
- Take it easy, Eddie.

52
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,498
That's the first thing I did,
smooch the ground and taste the freedom.

53
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,703
Sorry I'm late.
I miss anything?

54
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,747
As always, your timing is impeccable.

55
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,612
- Where's the kiss?
- Get away from me.

56
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,211
No tongue. I promise.

57
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,285
- Whoa!
- What?

58
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,858
- You've been expanding your...
- Don't say it!

59
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,094
I'm sensitive about my figure.

60
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,794
My next word
was gonna be consciousness...

61
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,597
Tubbo.

62
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,909
You're free, you son of a bitch!

63
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,708
What do you want to do? Statue
of Liberty? Entertain some ladies?

64
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,151
Broadway tix? Seduce women?

65
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,622
Play Nintendo?
Bone some chicks?

66
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,960
What's Nintendo?

67
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,125
Get me to the Five Tone. I'll strangle
somebody if I don't get a cappuccino.

68
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,464
You still got a thing for
those unmasculine European coffees?

69
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,061
- What can I say?
- Who's your buddy?

70
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:37,735
The man knows! The man knows!

71
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,143
Mr. Coffee, have any trouble
checking out?

72
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,445
Not much. Gates tried to blackmail me
into doing a job.

73
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,816
That doughnut-hole-e<ating
son of a bitch!

74
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,981
Take-it-in-the-ear-for-a-beer
rat bastard!

75
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,355
Had the perfect amount of foam.

76
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,361
I'll get you ten of them at the bar.

77
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,920
Gates wants you to rob
an auction house?

78
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,331
- Yes. Are you going deaf?
- He's your parole officer.

79
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,497
- Look, I am not going deaf.
- Just get me in the Five Tone.

80
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:10,702
All right. I am not deaf.
Don't make fun of my hearing.

81
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,677
Tell you something about the bar.
You're going to love it.

82
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,613
Five Tone Bar and Grill.

83
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,116
At least there's one thing
that will never cha...

84
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,012
I don't know how to tell you this.
Couple of brokers stopped in.

85
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,025
Now we're a ni<i>ce,</i> local bar
that none of the locals can afford.

86
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,155
I read about these people in <i>Newsweek.</i>

87
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,996
- Where's the regulars? Crazy Jack Cava?
- Gone.

88
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,763
- Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?
- Gone.

89
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,601
Tommy, you took down
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

90
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,698
They're all gone.

91
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,905
But look at the bright side.
Half this joint is yours.

92
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,846
Blackjack, give my irritable partner
a cappuccino.

93
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,042
I gotta go be a boss.

94
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,151
Reindeer goat cheese pizza?

95
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,349
Thank you, Jesus.

96
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,411
Cute shot.

97
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:31,081
Cesar Mario. Antony Mario.
I didn't know the circus was in town.

98
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,591
So, why won't you do
the auction house?

99
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,253
Well, call me superstitious, Cesar.

100
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,422
I don't like to commit a crime
the day I get out of the joint.

101
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,830
It's very simple.

102
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,598
There's a safe on the seventh floor.
You put their thing in this thing.

103
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,639
Directions even your brother
could understand.

104
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,868
Yeah, directions
even I could understand.

105
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,603
Shut up.

106
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,269
You're the best.

107
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,781
You're the only one who can do this.
You know that.

108
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,149
Don't tell me you want to open a store,
go straight and sell spatulas.

109
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,589
If the Mario brothers weren't New
Jersey's third-largest crime family...

110
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,592
I'd say "Kiss my ass."

111
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,629
But considering your status,
I will say "Slurp my butt."

112
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,095
- Sit.
- Sit.

113
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,292
Have you lovely ladies tried
our house wine? I think you'll enjoy.

114
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,894
Beat it, Tommy.
No dinosaurs allowed.

115
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,404
Enough!

116
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,277
You don't do that auction house job,
I'll put you on trial.

117
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:32,249
And I promise you, my friend,
there will be no bail. Understand?

118
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,649
Get him outta here.

119
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,830
"Witchcraft"?

120
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,373
Three minutes, 57 seconds.

121
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,205
- "Night and Day"?
- Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald?

122
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,973
- Sinatra!
- Five minutes, 12 seconds.

123
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,638
"Hit the Road, Jack"?

124
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,843
- Where are my needle-nose pliers?
- Check the bar.

125
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,251
- "Hit the Road, Jack"?
- Five minutes, 15 seconds.

126
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:15,816
How could you take this down?
Captain Bob's steering wheel.

127
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:20,127
Remember that night he came in?
Nobody could figure where he got this.

128
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,962
- Yes?
- Quiet.

129
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,695
Come here.

130
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,465
We got a nasty safe
on the seventh floor.

131
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,530
- Simpson?
- Yeah.

132
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,075
- What's the mechanism?
- Seventy-one.

133
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,304
Last time Simpson only made a 40.

134
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,712
It's gonna take you
another 31 seconds.

135
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,909
- I'm not worried about the safe.
- I know.

136
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,215
We know any of the guards? Not one?

137
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,222
- Not one.
- What about video surveillance?

138
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,588
- I have a plan.
- You got a plan.

139
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,594
I have a great plan. Great!

140
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,559
What the hell am I doing?

141
00:13:54,633 --> 00:14:00,230
Huh? I'm getting ready to do some crime,
rob some <i>farchadat</i> horse with you?

142
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:05,209
I should be looking in the want ads
for a job selling spatulas.

143
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:09,873
We're moving too fast.
I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.

144
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,318
- What is that?
- That's five seconds. My record's 18.

145
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,550
Is this funny? You think this is
some kind of fucking joke?

146
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,808
- How many seconds?
- How many what seconds?

147
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,367
On the thumbcuffs.

148
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,881
Not counting the bitching and whining,
I'll be nice and say eight.

149
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,281
They're not going to let you
walk away from this job.

150
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,152
I ain't never gonna get
rehabilitated this way.

151
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,455
- You still got it?
- Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

152
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,997
- "Mack the Knife"?
- Four minutes, 17 seconds.

153
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,124
"I Only Have Eyes for You"?

154
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,965
I didn't know you cared.
Three minutes, 22 seconds.

155
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,699
- "Xanadu"?
- "Xanadu"?

156
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,707
Four minutes, 19 seconds.

157
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,972
"Star-Spangled Banner"?
Whitney Houston, Super Bowl 17.

158
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,603
Hi. How you doing?

159
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,808
- Seven minutes, 17 seconds.
- You're full of shit!

160
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,319
Let me ask you something. How come
I'm not out trying to get laid tonight?

161
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,652
You're bumming my high. It's show time!

162
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,256
Tommy, hold on.
Hold on a minute.

163
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,761
The sign says "No horseplay
in the pool area."

164
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,957
This isn't horseplay.
This is a major felony.

165
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,455
Come on, Grandpa.

166
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,197
Tommy, can you give me one good reason
why we're up here?

167
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,232
I'll give you two.
Antony and Cesar Mario.

168
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,837
- You don't really think they'd...
- Cut off our balls if we don't do this.

169
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,347
I see.

170
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,349
- You have dinner tonight?
- Why?

171
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,977
'Cause this rope only holds 900 pounds!

172
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,987
Stop fooling around!

173
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,319
- I'm not fooling around!
- You are!

174
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,359
Pick me up, pick me up.

175
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,155
All right!

176
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,026
I wish you'd lay off the pasta.

177
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,838
Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

178
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,967
Covering our tracks.
We leave through the basement.

179
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,774
Now we have no choice, do we?

180
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,255
What?

181
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,258
Better make the hole bigger.

182
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,386
Don't worry, bonehead.
I'm wearing my girdle.

183
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,556
Six hundred seventy-three Wongs
in the phone book.

184
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,530
Hell of a lot of Wong numbers.

185
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,395
Look up Chin.

186
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,910
- That's it.
- You got a key?

187
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,679
Just checking.

188
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,804
They record everything
the video surveillance takes in.

189
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,506
Yes, I can see that, master thief.
You said something about a plan.

190
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,947
Am I boring you, smart-ass?

191
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,780
Jerry, check out Big Stan.

192
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,285
Watch this.

193
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,027
<i>Big Stan!</i>

194
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:00,797
Watch. A little rewind and replay
and the guards will be watching a rerun.

195
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,569
They're going to miss out
on tonight's exciting episode.

196
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,839
You figure this out all by yourself?
Good plan, Junior.

197
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,312
We got about five minutes
and change.

198
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,215
5:32. "Swinging on a Star.''

199
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,685
They invented something while
you were inside. It's called a watch.

200
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,278
- Tommy.
- What?

201
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,094
One. Two.

202
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,652
One. Two. Three.

203
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,222
<i>Would you like to swing on a star</i>

204
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,201
<i>Carry moonbeams home in a jar</i>

205
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,762
<i>And be better off than you are</i>

206
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,332
O<i>r would you rather be a mule</i>

207
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,277
<i>A mule is an animal</i>
<i>with long, funny ears</i>

208
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,544
<i>He kicks up at anything he hears</i>

209
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,117
<i>His back is brawny</i>
<i>and his brain is weak</i>

210
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,158
<i>He's just plain stupid</i>
<i>with a stubborn streak</i>

211
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,717
<i>And by the way</i>
<i>if you hate to go to school</i>

212
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,397
<i>You may grow up to be a mule</i>

213
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,901
O<i>r would you like</i>
<i>to swing on a star</i>

214
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,437
<i>Carry moonbeams home in a jar</i>

215
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,870
They're back on.

216
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,603
<i>And be better off than you are</i>

217
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,246
<i>Or would you rather be a fish</i>

218
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,647
<i>A fish is an animal</i>
<i>that swims in a brook</i>

219
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,016
<i>He can't write his name</i>
<i>or read a book</i>

220
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,148
<i>To fool the people</i>
<i>is his only thought</i>

221
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,251
<i>And though he's slippery</i>
<i>he still gets caught</i>

222
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,161
<i>If that sort of life</i>
<i>is what you wish</i>

223
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,926
<i>You may grow up to be a fish</i>

224
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,799
<i>Or would you like</i>
<i>to swing on a star</i>

225
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,431
<i>Carry moonbeams home in a jar</i>

226
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,238
<i>And be better off than you are</i>

227
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,513
<i>Or would you rather be a pig</i>

228
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,678
<i>A pig is an animal</i>
<i>with dirt on its face</i>

229
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,586
<i>His shoes are a terrible disgrace</i>

230
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,759
<i>He's got no manners</i>
<i>when he eats his food</i>

231
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,921
<i>He's fat and lazy</i>
<i>and extremely rude</i>

232
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,591
<i>But if you don't care</i>
<i>a feather or a fig</i>

233
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,928
<i>You may grow up to be a pig</i>

234
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,337
<i>And all the monkeys</i>
<i>aren't in the zoo</i>

235
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,467
<i>Every day you see quite a few</i>

236
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,212
<i>So you see</i>
<i>it's all up to you</i>

237
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,147
<i>You could be better than you are</i>

238
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,946
- <i>You could be swinging on a star</i>
- Got the horse?

239
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:34,015
- Just out of jail and I'm robbing.
- Let's go.

240
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,487
Dean, I don't get it.

241
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,895
I see the blue chair
in the auction room.

242
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,696
I didn't want to do it.
All I wanted was a cappuccino.

243
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:44,861
Snap out of it!

244
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,666
You think that's strange,
check out screen two.

245
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,172
That's us!

246
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,801
Somebody rewired the recorders!

247
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,971
- I hold you responsible.
- Let's take it home!

248
00:21:56,048 --> 00:22:00,985
<i>You could be swinging on a star</i>

249
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:19,001
- Let's go out the back way.
- Keep those ideas coming.

250
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,831
Get up.
You're embarrassing me.

251
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,672
- Would you get going?
- Come on, go!

252
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,240
- Go, go!
- Easy with that!

253
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,408
Come on!

254
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,915
I'm happy we covered our tracks!

255
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:46,119
Can I ask a question?
I'm not as fat as that guard, am I?

256
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,429
No, you're a slender reed
compared to that guard.

257
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,127
Come on, Slim Jim.

258
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,275
Hudson Hawk gets the chair of honor.

259
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,117
Good job.
Not pretty, but good.

260
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,454
All this trouble for a horsey.

261
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,256
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

262
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,653
You do.

263
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:26,034
When's this Buckingham Palace-looking
butlerhead-motherfucker getting here?

264
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,096
Any minute now, Mr. Gates.

265
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,311
Oh, sorry, Jeeves.

266
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,212
May I?

267
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,582
Exquisite.

268
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:46,317
Leonardo da Vinci's last commission
for the Duke of Milan.

269
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,853
Irreplaceable.

270
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,987
Mr. French, I'm...

271
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,330
What?

272
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,165
You son of a bitch!

273
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,470
I stuck my neck out setting this up
for you limey bastards!

274
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,602
Where's my cut?

275
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,283
So much for his cut.

276
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,848
Forgive my dry British humor.

277
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,363
I think Gates
promised Hawk a cut, too.

278
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,070
Lovely work, Alfred.
Taking the Concorde back?

279
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,200
Always, Mr. Mario.

280
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,507
I'm racking up
those frequent flyer points.

281
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,708
Ta-ta, Hudson Hawk.

282
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,651
Yo, Five Tone.

283
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,623
Did I miss anything?

284
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:57,287
Gates tries to blackmail me,
you ask, "Did I miss anything?''

285
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,388
Gates gets killed, you say,
"Did I miss anything?''

286
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,797
I bet you went to Mrs. Lincoln
at the theater and said...

287
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,996
"How was the show?
Did I miss anything?"

288
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,242
Might get this looked at.

289
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,609
Gates was killed?
Who do we send the thank-you note?

290
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,049
The butler did it. The guy was a cross
between Alistair Cooke and a Cuisinart.

291
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,281
Took Mr. Ed, humpty-dumptied it
over Gate's head...

292
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,289
and said it was made
by Leonardo...

293
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,052
Da Vinci's <i>"Sforza."</i>

294
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:32,256
I consider it the prize of tonight's
auction of objets d'equestrian.</i>

295
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,688
Horse things.

296
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,860
All right, Mr. PBS, you got me.

297
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,234
Morning edition.
It says here...

298
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,830
two thieves attempted to steal it.

299
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,207
But thanks to three brave guards,
it will be ready for tonight.

300
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,306
Attempted? I didn't want to steal it
in the first place, but I have my pride.

301
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,344
- I don't understand this.
- Why try? Forget about it.

302
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,412
I'm tired of not understanding things.
Cops! Mafia!

303
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,982
Butlers forcing me to steal something
it appears I didn't steal.

304
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,119
It's too goddamn peculiar.

305
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,823
Let me ask you.
How much does a new tuxedo cost?

306
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:08,934
A fantastic example
of Florentine bronze.

307
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,631
A fantastic example
of Florentine bronze.

308
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:16,037
Now who will start at 140,000?

309
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,306
140,000.

310
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,742
160,000.

311
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,111
70. 80. 90,000.

312
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,444
200.

313
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,447
20.

314
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,011
40.

315
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,422
<i>You could be swinging on a star</i>

316
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,119
250,000!

317
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,634
Sold!

318
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:54,008
After all these years, I still get
goose bumps coming to auctions.

319
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,773
The paintings, the sculptures.

320
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,215
Things that aren't really paintings
or sculptures.

321
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,119
Vultures never look up from their
calculators to see what they're buying.

322
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,248
That gives me goose bumps.

323
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,453
- Auctions are disgusting.
- I couldn't agree more.

324
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,428
Savages.

325
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,728
Now lot 15.

326
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,464
An equestrian piece
attributed to the Cellini school.

327
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:24,872
Who will start 250,000?

328
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,618
Sold!

329
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:46,096
And finally lot number 17...

330
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,826
thought to be lost in the war...

331
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,834
and again last night.

332
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,969
The da Vinci <i>"Sforza</i>,"
the jewel of the sale.

333
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,566
Fantastic!

334
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:03,205
Is looking like a constipated warthog
a job prerequisite in the art world?

335
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,781
We have <i>Doctoressa</i> Anna Baragli
of the Vatican here to verify it. Doc?

336
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,754
Some of us warthogs
are more constipated than others.

337
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,481
Perfection.

338
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,577
The Vatican extends its jealously
to the lucky bidder.

339
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,916
Thank you.

340
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,951
We'll begin the bidding...

341
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,050
at $20 million.

342
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,626
Waldo!

343
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,496
100 million clams!

344
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,662
That's $100 million...

345
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,933
to Mr. Darwin Mayflower.

346
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,739
One hundred million and one...

347
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,280
Waldo!

348
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,009
Fantastic!

349
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,984
$100 million and one.

350
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,284
Outbid by mine own wench.
<i>Quelle bummere.</i>

351
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,223
Don't hate me, baby.

352
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,823
Bunny.

353
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,627
Any other bids?

354
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,190
Going once.

355
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,437
Going twice.

356
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,709
Gone!

357
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,001
My God, that was bold of you.
You didn't have to do that.

358
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,236
It's nothing.
Anybody would've done the same.

359
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,575
I mean, you didn't have to tackle me.

360
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:22,716
I'm just kidding. Thanks for saving me.
Why was that guard chasing you?

361
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:26,245
Because danger is my middle...

362
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,932
You couldn't just play along,
could you?

363
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,505
Classy way of covering our tracks, eh?

364
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,777
That auctioneer ought to be landing
at LaGuardia any minute now.

365
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,581
Hey, subtlety's not one
of our strong points.

366
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,440
Menthol.

367
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,742
This is a brand-new tuxedo!

368
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,780
Mister, are you going to die?

369
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,128
Happy sailing!

370
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,931
How am I driving?
1-800, I'm going to fucking die!

371
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:50,808
Toll booth?

372
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,815
Exact change?

373
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,257
- Make a road kill!
- Fuck you, Cesar!

374
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,063
Run him down!

375
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,350
Cesar! Antony!

376
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,712
Are you okay?

377
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,508
What's the matter with you?

378
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,912
Name's Snickers.
Plane leaves in 40.

379
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,180
Almond Joy. Get it? Candy bars.

380
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,485
It's better than when
we first started.

381
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,257
Our code names were diseases. Know what
it's like being called chlamydia?

382
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,659
Forgot.

383
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,446
- My names Butterfinger.
- No shit.

384
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,088
Like the Company's new look?

385
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,886
I call them the MTVIA.

386
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,622
George, you promised.
No old C.I.A., new C.I.A. Jokes.

387
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,996
Punks.

388
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,659
They think the Bay of Pigs
is an herbal tea...

389
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,259
and the cold war has something
to do with penguins.

390
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,599
Don't I know you?

391
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,664
The last time you saw me I was bald,
with a beard and no moustache....

392
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,676
and I had a different nose.

393
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,939
So if you don't recognize me,
I won't be offended.

394
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,981
My high school science teacher?

395
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,641
I tricked you into robbing
the government installation...

396
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,711
then had you sent to prison for it.

397
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,155
George Kaplan.

398
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,829
I don't hold grudges.

399
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,832
Aah! I used you as a diversion.

400
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,528
I guess down deep I was jealous.

401
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,002
You were one hell of a thi<i>et</i>.

402
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,339
To what do I owe this honor
of this reunion?

403
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,809
I want to make it up to you.
That's why I got you this gig.

404
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,474
To quote the late Karen Carpenter,
"We have only just begun.''

405
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,575
Three minutes, four seconds.

406
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,813
But you're a little late.

407
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,082
Maybe nobody told you.
I quit stealing.

408
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,920
- My employer wants a meeting.
- Your employer?

409
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,258
- The president?
- No. Somebody powerful.

410
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,193
Good god, what's that?

411
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,301
You don't expect me to fall
for that old gag.

412
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,372
Shucks. I guess not.

413
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,772
- Now?
- Yes, now.

414
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,396
No way.

415
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,701
Welcome to Rome, sir.

416
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:38,963
So, Hawk. The Hawkster.
What do you think of the vehicle?

417
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:43,900
So, Hawk. The Hawkster.
What do you think of the vehicle?

418
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,027
Why did you duck at the auction?

419
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,466
What can I tell you?
I'm the villain.

420
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,478
Initially, it was a priority
to keep buffers between you and me.

421
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,776
Since most are dead now,
I thought, "What the heck?"

422
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,817
Hawky, you come highly recommended.

423
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,821
I hired Kaplan and the Marios
to find me a cat burglar.

424
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,419
Hey, I want to be
in business with you.

425
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,833
<i>I've got the power</i>

426
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,646
Ladies and gentlemen of the board
and Minerva.

427
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,117
Let's give it up for Hudson Hawk.

428
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,426
Hello.

429
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,927
Bunny, ball-ball.

430
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,459
Hawkmeister.

431
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:53,435
We've got you clothes, a great hotel
and a 250,000 lire per diem.

432
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:58,271
That's $200 a day so he can get
a hooker and tequila? Veto, Darwin.

433
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,004
We see who wears the penis
in this family.

434
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,980
For God's sakes,
somebody chain this convict.

435
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:13,721
Listen, this might be hard to believe,
but I'm just a regular Joe.

436
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,660
I just want to be happy.

437
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:22,461
And happiness comes
from the achieving of goals.

438
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:27,163
It's just that when you've made
your first billion by the age of 19...

439
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,139
it's hard to come up with new ones.

440
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:34,268
But now, finally,
I got myself a new goal.

441
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,537
World domination!

442
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,024
Shut up!

443
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,220
Bunny, quit that.

444
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,489
Ball-ball.

445
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,589
- Bunny's got today's ball-balls.
- Bad Bunny.

446
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,861
Bunny, you weren't that bad!

447
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,961
Just two more minutes.
I was so close.

448
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:05,168
Seriously, Concorde me home, jail me.
I don't care.

449
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:10,443
You go back to jail,
and you won't be alone.

450
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,745
You'll have a guinea barkeep cell mate
to keep you company.

451
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:20,080
You're young enough to enjoy shanking
child molesters for a pack of smokes.

452
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,850
But Tommy Fiv<i>e- </i>Tone...

453
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,795
will go in knowing
the next time he gets out...

454
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,628
will be to attend his own funeral.

455
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,867
Depressing?

456
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,910
Wouldn't waste a dime for th<e call.
You don't have proof.

457
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,608
The magic word.

458
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,816
It's veja du.
Something you wish never did happen.

459
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:55,223
Kaplan and his C.I.A. candy bars
shot the operation with hidden cameras.

460
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,728
They put the fake horse in the safe</i>
while you ran from the guards.

461
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,596
- Damn Fotomat assholes!
- Good shot of you, Minerva.

462
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,835
My man, you're going to hit a church.

463
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:16,107
<i>We want you to steal</i>
<i>da Vinci's sketchbook. The codex.</i>

464
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,480

465
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,452
I'm robbing the Vatican.

466
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,989
The nuns at St. Agnes...

467
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,921
predicted this.

468
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,187
What do they call you?
Igg and Ook?

469
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:07,459
I'm being blackmailed into robbing
the Vatican by psychotics and the C.I.A.

470
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,499
I don't...

471
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,396
That's okay.
Just keep an eye on the art.

472
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,624
Stop it!
You're embarrassing your country.

473
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,605
Though Leonardo is best known
as a painter...

474
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,575
it was his gift as an inventor
who drew together science....

475
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,407
and art...

476
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,777
that is most incredible.

477
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,413
Tough guy,
what are you doing here?

478
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,290
Every time I get around you,
my heart beats really fast.

479
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,798
As you know, the da Vinci codex...

480
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:53,268
has lived in the Vatican for centuries,
and will stay for centuries more.

481
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,771
That's what you think.

482
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,273
- Question?
- What time are you done?

483
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,140
His untiring pen predicted
the airplane...

484
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,803
the submarine...

485
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,340
the bicycle, the helicopter
and even the tank.

486
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,615
These designs inspired him
to develop a code...

487
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,465
- Something wrong?
- Come quickly.

488
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,631
Pokey!

489
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,807
- That smoke bad for you?
- This way.

490
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,643
- Where are we going?
- Through here.

491
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,652
Are you going to tell me
why you did that or blame it on Dumbo?

492
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,250
You mean Pokey?

493
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,488
Can you believe that kooky elephant?

494
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,793
What is this?

495
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,766
It's a postal subway.

496
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,167
Can I get to Times Square from here?

497
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,967
The pope takes his mail seriously.

498
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,840
Christmas cards, Easter seals.
Delivers up to 10:00 at night.

499
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,400
I see.

500
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,112
Actually, I don't see.
I'm confused.

501
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,616
How do you know this stuff?
What do you do?

502
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:20,419
I do a lot of things, but I don't steal
stuffed elephants from little girls.

503
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,982
My life's pretty boring.

504
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,255
Yeah, mine, too.

505
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,093
Want to have dinner?

506
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,962
Nice, boring dinner?

507
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:33,492
Scrabble, knock-knock jokes,
anecdotes about dead Italians?

508
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,030
I'll bring my entire repertoire.

509
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,539
And I'll bring my entire entourage.

510
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:49,052
There's a place around the corner.
Enzo's. Say 10:30?

511
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,917
Hey, thanks.

512
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:03,426
Father, it's obvious
he's up to something.

513
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,196
- <i>Report upstairs at once.</i>
- Yes, sir!

514
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,615
Did he mention the Mayflowers?

515
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,914
No, but he's going to steal the codex.
I can feel it.

516
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,318
- I'm not sure when.
- Attempt to steal!

517
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,187
The vanity of this Hudson Hawk.

518
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:32,490
The Vatican has foiled the advances
of pirates and terrorists.

519
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,659
We will not lie down
for some schmuck from New Jersey.

520
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:42,400
And must you flirt with him
so effectively?

521
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,498
That's the only way.

522
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,171
As an agent of our organization,
you're put in awkward situations.

523
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:53,444
Just remember, Hudson Hawk
is an evil, evil man.

524
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:18,036
Operator, I'd like to make a collect
call overseas to a New York number.

525
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,303
What?

526
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,368
No, don't put me...

527
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,941
<i>Thank you for calling AT& T.</i>
<i>What number please?</i>

528
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,287
Thank God.
212-555-1989.

529
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:44,523
Pick up the phone, you reindeer
goat cheese-eating bastard.

530
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:47,965
Pick it up.

531
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,505
Pick it up, Tommy.

532
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,408
The black thing on the desk.

533
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,640
Come on, Tommy.

534
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,528
Want more, Jumbo?

535
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,191
Kick your big, flabby ass.

536
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,040
- Enjoying Italy?
- Yeah.

537
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,076
Yes.

538
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,012
I've always had a soft spot
in my heart for <i>Roma.</i>

539
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,346
I did my first
barehanded strangulation here.

540
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,052
Communist politician.

541
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,611
George, you big softie.

542
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,885
I miss Communism!

543
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,428
The Red threat.

544
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:47,725
People were scared.

545
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,793
The Agency had respect,
and I got laid every night.

546
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,405
Brief him, Snickers.

547
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,739
Good news. The Mayflowers
have moved up the timetable.

548
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,371
You're hitting the Vatican tonight.

549
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,381
The timing is not right.

550
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,747
I'm under- equipped and I've got a date.

551
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,581
Grapple, bikers bottle....

552
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,484
Pocket Fisherman, olive oil...

553
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,113
100 stamps?

554
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,284
This is going to be some date.
No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

555
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,385
Make that list happen.

556
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,799
It's one thing to play hide-and-seek
with the Mayflowers' pathetic staff...

557
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,960
but we're sore losers.

558
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,004
We blow up space shuttles
for breakfast.

559
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:32,804
You and Tommy would be nothing more
than a late afternoon Triscuit.

560
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,870
Hey, old man!
Yeah, you!

561
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,918
You come back here
without your Cub Scout army...

562
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:46,012
and I'll kick your centrally intelligent
ass all over the piazza.

563
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,765
"Beware the blue wire"?

564
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,033
I got your stamps.

565
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,129
Good, Yogi.

566
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,957
Kit Kat, how did you know
about that blue wire?

567
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,116
I was afraid you wouldn't drop by.

568
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,120
Am I late?

569
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:57,355
You look very nice.
You really do.

570
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,595
- What?
- I am the waiter.

571
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,604
Very nice.

572
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,666
And bring ketchup.

573
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,973
You heard him.

574
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:20,984
Come on, Pierre, read my lips.

575
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,116
Steak burger.

576
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:27,493
French fries. This is France.
You gotta have French fries.

577
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,794
Actually, it's Italy.

578
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,096
As if it made a difference.

579
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,707
To be in "Paree" and in love.

580
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,911
They had the worst ketchup in prison.

581
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,073
Prison?

582
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,486
I was a warden.

583
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,954
- How long were you in?
- Let's just say I never saw <i>E.T.</i>

584
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,792
Wow.

585
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:02,924
You were in the joint doing hard time.

586
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,895
It's funny, but that excites me.

587
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,834
I seem to have a thing for sinners.

588
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,637
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
Check please.

589
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,845
Where'd you get the hawk?

590
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,279
Ossining, New York.

591
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,375
Where'd you get the name Hudson Hawk?

592
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:25,615
Well, "the hawk" is a slang word...

593
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:29,216
for the cold wind
that blows in the wintertime.

594
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:33,592
I grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey,
which is on the Hudson River.

595
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,655
- So Hudson River...
- Hudson Hawk.

596
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:42,128
- Where'd you get these?
- I had an accident around the house.

597
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,435
- What happened?
- Fell on some chickens.

598
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,634
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, they hurt.

599
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:52,171
- Maybe I can make them feel better.
- Well, okay. See what you can do.

600
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:08,631
Don't tickle me. Don't do it
because I gotta tell you something.

601
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,131
What?

602
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,361
I better whisper it to you.

603
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,868
Come here.

604
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,101
I can't.

605
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:25,771
- What's the matter?
- It's been a long time for me.

606
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,374
It's been a really long time for me.

607
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,545
Outside of a friendly dog yesterday,
this has been a slow decade.

608
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,990
I don't make love every ten years,
I get a cranky.

609
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:42,457
I'm not sure if I remember
how to kiss girls.

610
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,460
Not that I ever kissed guys.

611
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,502
Catholic girls are scary.

612
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,911
- Somebody robbed the Vatican.
- Really?

613
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:08,152
It's not what you think.
Well, maybe it is.

614
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,590
You went and did it.
You really did it.

615
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,823
In less than one day of planning,
you did it.

616
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:17,890
You started the week by stealing the
<i>"Sforza"</i> and ended by swiping the codex.

617
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,164
What are your plans for the weekend?
Hoisting away the Coliseum?

618
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:26,004
Tell me. Did the devil make you do it?
Or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

619
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,600
Can't we go back to the kissing part?

620
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,015
What's going on in there?

621
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,017
You want me to rape them?

622
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,848
Just read your book, Butterfinger.

623
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,891
"Not in a boat. Not on a train.

624
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:54,733
Not with a goat. Not in the rain.
I do not like green eggs and ham."

625
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,237
To yourself.

626
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,900
It's more complicated than that.

627
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:03,173
Two years I've tracked the Mayflowers'
interest in the three da Vinci pieces.

628
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:07,444
The "<i>'Sforza</i>" was a fake, but I was
under orders not to denounce it.

629
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,145
Does everybody in the whole world
know more than me?

630
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,484
- You didn't know?
- No.

631
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,455
I'm just good at swiping stuff.

632
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,258
Who knew that would lead to this?

633
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,323
They've even got the C.I.A.
Involved now.

634
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,426
Here's looking at you, kid.

635
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:32,565
Hey, this doesn't taste
like cappuccino.

636
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,133
Oh. I guess I put too much
ethyl chloride in it.

637
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,145
Why didn't you tell me that Hawk
had hit the Vatican tonight?

638
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:46,985
My people will not be happy.
I want to see Kaplan.

639
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,226
Damn meddlesome Vatican organization.

640
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,671
Way to go!

641
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:07,233
Hudson Hawk had some interesting things
to say about you and the Mayflowers.

642
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,074
Basically that you're all
a part of the same carpool.

643
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:14,606
Anna, Anna, if that were so...

644
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:18,814
Almond Joy would have handed you your
heart after you handed her the codex.

645
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,015
The trip is this.

646
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,117
When the Mayflowers find out we have
the codex, they'll want to make a deal.

647
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,856
We deal, they'll buy, we bust.

648
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,126
- A classic sting.
- What happens to Hudson Hawk?

649
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,828
I wouldn't worry much about him.

650
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,098
He's in very good hands.

651
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,107
But you look really tired, kiddo.

652
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,700
Maybe you should go back to Rome
and get some sleep. Kit Kat!

653
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,803
Oh, there you are.

654
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:48,876
See that Miss Baragli gets home safely.

655
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,855
<i>Arrivederci,</i> baby.

656
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:59,359
It's a great dress, but why didn't you
let me cut her heart out?

657
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,920
Close call. Close call.

658
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:07,662
But she's our only way of keeping tabs
on the mysterious Vatican organization.

659
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,040
Bunny Mayflower!

660
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:15,712
Forgive me, for I have sinned. It's been
1,200 hours since my last confession.

661
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:19,910
Forgive me, for I have sinned. It's been
1,200 hours since my last confession.

662
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,281
Hit me with your best shot.

663
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,877
I betrayed a man.

664
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:28,720
A good man, an innocent man,
a thief.

665
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,056
What are you trying to say?

666
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,154
Father, we've been double-crossed
by the C.I.A.

667
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,358
Hudson Hawk is not
who we thought he was.

668
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,664
He came into a world where crime
is a legitimate business tactic...

669
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,898
and legitimate government procedure.

670
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,906
But he knew right from wrong.

671
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,306
And we kind of messed around.

672
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,311
Messed around?

673
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,786
Seventeen Hail Marys...

674
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,448
and five minutes outside.

675
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:04,857
So, Sister,
what you are saying is...

676
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:08,021
that Hudson Hawk is not willingly
working for the Mayflowers...

677
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,565
but that Kaplan
and the candy bars are.

678
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:17,068
I thought we were using the C.I.A. To
get to Mayflower, but they're using me.

679
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,577
The pope warned me
never to trust the C.I.A.

680
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,875
If the Mayflowers get all three crystals
for the gold machine...

681
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,711
the world economy will be ruined.

682
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,087
Lord help us.

683
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:36,319
But what of Tommy Five-Tone,
Hawk's friend? Where's his loyalty?

684
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:37,984
I'll find out.

685
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:42,964
Remember, you have your vows to God
as well as your mission to the world.

686
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,465
Yes, Your Eminence.

687
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:50,366
- Just say, "God go with me.''
- God go with you, Sister.

688
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:53,543
Ball! Ball!

689
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,875
Ball! Ball!

690
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,710
Jolly good shot.

691
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,949
Oh, Hudson Hawk.

692
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:08,821
Hudson Hawk!
You cease to amaze me, convict.

693
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,951
You are a terrible cat burglar.

694
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,156
Haven't you ever seen David Niven?
Tiptoe in, tiptoe out.

695
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,359
- Like a cat, one would say.
- I could take it back.

696
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,971
- Let me do that.
- I don't care.

697
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,577
Oh, you two!

698
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:38,176
There's nothing I hate more
than failure.

699
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,188
You only had to follow Hawk.

700
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,589
It's not like I said teach
our nation's children how to read.

701
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,718
We'll have to kill them.

702
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,495
God, Minerva!
I was just joking.

703
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,779
- Get away from there.
- Just browsing.

704
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:15,289
Don't hurt him.
We need him for the final job.

705
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,989
Oh, really?

706
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:22,394
Don't hurt him?
Even if he does this?

707
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,734
What about this?

708
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:30,272
Surely this must offend.

709
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,174
Things are really heating up
at the castle tonight.

710
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,008
Mama Mia Pizzeria.
May I call you Minnie?

711
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,015
<i>You put your left foot in</i>
<i>You put your left foot out</i>

712
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:45,782
There is a part of your body
you won't be needing for your next job.

713
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,224
I always wanted to sing
like Frankie Valli.

714
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,227
Big boys don't cry.

715
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,521
Three minutes, 27 seconds.

716
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,905
Look, you Eddie Munster motherfucker...

717
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,067
somebody better tell me what's going on
or I ain't moving another muscle.

718
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:10,772
- I want to be treated like an adult.
- That's fair. Go to your room!

719
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,584
What?

720
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:22,091
So, Captain Hawk...

721
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,286
So, Captain Hawk...

722
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,352
in one of your paws you've got
a gold bar worth about eight thou.

723
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,764
In the <i>autre,</i> you've got lead
that won't get you <i>gelato.</i>

724
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,997
Surely a master thief like you
can tell the difference.

725
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,936
One down. Kitty Carlisle.

726
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:40,874
Cool, isn't it?
Weight, feel, malleability.

727
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,104
They're all but identical.

728
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:47,240
On the periodic chart of elements,
they're but one proton apart.

729
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:51,719
Great minds worked for centuries
to turn worthless into priceless.

730
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,049
Alchemy?

731
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:56,148
Alchemy is the business term
of the '90s.

732
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,558
Minerva read about it in
an airline magazine four years ago.

733
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,496
I dumped some lire into research.

734
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,763
Shazam! We come across a diary
by one of da Vinci's assistants...

735
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,634
detailing <i>la machina de oro...</i>

736
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,935
the gold machine
for those at home.

737
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,306
And the rest
is about to become history.

738
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,038
Money isn't everything.

739
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,137
Gold is.

740
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,876
Fuck T-bills!
Fuck blue chip stocks!

741
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,010
Fuck junk bonds!
We've got the real deal.

742
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,213
Money will always be paper...

743
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,383
but gold will always be gold.

744
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,551
After a couple years
of steady production...

745
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,528
we'll flood the market with so much gold
that gold itself...

746
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,192
the foundation of all finance,
will lose its meaning.

747
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,168
Brokers, economists,
fellow entrepreneurs...

748
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,866
will drown in the saliva
of their own nervous breakdowns.

749
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,138
- Sounds like a party.
- Markets will crash, crash.

750
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,111
Financial empires will crumble, crumble.

751
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,545
Except yours, yours.

752
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:56,383
In 1992, baby...

753
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:00,513
the European superpowers are c>oming
together for one business superpower.

754
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:04,753
- That's one party we'll love to poop.
- That's set.

755
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:09,730
The last ingredient in the recipe
is da Vinci's model of a helicopter.

756
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,565
On display for three days only
at the Louvre in Paris.

757
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,572
- As opposed to the Louvre in Wisconsin?
- Shut up. I'll lose my place.

758
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,541
You'll have to go in at night.
The security will be overwhelming.

759
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,043
Twelve guards...

760
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,943
Time out.

761
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,983
I choose not to accept
the assignment, Mr. Phelps.

762
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,915
Put me in jail.

763
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,922
Jail, you asshole! Our foot soldiers
will blow your brains out.

764
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,423
Bunny, ball-ball.

765
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:39,157
I'll torture you so slowly,
you'll think it's a career.

766
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:41,287
I'll kill your friends,
your family...

767
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,423
and the bitch you took to the prom.

768
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,297
Betty Jo Biarski?
I can get you an address.

769
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,234
You have a dilemma.

770
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,829
I think I know
what will help you solve it.

771
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,411
I'll kill you all!
I swear to God!

772
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,076
I'll kill the butler,
that yappy dog.

773
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,779
I'm sick of this.

774
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:13,823
I hated cigarettes until I saw
my first "no smoking" sign.

775
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:18,929
"Keep off the grass,"
let's play soccer.

776
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:23,495
The only law I cared for was friendship.
I broke that one, too, didn't I?

777
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:31,808
I don't think it's a smoking hot idea
to leave them in there alone.

778
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:37,012
Relax. That's why we hired the pasta
slurping guinea: To keep Hawk in line.

779
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:40,487
This Gates-Mario Brothers,
C.I.A.-Mayflower da Vinci thing...

780
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,787
seemed like a sweet deal.

781
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,059
Visit foreign lands,
take their treasures.

782
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,427
I thought you'd get into it.

783
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:52,365
It's better than playing darts
with M.B.A. S at the bar.

784
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:57,235
But I didn't think
it was going to be like this.

785
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,399
Them using me to use you.

786
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,344
I'm sorry, Eddie.

787
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,778
There's only one way out of this.

788
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,978
And it's gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

789
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,752
They'll talk about being buddies
and chugging brewskis.

790
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,058
You've got to love male bonding.

791
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,905
Fucked my freedom for a lousy job.

792
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:49,624
You know something?
You hit like a girl!

793
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,523
Really?

794
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,459
I was only kidding.

795
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,403
Tommy, no!

796
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,246
Plan B, George.

797
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:26,823
Plan B?

798
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,890
No sweat, Tommy.
You made the biggest mistake of my life.

799
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,488
Don't act like you never committed a
crime before. I know I made a bad call.

800
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:06,001
But when Anna tracked me down...
It was so beautiful.

801
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:08,901
When those blanks went off,
everybody freaked.

802
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,368
Ketchup.
You can't beat Heinz 57.

803
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,809
You fucked my freedom for a lousy job?

804
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,144
- You don't understand.
- You should be glad I don't hit women.

805
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,617
Assuming you are a woman. From now on,
I ain't taking nothing for granted.

806
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:27,315
I'm sorry. I work undercover for
a Vatican humanitarian organization.

807
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,721
Anna made me realize what a pawn I was.

808
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,556
- Man, I love you.
- I care for you.

809
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,653
Oh. Then what's this?

810
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,460
- Where did you get that?
- The da Vinci Castle.

811
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:40,297
The place where you gave the bad guys
the codex.

812
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,599
- That's from the gold machine.
- Yeah.

813
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,605
They were that close to making it work.

814
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:48,769
But now they've lost the greatest
cat burglar and his dead partner...

815
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:51,142
They won't be able to steal
the third piece of the crystal.

816
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,147
And we get to go home.

817
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,918
- Let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

818
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,819
Why'd they leave all these rocks
laying in the backyard?

819
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,321
They're called ruins.

820
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,689
Ruins?
Good name.

821
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,292
He had this look on his face
when we caught him. It was like...

822
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,561
I never saw a look on a face like this.

823
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,734
He was so embarrassed.

824
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:24,768
Speaking of being caught, isn't
the C.I.A. Gonna check out this place?

825
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:26,781
No. They fell for the fake death.

826
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,511
They think Hawk's been arrested.

827
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:33,180
Kaplan and the candy bars were seen
boarding a plane out of Rome.

828
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:36,747
- Where to?
- Quit worrying about them.

829
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:39,020
I'm not worried.
I'm just being cautious.

830
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:43,554
- Okay. On that note, it's time for bed.
- I couldn't agree more.

831
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:49,929
You sleep here.

832
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,569
- Where you gonna sleep?
- What do you think?

833
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,303
Yeah. Good night.

834
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:57,311
I'll get some sheets.

835
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,438
Yeah, we'll get you some sheets.

836
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,548
- It's a very special night.
- Yes, it was.

837
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,580
- Is.
- Was.

838
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,887
There's some things
you don't know about me.

839
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:15,658
There are things I do know about you,
and about me and about that bed.

840
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,633
This is not the time.

841
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:23,597
Look, can't we have
a late-night cappuccino?

842
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:27,164
I'm sorry, but the machine's
still set up for poisonous foam.

843
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,578
Oh, yeah. I remember.

844
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,614
Good night.

845
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:35,582
Good night.

846
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:45,753
Don't even think about it.
Don't say another word.

847
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,524
<i>It's a very special night</i>

848
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:51,632
You're very funny.

849
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,354
Good morning.

850
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:18,154
The license plates on the police van
had a Vatican prefix.

851
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,623
I'm losing respect for you.

852
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:24,325
You were that close to getting away
with this crap.

853
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,628
Where's Anna?

854
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:30,864
It's nice of you guys to drop by,
but next time you might phone ahead.

855
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:35,035
Come back in a half hour. We'll grab
a shower, pick up some croissants.

856
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:39,638
I wish I could come up with this
glib repartee the way you guys can.

857
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:42,741
But I can't, so I'll just paralyze you.
A.J.?

858
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,720
Curare darts.

859
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:50,816
When it comes to instantaneous loss
of physical control below the neck...

860
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:52,485
I highly recommend them.

861
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:56,429
I can't move! I'm gonna rip
their fucking tongues out!

862
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,989
Come here, you chickenshit
son of a bitch!

863
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:03,868
Come here! My head against your head.
Fair fight.

864
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,271
This is how I go out?
Like a hunk of frozen Play-Doh?

865
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,536
Like a Gumby in a store?

866
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,544
What the fuck are you...
Keep laughing, Jumbo.

867
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,239
It's coming out my nose.

868
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:16,341
This is no way, George,
to get me to rob the Louvre.

869
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:17,851
The Louvre?

870
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:23,189
The Louvre, Hawk,
is yesterday's news.

871
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,850
Or should I say, this morning's.

872
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,227
I admit we displayed a lack of nuance.

873
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,766
Didn't wear black,
didn't sing "Swinging on a Star."

874
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:36,567
We weren't being judged for neatness,
only results.

875
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,868
Goddamn it! Yanks lose again!

876
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,136
- How'd the Mets do?
- Can you turn to Section B?

877
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,283
You guys may be the fairest
cat burglars of them all...

878
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:54,220
but if you weren't such snobs, those
guards at the Louvre might be alive.

879
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,419
That's irrelevant now.

880
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:06,830
You're irrelevant now.

881
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,103
Because tonight...

882
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:15,007
at the Castle da Vinci,
we make gold!

883
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,908
Rise and shine, sleepyheads!

884
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,844
More babes for the party.

885
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:20,176
Hi, Anna.

886
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:23,776
Don't be stupid, Mr. Kaplan.
Give me the crystal.

887
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,786
Anna Baragli!

888
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,322
Came to play!

889
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,517
Anna-banana-fo-fanna...

890
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,685
you're not gonna shoot
little ol' me, are you?

891
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,695
You're not gonna shoot
little ol' anybody.

892
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,788
- Pull the trigger.
- Shoot, Anna, shoot.

893
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:40,198
- I read your dossier, Sister.
- Pull the trigger!

894
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,903
Why did she call you "sister"?

895
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:49,102
- I'm sorry. I meant to tell you.
- He didn't know.

896
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:52,044
- He didn't know!
- Know what?

897
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:54,810
Hawk likes a nun.

898
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:01,881
Those better be tears you're crying.

899
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:04,289
They are.

900
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:08,762
- It doesn't mean I don't love you.
- No, you love me. It's your job!

901
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:12,027
- You probably love Butterfinger.
- Well, yeah.

902
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,661
In a weird sort of Catholic way,
I do.

903
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:19,036
But you... You...

904
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:26,972
Miss Baragli's da Vinci expertise
allows her to go on to the next course.

905
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:30,143
- And as for you guys...
- Sorry, guys.

906
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,122
A souvenir.

907
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,723
- Later, guys.
- Easy for you to say.

908
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,133
We got some good news
and some bad news.

909
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,226
We got some good news
and some bad news.

910
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:50,294
The good news is you'll be unparalyzed
in about two minutes.

911
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:53,864
That bad news is that leaves you
with five seconds to defuse the bombs.

912
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,176
Bombs?

913
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,285
I'm so glad it had to be like this.

914
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,913
I'll shoot one in the kitchen
for good measure.

915
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,591
Almond Joy, more paralysis!

916
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,564
- You can move?
- Yeah.

917
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,301
This is what I get for darting a nun?

918
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,440
Get this off my head!

919
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,635
- Look at Snickers.
- He's about to have a migraine.

920
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,912
Maybe it's a dud.

921
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,766
I don't know.
It must be the curare.

922
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,199
It's been known to have side effects.

923
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:57,102
Oh, really, George?

924
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,335
I feel like a dolphin
who's never tasted melted snow.

925
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,639
Listen, Anna.

926
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,975
The apprentice's diary
contains a code that explains...

927
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,481
how the three pieces of crystal
fit together.

928
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:12,676
If you could do us the honor,
and decipher how the code works...

929
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,915
we would be eternally grateful.

930
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,720
What's the color blue taste like?

931
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,818
Bobo knows.

932
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:24,966
I must speak with the dolphins now.

933
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,174
Just shoot her. Anybody?

934
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:37,603
This is supposed to be torture,
not therapy.

935
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:37,713
The old man said turn left at the fork.

936
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,910
The old man said turn left at the fork.

937
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:44,645
If you want to save Anna,
you've got to find the castle first.

938
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,989
- Quit pushing.
- I'm not pushing.

939
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,456
- Count of three?
- Why not just go now?

940
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:59,059
- Tommy, who are you, Bob Hope?
- What are you talking about?

941
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,227
- What are you doing with that golf bag?
- I've got a plan.

942
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,237
- Is it a great plan?
- A great big plan.

943
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:23,458
- Let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

944
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:26,722
- How do I look?
- Great. Are you kidding?

945
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:28,729
No, I want you to tell me.

946
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,857
- I've been away a long time.
- We're hanging over a chasm.

947
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:36,097
- You're asking me how you look?
- Okay. You don't gotta get...

948
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,205
- You look gorgeous, like El Zorro.
- I didn't know.

949
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:53,020
A lifetime of service,
and it's come to this.

950
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:55,556
The dolphin is dead.

951
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,685
The dolphin is...
Come on, you bitch!

952
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:03,253
I'm not a very good damsel
in a dress, am I?

953
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:06,266
You must pay the rent!
But I can't pay the rent!

954
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:11,939
Yo, Flipper. A damsel in distress
implies that there is...

955
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:15,534
some well-hung Dudley Do-Right
galloping up to save you.

956
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,578
It ain't gonna happen.

957
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,444
Hudson Hawk go boom boom.
He dead.

958
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:33,991
- I'm thinking of using the 7 iron.
- Looks long.

959
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,292
- Six iron?
- Bingo.

960
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:39,561
Thank you. Fore!

961
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:44,236
Fore?
Did anybody hear something?

962
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:48,575
Can you believe it?

963
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:49,974
I heard something.

964
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:54,581
- Did you set the timer on that thing?
- No.

965
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,810
From now on, set the timer.

966
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:58,614
Come on, Butterfinger.

967
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:02,487
Kit Kat, guard the Mayflowers
with your life.

968
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:11,854
Kit Kat, are you really going
to guard us with your life?

969
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,469
Double crossbow for a double-cross.

970
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:27,344
Alfie, you dry British madman!

971
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:29,007
Catch you later, baby.

972
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:38,551
- Why did you do that?
- Try this one, Sister.

973
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:41,027
Thou shalt not share.

974
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:44,998
It's in the hole!
The gallery's ecstatic!

975
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:47,591
- He's gotta be happy with that one.
- So what do you say?

976
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:50,331
2-1/2 minutes to save Anna,
3-1/2 to save the world.

977
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,839
6-0-0. "Side by Side"?

978
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:59,472
O<i>h, we ain't got</i>
<i>a barrel of money</i>

979
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:03,244
<i>We may be ragged and funny</i>

980
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,343
<i>But we'll travel along</i>

981
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:08,116
Hit it!
<i>Singing a song</i>

982
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,589
<i>Side by side</i>

983
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,160
Let's go this way.

984
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:17,994
We better go this way.

985
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:26,669
Okay. This way.

986
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,574
Eddie, we better split up.

987
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:32,841
I'll take the front 9, you the back 9,
and we'll meet back at the clubhouse.

988
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:36,611
- Hey, Tommy, looking good, my man.
- Thanks.

989
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,712
How you doing?

990
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,814
Three. Two. One.

991
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:50,658
Go in, brief the Mayflowers
on the current situation.

992
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:55,028
You got it, coach.

993
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,594
<i>Through all kinds of weather</i>

994
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,470
<i>What if the sky should fall</i>

995
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,870
<i>Just as long</i>
<i>as we're together</i>

996
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:07,244
<i>It doesn't matter at all</i>

997
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:11,516
<i>When they've all had their quarrels</i>
<i>and parted</i>

998
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:14,646
<i>We'll be the same</i>
<i>as we started</i>

999
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:18,591
<i>Just sailing along</i>
<i>singing a song</i>

1000
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,958
<i>Side by...</i>

1001
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:24,455
Side.
I'll take that, sir.

1002
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,942
Hey, coach, looks bad.

1003
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,350
Those Mayflowers set us up.

1004
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:54,651
Jumbo, we hardly knew you.

1005
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:59,931
Since you won't tell us
what we want to know...

1006
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:04,995
I think it's time for you to report
to the head office in heaven, Sis.

1007
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:08,941
If you see the big guy,
tell him He's a loser.

1008
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,875
That's it.

1009
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:23,446
That didn't hurt.

1010
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:26,050
No? Try this.

1011
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,904
What do you say now, you centrally
intelligent scumsicle?

1012
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:46,203
Getting old, George?

1013
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:58,516
Tommy, you New York Italian
father-made-$20-a-week son of a bitch!

1014
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,788
You were hired as bait.

1015
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,797
On this simple task,
you have betrayed me.

1016
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:06,390
- Do you have an answer why?
- I got five of them.

1017
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,665
One! Two!

1018
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:15,031
Three! Four!
Just one more.

1019
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,617
It didn't hurt.

1020
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,455
How do I stop?

1021
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,592
My hat.

1022
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,440
You've never fucked with anybody
from Hoboken before!

1023
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:53,047
Anna, we're supposed to be saving you.

1024
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:55,480
I'm sorry. I got bored,
so I saved myself.

1025
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,781
- We've got to get those crystals.
- Got 'em here, cowboy.

1026
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,447
"Got 'em here, cowboy."

1027
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,548
Sounds like Tommy.

1028
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,796
I won't be needing the car anymore.

1029
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:28,081
My pension!

1030
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,864
- Friend of yours?
- Dead!

1031
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,509
Hudson, look...

1032
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,048
out.

1033
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:23,633
Anna, Hawkmeister, you're probably
wondering why you're still alive.

1034
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:28,074
We're still having a problem
putting this damn crystal together.

1035
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:32,203
Alfie and I have been at it all night.
Well?

1036
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,044
What are you waiting for?

1037
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,821
- Don't do it.
- Relax.

1038
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:51,426
Besides, we don't have much choice,
do we?

1039
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,950
Oh, Hawk.

1040
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:24,556
Don't ever change.

1041
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,763
Nice Hawk.

1042
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,804
Bad Hawk!

1043
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:47,911
Why is the world jam-packed
with such idiots?

1044
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:52,953
Every schmoe has a fantasy
that the planet revolves around them.

1045
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,927
It rains.

1046
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:59,296
A car crash stops traffic.
You say, "How can this happen to me?"

1047
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:04,964
But for us, this isn't a fantasy.
It is a reality.

1048
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,099
Oh, yes!
If da Vinci was alive today...

1049
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:13,136
he'd be eating microwave sushi, naked in
the back of a Cadillac with both of us.

1050
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:18,847
The project of his life
is now the toy of mine.

1051
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,687
History, tradition, culture
are not concepts.

1052
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:27,023
These are trophies I keep in my den
as paperweights!

1053
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:30,758
The chaos we will cause the world
with this machine....

1054
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:34,131
will be our final masterpi<i>ece</i>!

1055
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,429
Go, team, go!

1056
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,303
Yes!

1057
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:56,989
Now!

1058
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:13,739
Eureka, motherfucker!

1059
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:13,841
You should feel good about yourself.

1060
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:17,106
You should feel good about yourself.

1061
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,169
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1062
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:21,977
What would happen if I didn't put
that crystal together right?

1063
01:30:22,049 --> 01:30:24,609
What do you mean?

1064
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:28,712
Let's say I left out
this little piece of mirror.

1065
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:32,521
- Would that be bad?
- Real bad.

1066
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:34,254
Good.

1067
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:09,795
How.

1068
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:11,229
Your turn.

1069
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,462
How'd it get to be my turn?
I just killed Darwin and Minerva.

1070
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:19,139
- Definitely your turn.
- Shit!

1071
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:22,900
Stay over here and
try to stay out of the way.

1072
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,002
- Hudson?
- What?

1073
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,467
- Thou shalt not kill!
- Sorry.

1074
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:04,611
No! Stop helping me.

1075
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,931
You won't be attending
that hat convention in July.

1076
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:27,967
- My turn?
- Yeah.

1077
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:34,446
What's with this dog?

1078
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,641
Bunny?

1079
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,545
Ball-ball.

1080
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:48,559
Come on, Puppy Chow.
Got to go.

1081
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,665
Here we go.

1082
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:25,990
Hang on.

1083
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:41,109
Leonardo!

1084
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:45,518
Go, Leonardo! Please, please!

1085
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:51,257
Oh, baby!

1086
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:53,957
Hi, kids!

1087
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:09,370
- Anna?
- Yes, Hudson?

1088
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:12,469
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

1089
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:16,940
Will you play Nintendo with me?

1090
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:19,816
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather play Nintendo with.

1091
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:34,391
Wait a minute.
What about your boss?

1092
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:36,959
- What boss?
- You know.

1093
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:39,563
Oh, I think He wants me
to keep an eye on you.

1094
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,131
I think He wants you
to keep an eye on me, too...

1095
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:45,042
'cause I've got criminal tendencies.

1096
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:47,342
- Can I buy you a cappuccino?
- Yes.

1097
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:50,350
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes.

1098
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:54,478
I wish Tommy were here.

1099
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:57,781
No way!

1100
01:34:57,858 --> 01:34:59,917
- That's not very nice.
- No way!

1101
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,689
Yes, way!

1102
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:07,364
Did I miss anything?

1103
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:10,768
You're supposed to be all cracked up
at the bottom of the hill.

1104
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:13,432
Air bags!
Can you fucking believe it?

1105
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,873
You're supposed to be blown up
into fiery chunks of flesh.

1106
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:18,275
Sprinkler system set up in the back.

1107
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:20,472
Can you fucking believe it?

1108
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:24,146
Yeah! That's probably what happened.

1109
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:27,187
Drink your cappuccino.

1110
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:28,687
Drink your coffee.

1111
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:44,802
<i>With the world saved,</i>
<i>and the secrets of da Vinci protected...</i>

1112
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:47,534
<i>Eddie finally got his coffee.</i>
