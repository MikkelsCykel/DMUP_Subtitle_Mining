1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,336
Yeah, I see fine. I just wanted to know
whether you knew where San Quentin was.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,772
And you do, don't you, asshole.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,482
Get you yet, you son of a bitch.

4
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,190
You always gotta do things your way,
don't you?

5
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,792
No wonder Briggs stays on your tail.

6
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:31,732
You do things someone else's way
and you take your life in your own hands.

7
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:53,990
That son of a bitch Guzman!

8
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:57,994
He hasn't gone out for almost
24 hours now.

9
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:26,457
Hey, one of our guys took a spill.

10
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:31,129
Lt's Charlie McCoy! Seems to be okay.

11
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:33,364
Let me take a look.

12
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,268
Yeah, he's okay.

13
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:48,914
There he is.

14
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:52,952
So, all you've got to do
is sit around all day, Guzman?

15
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:27,488
This coke is out of sight!

16
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:30,157
Oh, Guzman gets the best, baby.

17
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,461
Oh, you bitch. Don't spill it.

18
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,231
That stuff's worth $900 an ounce.

19
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,133
You better not spill it.

20
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,969
Don't get so uptight.

21
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:45,073
Nobody says "don't" to me.
You understand? Nobody.

22
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,511
Inver touch the stuff.

23
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:52,315
You want to put that over there now?

24
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,644
Take over for me, will you, Ed?

25
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,308
Damn, I wish something would happen.

26
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:50,844
Take it easy.

27
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,847
That's what stakeouts are all about.
Waiting.

28
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,398
No, please! No!

29
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:21,939
Frank!

30
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,649
-Just what the hell is going on?
-Somebody killed a cop.

31
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:37,753
Folks, there's been a little trouble here.
Everyone stand back.

32
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,755
Please, ma'am, move back.

33
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,560
There's been some trouble.

34
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:46,896
What happened?

35
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:50,399
Everything seems to be all right, folks.

36
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:51,835
What's going on?

37
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:55,839
Move it, people.

38
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,675
Please, sir, stand back.

39
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,443
Yes, sir.

40
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:03,113
Yes, sir.

41
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,551
No, sir. We won't let anything
out to the press.

42
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,187
Yes, sir.

43
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:13,458
You endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something.

44
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,459
Not to mention your own lives.

45
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,729
You blew the whole Palancio stakeout.

46
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:20,766
Instead of keeping him under surveillance
as I told you to...

47
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,203
...you had to harass him.
What do you have to say about that?

48
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,904
What do I tell Avery? What?

49
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:32,778
You tell him it's not Palancio.
You tell him it's a traffic cop.

50
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:35,715
A cop?

51
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:36,916
That's right.

52
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:39,419
A traffic cop. Are you out of your mind?

53
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,756
Do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop...

54
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,494
...is killing off all the top criminals
in the city? Who?

55
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:53,600
Lt's Charlie McCoy.

56
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:58,071
He's ready for the rubber gun squad.
He even tried to kill himself.

57
00:07:58,506 --> 00:07:59,773
Charlie McCoy.

58
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:06,246
Guzman was hit today.

59
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:10,785
A cop was killed. It was Charlie McCoy.

60
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:17,258
-McCoy?
-Yes, Charlie McCoy.

61
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:21,163
The only reason I don't bust you
into the bag this minute...

62
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:23,965
...is I know the two of you
were close friends.

63
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:27,969
I was just about to call his wife.
Or you can, if you want to.

64
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:29,771
I know he had kids.

65
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,774
Yeah!

66
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,879
-Who reported it?
-Davis.

67
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:37,146
Davis?

68
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,782
What happened
to the DiGiorgio stakeout team?

69
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,819
Lt was an accidental coincidence.
Davis happened to be going by, it happens.

70
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:46,023
McCoy was already dead
when he got there.

71
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,991
Any witnesses?

72
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,159
None.

73
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,398
- I'll make that call.
-Go ahead.

74
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:59,036
Harry, if it means anything coming
from me, I'm sorry about Charlie.

75
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:01,305
But it's Palancio, believe me.

76
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,243
I'll have a warrant in 48 hours.
You can pick him up.

77
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,678
He's all yours.

78
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,384
Well, thank you for coming, Harry.

79
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,054
You sure you have to leave?

80
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,591
I won’t have any place to go
for a sit-down dinner anymore.

81
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,429
Inver really did like it here very much.

82
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:59,200
I always liked the change of seasons.

83
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,275
I'm going to take him home. It's time.

84
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,379
Lt's time he went home.

85
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,087
Come on, kids, let's get in the car.

86
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:32,401
Lt was nice of that young man
to help us with the children.

87
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:38,241
Goodbye, Harry. We'll all miss you.

88
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:40,410
'Bye, doll.

89
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:50,121
Take them
to the passenger terminal, please.

90
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:03,334
Lt was nice of you to come out.
You didn't have to do that.

91
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:06,637
Lf I'd have been there sooner,
he might still be alive.

92
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:10,375
He didn't deserve to get it that way.

93
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,978
Lf there's anything I can do....

94
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,282
I feel responsible somehow.

95
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:49,149
The next shooter is Callahan.
Davis on deck.

96
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:34,130
You sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score, Harry.

97
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,133
I've never seen you smoother.

98
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,235
By the way, I personally want to tell you...

99
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:42,106
...how sorry I am
about what happened to Charlie.

100
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:47,477
What I can't figure out, Frank,
is how that kid, Davis, got in there first.

101
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:49,913
You guys were right across the street.

102
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:54,552
I don’t have a goddamned idea, Harry.
The kid came out of nowhere.

103
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:58,422
We were in that garage
before you could spit.

104
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,227
Maybe I'm slowing down in my old age
or something, I don't know.

105
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:06,965
I want to be the first to congratulate you
on what I think will be the winning score.

106
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,901
You shaded me by seven points.

107
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,770
The only person now
who has a chance is Davis.

108
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:18,778
Shoot 'em up!

109
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,851
I think the kid beat you, Harry.

110
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:00,322
Lt happens.

111
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,324
Harry, he edged you by four points.

112
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,195
That evens it up on the overall champion.

113
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,931
You have your choice in the shoot-off.

114
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,400
Bull's eye or combat?

115
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,538
Combat.

116
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:02,054
Out!

117
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:12,999
Five, 46 seconds. Score, perfect.

118
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:15,934
Good luck, sir.

119
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:57,112
A good guy!

120
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,814
That last one was a good guy!

121
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:15,297
36 seconds.
But I'm sorry, Harry, you hit a good guy.

122
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,800
You had a bad break.
Ideally don't deserve it.

123
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,102
You won, didn't you?

124
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:21,170
-Yes, sir, but--
-That's all that matters.

125
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,772
You mind if I try that one?

126
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,981
Chester, how about six?

127
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:52,137
Not bad. I seem to have lost the last one.

128
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:55,340
You get used to it.

129
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,712
I can see how you would, at that.

130
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:59,775
You said five minutes
and I've been waiting for a half an hour.

131
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,577
Don't you ever get hungry?

132
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:08,550
-It just didn't seem like a half hour.
-Yeah, well it has been.

133
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:12,255
I went over to my butcher's yesterday
and picked up some veal.

134
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:16,693
Pops is really an artist, man. I could
watch that man cut meat all day long.

135
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,097
Why don't you come home with me and....

136
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:23,100
My wife's a good cook.
Have a little dinner with us.

137
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:33,277
No, thanks. I just saw something
that killed my appetite.

138
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:45,490
We'll catch those animals with their pants
down. I was going to call you at home.

139
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,127
We got our search warrants
and multiple charges.

140
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,896
We're going to make a city-wide raid
tomorrow morning.

141
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,267
Palancio is yours.
Just don't take him out head-first, Harry.

142
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,405
I think you'll find what I want to show you
in ballistics very interesting.

143
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,176
You'll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning.

144
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,816
-Good morning, Harry. Sir.
-Walter.

145
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,151
Do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes?

146
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,153
Sure.

147
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:23,763
There's only two.

148
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,934
-l wonder what happened to the others.
-Federal boys have them.

149
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:50,826
Well?

150
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:52,961
Take a look.

151
00:19:58,134 --> 00:19:59,802
Close, real close.

152
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,906
But there's still a lot of lines
that don't match up.

153
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,375
All this proves is that these two bullets...

154
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,913
...came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling.

155
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:12,516
You don't think it would stand up
as evidence?

156
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:14,084
As it is, no.

157
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,053
But I'll have a full comparison report made,
no problem.

158
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:20,324
You're probably right.
Besides, it isn't necessary yet.

159
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,092
What do you mean, "yet"?

160
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,328
Where'd you get that slug?

161
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:28,166
- I'd just as soon not say for the time being.
-Don't play games on this.

162
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:29,834
Whose side are you on anyway?

163
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,570
Lt's just a wild shot
and I'm probably wrong.

164
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:35,506
I'd like to handle it my own way.

165
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:39,945
By the way, I'd like to have Davis
and Sweet as my back-up squad tomorrow.

166
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:43,215
They're just rookies for Christ's sake.

167
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:47,085
You drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and I'll use them.

168
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:49,721
Goddamn it,
there isn't supposed to be any shooting.

169
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:53,459
Besides, they don't have the experience yet
for a job like this.

170
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,530
How the hell's a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance?

171
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:59,632
And Davis is the new pistol champion.

172
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:01,868
Suppose they panic and start shooting?

173
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:09,076
Nothing wrong with shooting,
as long as the right people get shot.

174
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,229
-Let him know who you are and keep cool.
-Okay.

175
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:31,900
I want you to keep an eye
on Davis and Sweet.

176
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,000
What for?

177
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,769
Just do it, will you?

178
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:37,639
All right.

179
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:39,975
-You all set?
-All set.

180
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:41,744
We'll take off in three cars.

181
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,480
Davis and Sweet will make the arrest.
Early will cover.

182
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,850
I'll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it.

183
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:50,419
Lf there'll be trouble, that's where it'll start.

184
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:53,822
We're holding the other squads back
until you've made your arrest.

185
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:57,960
Yours is the most important, it'll be
the first. We don't want any foul-ups.

186
00:21:58,361 --> 00:21:59,862
-Right?
-Right.

187
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:05,335
I'd never walk up to a door with Harry,
too many people don't like him.

188
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:08,305
Thanks. I needed that.

189
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,444
-You boys ready?
-Yes, sir.

190
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:16,714
-Thank you for requesting us.
-Sir, we won't let you down.

191
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:18,649
Well, I'm depending on that.

192
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:27,221
Yeah?

193
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:31,760
Who is this?

194
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,035
What was that, Nickie?

195
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:47,443
Somebody said we'll be hit in two minutes.
They'll be dressed like cops.

196
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:51,381
Did it sound like anybody you know?

197
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,416
No, I couldn't tell.

198
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:11,002
Ed, Chuck...

199
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:15,772
...get over to the windows.

200
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:20,811
I got the water side.

201
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:23,014
I'll take the street side.

202
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:25,350
Lf they are cops, this could be a set-up.

203
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,453
After the holes they put in Ricca
you want me to wait and see?

204
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,489
Lf they're cops, they'll have papers.

205
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,924
Car coming, Frank.

206
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:34,660
There's a big guy out there.

207
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:40,732
-He got a uniform on?
-No.

208
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:45,605
He ain't no cop.
Cops always come in the front door.

209
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:47,273
Another car.

210
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:50,743
Why didn't they come in squad cars
if they're cops?

211
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,680
That big guy's working himself around
by those containers.

212
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:57,117
He's got a gun out.

213
00:24:57,985 --> 00:24:59,218
Two uniforms in it.

214
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:02,289
That ain't no cop's gun, Frank.

215
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:10,565
There's a cop in uniform coming up
to the door.

216
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:19,173
We aren't open. Come back tomorrow.

217
00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:22,644
Police officers,
we'd like to ask you some questions.

218
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:25,046
Yeah, I'm just a watchman. Nobody's here.

219
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:27,216
We're looking for Mr. Frank Palancio.

220
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:30,152
Would you open the door?
We have a warrant for his arrest.

221
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:32,021
I said nobody's here, goddamn it!

222
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,356
We have warrants
for a search of the premises.

223
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:35,324
Serve them!

224
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,342
They got Sweet! Send some help! Quick!

225
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:42,295
Cease firing.

226
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:45,798
Throw your weapons out and come out
with your hands behind your heads.

227
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,600
-Bullshit!
-Fuck you!

228
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:51,398
You sure you don't want a local for this?
Takes about seven stitches.

229
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:52,599
No, thanks.

230
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,103
Okay, it's your ass.

231
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:59,439
My head, cut's on my head.

232
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:04,179
Why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here?

233
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,381
Does he have to stay in here?

234
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:11,420
No, I could stop and let the man's
brains run out all over his shoes.

235
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:15,390
Rogers, I don't need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude.

236
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:17,226
A police officer is dead.

237
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:19,094
Sorry.

238
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:23,899
I got those warrants
for a search of the premises, Callahan...

239
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:26,935
...not for you to become
judge, jury and executioner.

240
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,038
Lt was supposed to be a simple arrest.

241
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:33,709
Arresting a killer like Palancio
isn't always simple.

242
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,645
People are guilty until proven--

243
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:36,580
I mean....

244
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:39,783
Goddamn it, you know what I mean.

245
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:43,287
The city's on the edge
of the worst violence in its history...

246
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:46,089
...and you have to start
full-scale military operations.

247
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:49,627
I didn’t start shooting at anyone
who didn't start shooting at me first.

248
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:53,965
Each time you pull out that gun,
my paperwork backs up for three months.

249
00:29:54,332 --> 00:29:57,101
The chief and I have already
conferred on this matter.

250
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:59,470
A full investigation is warranted here.

251
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:06,278
What about a dead cop?

252
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:11,249
-l warned you against taking them.
-Sweet was killed with the first shot.

253
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:15,420
Besides they were tipped off.
They knew we were coming, Briggs.

254
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:18,090
How? Don't hand me that crap.

255
00:30:18,757 --> 00:30:22,128
They knew we were coming.
After 200 arrests, I know the difference.

256
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:27,800
Lf I have my way, Callahan, you won't make
another arrest as long as you live.

257
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:31,504
Ls that all, Lieutenant?

258
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,307
No, that's not all.

259
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:37,544
I want that slug you showed me.

260
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,550
Iran that through ballistics, it was nothing.
The rifling was totally different.

261
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,320
Lt's still State's evidence.
I want it anyway.

262
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,326
Eat it.

263
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:19,521
Look, Harry, if it means anything,
I think you got the wrong end of the stick.

264
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,357
-You do?
-Yeah.

265
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:23,692
What did they find when they got in there?

266
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:27,263
Nothing. Palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be.

267
00:31:27,997 --> 00:31:30,066
They knew we were coming, Harry.

268
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:32,569
Why do you figure they opened up on us?

269
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:35,939
They must've thought
it was a set-up like the others.

270
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:38,375
-It was.
-No.

271
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,378
Lt was a set-up, Early.

272
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:47,385
What I'll lay on you seems so far-fetched,
I can’t even believe it myself.

273
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:51,622
I gave up being surprised
working with you anyway.

274
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:54,792
Would you be surprised if I told you...

275
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:58,897
...a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing?

276
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:01,133
See this?

277
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:04,069
I gave Briggs a phony for the time being.

278
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:07,138
This is a bullet I took out
of the target range.

279
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,208
Lt came from Davis' gun.

280
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,745
Lt matches up with the one
taken out of Charlie McCoy's body.

281
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,214
Davis? That's insane.

282
00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:19,118
Maybe so, but somebody tipped-off
Palancio that we were coming.

283
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:23,289
Wanting me killed or Palancio
or hopefully both.

284
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:26,159
Yeah, but Sweet died today.

285
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,429
Sweet was sacrificed.

286
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:33,833
What's more important if I'm right,
I'll be sacrificed.

287
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:37,504
They've gotta figure I told you,
which means you'll be sacrificed.

288
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:41,442
Yeah.

289
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:46,981
Lf anything happens to me,
I want you to give that to Lt. Briggs.

290
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,081
Okay.

291
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,018
What happens if they get us both?

292
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:51,753
Then they win.

293
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:58,460
Lt's not hard to understand
how this could happen, the way things are.

294
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:02,631
As incredible as it seems, there may be
a sub-organization within the police force.

295
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:06,468
Sort of a death squad
like they had in Brazil some years back.

296
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,637
Damn.

297
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:14,844
Some nights I wake up, wonder
where the hell the world's going to.

298
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:20,683
I want you to take care of yourself,
you understand?

299
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:54,219
Hi!

300
00:33:54,652 --> 00:33:55,687
Hi.

301
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,357
Jesus, what happened to your face?

302
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,893
Nothing, just a few stitches.

303
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:06,431
I was going to the market,
how about if I bring back a few beers?

304
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:09,335
Good, I could use a beer right about now.

305
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:11,771
I've got your key, so I'll get your mail, too.

306
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,071
All right, baby.

307
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:14,840
Keep it warm.

308
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:43,070
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop?

309
00:35:01,924 --> 00:35:04,059
You heroes have killed
a dozen people this week.

310
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:07,797
What are you gonna do next week?

311
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:12,101
Kill a dozen more.

312
00:35:13,603 --> 00:35:16,106
Ls that what you guys are all about,
being heroes?

313
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:17,907
All our heroes are dead.

314
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,143
We are the first generation...

315
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,311
...that's learned to fight.

316
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:26,016
We're simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught...

317
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:29,186
...and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly.

318
00:35:30,854 --> 00:35:34,291
We began with the criminals
that the people know...

319
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,629
...so that our actions would be understood.

320
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,535
Lt's not just a question
of whether or not to use violence.

321
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:47,706
There simply is no other way, inspector.

322
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,542
You of all people...

323
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,144
...should understand that.

324
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:58,817
Either you're for us or you're against us.

325
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:07,292
I'm afraid you've misjudged me.

326
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,992
-Hi, Sunny.
-Hi, Sue.

327
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,467
No, no!

328
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:24,104
Harry, what are you doing?

329
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:33,081
Hey, what's going on down here?

330
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:36,084
I'm taking the mailbox apart,
what does it look like?

331
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:38,520
-You people live here, don't you?
-Yeah.

332
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:42,424
What are you doing to the mailbox?
Did you lose you key?

333
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,860
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business.

334
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:48,964
That's my mailbox, too.
Don't you get smart with me!

335
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:52,634
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.

336
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,503
I'm calling the police.

337
00:38:55,438 --> 00:38:56,672
I am the police.

338
00:38:58,307 --> 00:38:59,174
What?

339
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,012
The cop that lives upstairs?

340
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:22,867
What's that?

341
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,370
Plastic explosive.

342
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:29,574
A bomb?

343
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:31,142
That's right.

344
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:34,479
If you'd bothered me anymore,
we'd all be stuck to the ceiling.

345
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:37,716
-Do you want to hold it?
-No. I don't want to get involved.

346
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,722
Go to your apartment and stay there.
Don't open for anybody.

347
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:18,622
Homicide, Lt. Briggs,
inspector Callahan calling.

348
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,428
Callahan, where are you?

349
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:26,264
Look, Briggs,
I just found a bomb in my mailbox.

350
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:29,167
I want you to get a man
over to Early's house right away.

351
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,301
What?

352
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,337
I've got a bomb right here!

353
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:34,673
Now get a man over to Early's,
you hear me?

354
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:36,441
Right.

355
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:39,945
Stay right where you are.
I'll be down there myself.

356
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:41,146
Don't move.

357
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,160
Yeah?

358
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,704
Come on in.

359
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,576
I don’t like looking down one of those.

360
00:42:44,013 --> 00:42:45,380
Where's the bomb?

361
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:47,883
Right on the dresser.

362
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:54,257
All right. Let's get out of here.

363
00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:57,026
Avery will want to see this.

364
00:43:07,705 --> 00:43:10,941
You mind driving?
I want to take a closer look at this thing.

365
00:43:33,298 --> 00:43:36,134
This thing could be activated
by your mailbox key.

366
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,770
Or by a timer.

367
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:43,843
Turn right, here.

368
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:50,116
Get on the freeway.

369
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:52,519
The freeway?

370
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,023
You got a new route to city hall,
Lieutenant?

371
00:44:03,998 --> 00:44:07,635
Your gun's out of its holster, Briggs.
First time?

372
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:10,004
You know you're not going to city hall.

373
00:44:10,104 --> 00:44:13,174
The only way you're going anywhere
is in a rubber bag.

374
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,176
Let me have your gun.

375
00:44:35,064 --> 00:44:36,365
Now the shells.

376
00:44:40,703 --> 00:44:43,339
Three. You always carry three.

377
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:50,413
Throw them out the window.

378
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:59,156
How do you figure on pulling this off,
Briggs?

379
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:03,026
Irun the investigation, with your record,
I can make anything stick.

380
00:45:04,228 --> 00:45:06,898
What I can't understand is,
why you of all people?

381
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:10,001
A hundred years ago in this city,
people did the same thing.

382
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:13,037
History justified the vigilantes,
we're no different.

383
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:17,041
Anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed.

384
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:21,913
-Evil for evil, Harry. Retribution.
-That's just fine.

385
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:24,516
But how does murder fit in?

386
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:27,853
When police start becoming
their own executioners...

387
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:30,022
...where's it gonna end, Briggs?

388
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,693
Pretty soon, you'll start executing people
for jaywalking.

389
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:36,361
And executing people for traffic violations.

390
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:40,767
Then you end up executing your neighbor
'cause his dog pisses on your lawn.

391
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,038
There isn't one man we've killed that
didn't deserve what was coming to him.

392
00:45:45,105 --> 00:45:47,440
Yes, there is. Charlie McCoy.

393
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:49,376
What would you have done?

394
00:45:49,443 --> 00:45:50,978
I'd have upheld the law.

395
00:45:51,078 --> 00:45:53,380
What the hell do you know about the law?

396
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:55,215
You're a great cop, Harry.

397
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:58,918
You had a chance to join the team,
but you'd rather stick to the system.

398
00:45:58,986 --> 00:46:02,556
Briggs, I hate the goddamn system.
But until someone comes along...

399
00:46:02,623 --> 00:46:05,459
...with some changes that make sense,
I'll stick with it.

400
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:08,129
You're about to become extinct.

401
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,469
Get off at the next exit.

402
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:20,380
Red?

403
00:55:51,246 --> 00:55:52,147
Red?

404
00:58:11,828 --> 00:58:15,632
Briggs was right.
You guys don't have enough experience.

405
00:58:56,442 --> 00:58:58,611
Just hold it right there, Callahan.

406
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:01,514
No tricks.

407
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,396
Your organization's through, Briggs.

408
00:59:16,964 --> 00:59:19,767
There's a lot more where they came from,
believe me.

409
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,204
Move out of the way. Move it!

410
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,501
Uphold the law.

411
00:59:55,171 --> 00:59:58,174
You just killed three police officers, Harry.

412
01:00:02,578 --> 01:00:05,182
And the only reason
I'm not gonna kill you...

413
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:08,785
...is because I'm gonna prosecute you
with your own system.

414
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:19,030
It’ll be my word against yours.

415
01:00:20,598 --> 01:00:22,433
And who's gonna believe you?

416
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:26,671
You're a killer, Harry. A maniac!

417
01:01:23,364 --> 01:01:25,700
A man's got to know his limitations.

418
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:36,700
