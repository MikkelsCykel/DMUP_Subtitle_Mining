1
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,839
"I REMEMBER"

2
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:24,912
The puffballs!

3
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:30,881
When the puffballs come, cold winter's almost gone.

4
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:41,131
When the puffballs soar, then winter's no more.

5
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:45,530
I've got the best one!

6
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:48,401
Ciccio, let's go to the seashore.

7
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,087
In our town, the puffballs and spring arrive together.

8
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:17,164
These are puffballs that are drifting around.

9
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:21,704
Soaring over the cemetery, where all rest in peace...

10
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:27,004
Soaring over the beach front and over the Germans, just arrived,

11
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:29,976
who don't feel the cold...

12
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,582
Drifting, drifting...

13
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,547
Swirling...

14
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,279
Swirling... swirling...

15
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:40,957
Drifting, drifting, drifting!

16
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:45,559
I'm the last of fourteen children

17
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,496
by then my father had had enough, so he called me "Definitivo."

18
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:53,700
Had he had enough sooner, there'd have been one less chatterer.

19
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,365
Good evening.

20
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:57,167
See you in the square.

21
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:05,073
I've come for my sister. Is it too early?  Your sister's here!

22
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:07,808
Fiorella, I've finished, come in!

23
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:11,617
I better calm you down, you horny beast. What a body!

24
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,748
The bonfire's bigger this year than it was last year.

25
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:19,690
Going to the bonfire tonight? What're you playing?

26
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:21,855
I've composed a brand new tune.

27
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,631
Listen to this.

28
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:45,582
Now, Dad, we'll watch them light the bonfire, then off to bed.

29
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,356
The doctor says you must go to bed early.

30
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:51,461
The doctor's an asshole. I'll go to bed when I please!

31
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,427
You'll end up in the hospital, and this time I'll leave you there.

32
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,359
Blockheads! Numbskulls!

33
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:08,644
Let me through! That's my place!

34
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:14,912
You creeps!

35
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:18,085
Let me through! Listen to this one!

36
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:22,651
A father can take care of 100 kids, but 100 kids

37
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:24,988
can't take care of one father. That's the gospel truth.

38
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:28,065
I want to set off a firecracker.  You stay here.

39
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,425
Hey, Giudizio, catch!

40
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:39,772
I can, I order and I want! Viva Giudizio!

41
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,610
Volpina, have you made love today?

42
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,153
How many men did you service?

43
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:55,714
I bet you even dip a cock in your morning coffee!

44
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,155
Here she is!

45
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:03,464
You're the greatest, Gradisca. Greta Garbo's got nothing on you!

46
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,270
Let's go over there.

47
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:15,475
Ronald Coleman, we're over here!

48
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,973
Giudizio, take this chair too.

49
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:22,979
Burn this one too! Put it on top.

50
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:25,917
Sit the old witch in it.

51
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,926
I'll stuff that chair down your throat! Take it home.

52
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:41,336
The old witch!

53
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,008
The old witch is here.

54
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:47,644
Let me wed her before you burn her!

55
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,186
What're you looking at?  I wasn't looking.

56
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:58,016
Keep still!

57
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,794
Don't look, otherwise you'll get too excited!

58
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:21,368
Bring the firecrackers!

59
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:24,310
Let's light the bonfire and burn the old witch.

60
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:50,070
Burn away, oh witch so old. Burn the winter and the cold.

61
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,540
Here's spring!

62
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:57,613
I don't have a match.  But your beloved has.

63
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:10,259
Viva the old witch! Viva Giudizio!

64
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:14,854
I can, I order and I want!

65
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,265
Where's the ladder?

66
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,003
Want it? Take it!

67
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:35,110
Want it? Take it!

68
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:37,254
Hurry, I'm burning!

69
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:46,125
In America, I saw bonfires 106 meters high.

70
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:49,494
When were you there?  My parents are American.

71
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:53,698
I'll break your neck!

72
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,032
You should hear what my father can do with his ass!

73
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,534
Hurrah for spring!

74
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:05,813
It gives me a funny feeling. Does it you?

75
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:09,475
Yes, but it's winter that's dying and spring is now here!

76
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:12,485
I can feel spring all over me already!

77
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:57,257
Our respects to you, milord. Our respects to you, ma'am.

78
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,403
Our respects to you, little countess.

79
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:09,944
Drink a little, it'll do you good! Even your aunt's drinking, look!

80
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:38,730
Good old Lallo! No one would know you're sixty.

81
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,072
Just take a look! Your brother really is an asshole!

82
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:45,510
He's only a youngster!

83
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:52,852
Now see the Malayan tiger leap!

84
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:58,020
Be careful! You'll catch it when we get home.

85
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,463
The heel's come off. He'll just have to do without one!

86
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:03,691
Where's that other useless ass gone?

87
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,570
Ciccio, throw the big bang on the fire!

88
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,676
Off to bed with you! I'll put you all in boarding school!

89
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:23,209
Here's Scureza di Corpolo~, "The Fart." Go to it, Scureza!

90
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,354
Scureza di Corpolo~! Bravo!

91
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:52,541
The origins of this town are lost in the mists of time.

92
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,914
In the Municipal Museum, there are stone implements...

93
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:59,188
All the best.  My respects.

94
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:02,291
...that date back to prehistoric times.

95
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,394
I myself have found some graffiti of great age

96
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:07,895
on the walls of caves in Count Lovignano's estate.

97
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:13,367
Be that as it may, the first certain date is 268 B.C.

98
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:17,803
when this became a Roman colony and the start of the Emilian Way.

99
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:19,504
Mr. Lawyer!

100
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:28,451
This, too, is characteristic of the spirit of these people

101
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:31,918
who have Roman and Celtic blood in their veins.

102
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,616
Theirs is an exuberant, generous, tenacious nature.

103
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:44,599
Dante, Pascoli, D'Annunzio and many others have lauded this land

104
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:48,727
while innumerable are its sons who have contributed greatly

105
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:52,103
to the arts, science, religion and politics.

106
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:57,613
Who are you? Trying to be clever,

107
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,908
but too gutless to show yourself.

108
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:06,519
Come out and show yourself! I'll explain everything face to face.

109
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,600
Mr. Lawyer!  Sure... sure.

110
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:28,641
Shut up, you delinquents!

111
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,256
Shall we all take our places?  If you insist, headmaster...

112
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:46,953
But I never come out well in photographs.

113
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:51,329
You boys at the back... get on the bench!

114
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,973
Now what, De Santis?  It wasn't me, sir!

115
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,870
Aldina!

116
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:23,933
Doesn't it look like you?

117
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:29,567
What's happening?  Gigliozzi! Be seated!

118
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,513
Put it down her neck. Hold it like that, please.

119
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,744
What is this?  A stone.

120
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:46,548
Y es, but what is it?  I know, it's for a slingshot.

121
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:48,787
Is it an elephant's testicle?

122
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,490
It is a pendulum.

123
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:55,488
You certainly all know a pendulum clock.

124
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,533
And how does it go? tick... tock...

125
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:14,750
Where did Tiberius retire to when he gave up leadership of the Empire?

126
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:16,510
To Capri.

127
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:28,695
When was Agrippina killed?  69 A.D.

128
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:33,760
Why have you given me a zero? Wasn't it 69?

129
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,205
It was 59 A.D.!  Are you sure?

130
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:43,613
What do you mean, sure! It was 59 A.D.!

131
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:45,976
Oh, damn it! I knew it was!

132
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,750
You'll drive me crazy! Get back to your seat!

133
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,316
What have I done? Why couldn't it have been 69?

134
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:01,020
There will come the day when a renewed ltaly

135
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,133
will take to the field of battle on her own behalf

136
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:07,793
and not be defending her soil for others, with their weapons.

137
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:11,839
Universal, being Spirit incarnate in the State

138
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,376
and cannot but enter into the true nature of the Church.

139
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,308
This reconciliation between State and Church occurred through

140
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:24,045
a Demiurge which brought order to members of State and Church

141
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:28,987
demanding iron discipline and the right to intervene

142
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,093
in all aspects of individual life.

143
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:34,591
He is God's chosen Son

144
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:37,199
because he has the same power as the Father.

145
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:41,896
Then there is the Holy Spirit to be placed on the same level

146
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:44,632
as the Father and the Son. Is that clear?

147
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:48,277
This is why God is one and also a Trinity.

148
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:55,040
I'll speak about the great Giotto...  Whose balls exploded like this!

149
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:58,377
Do you know, boys and girls

150
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,854
why Giotto is important in Italian painting?

151
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:08,393
I will tell you. Because he invented perspective.

152
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,360
Remember, per spec tive!

153
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:19,806
Miss, can I leave the room? Bobo's let a real stinker!

154
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:21,803
What do you mean?

155
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:29,275
You're nuts! It's not true, I never fart!  You do! You do!

156
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:32,521
Alboin...

157
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:39,254
signed the peace. Gigliozzi! Outside!

158
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,328
Now, this is not difficult. Solve it.

159
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,243
Why have you stopped? You were doing fine.

160
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:00,280
What did you want to do?

161
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:03,947
Give me a clue.  Pass it to me.

162
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:09,320
Just think a moment. X9 plus the square root of K3.

163
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:12,953
It's so obvious!

164
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:18,033
Move over. What have you done here?

165
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:22,970
We'll go through it together. What is written here?

166
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:28,039
What is written here, I say? You must know how to read!

167
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,111
But I...  Keep quiet!

168
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:42,654
X9 plus the square root of K3...

169
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:47,254
Here's the solution.

170
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:50,962
X1 = 140...
X1 = 140...

171
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:54,865
X2 = 3/5ths of the total, less the difference.

172
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:56,437
Is that clear?

173
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:03,507
What have you done? Are you crazy?

174
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:06,075
Janitor! Janitor!

175
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,533
Greek is so beautiful, isn't it?  You betcha!

176
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:27,161
Don't you think it is so musical?

177
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:31,732
Emarpszamen! Repeat after me.

178
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:38,447
Be quiet! Now try again.

179
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:41,748
Please, teacher, could you be so kind...

180
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:44,854
Could I hear it again?

181
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:48,890
Certainly. Look: Emar pszamen.

182
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,258
Careful with the tongue...

183
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:55,956
it must go here, against the palate...

184
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,465
then spit it out.

185
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:08,642
Silence!

186
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,522
Come on now. Greek is so difficult.

187
00:20:21,992 --> 00:20:23,323
How did you put your tongue?

188
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:28,424
Not that way, between your teeth.

189
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:31,291
Like this?  Right!

190
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,999
Go back to your seat, damn it!  I nearly got it, that time.

191
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,278
Who's that?  It's Ciccio.

192
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:51,614
Leave me the butt.  Just one drag.

193
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:56,250
Is it true that Aldina's ripped up your poem?

194
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,723
But, I've written another!

195
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:01,759
"What a kind, gentle maiden art thou, Aldina.

196
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:07,132
"You set my heart beating like a steam hammer"

197
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:13,474
It's pretty warm outside.  I prefer Aldina's mother.

198
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,869
Who'll be on the beach this morning?

199
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:33,361
Fu Manchu!

200
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:54,710
Volpina! Come here!

201
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,550
What do you want here?

202
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:07,426
I've lost my pussycat.

203
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:14,664
There's no cats here. Go home.

204
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:22,768
It's hot, isn't it? Aren't you all hot?

205
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:27,543
What an odd girl you are.

206
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:31,312
Come on now, go home. There's no cats here.

207
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:37,156
Boss, "Mortar" has written another poem.

208
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:39,561
When do you manage to write these poems?

209
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,899
"Mortar " let's hear this poem.

210
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:45,458
O.K., let's hear it.

211
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:50,839
What's its title?  "Bricks"

212
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:55,140
"My grandfather made bricks

213
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:57,610
"My father made bricks

214
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:01,581
"I make bricks too, but where's my house?"

215
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:09,582
Bravo! I get your point!

216
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,459
It's quite right. But I, too, was once a poor man

217
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,064
and I have gradually worked my way up to master builder.

218
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,433
You can't get everything at once!

219
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:22,494
You have to be patient, you have to work.

220
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,908
By working, one can. You must work.  Aren't we working?

221
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,542
That's enough!

222
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:37,553
No drinking before the soup!

223
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:41,521
Where have you read that?

224
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:44,159
It blows up the stomach. I read it in the Sunday paper.

225
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:47,956
Keep your hands to yourself!  There's a spoon missing.

226
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,661
Is it hot, Lallino?  A little.

227
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:57,201
I want a lot.  You'll get your share.

228
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:02,478
Would you like some more, Lallo? There's some left, you know.

229
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,578
Is there enough salt?  Yes, Grandpa.

230
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:14,022
Give him a little.  He's already eaten.

231
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,626
My father's father was known as "Big Meat"

232
00:24:18,128 --> 00:24:20,858
He lived to be 107 and he was still doing it!

233
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:29,765
And so?  And so then...

234
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,173
When I was little, he taught me you have to eat at 11 in the morning

235
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:39,475
before the sun burns your head, and at 4 in the afternoon,

236
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:44,143
otherwise food's like poison that gets into your blood.

237
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:46,986
Aren't you eating?  No!

238
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,690
What have you done to her?

239
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:54,093
Nothing!

240
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:56,493
They've done nothing.

241
00:24:57,233 --> 00:25:00,760
Bloody hell! Get up at 4 in the morning...

242
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:02,427
Slave away all day like a mule.

243
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:07,805
Then come home to eat some bread and see a bunch of long faces...

244
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,644
Well, now you'll see no more of them!

245
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:17,384
Ma'am, it's time to take the boiler off.

246
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:23,420
What's the matter?  Nothing!

247
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:26,221
Well, eat something, then.  I don't want anything!

248
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:28,330
Why?  Because I don't!

249
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,396
Shut the door, it's cold.

250
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,199
I'm still convalescent.

251
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,335
Who can it be at this hour?  How would I know!

252
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:43,171
Shall I see who it is?  Y es, you go.

253
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:48,978
What do you think my bottom is? Holy water?

254
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,887
Chicken always gets stuck between my teeth.

255
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:54,647
Can I have some more, Dad?

256
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:58,850
A wing.  Stop there! I'll give it to you!

257
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:05,025
Have you put mint in it, Miranda?  No, not mint! Sage!

258
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:09,133
But you realized there was something different, didn't you?

259
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:11,300
Lallino has a good palate.

260
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:14,269
Gina! Who is it?

261
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,383
Mr. Biondi.

262
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:25,047
He's the bishop's cousin, isn't he?

263
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:29,247
What's all this? Anyone'd think I never fed you!

264
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:32,521
Uncle, look!

265
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,493
If your dad sees you...!

266
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:40,259
Uncle, do that trick for us. Come on, just once.

267
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:43,470
Look, Titta!

268
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:47,139
Bravo!

269
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:50,837
It's difficult, isn't it?  Well, you know...

270
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:06,385
Good wine, this Sangiovese.

271
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:10,960
Where were you last night?

272
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:14,661
At the cinema.  What was on?

273
00:27:16,272 --> 00:27:21,574
The Americans were trying to get into Comanche territory

274
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:24,612
and they'd built a bridge for the railway, but the lndians

275
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:29,218
shot arrows at them from above. It was a massacre, Dad!

276
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,214
I'll massacre you, you little criminal!

277
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,449
What's happened now?

278
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:34,912
I didn't do anything!

279
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:39,887
I'll put you in the hospital if I catch you!

280
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,531
Aurelio, people are watching!

281
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:49,796
Starting tomorrow, no more school, no more allowance.

282
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:51,770
He can start working with me!

283
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:55,541
But will you pay me?  With a hammer in the face!

284
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:59,244
You have to tell me who fathered this piece of shit!

285
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:02,179
At his age, I'd been working three years!

286
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:05,080
Y eah, I know. And gave all the money to Grandma!

287
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:07,655
That's enough now! Let's all go and eat.

288
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:10,289
Good day to you.

289
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:16,224
Everyone in town laughs at us, even the roosters.

290
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:22,700
In my own home, I'll do as I please!  Listen to His Royal Highness!

291
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:27,331
Give me your brother's plate.

292
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:31,342
Put that plate down.  What has he done?

293
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,279
I'll show you what he's done.

294
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:36,440
What has he done?

295
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,050
What has he done?  I don't know.

296
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:47,486
This is Mr. Biondi's hat. He was at the cinema last night.

297
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:49,529
Just smell it. Know who did that?

298
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:52,896
That brat of a son of yours.

299
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:56,469
He pissed over the rail of the balcony, right on Biondi's head.

300
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:59,199
That cost me three bills!

301
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:01,970
I'm sure it was those juvenile delinquents he hangs around with!

302
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:05,705
That's enough! You've got to stop taking his side.

303
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:08,442
He's getting worse and worse!

304
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:12,076
They're a pair of little criminals! You've educated them wrong!

305
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:18,160
O.K., you do it! Let's see how well you do!

306
00:29:18,328 --> 00:29:24,324
I can't stand any more! I'm going crazy! I'm going mad!

307
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,469
I'll kill the lot of you!

308
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:37,439
I'll put strychnine in your soup! That's what I'll do!

309
00:29:42,886 --> 00:29:43,853
1... 2... 3...
1... 2... 3...

310
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:53,361
But I'll kill myself first! Right now!

311
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:58,827
You'll see! I'll kill myself first!

312
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:03,094
Uncle, look at Dad!

313
00:30:12,215 --> 00:30:15,981
Why does everything happen to me? What have I done?

314
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,798
God damn it all!

315
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:34,893
Have you hurt yourself?  What are you doing on the floor?

316
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:59,723
Good evening, headmaster.

317
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:09,769
There's Gradisca! Where is she! Over there...

318
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:24,116
If you give the archbishop permission

319
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:27,051
to sell holy pictures in the schools,

320
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:30,249
we can settle the matter between us.

321
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:46,237
When are you showing "The Vale of Love" with Gary Cooper?

322
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:47,933
Next week, my dear.

323
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,477
When can your little prince come to bed with you?

324
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:54,816
You'll get my bag round your ear!

325
00:31:57,086 --> 00:31:58,519
Such behavior!

326
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,652
Get lost, Giudizio!

327
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:06,357
It was lovely... I really had a good cry!

328
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:09,964
Romanesque, 13th century, perfect condition.

329
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:18,504
Mullion window... Excuse me, I'll continue later.

330
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:23,636
Lallo, read the telegram "White Feather" got from Stockholm.

331
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:27,907
"Come immediately, I cannot live without you. Inge"

332
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:31,043
Is she the bucktoothed one from last summer?

333
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,917
Are you going? It'll be cold up there now!

334
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:43,798
If I shot them, they'd call me a murderer!

335
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,761
I'd throw them all in quicklime!

336
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,302
Get the hell out of here!

337
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:58,504
I couldn't leave Mamma behind for those buck teeth.

338
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:01,945
Look at Madam's new girls.

339
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:07,215
Just look!

340
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:18,399
See that big one with the hat?

341
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:24,261
I'm here!

342
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:26,669
Here I am, too!

343
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,040
With the sacred right of a place in the sun...

344
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:37,710
He was a lovely man, a lot like Wallace Beery.

345
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:40,913
Do you remember? With that beard, he looked like a French duke.

346
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,177
That's a great load!

347
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:00,928
Good night, King Vittorio, good night, everybody!

348
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:06,730
This is the Victory Monument we used to visit everyday.

349
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,475
And I dreamt about it at night, too.

350
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:16,348
I'm going, Mamma.  Make a good confession.

351
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,244
If you've had a drink, you can't receive Communion.

352
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:22,323
You can drink, but you can't eat.

353
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:26,291
You can't drink either. And tell him you're a delinquent.

354
00:35:26,462 --> 00:35:30,694
That you make your parents angry... that you answer back.

355
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,299
And that you curse everything, understand?

356
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:42,004
Who's the first?

357
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:00,222
When did you last confess?  Christmas.

358
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:04,389
Oh, lovely. Do you go to mass?  Not when I've got the mumps.

359
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:06,797
Do you honor your parents?  Oh, yes.

360
00:36:07,236 --> 00:36:12,435
Not like that! White flowers on one side, yellow on the other.

361
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:16,303
It's not the same thing, it's all matter of aesthetics.

362
00:36:18,648 --> 00:36:20,707
Well, do you honor your parents?

363
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,219
Oh, yes, but they don't honor me. They beat me.

364
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:28,480
You must annoy them. Do you tell lies?

365
00:36:28,658 --> 00:36:31,718
I have to.  Do you covet what belongs to others?

366
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:34,385
The small flowers in the small vases.

367
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:37,122
What do you covet?

368
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:42,235
My pal Bragger's got a raincoat with a lot of metal buckles

369
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:44,896
Iike the one the detective has in the William Powell Myrna Loy films.

370
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,903
Do you commit impure acts? Do you touch yourself?

371
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:50,777
Do you know Saint Louis cries when you touch yourself?

372
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:58,213
Let him cry... I'm not going to say whether I do

373
00:36:58,354 --> 00:37:02,814
because you'll only tell Dad. Don't say you don't touch yourself.

374
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:08,954
Can you avoid touching yourself when you see her at the tobacconist's

375
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:11,964
as stacked as she is, when she says "Export brand"?

376
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:19,307
And the math teacher who looks just like a lion? Madonna...

377
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,744
How can you avoid touching yourself when she looks at you that way?

378
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:29,242
What do you think we come to see on Saint Anthony's day when

379
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:32,251
there's the benediction of the animals  the sheeps' butts?

380
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,242
See how he's looking at me? How can I tell him about Volpina

381
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:02,181
when I fixed her bike tires.

382
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:11,792
Did you know people kissed that way, with tongues going in and out?

383
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:14,555
I ask the questions, not you. Go on.

384
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:18,524
Then, there's Gradisca. Last summer,

385
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:21,693
I saw her going into the cinema.

386
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:26,802
Not because... You see... I'm crazy about Gradisca.

387
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,803
I want a wife like her.

388
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:35,045
She was alone.

389
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:38,513
She was there, in front of me.

390
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:47,793
I changed seats...

391
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:53,166
I changed seats again...

392
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,864
then again.

393
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,514
And finally...

394
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,633
"Looking for something?"

395
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:35,607
I sat there like an asshole.

396
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:37,774
I could have jumped in the harbor.

397
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:44,081
Father Balosa can't understand such things, so I said to him

398
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:47,653
that I'd touched myself once, just a little,

399
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,381
but I repented immediately.

400
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:54,485
He was happy with that. He gave me three Our Fathers,

401
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:56,221
Hail Mary's and Glorias and that was it.

402
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,133
Three Our Fathers, Hail Mary's and Glorias.

403
00:40:08,277 --> 00:40:11,041
Do you touch yourself? Just look at those rings

404
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:14,614
under your eyes! Yes, you obviously do.

405
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,513
Yes, just once in the garage.

406
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,718
Keep still! Always touching me.

407
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:30,297
Jean Harlow! Gradisca!

408
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:33,128
The tobacconist's tits!

409
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:35,434
The girl at the circus!  Which one?

410
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:38,095
The one in the fishnet! Aldina!

411
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:41,274
No, Aldina's mine! I'll smack your face!

412
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:38,026
There he is!

413
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:14,669
Comrades! Salute the Duce!

414
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:20,136
We hail the Duce with grateful hearts and the Fascist salute!

415
00:42:21,844 --> 00:42:25,371
The greeting of lmperial Rome

416
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:27,612
which shows us

417
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:31,913
the path of destiny to be followed by Fascist ltaly.

418
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,767
Let me touch him! I want to touch him!

419
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:57,476
Viva il Duce!

420
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:26,138
Ninety nine per cent of the population carry the party card.

421
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:30,237
We have 1200 Young Fascists, 3000 Young Italian Girls

422
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:32,846
and 4000 Sons of the She Wolf.  A single Fascist heart

423
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:35,916
but the work on the sea front needs hurrying up.

424
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:40,749
This marvelous enthusiasm makes us young but so old at the same time.

425
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:44,950
Young, because Fascism has rejuvenated our blood

426
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:47,755
with shining ideals that are very ancient.

427
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,866
All I can say is... Mussolini's got two balls this big!

428
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:58,597
Today, April 21st, we celebrate the birth of Rome, the Eternal City.

429
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:02,308
What does that mean? It means we must respect the monuments,

430
00:44:02,478 --> 00:44:06,073
the ruins that Rome has left us.

431
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:10,116
That is what I am doing, despite being razzed at night.

432
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:24,727
Why don't we see on this glorious sun filled day,

433
00:44:25,868 --> 00:44:29,497
the Italian sun, to which no one can apply sanctions,

434
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,231
is a Divine sign that the heavens are on our side!

435
00:44:34,276 --> 00:44:35,300
Miranda!

436
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,738
Who locked the gate?  I did!

437
00:44:39,915 --> 00:44:42,281
Why?  You know why!

438
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:46,547
You've heard what's been going on in the piazza all day.

439
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:51,216
Open up, I have things to do!  You're staying at home!

440
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:55,352
If I want to be a widow, I'll kill you myself.

441
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,590
I'll strangle you with your neckerchief!

442
00:44:57,766 --> 00:45:00,428
Think I'm scared of those black shirted lice?

443
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,701
Give me the key!

444
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:13,371
Damn it all... why is it that whenever there's a meeting going on

445
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:17,041
I have to stay home! That's the last straw!

446
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:32,363
These youth are sturdy as rock!

447
00:45:33,202 --> 00:45:35,329
Y es, yes, sturdy as a rock!

448
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:41,569
One, two, three, four,

449
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:45,270
five, six, seven...

450
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:52,650
Hail to the Duce!

451
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:13,000
Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi...

452
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:18,502
do you wish to marry Young Italian, Aldina Cordini?

453
00:46:19,982 --> 00:46:23,349
And you, Young Italian, Aldina Cordini...

454
00:46:23,986 --> 00:46:28,980
do you wish to marry Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi?

455
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:31,286
Bravo, Ciccio!

456
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,776
Camerati, they say bread and work,

457
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:57,043
but wouldn't bread and wine be better?

458
00:47:04,993 --> 00:47:06,893
A Fernet... A coffee... Fernet!

459
00:47:08,163 --> 00:47:09,460
Just a soft drink.

460
00:47:10,265 --> 00:47:13,257
For our "camerata the Federale"! Three cheers!

461
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:25,572
Difficult shot! Difficult shot!

462
00:47:26,081 --> 00:47:27,878
Quite, Your Excellency, a difficult shot!

463
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:42,562
I wouldn't like to go up against him!

464
00:47:51,306 --> 00:47:53,900
Who doused the lights? Attilio, light a candle.

465
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:55,876
Light the candle.

466
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,413
There's a gramophone upstairs.

467
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:04,215
What're you saying?

468
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:07,385
Silence!

469
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:09,919
That's the lnternationale!

470
00:48:10,926 --> 00:48:13,918
What's the lnternationale?  The hymn of subversives.

471
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:17,388
Where is it? Where's it coming from? Where're you hiding, you miserable?

472
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:19,725
It's incredible!

473
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:24,672
Let's see you, you coward!

474
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:30,972
We await your orders, sir!

475
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:35,542
Everyone's to go home!

476
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:38,783
Close the windows!

477
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:45,591
Get inside you! Go home!

478
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:52,090
What're you doing there? Get home with you!

479
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:11,583
Hey! He's up there!

480
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:15,255
He's in the bell tower.

481
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,196
To arms, to arms, to arms

482
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:04,031
We are Fascists. We fight against the Communists...

483
00:50:35,303 --> 00:50:36,531
You're free.

484
00:50:37,772 --> 00:50:42,471
You can go home. You see! The Fascists aren't all that bad.

485
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:46,177
They've not even harmed a single hair.

486
00:50:47,315 --> 00:50:50,307
We almost offered you coffee as well.

487
00:50:50,886 --> 00:50:52,581
Good night, sunny boy!

488
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:57,224
Bring him here.

489
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,102
Take your hat off.

490
00:51:14,276 --> 00:51:17,404
I'm sorry, it's a habit... even at home.

491
00:51:18,413 --> 00:51:20,438
Why don't you use the Roman style of greeting?

492
00:51:22,284 --> 00:51:24,650
I didn't know it was mandatory.

493
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,883
I don't know anything about politics.

494
00:51:27,756 --> 00:51:29,280
Sit down!

495
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:32,618
So you don't know anything about politics!

496
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:36,029
Y et you have been heard to say:

497
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,828
"If Mussolini continues like this, I really don't know"

498
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:44,901
What do you mean by "I really don't know"?

499
00:51:47,142 --> 00:51:49,201
I never said anything like that.

500
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:53,236
I generally only talk about my work. Perhaps I said...

501
00:51:53,415 --> 00:51:57,044
I really don't know about politics, how it works...

502
00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:00,484
Is that a threat?  Certainly not!

503
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:03,781
Lack of faith in Fascism?  No, why?

504
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:08,487
Subversive propaganda, perhaps?  No, there's no reason for it.

505
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:18,038
And you know nothing about the gramophone?  The gramophone?

506
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,670
Don't try to be a wise guy! Answer!

507
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:27,241
They woke me from my sleep. I didn't even have time to put my tie on.

508
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:35,716
Your tie or your anarchist's neckerchief?  What neckerchief?

509
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:44,927
Would you like to drink a toast to the victory of Fascism?

510
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:49,867
Well, really at this time...

511
00:52:50,038 --> 00:52:51,596
At this time...

512
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:57,868
You fools! Trying our patience in this way!

513
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:01,812
You must drink to a Fascist victory, my friend.

514
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,814
We don't want to crack your skulls to make you understand

515
00:53:04,953 --> 00:53:07,945
that Fascism is for your protection, for your dignity.

516
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:11,657
Go to hell, you ignorant bunch of animals!

517
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:18,296
This is castor oil.  Drink it!

518
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:22,296
Why should I drink it? What have I done?

519
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,237
What are you doing? Leave me alone! What are you doing?

520
00:53:30,278 --> 00:53:33,213
Be good! Open your mouth!

521
00:53:33,748 --> 00:53:36,683
Open your mouth! Don't make me angry!

522
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:40,652
Drink it down, it'll do you good!

523
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:44,791
Just look at the state he's in... a man of his age. It's shameful!

524
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:48,726
What're you doing, vomiting on my shoes?

525
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:57,398
This is what saddens us, this utter refusal to understand. Why?

526
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:01,672
Why, I ask?

527
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:04,209
There must be something wrong with your head.

528
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:07,075
Have some more... it'll clear your ideas!

529
00:54:08,817 --> 00:54:11,149
You'll pay for this!  Well, just send us the bill.

530
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,892
Good Heavens, it's two o'clock!

531
00:54:18,473 --> 00:54:19,462
Aurelio!

532
00:54:26,614 --> 00:54:27,876
What's happened?

533
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:58,072
You won't listen to me!

534
00:55:00,148 --> 00:55:01,775
You'll see!

535
00:55:10,158 --> 00:55:11,750
Get up...

536
00:55:15,797 --> 00:55:17,662
Dry yourself.

537
00:55:21,836 --> 00:55:23,269
Don't catch cold.

538
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:29,971
Dad!

539
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,512
Go to bed!

540
00:55:33,848 --> 00:55:35,782
God, what a stink!

541
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:43,380
If the person who squealed is the one I think it is,

542
00:55:43,558 --> 00:55:46,527
he'd better move to another continent

543
00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:49,891
because I'll eat his guts I'll eat his balls!

544
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:54,627
Traitorous son of a bitch!

545
00:56:00,308 --> 00:56:01,639
The Grand Hotel.

546
00:56:02,243 --> 00:56:05,212
I call her the "Old Lady".

547
00:56:06,047 --> 00:56:09,881
I come here every year to sip the nectar of love.

548
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:13,553
I give kindness and I yearn for kindness.

549
00:56:14,222 --> 00:56:17,214
I'm the only one in town to visit the Grand Hotel.

550
00:56:17,391 --> 00:56:20,019
They say Gradisca was here once.

551
00:56:20,194 --> 00:56:23,459
It was because of that highly improbable adventure

552
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:26,122
that she came to be called Gradisca.

553
00:56:26,934 --> 00:56:30,870
Her real name is Ninola. But three years ago...

554
00:56:31,038 --> 00:56:32,562
one winter night...

555
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,640
Don't let us down, Ninola!

556
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,709
The Prince is a handsome man, you know.

557
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:42,712
If he looks like he's satisfied, mention the work on the harbor.

558
00:56:42,884 --> 00:56:45,079
It'll only take a word from him.

559
00:56:45,253 --> 00:56:47,221
Be polite, speak Italian.

560
00:56:47,688 --> 00:56:50,919
He's a real prince, not just any old asshole.

561
00:56:51,092 --> 00:56:54,459
It's a great opportunity for you, too. The harbor.

562
01:00:17,565 --> 01:00:19,260
Oh, Mister Prince, sir...

563
01:00:21,469 --> 01:00:23,027
Gradisca! (Whatever you desire)

564
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:27,799
That's how Ninola came to be called Gradisca.

565
01:00:28,576 --> 01:00:31,044
I don't think there's a lot of truth in this story.

566
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:33,544
Nor in the one that Biscein tells.

567
01:00:34,015 --> 01:00:37,416
He's an inveterate liar. He invents a new one each day.

568
01:00:38,152 --> 01:00:40,052
A couple of years back...

569
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:43,156
an Emir arrived with thirty concubines.

570
01:00:43,758 --> 01:00:45,350
I saw him arrive.

571
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:36,660
The Emir locked all thirty rooms every night up tight.

572
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:41,604
That is quite true, but the rest of Biscein's story has holes in it.

573
01:02:44,612 --> 01:02:48,514
The silly man claims that on that very night...

574
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,583
Beans, olives, toasted melon seeds!

575
01:03:16,076 --> 01:03:18,340
Here I am, here I am, girls!

576
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,513
Come on, Biscein!

577
01:03:32,693 --> 01:03:35,924
Sweet Jesus, the pussy!

578
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:33,843
He claims that making no distinction between the beautiful and the ugly,

579
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:36,285
he polished off 28 of them that night!

580
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,196
Uncle!

581
01:04:48,035 --> 01:04:52,131
Are you Polish? Because only Poles have this fire in their eyes.

582
01:04:54,842 --> 01:04:56,400
My uncle dances very well!

583
01:05:10,424 --> 01:05:12,790
Commander! Ladies!

584
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:18,259
Then you must be Czech! Because only Czech women

585
01:05:19,537 --> 01:05:21,004
have this fire in their eyes.

586
01:05:21,172 --> 01:05:24,141
I now Italian: "bellissima," "Buonasera" (good evening)

587
01:05:24,308 --> 01:05:26,742
"Michelangelo," "Fanculo" (fuck you), "O sole mio."

588
01:05:45,963 --> 01:05:47,123
Good evening.

589
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:06,416
Uncle!. Uncle!.  Get out of here!.

590
01:06:06,585 --> 01:06:08,644
Jesus, the waiter asshole... asshole... asshole.

591
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:31,305
Seen the sea?  The sea?

592
01:06:32,144 --> 01:06:34,977
Come and take a walk with me. Let's go!.

593
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:43,915
Leopardi wrote poetry. Do you know Leopardi?

594
01:06:44,656 --> 01:06:46,920
No, this is my first time here.

595
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:54,694
Dante Alghieri here, Leopardi here, or even here!.

596
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,558
Oh, good!

597
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:00,466
Skol!

598
01:07:15,787 --> 01:07:17,277
How did it go?

599
01:07:17,489 --> 01:07:21,448
Fine, it's always a pushover with Germans.

600
01:07:22,828 --> 01:07:24,693
She's really fallen for me.

601
01:07:25,898 --> 01:07:29,493
And to prove it, she even offered me posterior intimacy.

602
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:55,784
Uncle! Uncle!

603
01:07:56,895 --> 01:07:58,920
Uncle Teo was Dad's brother.

604
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:02,764
We went to take him for a ride every month, in the summer.

605
01:08:03,302 --> 01:08:04,326
He's coming.

606
01:08:12,044 --> 01:08:13,102
He's coming.

607
01:08:18,884 --> 01:08:20,215
Hello, Uncle!

608
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:22,816
How are things, Teo?

609
01:08:23,288 --> 01:08:25,119
He's happy, Mamma.

610
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:27,690
He's looking well.

611
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:29,520
Yes, he's looking well.

612
01:08:31,296 --> 01:08:32,627
Watch your step.

613
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,527
How are you?  And how are you?

614
01:08:38,704 --> 01:08:40,433
I'm fine, I go to school.

615
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,636
Guess where we're taking you today?

616
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:47,210
To eat "passatelli" at the farm.

617
01:08:48,814 --> 01:08:50,611
What do you think of that?

618
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:53,550
Look, Dad's here too. He's a lovely lad!

619
01:08:54,954 --> 01:08:57,149
Give Dad a kiss.

620
01:08:59,158 --> 01:09:01,149
How's he?  He's normal.

621
01:09:01,961 --> 01:09:04,225
He's grown, hasn't he? He's in the fifth grade.

622
01:09:04,397 --> 01:09:06,627
And he got dead drunk the other night.

623
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:11,830
How are you keeping?  I'm much better.

624
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:16,368
Mamma, the pastries! Uncle, Mamma brought you pastries.

625
01:09:18,611 --> 01:09:20,010
We'll be back before evening.

626
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,411
Have a smoke on me.

627
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:32,020
Is Father Pazzaglia still alive?

628
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,593
He's been dead ten years now.

629
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:37,888
He's been gone quite a time!

630
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,726
He was alive last year.  That was Father Amadeo.

631
01:09:42,635 --> 01:09:46,071
Is he dead as well?  No, he's alive.

632
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:48,435
Exactly, that's what I was saying.

633
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:53,440
I saw him last year, walking along with a bunch of flowers.

634
01:09:54,213 --> 01:09:56,113
I wonder where he was going?

635
01:09:59,752 --> 01:10:02,619
Teo was a bright lad when he was eight.

636
01:10:04,023 --> 01:10:05,923
I don't want to offend you, Aurelio,

637
01:10:06,058 --> 01:10:08,652
but Teo was smarter than you at school.

638
01:10:09,262 --> 01:10:12,197
I grant you that. That's quite true.

639
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:14,799
He still is, even now.

640
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:18,164
Do you like being with us, Teo?

641
01:10:19,572 --> 01:10:22,803
Uncle, the sea's over there. It's like a blue streak.

642
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,471
Dad, can I drive the horse?  No!

643
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:30,372
What can I do just sitting here, then? Let me drive it!

644
01:10:30,549 --> 01:10:33,848
That'll be the first time a horse was driven by a mule!

645
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:39,285
That's a shorter road.

646
01:10:40,126 --> 01:10:43,459
An awful road, full of potholes, enough to take this carriage.

647
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:45,757
Is something wrong?

648
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,405
Why do you carry those in your pocket?

649
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:59,134
These stones!

650
01:11:01,514 --> 01:11:05,245
Aren't they heavy?  They're beautiful, stones are.

651
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:12,351
Stop the carriage!

652
01:11:13,926 --> 01:11:15,917
Teo needs to take a leak!

653
01:11:17,263 --> 01:11:18,195
If he has to...

654
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,192
Watch how you get down.

655
01:11:26,272 --> 01:11:27,432
You too?

656
01:11:28,974 --> 01:11:30,737
Don't be long, Grandpa, I'm hungry.

657
01:11:31,977 --> 01:11:34,138
My father's father used to say:

658
01:11:34,613 --> 01:11:37,514
to be fit as a fiddle, you have to piddle!

659
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:41,481
To be fit as a frog, pee often like a dog.

660
01:11:42,321 --> 01:11:44,312
How green! How beautiful, Teo...

661
01:11:49,095 --> 01:11:52,690
How old's the mare?  Three years and two months.

662
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:55,425
She's only got one vice, she can't stand train whistles.

663
01:11:57,203 --> 01:12:00,263
When I'm at the station stand, it's really a job to hold her!

664
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:05,610
What'll you give her to eat today?  Cappelletti (pasta).

665
01:12:05,778 --> 01:12:07,837
You forgot to unbutton your fly!

666
01:12:08,013 --> 01:12:09,571
Uncle pissed in his pants!

667
01:12:12,918 --> 01:12:14,715
They said he was normal!

668
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:17,583
You didn't undo your fly!

669
01:12:18,557 --> 01:12:20,252
He forgot.

670
01:12:21,293 --> 01:12:23,124
It's really true.

671
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,490
The sea looks like a blue streak.

672
01:12:25,664 --> 01:12:28,895
You pissed in your pants!  Shut up!

673
01:12:29,869 --> 01:12:31,530
He didn't open the shop!

674
01:12:32,872 --> 01:12:35,136
It doesn't matter, you can change at the farm.

675
01:12:40,579 --> 01:12:43,070
Come here, or I'll throw myself under the wheels!

676
01:12:44,216 --> 01:12:46,309
Sit down, you criminal!

677
01:12:46,819 --> 01:12:48,480
Shall we move on?

678
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:02,331
Ah, that was a fine meal!

679
01:13:03,068 --> 01:13:05,593
You all go and see the spring.

680
01:13:05,771 --> 01:13:09,764
My son Teo and I will stay here and have another glass of wine.

681
01:13:10,276 --> 01:13:12,972
Fine, but just one and no more.

682
01:13:13,512 --> 01:13:16,845
Know what I'll do? I'll have a nap.

683
01:13:19,552 --> 01:13:21,850
Good. It won't do you any harm here in the shade.

684
01:13:22,822 --> 01:13:25,017
The eggs's lovely, isn't it, Teo?

685
01:13:25,724 --> 01:13:30,627
Me too. When I see an egg, I could look at it for hours.

686
01:13:31,363 --> 01:13:35,163
I ask myself how Nature manages to make things so perfect.

687
01:13:35,768 --> 01:13:39,636
God made Nature, not an ignorant lout like you!

688
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:43,538
Oh, don't bust my chops! See you later here.

689
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:48,670
I'm relying on you, Dad. Menghino, how far away is this spring?

690
01:13:56,722 --> 01:13:58,713
Uncle, look, I'm hypnotizing it.

691
01:14:09,034 --> 01:14:12,299
Oliva, there's a toad! It looks like Father Balosa!

692
01:14:21,046 --> 01:14:23,412
What's it like?  Fantastic!

693
01:14:23,582 --> 01:14:26,745
It won't give you a hangover. We'll put it here.

694
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:35,386
Throw that stone away!

695
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:38,055
You naughty little boy!

696
01:14:41,634 --> 01:14:44,102
I know what your name is, you delinquent!

697
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:52,309
Dad, Uncle Teo's up a tree!

698
01:14:53,412 --> 01:14:56,745
What's that? What's he shouting?  I can't understand.

699
01:14:57,383 --> 01:15:00,011
Uncle Teo's up a tree!

700
01:15:02,922 --> 01:15:06,016
I want a woman!

701
01:15:08,193 --> 01:15:11,492
I want a woman!

702
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:20,534
But where am I going to get you a woman, my boy?

703
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:22,435
Uncle's up there.

704
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:25,509
I want a woman!

705
01:15:26,378 --> 01:15:28,107
There he is, up there!

706
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,644
Come down, Teo, you'll hurt yourself.

707
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:35,979
Quickly, get a ladder!

708
01:15:36,488 --> 01:15:39,946
Is this how you keep an eye on him? How did he get up there?

709
01:15:40,526 --> 01:15:44,587
I'll go up.  I'll hammer you into the ground.

710
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,928
How did he get up there? If he falls he'll break every bone.

711
01:15:53,105 --> 01:15:56,006
You go indoors and stop playing the actress.

712
01:15:57,076 --> 01:15:59,010
How did he do it?

713
01:15:59,144 --> 01:16:01,635
We were having a drink, and like a shot...

714
01:16:01,814 --> 01:16:04,647
He was away and up there like a cat.

715
01:16:05,184 --> 01:16:08,676
What're you doing? Throwing stones at your old dad!

716
01:16:08,854 --> 01:16:10,947
That's enough, now!

717
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:16,653
Now, now! Don't you do the same!

718
01:16:17,096 --> 01:16:19,860
Come down, Teo, your brother's angry.

719
01:16:20,532 --> 01:16:22,466
Come down, now!

720
01:16:22,635 --> 01:16:25,968
I WANT A WOMAN!!!

721
01:16:27,573 --> 01:16:32,010
It's quite a normal urge. He's 42!  Yes, but he'll fall down.

722
01:16:32,177 --> 01:16:34,907
When I was 42... I'll tell you!

723
01:16:37,216 --> 01:16:40,310
Now, that's enough, Teo!

724
01:16:40,886 --> 01:16:42,877
Climb down, Teo!

725
01:16:43,055 --> 01:16:47,219
Good shot, Uncle, right on his head!

726
01:16:50,029 --> 01:16:52,827
Right on the target.

727
01:16:56,335 --> 01:16:59,827
Now, I'll come up, but don't throw anything at me!

728
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,871
We'll take some birds home.

729
01:17:03,475 --> 01:17:07,070
Do you want to kill us all?  Now, I'm coming up.

730
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,177
Y es sirree! If you throw one at me, you'll hear about it!

731
01:17:16,488 --> 01:17:21,892
What a shot! Murderer! I hope somebody kicks you in the nuts!

732
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:29,289
Christ, what'll I do now? Jerk off?

733
01:17:33,172 --> 01:17:36,141
I'm an asshole, a stupid asshole.

734
01:17:39,678 --> 01:17:41,305
Well, let's all go home!

735
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,975
Driver, hitch up the horse, we're going home!

736
01:17:47,553 --> 01:17:51,887
Are you going to leave him up there?  Yes! Hitch up the horse. Let's go!

737
01:17:52,591 --> 01:17:55,219
As you wish.  Dad! Titta!

738
01:17:55,394 --> 01:17:57,954
Call your mother! Where's your mother?

739
01:17:58,564 --> 01:18:01,055
Leaving him there?  He's all right up there.

740
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:02,564
Let's go! I want to go home.

741
01:18:02,735 --> 01:18:05,499
But he's my son! Aurelio, listen to me.

742
01:18:05,671 --> 01:18:09,368
I want a woman!  Miranda!

743
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,567
Teo, we're going. Come down!

744
01:18:15,814 --> 01:18:17,111
We're just pretending.

745
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:22,817
Listen, Aurelio... Send me up there. He'll come down.

746
01:18:30,429 --> 01:18:32,124
Everyone in the carriage!

747
01:18:33,232 --> 01:18:36,099
We're leaving right away. Get in.

748
01:18:36,268 --> 01:18:41,262
Teo, what're you doing? Staying there? We're going now. It's late.

749
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:45,774
It's getting dark. Who'll take you back?

750
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:49,579
You going to stay up there? All right, then, ciao!

751
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:00,452
Come down!

752
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:11,560
Teo, Holy Mother of God! Are you going to come down?

753
01:19:12,137 --> 01:19:13,729
We're leaving!

754
01:19:17,743 --> 01:19:19,802
Good bye, Uncle!

755
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:42,793
He'll kill the lot of us, today.

756
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:48,235
Come on, let's have you all out! Get out, now! No questions!

757
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:50,307
What're you crying about?

758
01:19:51,143 --> 01:19:54,544
Now, you drive to the hospital and call the attendants.

759
01:19:54,713 --> 01:19:56,840
And come back right away, or I'll throw myself down the well!

760
01:19:58,383 --> 01:20:01,079
What're you crying about? It's a big laugh, it's just comic!

761
01:20:19,338 --> 01:20:21,898
Listen to him, Miranda. Poor lad.

762
01:20:24,142 --> 01:20:25,404
Do you feel better?

763
01:20:29,348 --> 01:20:33,842
I want a woman!

764
01:20:43,896 --> 01:20:47,297
I can't stand any more!

765
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:50,026
Make him shut up! I've had enough!

766
01:20:50,202 --> 01:20:52,602
Dad... Dad...  What do you want?

767
01:20:52,771 --> 01:20:54,500
Shall I go and call Volpina?

768
01:21:01,446 --> 01:21:02,640
Look, Dad.

769
01:21:04,383 --> 01:21:05,816
Mamma, they've arrived.

770
01:21:08,553 --> 01:21:10,316
Good evening, Doctor.  What's happened?

771
01:21:10,923 --> 01:21:14,723
He's up the tree.  Nice place. Fresh air. All yours?

772
01:21:14,893 --> 01:21:16,758
It's only an old farm.

773
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:21,724
He's been up there for five hours.

774
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,494
You can't see him now, because of the foliage.

775
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,695
What have you done to him?  Nothing.

776
01:21:26,872 --> 01:21:29,500
He's been shouting and throwing stones.

777
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:31,836
I hope he won't always be like this... his whole life, Doctor.

778
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:33,739
A dwarf nun!

779
01:21:38,016 --> 01:21:40,576
It'll be bad for him and worse for us.

780
01:21:40,752 --> 01:21:42,242
Keep cool, she'll attend to things.

781
01:21:43,355 --> 01:21:45,414
Were you getting a bit of air?

782
01:21:47,592 --> 01:21:49,219
Is she going up?

783
01:21:50,829 --> 01:21:54,287
Come down! I'm not going to play these damn silly games!

784
01:21:58,971 --> 01:22:01,439
Jesus, just look at that! She's got him to come down!

785
01:22:03,775 --> 01:22:06,403
She's got him down and he's quite happy.

786
01:22:10,215 --> 01:22:11,842
Teo, Teo...

787
01:22:12,818 --> 01:22:14,308
Here he is.

788
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:18,254
So, have you been up to your tricks again, have you?

789
01:22:18,423 --> 01:22:20,755
What were you doing up there?

790
01:22:20,926 --> 01:22:23,759
Counting how many stones fig trees grow in this season.

791
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:25,157
Take him home.

792
01:22:28,867 --> 01:22:32,701
Some days he's normal, some days he isn't... just like all of us.

793
01:22:33,572 --> 01:22:36,541
Ciao, Uncle!  Titta, take care.

794
01:22:42,214 --> 01:22:44,478
You can see Gigino's place from up there.

795
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,475
It's a long time since I saw him.

796
01:22:52,257 --> 01:22:55,693
Between 11 o'clock and midnight, in Caghetta's boat.

797
01:22:57,796 --> 01:23:01,391
It's thirty stories high and has sixteen smokestacks.

798
01:23:01,566 --> 01:23:04,467
Think what a pirate could do with a ship like that!

799
01:23:34,032 --> 01:23:36,398
Where's "Ronald Coleman"? I don't see him.

800
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:38,993
Gradisca! Hurray for Gradisca!

801
01:23:41,339 --> 01:23:46,038
Hello, sister.  Your steamboat. Climb aboard!

802
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:54,650
Where're all these people going?

803
01:23:54,820 --> 01:24:00,019
Where're they going with hearts all pounding? Where're they going?

804
01:24:02,027 --> 01:24:05,690
Today is a very important day for our country, for our fatherland...

805
01:24:05,864 --> 01:24:07,764
Come on, we're off!

806
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:11,198
If you drop me, you'll have to pay for it all.

807
01:24:12,337 --> 01:24:17,639
I'd like to tell you, but I can't because it's all still in the air.

808
01:24:19,077 --> 01:24:21,204
Where're these people going?

809
01:24:37,596 --> 01:24:39,894
How far out will it be?  Eight kilometers.

810
01:24:40,065 --> 01:24:43,831
But thanks to Galileo, it will seem like 400 meters to us.

811
01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:46,596
Marvelous! It'll seem like it's coming straight at us.

812
01:25:04,389 --> 01:25:06,789
Mr. Lawyer, how much will it weigh?

813
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:10,220
About two and a half times the weight of the Grand Hotel.

814
01:25:10,695 --> 01:25:12,890
Plus the Arch of Augustus!

815
01:25:13,431 --> 01:25:16,628
"Go thou, Queen of the Sea

816
01:25:16,801 --> 01:25:20,498
"Thou passeth and thy destiny

817
01:25:20,672 --> 01:25:23,539
"I shall follow in the waves

818
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:28,509
"Watching the glistening wake..."

819
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,444
Get closer to your mother, and you move nearer to your son.

820
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:36,979
Suck me off! The water's really freezing!

821
01:25:38,423 --> 01:25:41,483
My nuts has shriveled to the size of two dried beans.

822
01:25:43,395 --> 01:25:46,057
You swam out?  Sure!

823
01:25:46,231 --> 01:25:48,825
I did the Australian crawl.

824
01:25:53,572 --> 01:25:58,942
"I want to dance with you

825
01:26:01,746 --> 01:26:04,306
"All night like this..."

826
01:26:04,482 --> 01:26:09,078
The third day I went there with my boat, whistled as usual

827
01:26:10,255 --> 01:26:13,088
and out came the dolphin.

828
01:26:13,258 --> 01:26:14,987
It looked at me and said "mamma"!

829
01:26:16,494 --> 01:26:18,587
What a load of bull!

830
01:26:18,763 --> 01:26:21,197
Dolphins are intelligent, my dentist told me so.

831
01:26:24,369 --> 01:26:26,667
Look how many there are.

832
01:26:27,339 --> 01:26:29,899
Millions and millions and millions of stars.

833
01:26:30,909 --> 01:26:32,843
Jesus Christ, you guys! I wonder

834
01:26:32,911 --> 01:26:36,210
how the whole lot stays up there in place?

835
01:26:38,216 --> 01:26:41,310
It's pretty simple for us.

836
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:44,851
If we have to build a house, so many bricks, so much lime...

837
01:26:45,056 --> 01:26:47,957
But up there, Sweet Jesus! Where do you put the foundations?

838
01:26:49,127 --> 01:26:50,958
They aren't just confetti, you know!

839
01:26:53,331 --> 01:26:55,629
Are you asleep? Answer me!

840
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,931
Are you cold? Want my jacket? Come on, take my jacket.

841
01:27:01,406 --> 01:27:04,239
Put it round your shoulders or you'll get a chill and complain.

842
01:27:04,643 --> 01:27:08,238
We've still a long time to wait, haven't we? It's one o'clock.

843
01:27:08,413 --> 01:27:10,711
How would I know? They said it'd be around midnight.

844
01:27:10,849 --> 01:27:12,680
Even if it's late, it's coming from America, you know.

845
01:27:14,653 --> 01:27:16,143
Go fuck yourselves, all of you!

846
01:27:16,321 --> 01:27:18,186
He's a friend...

847
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:24,494
He sent you best wishes.

848
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:31,159
Every time I was full of hope, but it never came to anything.

849
01:27:33,004 --> 01:27:34,232
And now...

850
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:37,773
Know how old I am?  Fifty two?

851
01:27:37,976 --> 01:27:40,137
I'm not ashamed to tell the truth.

852
01:27:40,278 --> 01:27:44,476
In fact, I always add a few years on. I'm thirty.

853
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:47,243
That's surprising, my darling.  I haven't given up hope.

854
01:27:47,419 --> 01:27:49,444
I thought you were seventeen age.

855
01:27:49,888 --> 01:27:54,325
I want one of those long encounters that last a lifetime.

856
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:59,919
I want a family, children, a husband

857
01:28:00,098 --> 01:28:05,263
to chat with in the evening at supper, maybe,

858
01:28:05,437 --> 01:28:08,406
and to make love with now and then, because that's important too.

859
01:28:09,474 --> 01:28:11,965
But affection is perhaps even more necessary than love.

860
01:28:13,244 --> 01:28:15,940
I'm so full of affection.

861
01:28:16,948 --> 01:28:20,281
But who can I lavish it on, who wants it?

862
01:28:20,452 --> 01:28:23,888
Why are you crying? Look at the silly girl, she's crying!

863
01:28:24,055 --> 01:28:28,583
The girl is delicate and sensitive, oh yes!

864
01:28:29,527 --> 01:28:34,464
She's right! Men are all the same!  Don't cry, my darling!

865
01:28:58,957 --> 01:29:01,357
Here it is!  Dad, Dad!

866
01:29:01,893 --> 01:29:04,487
The Rex! The Rex!

867
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:09,957
Hurray for the Rex! The greatest thing the regime has built!

868
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:18,241
As the representative of the Podesta, I wish you a safe journey!

869
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:19,968
Long live ltaly!

870
01:29:20,412 --> 01:29:23,848
What's it like? What's it like?

871
01:30:09,627 --> 01:30:11,254
Just look at this!

872
01:30:24,476 --> 01:30:26,671
Can't see a darned thing!

873
01:30:29,447 --> 01:30:31,472
I'll keep to the wall.

874
01:30:33,485 --> 01:30:36,386
The last fog like this was in '22.

875
01:30:40,892 --> 01:30:45,329
Careful now, stop. There's a man here!

876
01:30:50,768 --> 01:30:52,736
Well, damn it all.

877
01:30:56,241 --> 01:31:00,803
Gina! Gina!

878
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:10,050
Where am I? I don't seem to be anywhere.

879
01:31:14,926 --> 01:31:19,556
If death is like this, I don't think much of it.

880
01:31:21,699 --> 01:31:27,729
Everything's gone. People, trees, birds, wine...

881
01:31:30,775 --> 01:31:32,037
Up yours!

882
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:45,950
Dino, I can't even find my house. Where am I?

883
01:31:46,491 --> 01:31:49,426
You are in front of your house.

884
01:31:49,594 --> 01:31:50,822
It's there...

885
01:32:03,141 --> 01:32:06,577
Where're you going in all this fog?  To school. Ciao, Grandpa.

886
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,945
Just think of that.

887
01:33:28,893 --> 01:33:32,090
I was in Norway. Two women...

888
01:33:33,031 --> 01:33:37,161
beautiful, huge, Norwegians!

889
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:40,064
Beans, olives, toasted melon seeds...

890
01:33:50,148 --> 01:33:52,241
It's open, you can get in.

891
01:33:53,284 --> 01:33:55,047
Last one in's a queer!

892
01:33:56,087 --> 01:33:58,681
Naso, get an eyeful of this.

893
01:34:11,803 --> 01:34:15,170
It's gorgeous!

894
01:35:14,232 --> 01:35:15,893
Where are you, my love?

895
01:36:11,824 --> 01:36:14,520
It was number 18. 18... Campari.

896
01:36:15,027 --> 01:36:17,325
Aldina, do you want to know who it was?

897
01:36:17,696 --> 01:36:19,288
We know, it was Campari.

898
01:36:19,665 --> 01:36:21,530
I knew him in the race at Monza.

899
01:37:32,171 --> 01:37:33,433
Aldina!

900
01:37:49,788 --> 01:37:51,517
Be careful, Lallo!

901
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:56,620
What is it?  An ear.

902
01:37:57,429 --> 01:37:59,192
Look, an ear!

903
01:38:16,348 --> 01:38:19,181
Can I come in?  I'm closed.

904
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:20,682
Can I come in, miss?

905
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,779
What do you want?  A cigarette.

906
01:38:29,194 --> 01:38:32,391
Can I help you?  You couldn't manage.

907
01:38:32,565 --> 01:38:37,696
What do you mean? I can lift 80 kilos. I can even lift my father.

908
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,166
What do you weigh?  I don't know.

909
01:38:45,511 --> 01:38:47,342
I could lift you, too.

910
01:39:07,433 --> 01:39:09,025
Let's see you.

911
01:39:09,702 --> 01:39:12,865
I really can.  Let's see.

912
01:39:19,945 --> 01:39:22,209
You silly boy, put me down, let me go!

913
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:28,514
You're strong!  I'll lift you again.

914
01:39:36,395 --> 01:39:37,794
Now that's enough.

915
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:53,439
What're you doing? You'll let me fall! You mad thing!

916
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,947
Put me down, that's enough!

917
01:39:57,216 --> 01:39:59,275
You'll let me drop, you crazy boy!

918
01:40:01,587 --> 01:40:03,612
You really are mad... What's happened to me? My head...

919
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:06,690
See how many times I did it?

920
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:18,163
Yes, my little darling... Come here... you really are nice.

921
01:40:20,873 --> 01:40:24,365
Drive me crazy, just a little.

922
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:28,107
What should I do?  Suck!

923
01:40:29,548 --> 01:40:31,743
Come on...

924
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,715
You can have this one, too...

925
01:40:39,558 --> 01:40:42,391
Don't blow! Suck!

926
01:40:42,561 --> 01:40:47,555
Is this right?  Yes, darling, yes!

927
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:51,662
You have to suck, you idiot!

928
01:40:52,571 --> 01:40:54,129
I can't breathe!

929
01:40:55,274 --> 01:40:58,971
Let me alone. Get out, now, I've got to close up.

930
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:03,339
What was it you wanted? A cigarette?

931
01:41:04,249 --> 01:41:07,047
I'll give you one. Now, beat it!

932
01:41:15,427 --> 01:41:16,394
I can't manage it.

933
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:23,759
Come on, get out!  Good night!

934
01:41:31,143 --> 01:41:32,804
Drink it. It'll do you good.

935
01:41:33,812 --> 01:41:36,007
It's hot!  It has to be hot.

936
01:41:54,166 --> 01:41:55,428
There's a fly.

937
01:41:55,768 --> 01:41:58,703
Where is it?  It was there.

938
01:42:02,374 --> 01:42:04,672
The only house with flies in winter...

939
01:42:05,644 --> 01:42:09,546
How did it happen with you and Dad?

940
01:42:10,415 --> 01:42:15,648
What?  How'd you meet, fall in love, get married?

941
01:42:19,458 --> 01:42:23,622
What's all this about? Anyway, who remembers!

942
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:27,059
Your dad's not a great one for compliments.

943
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,166
He was a laborer at Saludecio,

944
01:42:31,136 --> 01:42:35,470
my folks had a bit of money and they didn't think much of him...

945
01:42:37,342 --> 01:42:40,368
Well, we eloped

946
01:42:40,546 --> 01:42:45,483
without saying a word to anyone.

947
01:42:46,852 --> 01:42:49,343
When did he give you your first kiss?

948
01:42:50,155 --> 01:42:52,521
What kind of a question is that?

949
01:42:54,026 --> 01:42:56,426
I don't even know whether there was one.

950
01:42:57,696 --> 01:43:01,530
The first time, he raised his hat, and that's all.

951
01:43:02,768 --> 01:43:05,362
It was the most one could do in those days.

952
01:43:05,537 --> 01:43:10,270
It's not like now, when all kinds of things go on.

953
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:15,174
But I never manage anything.  Stay covered, you're all sweaty.

954
01:43:15,347 --> 01:43:18,510
What do you mean "manage," and you still in short pants?

955
01:43:18,684 --> 01:43:22,484
Well, get me some long ones then, like the other kids!

956
01:43:22,654 --> 01:43:24,747
What others? Gina!

957
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:28,756
She told me I wasn't to send any more love letters.

958
01:43:28,927 --> 01:43:32,658
Go and ask the doctor to come as soon as he can.

959
01:43:33,498 --> 01:43:36,524
Get him to examine you at the same time.

960
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:37,862
Run along...

961
01:43:41,073 --> 01:43:44,839
But I'll send letters just when I like.

962
01:43:49,514 --> 01:43:53,075
In Africa! I'll become a doctor and go to Africa!

963
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:55,346
That'll teach her!

964
01:44:09,468 --> 01:44:11,527
It's snowing outside!

965
01:44:21,613 --> 01:44:23,478
It's true, it's snowing!

966
01:44:26,184 --> 01:44:28,084
Professor Fighetta, up yours!

967
01:44:29,321 --> 01:44:32,017
If it goes on like this, there'll be no school for a few days.

968
01:44:32,524 --> 01:44:35,118
The mountains are all white.

969
01:44:35,294 --> 01:44:37,854
Let's go and see the snow on the sea.

970
01:44:38,297 --> 01:44:40,492
It's wet, it won't stick.

971
01:44:50,509 --> 01:44:53,103
Go away! Get the hell out of the way!

972
01:45:18,236 --> 01:45:21,433
Stop there! The sparrows!

973
01:45:46,498 --> 01:45:48,295
Wait, I'll come with you.

974
01:46:02,714 --> 01:46:04,875
Titta! Look how it's coming down!

975
01:46:09,121 --> 01:46:10,110
Let's open the window.

976
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:13,385
Lovely!

977
01:46:18,196 --> 01:46:19,595
Me too!

978
01:46:23,702 --> 01:46:28,332
It's still snowing! Four days this goddamn stuff's been around!

979
01:46:37,082 --> 01:46:39,607
This will go down as the Year of the Big Snow.

980
01:46:40,085 --> 01:46:42,485
Since the last Ice Age,

981
01:46:42,754 --> 01:46:47,123
it never snowed so heavily in our town.

982
01:46:52,397 --> 01:46:55,195
That must've been a boy, not the other person.

983
01:46:55,867 --> 01:46:59,462
As I was saying... the exceptional years were

984
01:46:59,638 --> 01:47:02,630
1541... 1694...
1541... 1694...

985
01:47:02,808 --> 01:47:06,300
1728... 1888...
1728... 1888...

986
01:47:06,478 --> 01:47:10,676
when oddly enough, it snowed on July 13th.

987
01:47:57,929 --> 01:47:59,123
Where's she?

988
01:48:08,373 --> 01:48:12,400
How's your mother?  Better now.

989
01:48:13,645 --> 01:48:16,705
She's still in hospital, but she's off the critical list.

990
01:48:17,149 --> 01:48:21,245
That's good, poor woman. Give her my regards.

991
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:24,111
Your mother's a kind lady.

992
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:26,883
She always gave me soup

993
01:48:27,058 --> 01:48:31,757
and wine. She's good...

994
01:49:07,299 --> 01:49:08,527
How are you feeling?

995
01:49:10,168 --> 01:49:12,966
I've brought you some flowers.  Thank you. How are you?

996
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:18,165
Hello, Aurelio. They're lovely!

997
01:49:19,177 --> 01:49:22,169
I was just looking out, now I'll go back to bed.

998
01:49:23,081 --> 01:49:26,642
But I'm feeling better today. What lovely colors!

999
01:49:27,586 --> 01:49:29,315
Are you hot, with this?

1000
01:49:29,988 --> 01:49:32,479
Have you eaten?  Yes.

1001
01:49:49,841 --> 01:49:54,710
Are you still annoying your father?  He whips so hard!

1002
01:49:55,447 --> 01:49:57,438
I'll finish up, stupid!

1003
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:11,390
There's a nice garden here, I didn't know.

1004
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:15,124
It looks as though it's in bloom, with the snow.

1005
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:16,858
It's still snowing.

1006
01:50:19,037 --> 01:50:24,907
In one way you're lucky to be here warm in bed, with this weather.

1007
01:50:27,145 --> 01:50:31,206
He's tired, poor man, when he gets home.

1008
01:50:31,383 --> 01:50:34,352
You shouldn't answer back, you're a grown up now.

1009
01:50:36,588 --> 01:50:39,682
Don't throw ice! It hurts!

1010
01:50:44,095 --> 01:50:47,656
Wind and rain, go home again. I don't want to feel the pain.

1011
01:50:53,338 --> 01:50:54,930
Idiot! No!

1012
01:50:57,876 --> 01:50:59,537
A quite difficult shot, Excellency!

1013
01:51:09,754 --> 01:51:11,688
No! Not at Gradisca! No!

1014
01:51:17,195 --> 01:51:19,129
Enough! I give up!

1015
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:22,933
If you break my windows, I'll break your skull!

1016
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:32,500
Who is it?

1017
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:40,948
What is it?

1018
01:51:49,527 --> 01:51:52,155
Look, it's the Count peacock!

1019
01:51:55,066 --> 01:51:58,194
There it is! It's coming down!

1020
01:52:06,911 --> 01:52:08,538
Shall we catch it, boys?

1021
01:52:24,796 --> 01:52:28,061
I don't understand. What's happened?

1022
01:52:28,233 --> 01:52:30,667
I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.

1023
01:52:31,169 --> 01:52:33,603
Why in the car? Where're we going?

1024
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:36,835
Quite near. To Aunt Zaira's farm.

1025
01:52:37,475 --> 01:52:40,103
A relative's come from America and wants to say hello to you.

1026
01:52:41,179 --> 01:52:44,615
Well, why doesn't he come here, then?

1027
01:52:44,983 --> 01:52:46,712
Who is this relative?

1028
01:53:14,662 --> 01:53:16,220
My aunt is dead.

1029
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:24,030
Bear up.

1030
01:53:30,745 --> 01:53:36,377
No, don't do that... Open up!

1031
01:53:39,687 --> 01:53:41,177
No, I won't!

1032
01:54:08,049 --> 01:54:10,483
Lallo! He's fainted.

1033
01:54:10,818 --> 01:54:12,615
Dad, Uncle's feeling poorly.

1034
01:54:16,924 --> 01:54:19,222
Take him to the whorehouse, then!

1035
01:54:23,498 --> 01:54:25,090
Make the sign of the cross.

1036
01:54:48,122 --> 01:54:49,851
How do you feel now?  Better!

1037
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,986
Don't take it so hard... be strong!

1038
01:55:24,692 --> 01:55:27,627
Now everybody in line. Where're the orphans?

1039
01:56:36,731 --> 01:56:38,494
Stop that!

1040
01:58:11,226 --> 01:58:13,387
Hurray for the bride and groom!

1041
01:58:16,197 --> 01:58:17,664
Give me your arm, Naso.

1042
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:22,758
Make way, make way, my breasts are full of milk!

1043
01:58:24,839 --> 01:58:30,300
I raise my glass to the newly weds and say...

1044
01:58:31,613 --> 01:58:33,843
May bride and groom find marriage glowing in Battipaglia.

1045
01:58:34,015 --> 01:58:37,041
When you're drunk, you can even rhyme!

1046
01:58:42,357 --> 01:58:45,292
Gradisca's getting married and going away!

1047
01:58:47,328 --> 01:58:51,492
We're sorry if we made you angry, and we hate to see you go!

1048
01:58:54,969 --> 01:58:56,436
You'll miss us badly!

1049
01:59:01,943 --> 01:59:04,434
Silence is golden, but words are silver.

1050
01:59:04,612 --> 01:59:07,308
May this married couple live happily ever after!

1051
01:59:08,216 --> 01:59:09,649
Where's the bride?

1052
01:59:10,785 --> 01:59:15,085
Our Gradisca is going away because she's found her Gary Cooper.

1053
01:59:15,723 --> 01:59:19,159
It's true that Gary's cowboy, while Matteo is a carabiniere

1054
01:59:19,327 --> 01:59:22,956
but love's always love. Good luck, Gradisca!

1055
01:59:24,098 --> 01:59:26,658
Long live the bride and groom!

1056
01:59:26,834 --> 01:59:29,530
You have crowned your dream of love.

1057
01:59:30,071 --> 01:59:33,199
Now it's your duty to have many children.

1058
01:59:35,176 --> 01:59:38,168
For your family, for the church and for your country!

1059
01:59:41,182 --> 01:59:45,414
Now we're all together... one more toast before we leave.

1060
01:59:48,456 --> 01:59:50,287
Photograph! Photograph!

1061
01:59:50,458 --> 01:59:52,983
Now we'll take the photograph.

1062
01:59:53,661 --> 01:59:55,288
A mirror!

1063
01:59:57,198 --> 01:59:58,961
Everybody get behind the bride!

1064
02:00:00,201 --> 02:00:03,500
She's lovely, our Ninola!  Why're you crying?

1065
02:00:03,671 --> 02:00:06,606
I'm not, now.  Get closer together.

1066
02:00:06,741 --> 02:00:08,709
The carabiniere must move back a little.

1067
02:00:10,611 --> 02:00:11,976
Stand in the light.

1068
02:00:12,547 --> 02:00:14,879
Hold it! It's raining.

1069
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:21,311
Smile.  O.K., O.K. Another one.

1070
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:26,352
Don't fall all over us, you drunken lout!  Gangway!

1071
02:00:28,963 --> 02:00:32,558
Let's move into the sun, the bride in the center. Ready for a photo?

1072
02:00:40,074 --> 02:00:42,474
I've made up another rhyme that goes like this.

1073
02:00:43,344 --> 02:00:46,609
Though the world may be full of beautiful things

1074
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:51,548
Full of towns that are attractive, even more than here,

1075
02:00:51,719 --> 02:00:55,450
A drop of water'll be good for you... you'll get a bath.

1076
02:00:55,757 --> 02:00:57,088
Get up!

1077
02:00:57,592 --> 02:01:01,619
It's stopped raining, sit down. Play!

1078
02:01:02,463 --> 02:01:04,863
A wet bride is a lucky bride!

1079
02:01:10,104 --> 02:01:11,765
Viva l'Italia!

1080
02:01:19,414 --> 02:01:24,613
How will you live, so far away from here?

1081
02:01:26,788 --> 02:01:29,621
Good bye to you all! Go home!

1082
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:33,452
Biscein bids you good bye!

1083
02:01:44,305 --> 02:01:46,296
Naso, I'm going home!

1084
02:01:48,609 --> 02:01:51,373
Wait for me, I'll come with you!

1085
02:02:15,803 --> 02:02:16,929
My bouquet! Wait!

1086
02:02:18,272 --> 02:02:21,730
Good bye! I love you all!

1087
02:02:24,378 --> 02:02:27,836
Gradisca's going!  She's leaving!

1088
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:38,548
Good bye, Gradisca!

1089
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:04,011
The puffballs!

1090
02:03:10,112 --> 02:03:13,412
Titta!
Nasso!

1091
02:03:14,295 --> 02:03:15,592
Where's Titta?

1092
02:03:16,531 --> 02:03:18,431
Shall we go fishing in the harbor?

1093
02:03:23,070 --> 02:03:24,970
Titta's went away some time ago.
