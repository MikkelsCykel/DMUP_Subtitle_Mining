1
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,189
His Highness, Prince Yu arrives!

2
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,990
Your Majesty.

3
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:30,926
Yu...

4
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:32,258
is everything ready?

5
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:35,936
Mother...

6
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:37,604
Second Brother should be here soon.

7
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,467
Has he entered the Palace?

8
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,800
I hear he stopped at the Official
Inn to await orders.

9
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,376
First Brother mentioned...

10
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:45,306
that as soon as Father arrives...

11
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,139
he will ask permission to leave.

12
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:50,139
He wants to go to Qingzhou.

13
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:14,130
Mother.

14
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:30,715
Her Majesty the Empress arrives!

15
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,254
First Brother.

16
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,329
Your Majesty.

17
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:08,449
So you are leaving.

18
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:11,890
Are you afraid?

19
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,183
You are my mother, Your Majesty.

20
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:18,352
We have been
intimate for three years.

21
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,657
You, of all people
should know who I am.

22
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,096
I am first and
foremost my father's son.

23
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:34,004
Mother!

24
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,745
I am not your mother!

25
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:42,846
Many things can be changed.

26
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,219
In fact, nothing can be changed.

27
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:51,086
Still, I would like to try.

28
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:54,320
What are you going to do?

29
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,896
It is time to go
and welcome the Emperor

30
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,712
The day breaks.

31
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,146
The court presides.

32
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,910
Peace to all.

33
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,144
It is the Hour of the Tiger.

34
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,520
The day breaks.

35
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,887
The court presides.

36
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,619
Peace to all.

37
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,287
It is the Hour of the Tiger.

38
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,064
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.

39
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,172
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.

40
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,178
By the Emperor's command...

41
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,046
retire to your chambers!

42
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:12,518
The welcome ceremony is cancelled!

43
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,350
Retire to your chambers!

44
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:16,684
The welcome ceremony is cancelled!

45
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:18,485
The Emperor commands...

46
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,094
retire to your chambers!

47
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:22,526
The welcome ceremony is cancelled!

48
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:24,222
Retire to your chambers!

49
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,594
The welcome ceremony is cancelled!

50
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:27,564
Your Majesty...

51
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:28,701
the Emperor commands...

52
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:29,871
everyone is to return
to their chambers.

53
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:31,801
The welcome ceremony is cancelled.

54
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,039
Where is His Majesty?

55
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,437
The Emperor has diverted his
escort to the Official Inn.

56
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:37,441
Your Majesty...

57
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:40,341
the Emperor requests the presence
of the Empress and the two princes...

58
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:43,517
on the Chrysanthemum Terrace
tomorrow morning.

59
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:53,951
Your Highness, Prince Jai...

60
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,525
the Emperor has arrived.

61
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,291
Your son kneels before the Emperor.

62
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,212
I am honored...

63
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,011
by Father's personal visit.

64
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:43,494
Come.

65
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:06,975
Father's prowess is unequaled.

66
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:12,051
The decision to send you
to the frontier...

67
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:14,316
was clearly the right one.

68
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,614
I came here today...

69
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,654
to warn you...

70
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,052
against your past mistakes.

71
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,859
There are many things
in Heaven and Earth...

72
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,226
but you can only have...

73
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:28,924
what I choose to give you.

74
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,432
What I do not give...

75
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,501
you must never take by force.

76
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:34,337
Father's counsel...

77
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,201
is etched into my heart.

78
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,512
Return to the Palace with me.

79
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:08,701
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives!

80
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,202
Jai.

81
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:16,767
Your son kneels before the Empress.

82
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,912
Mother.

83
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:26,815
It has been over three years.

84
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,849
Have you been well?

85
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,358
I am very well.

86
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,896
And you?

87
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,624
I have missed Mother...

88
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,501
every moment of every day.

89
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,633
Mother.

90
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,135
You must have suffered.

91
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,678
I am fine.

92
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:27,092
Charity seeks no recognition.

93
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:29,425
Virtue seeks no reward.

94
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,123
The harvest is abundant.

95
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:33,427
It is the Hour of the Rabbit.

96
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,030
Your Majesty...

97
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,570
the Empress has been
taking her medicine...

98
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,370
daily and without interruption.

99
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,046
Following Your Majesty's
instruction...

100
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:51,975
the black fungus is added
personally by my daughter, Chan.

101
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:53,950
Nobody knows about
the new ingredient.

102
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:59,152
Has it been ten days now?

103
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,021
Exactly ten days.

104
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,365
Is your relationship
with Father unchanged?

105
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:15,432
Why is Mother embroidering
so many chrysanthemums?

106
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:17,576
It is the Chrysanthemum Festival soon,
remember?

107
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:26,677
Mother!

108
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:27,408
Mother!

109
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:29,347
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

110
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:30,612
What is the matter?

111
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:31,652
Your Highness...

112
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:32,618
your servant does not know.

113
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:34,348
It is the third time
this has happened.

114
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,663
Mother's illness is clearly serious.

115
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:53,901
Have you been taking your medicine?

116
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,782
Have a rest.

117
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,148
Before the Chrysanthemum Festival...

118
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:12,321
I must finish all the embroidery.

119
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,459
Why don't you go
and see your brothers?

120
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:26,831
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives!

121
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,640
Jai bows to his First Brother,
the Crown Prince Wan.

122
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,974
Second Brother, please sit.

123
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,202
Thank you.

124
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,277
Second Brother.

125
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,811
Yu.

126
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:41,682
Second Brother...

127
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:43,184
I hear Father changed his plans
and welcomed you in person.

128
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:45,219
We all waited up half
the night in vain.

129
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:48,553
These years away from home...

130
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,283
must have been hard.

131
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,858
It was fine.

132
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:55,423
Do you know what
is wrong with Mother?

133
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:58,163
Father says she suffers from anemia.

134
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,195
She has been taking
her medicine regularly.

135
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:09,207
She seems to be obsessed
with embroidering chrysanthemums.

136
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,505
They must be for the Festival.

137
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:39,665
Dad!

138
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,105
Have you been visiting
with the Crown Prince again?

139
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,404
Why would I visit the Crown Prince?

140
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:49,376
Father knows.

141
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:52,040
What do you know?

142
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,046
Go more often!

143
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:13,369
This is a Persian black fungus.

144
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,003
Do you know its properties?

145
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,108
Two grams a day,
taken over a few months...

146
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:20,071
will cause a person to lose
all their mental faculty.

147
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,340
And you think you know so much.

148
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:28,982
But the Empress...

149
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,345
Don't breathe a word.

150
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:31,884
Our entire clan will be executed!

151
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,034
Law of the nation...

152
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,399
Precept of the home...

153
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,096
Ancient yet unchanged.

154
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,367
It is the Hour of the Dragon.

155
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,287
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.

156
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,457
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.

157
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,252
So, you are Chan.

158
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:21,727
Yes, Your Majesty.

159
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,992
The Imperial Doctor is your father?

160
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:25,430
Yes.

161
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:33,665
The Crown Prince seems
a little pale lately.

162
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:39,314
Is the Empress asking her servant?

163
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,053
My duty is only to prepare
Your Majesty's medicine.

164
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:49,015
I am not acquainted with
His Highness's state of health.

165
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,183
Is that so?

166
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:57,722
You may enter.

167
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:05,281
'To the highest mountains
my brothers ascend...

168
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:08,759
but one is missing,
without berries in his hair.

169
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,093
Prince Jai has returned.

170
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,234
The family is reunited.

171
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:27,138
Do you know why...

172
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:28,473
every Chrysanthemum Festival...

173
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:31,116
we assemble on this high
terrace as a family?

174
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,984
Father, on the ninth day
of the ninth month...

175
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:37,678
the sun and the moon unite.

176
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,915
We call this the
Chrysanthemum Festival.

177
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,649
It symbolizes the strength
and harmony of the family...

178
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,418
and we always celebrate
on this high terrace.

179
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,358
That is a very good answer.

180
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:49,261
The terrace is round.
The table is square.

181
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:50,832
What do they represent?

182
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,830
That Heaven is round.
The earth is square.

183
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:54,368
The law of the Heavens...

184
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:56,130
dictates the rule of earthly life...

185
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:57,807
under the circle,
within the square...

186
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,839
everyone has his proper placement.

187
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:02,238
This is called natural law.

188
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:04,411
Emperor, Courtier, Father, Son...

189
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,442
loyalty, filial piety,
ritual and righteousness...

190
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,880
all relationships obey this law.

191
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,410
Do you have any requests?

192
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,678
Your Majesty...

193
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,583
I beg permission...

194
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,621
to travel to Qingzhou.

195
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,152
You also wish to be
sent to the frontier?

196
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,760
I have never left the Palace...

197
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,953
and would like to gain
experience in the outside world.

198
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,433
Is there anything else?

199
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,998
Father...

200
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:34,638
I beg your permission, also.

201
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:35,774
What is it?

202
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,034
I...

203
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:38,905
do not know if it
would be appropriate...

204
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:41,013
Then speak when you do know.

205
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,114
You did not finish the medicine

206
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,254
served at the Hour of the Dragon.

207
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,192
Is there any left?

208
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,094
Your Majesty...

209
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:57,727
there is a sip or two.

210
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:58,793
Serve it to the Empress.

211
00:21:58,997 --> 00:21:59,929
Yes.

212
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:01,497
Your Majesty...

213
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,992
your consort is not ill.

214
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:05,999
That is your opinion.

215
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:13,736
Medicine has to be taken in the
right measure, at the right time.

216
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,844
Everything abides by its own law.

217
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:34,426
Yu.

218
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:42,094
Mother, please do not upset Father.

219
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:51,675
Mother, please take the medicine.

220
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,083
Remain kneeling...

221
00:22:58,285 --> 00:22:59,912
until your mother drains the cup.

222
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:10,258
Father...

223
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:11,395
Mother does not wish to drink.

224
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:12,655
Why not let her be?

225
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:14,423
Medicine is governed by dosage...

226
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,700
just as life is governed
by its own law.

227
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,960
Surely you all know this.

228
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:32,240
Mother...

229
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,076
you have been taking
this medicine for years.

230
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:36,013
This is only a little sip...

231
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:38,247
why refuse?

232
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:45,758
You are right.

233
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:49,488
I have been taking
this medicine for years...

234
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,232
why refuse now?

235
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,622
Your mother is not well.

236
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,458
Are you not aware?

237
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,289
We know, Father.

238
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,393
If a person is sick,
they have to be treated.

239
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,896
Why is this unusual?

240
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,074
What were you trying to say just now?

241
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,769
Father...

242
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,001
I would like...

243
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:42,577
on the night of the
Chrysanthemum Festival...

244
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,044
I would like to command
the Imperial Guards.

245
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,881
I, too, wish to gain experience.

246
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:51,854
Since Prince Jai has returned...

247
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,182
he will assume this duty.

248
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:56,956
Jai.

249
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,283
Present, Father.

250
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:01,861
The Imperial Guards
protect our private palaces.

251
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:03,258
On the night of the Festival...

252
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,865
they will be under your sole command.

253
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,329
Do you understand?

254
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:09,799
Father's trust will not be misplaced.

255
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,834
You know what to do.

256
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,878
The Empress arrives.

257
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,950
Your consort kneels before the Emperor.

258
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:42,126
Do you know why I summoned you?

259
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:45,292
Today...

260
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,538
you acted against the family's wishes.

261
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,964
Watch closely...

262
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,235
I select each ingredient personally...

263
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:57,505
with utmost care.

264
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,315
This will cure your anemia.

265
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,746
I thank His Majesty for his concern.

266
00:26:03,954 --> 00:26:05,387
All good medicine tastes bitter.

267
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,987
You have excess bile...

268
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,452
poor digestion...

269
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:10,057
Yin and Yang are out of balance.

270
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:11,851
That is why you are fractious...

271
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:14,757
listless and lethargic...

272
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:17,432
capable of nothing but cutting remarks.

273
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,897
These are all symptoms of anemia.

274
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:21,592
It has been more than ten years.

275
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:23,293
My so-called sickness...

276
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,871
is clearly not improving
with Your Majesty's treatment.

277
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:39,014
If your father were not
the King of Liang...

278
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,777
I would scarcely
be speaking with you...

279
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:43,285
with such restraint.

280
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:44,956
You had better understand...

281
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:46,989
that as long as I am the Emperor...

282
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:48,626
and you, the Empress...

283
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:51,559
we shall play
our parts to perfection.

284
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:52,924
The Imperial Family...

285
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:55,396
has to set an example
for the entire country.

286
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:02,563
For the sake of this family...

287
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:06,600
there is much that
I am prepared to tolerate...

288
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:07,937
because my concern...

289
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:10,080
is to maintain law
and order in the home.

290
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:14,380
Chickens roost.

291
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,882
Gentlemen to rest.

292
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:18,486
Streams run clear.

293
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:20,987
It is the Hour of the Snake.

294
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,027
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.

295
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,464
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is served.

296
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,946
Thank you, Your Majesty.

297
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:35,502
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

298
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,576
The Chrysanthemum Festival...

299
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,682
the day my birth mother died.

300
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:41,977
You lost your mother
when you were small...

301
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:44,877
and I was away at war
much of the time.

302
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:47,519
I never took proper care of you.

303
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:51,092
This has created a distance
between us...

304
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:56,530
but you have always
been my favorite son.

305
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:58,563
I asked Jai to come back...

306
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:00,599
and gave him a heavy
responsibility tonight.

307
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:03,630
Did you wonder why?

308
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:05,135
Father...

309
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:06,807
is thinking of...

310
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:09,101
making Jai the Crown Prince.

311
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:11,541
If this makes you uncomfortable...

312
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,645
I shall not go ahead.

313
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:15,009
Father need not worry.

314
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:16,377
I am without talent...

315
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:18,245
and do not deserve the throne.

316
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,852
Twice in the past I begged Father
to appoint another heir.

317
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:22,849
I had meant it sincerely.

318
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:25,457
Father's wish is my wish.

319
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:38,670
How did you manage to sneak away?

320
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,147
Did the Emperor grant you
permission to leave for Qingzhou?

321
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,587
After the Festival...

322
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,259
if Your Highness asks again...

323
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,294
I am sure the Emperor will say yes.

324
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:13,767
Your Highness,
please do not forget...

325
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,164
to take Chan with you.

326
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,477
Once there...

327
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:25,044
we shall finally be together.

328
00:31:25,547 --> 00:31:27,377
If only I could get away...

329
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,550
It will happen!

330
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,760
Her Majesty the Empress arrives!

331
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,076
Your Majesty.

332
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:00,927
You can tell her to come out.

333
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,268
What did Mother say?

334
00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:05,598
Tell her to come out!

335
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,839
Mother...

336
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:13,742
Come out!

337
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:26,817
What is the punishment?

338
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:28,424
For seducing the Crown Prince...

339
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:29,820
trespassing into royal chambers...

340
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:32,086
by law twenty lashes of the whip...

341
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:33,592
branding of the face...

342
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:36,061
and banishment from the Palace.

343
00:33:39,336 --> 00:33:41,896
Your Highness, what do you suggest?

344
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:51,242
What happened
here was entirely my fault.

345
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,847
For my sake, I beg Your Majesty...

346
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,083
to exercise lenience.

347
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,989
Mother, please spare her.

348
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,391
Fine.

349
00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:17,998
I shall let her go this time...

350
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:21,999
but I do this for
the sake of another, not you.

351
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,869
You may rise.

352
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:40,820
I am not trying to make
things difficult for you.

353
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,617
But before the Festival...

354
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:45,057
nothing untoward must
happen in the Palace.

355
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:11,743
Leave me.

356
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,583
I have made the discovery...

357
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:24,376
Your Majesty requested.

358
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,684
The new ingredient
in your prescription...

359
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:33,360
is a black fungus from Persia.

360
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:34,756
Two grams a day...

361
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:35,860
over a few months...

362
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:38,031
will cause a person
to lose all their mental faculty.

363
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,673
Thank you.

364
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,509
I did not do this for money.

365
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,912
Then why did you?

366
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,108
The Empress may think...

367
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,253
that I came...

368
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,320
because of the generous reward...

369
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,360
but I came...

370
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,530
for my own reasons.

371
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,659
I hate this man.

372
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,199
Only Your Majesty is
in a position to avenge me.

373
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,060
I see that your face is branded.

374
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:23,068
Why were you in jail?

375
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:24,833
Your Majesty...

376
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,872
forgive my silence on this subject.

377
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:29,372
Farewell.

378
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:24,990
Your Highness, Prince Wan.

379
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,788
The Empress has already retired.

380
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,432
Who are you?

381
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:14,587
Father.

382
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:15,524
Your Majesty.

383
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,994
This is the wife
of the Imperial Doctor.

384
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:18,824
Father...

385
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:22,025
this woman broke in
into the Palace three days ago.

386
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,406
Raise your head.

387
00:40:40,153 --> 00:40:41,450
Loosen the ties!

388
00:40:45,024 --> 00:40:46,547
Leave us!

389
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:52,161
Wan...

390
00:40:52,364 --> 00:40:55,856
you must never speak of
the events of this night.

391
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,364
Remember!

392
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:10,970
You may rise.

393
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,153
It has been twenty-five years.

394
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:29,753
I thought...

395
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:32,095
that I would never see you again.

396
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:41,239
And you married the Imperial Doctor!

397
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:50,715
At the time you were
only a lowly captain...

398
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,475
plotting day and night
to become Emperor.

399
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:55,051
You flattered the King of Liang...

400
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:57,620
into letting you marry his daughter.

401
00:41:57,823 --> 00:42:00,553
You planned meticulously to have
my entire family put in prison.

402
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:01,953
Later...

403
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:04,129
I alone managed to escape.

404
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:07,423
Far from home, I almost died.

405
00:42:07,632 --> 00:42:09,759
It was the doctor who saved me.

406
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:12,129
Who then, do you think
I should have married?

407
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:21,977
Why did you come?

408
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:24,113
I came to see my son.

409
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:27,346
I suppose the Empress invited you.

410
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:29,950
I have never even met the Empress.

411
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:56,704
What I owe you...

412
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,170
I shall repay in full.

413
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,549
The Imperial Doctor...

414
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:04,677
has served us for many years...

415
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:07,352
with impeccable conduct,
loyalty and honesty.

416
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:10,717
He is promoted
to Governor of Suzhou...

417
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,619
also Commander of Chariots.

418
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:14,883
He will depart immediately...

419
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,617
with his daughter, Chan.

420
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,796
This is the order of His Majesty.

421
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,158
We thank His Majesty
for his gracious favor.

422
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:31,332
Your humble servant
kneels before the Emperor.

423
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,638
Before I leave...

424
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:41,873
I beg to serve Your Majesty
one last time.

425
00:43:42,085 --> 00:43:44,144
How long have you been with me?

426
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:45,378
Your Majesty...

427
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,056
it has been fifteen years.

428
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,850
If I have ever wronged you...

429
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,855
please forgive me.

430
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:54,996
Your Majesty must
not say such things!

431
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:57,858
Your servant would
willingly give his life...

432
00:43:58,067 --> 00:43:59,830
Your wife...

433
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:03,563
is she well?

434
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,202
She is.

435
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:09,865
She will accompany you
to your new post.

436
00:44:10,078 --> 00:44:12,170
Your Majesty is too considerate.

437
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:15,111
My gratitude is without bounds.

438
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:17,076
As for the Empress's medicine...

439
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:20,245
I have prepared
two months' supply.

440
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:23,080
Your Majesty need only
command the pharmacist...

441
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,154
to heat up each dose as necessary.

442
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:12,193
Your consort kneels
before the Emperor.

443
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,731
Leave us.

444
00:45:23,978 --> 00:45:27,209
I came to pay respects to the
Crown Prince's birth mother.

445
00:45:27,848 --> 00:45:30,009
Today is the anniversary of her death.

446
00:45:45,864 --> 00:45:48,856
For over twenty years this portrait
has kept Your Majesty company.

447
00:45:50,803 --> 00:45:52,498
In your heart...

448
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:55,265
there is only one woman.

449
00:46:03,981 --> 00:46:05,915
What have you come to say?

450
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:08,412
I hear...

451
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:10,711
that an assassin was captured
last night...

452
00:46:11,254 --> 00:46:13,620
and the Emperor spent a long time
interrogating him.

453
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:17,417
Is anything wrong with that?

454
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:19,789
Of course not.

455
00:46:21,997 --> 00:46:23,897
I shall take my leave now.

456
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:36,475
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives.

457
00:46:36,678 --> 00:46:37,838
Leave us, all of you.

458
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:48,343
Mother.

459
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:52,848
I have been taking your father's
medicine for over ten years.

460
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,117
Ten days ago...

461
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:56,318
he suddenly changed the formula...

462
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:03,832
and this new ingredient was added.

463
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,705
Mother was taken ill yesterday.

464
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,741
Was it because of this?

465
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:26,379
Why is Father doing this to you?

466
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:29,691
Jai...

467
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:37,055
after the Chrysanthemum Festival...

468
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:38,961
I shall tell you the whole truth.

469
00:47:50,144 --> 00:47:52,704
Each day, in front of your father...

470
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:55,405
I have to feign ignorance.

471
00:47:56,984 --> 00:47:58,417
Every two hours...

472
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:01,587
I swallow this poison without protest.

473
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:07,022
Nobody knows what is happening.

474
00:48:09,696 --> 00:48:13,131
I shall die exactly as your
father intends - a cretin...

475
00:48:16,836 --> 00:48:19,031
but I refuse
to submit without a fight.

476
00:48:26,377 --> 00:48:27,935
On the night of the Festival...

477
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,305
I shall put an end to all of this.

478
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:37,754
Do my brothers know?

479
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:39,913
No.

480
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:45,926
If I had not come back...

481
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:48,096
would Mother have gone ahead?

482
00:48:48,297 --> 00:48:49,662
Yes.

483
00:48:52,268 --> 00:48:54,429
Then why did you tell me?

484
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:58,804
Because I want you to be Emperor.

485
00:49:06,548 --> 00:49:08,607
Are you going to kill Father?

486
00:49:09,117 --> 00:49:11,346
I shall force him to abdicate...

487
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:14,214
but it is not my intention
to kill him.

488
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:17,554
Mother...

489
00:49:17,758 --> 00:49:20,590
a son cannot stand in rebellion
against his father!

490
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:22,261
Whatever the circumstances...

491
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,396
he is still my father
and my Emperor.

492
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:39,008
Jai...

493
00:49:41,747 --> 00:49:43,680
I know that this puts you
in an untenable position.

494
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:47,041
You do not have to do anything
you do not want.

495
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,285
Prayers in the Spring...

496
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,396
Tranquility in the Fall...

497
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:02,963
The earth yields.

498
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,861
It is the Hour of the Monkey.

499
00:50:23,184 --> 00:50:24,344
Mother.

500
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,319
Your son will help you.

501
00:51:11,729 --> 00:51:14,721
You will never
drink this poison again.

502
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,003
His Highness,
the Crown Prince arrives!

503
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:37,899
Mother summoned me.

504
00:52:38,107 --> 00:52:39,836
Is anything the matter?

505
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:47,874
Please leave us.

506
00:52:54,189 --> 00:52:55,554
I have made a new robe for you...

507
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:57,384
different from the one last year.

508
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,261
I have added
this chrysanthemum specially.

509
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,467
What does this mean?

510
00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:12,132
It will protect you from harm.

511
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:14,499
Protect me?

512
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:17,407
What exactly are you plotting?

513
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:20,406
Wan...

514
00:53:21,046 --> 00:53:22,570
on the night of the
Chrysanthemum Festival...

515
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:24,715
you must wear this.

516
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,577
I will not wear it.

517
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:28,677
You must.

518
00:53:29,254 --> 00:53:30,881
I refuse!

519
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,382
I refuse.

520
00:53:34,592 --> 00:53:36,457
I refuse to wear it!

521
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:48,930
What in Heaven's name
are you trying to do?

522
00:55:34,435 --> 00:55:35,663
Your Highness!

523
00:55:49,615 --> 00:55:51,378
I received the message...

524
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:52,914
that Your Highness was coming...

525
00:55:53,118 --> 00:55:54,676
and have been waiting up all night.

526
00:55:56,054 --> 00:55:57,544
I came here...

527
00:55:57,756 --> 00:56:00,122
to ask you something.

528
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:02,986
Why was your mother at the Palace?

529
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,422
She came to see me.

530
00:56:04,629 --> 00:56:06,620
Had she visited you before?

531
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,890
No. Why?

532
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,331
Do not keep anything from me.

533
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,058
Never!

534
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,171
I always tell Your Highness
everything I know.

535
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,774
Do you know why the Empress
keeps embroidering chrysanthemums?

536
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,911
I hear they are for the Festival.

537
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:26,377
The eunuch in charge of weaving
has made ten thousand flowers for her.

538
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:30,478
Ten thousand?

539
00:56:33,555 --> 00:56:36,318
Her Majesty had them all
delivered to General Wu.

540
00:56:36,524 --> 00:56:37,786
Of the State Army?

541
00:56:37,992 --> 00:56:39,584
That's right.

542
00:56:39,827 --> 00:56:41,351
How did you know?

543
00:56:41,863 --> 00:56:44,058
I heard my father mention it.

544
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:45,095
What else do you know?

545
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,561
Nothing.

546
00:56:59,645 --> 00:57:01,044
Chan.

547
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:01,906
Chan.

548
00:57:02,114 --> 00:57:03,741
My mother is coming. Please hide!

549
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:06,611
Something is about
to happen at the Palace.

550
00:57:06,819 --> 00:57:08,013
I must go back.

551
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,985
Something terrible...

552
00:57:16,828 --> 00:57:18,887
Your servant kneels
before the Crown Prince.

553
00:57:20,564 --> 00:57:22,395
Your Highness, may I present my wife.

554
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:23,827
Quick!

555
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:26,498
Kneel down,
welcome the Crown Prince!

556
00:57:27,738 --> 00:57:29,535
Leave!

557
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:33,472
I said leave!

558
00:57:33,676 --> 00:57:36,406
How can you speak
to His Highness in this way?

559
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,838
Mom, this is the Crown Prince!

560
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:41,676
Leave now! Go!

561
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:47,622
Please forgive her.

562
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:51,887
Your Highness...

563
00:57:52,994 --> 00:57:54,222
please forgive her.

564
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,918
Please forgive her.

565
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:05,304
I was such a fool.

566
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,933
I should never have
let you enter the Palace.

567
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:10,666
His Highness's feelings
for me are true.

568
00:58:10,877 --> 00:58:12,071
The two of you...

569
00:58:12,278 --> 00:58:13,609
can never be together.

570
00:58:13,813 --> 00:58:14,302
But why?

571
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:15,981
No reason.

572
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:19,079
You must never see him again.

573
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:21,642
Something terrible is going
to happen tonight.

574
00:58:21,854 --> 00:58:23,583
Mom, I have to go and find him.

575
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:25,120
You dare!

576
00:58:28,093 --> 00:58:29,787
What is going on?

577
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:39,534
Chan, go outside.

578
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:07,020
For more than ten years...

579
00:59:08,997 --> 00:59:11,795
I have never once asked
you about your past.

580
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:16,533
What exactly have you been
hiding from me?

581
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:27,494
Where is Chan?

582
01:00:27,802 --> 01:00:28,359
Gone to the Palace!

583
01:00:28,569 --> 01:00:30,161
You fool!

584
01:00:37,244 --> 01:00:39,576
By royal command,
I am the new Governor of Suzhou!

585
01:00:39,779 --> 01:00:41,371
Who are you?

586
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:45,975
Let's go!

587
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:55,924
Let's go!

588
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:44,371
You must be hiding something
important from me.

589
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:47,501
Quick! Go and save our daughter!

590
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:52,769
No!

591
01:02:58,673 --> 01:03:01,335
His Highness
the Crown Prince arrives.

592
01:03:16,222 --> 01:03:17,849
When will you make your move?

593
01:03:19,725 --> 01:03:21,192
So you know.

594
01:03:23,796 --> 01:03:25,229
How did you find out?

595
01:03:25,598 --> 01:03:26,621
It is not your concern.

596
01:03:26,831 --> 01:03:28,799
When do you plan to make your move?

597
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:40,134
The night of the
Chrysanthemum Festival.

598
01:03:48,252 --> 01:03:49,479
What are you afraid of?

599
01:03:49,686 --> 01:03:50,618
This has nothing to do with you.

600
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,152
How can it have nothing
to do with me?

601
01:03:53,389 --> 01:03:54,481
I am the Crown Prince.

602
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:58,252
The entire country is going
to think I planned it all.

603
01:04:01,096 --> 01:04:03,121
So what if you did?

604
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:13,066
You lunatic!

605
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:15,868
You raving lunatic!

606
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:17,408
Father is right.

607
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:20,808
You do need to take his medicine
every day until you die!

608
01:04:21,015 --> 01:04:21,982
Get out!

609
01:04:22,183 --> 01:04:23,979
If you proceed
with your insane plan...

610
01:04:24,551 --> 01:04:27,918
you are asking me to die.

611
01:04:28,755 --> 01:04:32,213
All you ever wanted
was for me to die.

612
01:04:35,294 --> 01:04:36,420
Yes...

613
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:39,563
I want you to die.

614
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:13,054
Wan!

615
01:05:13,996 --> 01:05:15,088
Wan!

616
01:05:15,464 --> 01:05:16,522
Wan!

617
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:17,926
Help!

618
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,868
Your Majesty,
fortunately the wound is not fatal.

619
01:05:25,073 --> 01:05:26,540
His Highness will recover.

620
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:02,670
You must be hiding
something else from me.

621
01:06:04,609 --> 01:06:06,508
Why are you doing this?

622
01:06:08,179 --> 01:06:10,010
I have no choice.

623
01:06:12,783 --> 01:06:14,216
I beg you...

624
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:17,348
please stop...

625
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:20,117
for your own good.

626
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:23,486
I know...

627
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:29,830
but I cannot do as you say.

628
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:38,871
Wan.

629
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:42,572
Your father is arriving any moment.

630
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,895
The secret between the two of you...

631
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:39,058
has been known to me for some time.

632
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:42,103
Ever since...

633
01:08:43,173 --> 01:08:45,004
night after night...

634
01:08:45,675 --> 01:08:47,699
I have lain in bed with my eyes open.

635
01:08:51,447 --> 01:08:53,813
Have you ever considered
how I might feel?

636
01:08:56,118 --> 01:08:57,880
I do not blame you.

637
01:08:58,486 --> 01:08:59,953
I know...

638
01:09:00,154 --> 01:09:02,349
it was she who seduced you.

639
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:38,521
Father.

640
01:10:06,982 --> 01:10:08,506
Where is your mother?

641
01:10:09,384 --> 01:10:11,352
Your Majesty, Mother is dressing.

642
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:13,111
I shall go and see if she is ready.

643
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:38,267
These berries...

644
01:10:38,778 --> 01:10:40,836
were your birth mother's favorite.

645
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:42,740
Even after the Festival...

646
01:10:43,048 --> 01:10:45,039
she would wear them for a few days...

647
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,150
to ward off evil spirits.

648
01:10:48,053 --> 01:10:49,350
Yes.

649
01:10:49,555 --> 01:10:51,546
Each year, on this day...

650
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:53,919
you too should wear...

651
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,888
a twig of berries...

652
01:10:56,094 --> 01:10:57,891
to honor the memory of
your birth mother.

653
01:10:58,096 --> 01:11:00,087
I shall not forget, Father.

654
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:07,958
His Highness!

655
01:12:11,363 --> 01:12:13,922
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives!

656
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:23,234
Mother...

657
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:27,202
what happened with Wan?

658
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,612
He knows everything.

659
01:12:36,718 --> 01:12:38,413
Will he tell?

660
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:56,027
The chrysanthemums are all ready.

661
01:12:57,205 --> 01:12:58,967
They deserve to bloom once.

662
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:03,970
I understand...

663
01:13:10,049 --> 01:13:11,607
Jai.

664
01:13:30,034 --> 01:13:31,262
Go then.

665
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,248
By order of the Commanding Officer:

666
01:15:40,486 --> 01:15:42,147
To reward your hard work...

667
01:15:42,355 --> 01:15:43,583
a banquet has been prepared.

668
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:44,721
While at your feast...

669
01:15:44,924 --> 01:15:47,449
your duties will be assumed by
our Commanding Officer.

670
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:50,184
Orders received.
We thank our gracious Prince.

671
01:17:27,918 --> 01:17:29,249
Mom, what is going on?

672
01:17:29,453 --> 01:17:30,943
The Emperor wants to
kill our entire family.

673
01:17:31,154 --> 01:17:31,882
Why?

674
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:33,520
Where is Dad?

675
01:17:45,233 --> 01:17:47,030
The Empress sent help.

676
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:49,226
Please, this way.

677
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:01,309
Your Majesties - Emperor,
Empress...

678
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:03,983
the Imperial Doctor's
family is outside.

679
01:18:04,551 --> 01:18:06,279
Let them come.

680
01:18:14,227 --> 01:18:16,024
So it was you who defended them.

681
01:18:23,435 --> 01:18:24,766
Leave us.

682
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:53,919
Your Majesty,
I have come to you still alive.

683
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,758
It was beneath contempt...

684
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,456
to attack us under
the cloak of darkness.

685
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:02,034
Once again you have deceived me.

686
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:05,396
You coward and hypocrite...

687
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:12,378
my daughter and I stand before you.

688
01:19:12,747 --> 01:19:14,271
Go ahead, kill us!

689
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:16,574
You should not have worked
for the Empress.

690
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:20,079
You brought this upon them.

691
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:21,982
And my husband and daughter?

692
01:19:22,188 --> 01:19:23,951
They knew nothing about me!

693
01:19:24,858 --> 01:19:27,223
But they knew far too much about me.

694
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:30,757
Father...

695
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:32,097
who is she?

696
01:19:32,298 --> 01:19:32,787
Wan!

697
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:34,090
Wan...

698
01:19:35,401 --> 01:19:36,265
I shall tell you who she is.

699
01:19:36,468 --> 01:19:37,900
Your Majesty!

700
01:19:39,037 --> 01:19:40,629
She is the woman in the portrait.

701
01:19:40,838 --> 01:19:42,237
Empress!

702
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,108
Your father's first wife...

703
01:19:45,877 --> 01:19:47,538
your birth mother.

704
01:19:51,214 --> 01:19:52,272
Father...

705
01:19:54,184 --> 01:19:55,913
is this true?

706
01:20:01,524 --> 01:20:02,821
Yes...

707
01:20:06,362 --> 01:20:07,989
it is true.

708
01:20:13,335 --> 01:20:15,360
Now are you satisfied?

709
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:17,502
Yes.

710
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,467
I wanted him to know...

711
01:20:19,674 --> 01:20:21,972
what kind of a person
his father is.

712
01:20:22,177 --> 01:20:24,576
Didn't you say she died
a long time ago?

713
01:20:52,104 --> 01:20:53,594
Chan!

714
01:20:53,872 --> 01:20:55,533
Chan!

715
01:20:59,977 --> 01:21:01,501
Mother...

716
01:21:02,747 --> 01:21:05,238
why did you have to tell us?

717
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:16,183
Chan!

718
01:21:22,431 --> 01:21:26,026
Chan!

719
01:21:26,235 --> 01:21:27,998
Chan!

720
01:23:24,409 --> 01:23:26,070
What else is there up your sleeve?

721
01:23:26,277 --> 01:23:27,744
You will find out soon.

722
01:23:31,482 --> 01:23:32,141
Yu!

723
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:33,009
Mother...

724
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,276
this is now out of your hands!

725
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:37,376
Your shameful incestuous affair...

726
01:23:37,588 --> 01:23:39,020
you think I don't know?

727
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,690
You think I am still a child?

728
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:44,053
I know what you and
Jai have been planning.

729
01:23:45,295 --> 01:23:46,922
I am acting first!

730
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,656
Wan!

731
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:53,298
Wan!

732
01:23:55,337 --> 01:23:56,463
Have you gone mad?

733
01:23:56,672 --> 01:23:57,969
I am not mad!

734
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,231
Abdicate immediately
and offer me the throne!

735
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:04,971
I know you have never liked me.

736
01:24:05,246 --> 01:24:06,941
Who has ever cared about me?

737
01:24:07,248 --> 01:24:09,375
Who has ever thought about me?

738
01:24:10,118 --> 01:24:12,813
He is your older brother!

739
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,817
And I want to kill him!

740
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:17,256
I hate him!

741
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:19,015
I hate you all!

742
01:25:17,246 --> 01:25:20,477
I... I... I am so sorry.

743
01:28:02,262 --> 01:28:03,695
Attack!

744
01:29:23,703 --> 01:29:25,170
Halt!

745
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,268
Attack!

746
01:31:18,741 --> 01:31:19,867
Throw!

747
01:31:23,346 --> 01:31:25,211
Shields up!

748
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:29,841
Shields up!

749
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,477
Shields up!

750
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:38,049
Forward!

751
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:43,424
Forward!

752
01:31:56,243 --> 01:31:57,540
Attack!

753
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:16,358
Do not harm Prince Jai!

754
01:32:17,428 --> 01:32:20,795
Do not harm Prince Jai!

755
01:33:19,986 --> 01:33:21,009
Throw!

756
01:33:22,788 --> 01:33:24,779
Catch!

757
01:33:26,892 --> 01:33:28,154
Ready!

758
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,122
Ready!

759
01:33:29,328 --> 01:33:30,420
Ready!

760
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:31,618
Ready!

761
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:32,523
Ready!

762
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:33,697
Ready!

763
01:33:33,898 --> 01:33:34,990
Ready!

764
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:36,097
Ready!

765
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,564
Ready!

766
01:33:38,903 --> 01:33:40,495
Shoot!

767
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:12,456
Hold the gates!

768
01:36:23,053 --> 01:36:24,451
Take him alive!

769
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:47,983
Kneel!

770
01:38:55,691 --> 01:38:57,181
Rise!

771
01:39:01,297 --> 01:39:03,787
You took the life
of my favorite son.

772
01:39:05,934 --> 01:39:08,061
He told me everything...

773
01:39:08,603 --> 01:39:10,332
about your pitiful coup.

774
01:39:10,538 --> 01:39:12,403
I thought he would.

775
01:39:20,714 --> 01:39:22,944
You are truly insane.

776
01:40:15,698 --> 01:40:17,131
Execute!

777
01:42:43,666 --> 01:42:45,361
I had a plan.

778
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:48,131
After the Chrysanthemum Festival...

779
01:42:48,337 --> 01:42:50,601
I was going to remove
Wan as Crown Prince...

780
01:42:50,906 --> 01:42:53,066
and appoint you as my heir.

781
01:42:55,844 --> 01:42:57,141
I had told you before...

782
01:42:57,579 --> 01:42:59,069
what I do not give you...

783
01:43:00,248 --> 01:43:02,148
you must never take by force.

784
01:43:05,485 --> 01:43:07,180
The Imperial Flag...

785
01:43:07,387 --> 01:43:10,220
was a final warning to you.

786
01:43:11,658 --> 01:43:13,182
I always knew...

787
01:43:13,627 --> 01:43:15,594
that this was not a
battle I could have won.

788
01:43:17,129 --> 01:43:18,994
Kill me, or dismember me...

789
01:43:19,265 --> 01:43:21,062
you will do as you wish...

790
01:43:22,001 --> 01:43:24,526
but I need you to know, Father...

791
01:43:24,737 --> 01:43:26,068
that I did not rebel...

792
01:43:26,271 --> 01:43:28,102
for the sake of the crown.

793
01:43:31,877 --> 01:43:34,175
I did it for the sake of my mother.

794
01:43:43,921 --> 01:43:46,446
Heaven, earth, and man unite.

795
01:43:46,657 --> 01:43:48,818
Fortune and prosperity to all...

796
01:43:49,026 --> 01:43:50,219
Midnight...

797
01:43:50,426 --> 01:43:51,620
The Hour of the Rat.

798
01:43:51,828 --> 01:43:54,160
The Chrysanthemum Festival begins.

799
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:26,258
The phoenix spreads its wings.

800
01:44:26,459 --> 01:44:30,293
Sun and moon shine bright.

801
01:44:30,497 --> 01:44:34,399
The four seas rise.

802
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:38,502
Frontiers push back.

803
01:44:41,373 --> 01:44:45,275
Humanity, wisdom, trust...

804
01:44:45,477 --> 01:44:49,378
Ritual, righteousness, loyalty...

805
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:53,482
Deep virtue pervades.

806
01:44:53,685 --> 01:44:58,246
Father to son... Wise kings all.

807
01:45:00,557 --> 01:45:05,790
Follow the Heavens' way.

808
01:45:05,996 --> 01:45:11,433
Peace and glory above...

809
01:45:11,634 --> 01:45:16,799
Rain down...

810
01:45:17,006 --> 01:45:22,568
On all nations below.

811
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,145
Your servant kneels before the Empress.

812
01:45:25,347 --> 01:45:27,212
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.

813
01:45:34,855 --> 01:45:36,584
What is the punishment...

814
01:45:37,858 --> 01:45:39,689
for a prince in rebellion?

815
01:45:40,361 --> 01:45:41,259
Your Majesty -

816
01:45:41,462 --> 01:45:43,522
to be torn apart by five horses.

817
01:45:44,397 --> 01:45:45,796
You hear ?

818
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:47,826
I...

819
01:45:48,835 --> 01:45:51,030
is prepared to spare you...

820
01:45:52,271 --> 01:45:54,569
if you agree to one thing.

821
01:45:55,941 --> 01:45:58,000
From now on...

822
01:45:59,411 --> 01:46:01,140
every day...

823
01:46:01,747 --> 01:46:05,308
you will personally serve
your mother's medicine.

824
01:47:04,136 --> 01:47:05,125
Mother...

825
01:47:06,305 --> 01:47:07,897
your son has failed you.

826
01:47:09,075 --> 01:47:11,202
Please forgive me.
