1
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,499
<i>This will be the final
boarding call for flight 2...</i>

2
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,102
<i>to London, Heathrow.</i>

3
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,113
Okay.

4
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,283
I'm not even
gonna say it, Kate.

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,952
Then it'll be
like I never left.

6
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,630
Okay?

7
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,601
Wait.

8
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,516
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

9
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,778
About the plane?

10
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,150
You think it's gonna crash?
Don't say that.

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,247
No. Look, I know that we've
talked about this a thousand times,

12
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,919
and we agreed that going to
London was the right thing to do.

13
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,726
But in my heart...
this feels wrong.

14
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,403
Don't go, Jack.
You mean don't go at all?

15
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,802
Well, what...
what about my internship?

16
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,603
Believe me, I know... I know what an
incredible opportunity this is for you.

17
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,645
For us, Kate.
Right, for us.

18
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,182
But I'm afraid that if you
get on that plane... Look.

19
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:01,515
We're at the airport. Nobody ever
thinks clearly at the airport.

20
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,317
So we should just trust
the decision we already made.

21
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,985
You've been accepted to one of the
best law schools in the country.

22
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:12,758
I've got this internship at Barclay's
Bank. We have a great plan, honey.

23
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,899
You wanna do something
great, Jack?

24
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:21,736
Let's flush the plan. Let's
start our lives right now, today.

25
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,207
I mean, I have no idea what
this life is gonna look like,

26
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,440
but I know that it has the both
of us in it, and I choose us.

27
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,309
The plan doesn't
make us great, Jack.

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,617
What we have together,
that's what makes us great.

29
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,629
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you too. I do.

30
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,570
And one year in London
is not gonna change that.

31
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,170
A hundred years
couldn't change that.

32
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,202
<i>Experts are predicting
a mild rally in the bond market.</i>

33
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,441
<i>Last night was incredible.
Huh?</i>

34
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,677
I said, last night was great.

35
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,381
You are
an amazing lover.

36
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,650
Thanks.
You're not bad yourself.

37
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,194
- I wanna see you again.
- I'd like that too.

38
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:53,527
<i>Tonight.
It's Christmas eve, Jack.</i>

39
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,034
So? I'll pour
eggnog over you.

40
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,833
- I have to go visit
my parents out in Jersey.

41
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,843
Jersey? Do you have any idea
what the traffic's gonna be like?

42
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,379
That's why I'm taking
the train.

43
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,776
It was nice
meeting you, Jack.

44
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:10,539
<i>Mrs. Peterson.
Hello, Jack.</i>

45
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,278
You don't have to stop singing on my
account. Oh, it's because I'm shy, Betty.

46
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:23,515
So, when are you gonna leave that old
corpse, Mr. Peterson, and run away with me?

47
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,059
You know you could never
satisfy me the way he does.

48
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,457
Ah.

49
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,588
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Campbell.

50
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,758
How'd you make out
this year, Tony?

51
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:39,497
About four grand, and a bottle
of 25-year-old Scotch from 9D.

52
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,630
I'm putting it all in
commercial paper like you said.

53
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,971
Good, but just until
the deutsche mark turns.

54
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,637
- Thank you, Mr. Campbell.
- All right.

55
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,020
Good morning, Joe.
Merry Christmas, sir.

56
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,665
Campbell wants these
available. Thanks, Adelle.

57
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,666
Better you than me.

58
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:48,135
If MedTech shares fall
any lower than 43,

59
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,141
we're in trouble
with the stock valuations.

60
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,974
So for God's sake, please watch what
you say to your institutional customers.

61
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,518
We still have almost a full day of trading
before zero hour, and I don't want any trouble.

62
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,554
A penny for
your thoughts, Alan.

63
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,853
Hmm? Oh, God, I'm sorry.

64
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,860
Jack, I was thinking about,
you know, Dee and the kids.

65
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,226
I promised I'd be home for
dinner. It's Christmas eve, Jack.

66
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,789
Oh, is that tonight?

67
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,065
You think I like being
here on Christmas eve, Alan?

68
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,470
No. Well, maybe.

69
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,975
Okay.

70
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:29,377
Okay, maybe I do have a touch of
tunnel vision this holiday season.

71
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,712
But in two days
we're going to announce...

72
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,981
one of the largest mergers
in U.S. Corporate history.

73
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,887
When a deal like this turns up, you get
on it and you ride it till it's over.

74
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,722
<i>You don't ask it
for a vacation.</i>

75
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,923
December 26. After that there'll be
so much money floating around here,

76
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,932
it'll be like Christmas
every day.

77
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,403
December 26, people. If you'd like to
celebrate that day, you all have my blessing.

78
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,531
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to be excited.

79
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,269
I want my gift to you to be the first
gift you open this year. You know why?

80
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:02,108
- Because my gift comes
with ten zeroes.

81
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,082
You're right.
I'm focused. I'm there.

82
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,017
Good man. Everybody, turn to
page 12 in your prospectus.

83
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,125
You have six messages. Two of them
are imperative. Whoa. I'm going home.

84
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,326
I'm not even here now. Good night.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

85
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,268
It's only 8:30. I'm disappointed.
Got some last-minute shopping to do?

86
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:29,432
You too? This holiday's about giving. I'm
giving everything I've got to this deal.

87
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,740
So in a way, I'm more Christmassy than
anybody. You're my role model, Jack.

88
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,339
Oh, and Oxford called.
Ooh, my suits are ready.

89
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,646
- Mm-hmm.
- Care for a Lifesaver?

90
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,983
No, thank you.
Help yourself.

91
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,994
Kate Reynolds. Her assistant said you
could reach her at home after 8:00.

92
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,567
Kate Reynolds was
my girlfriend in college.

93
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,693
<i>I almost married her.
You?</i>

94
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,135
Married?
Almost married.

95
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:04,005
And almost a broker at
E.F. Hutton. Excuse me?

96
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,307
She didn't want me
to go to London.

97
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,281
We're standing at the airport saying
good-bye, and she asked me to stay.

98
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,045
So you left her.

99
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:17,145
- Wasn't easy.
- Oh, stop it. I'm getting all weepy.

100
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,315
I took the road
less traveled, Adelle.

101
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,862
And look where it took ya. I'm
gonna get this gal on the phone.

102
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,829
Nope. You almost married this woman.

103
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,871
You're not even curious
why she called?

104
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,236
She's probably just having
a fit of nostalgia.

105
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,744
Lonely Christmas eve. Called the one that
got away. Why call her back and mislead her?

106
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,211
This happened
a very, very long time ago.

107
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,113
<i>8:35 on Christmas eve.</i>

108
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,378
Jack Campbell still
at his desk.

109
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,717
<i>Now there's
a Hallmark moment for you.</i>

110
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,815
<i>Peter, I don't see you
rushing home to trim the tree.</i>

111
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,693
That's because I'm a heartless
bastard who only cares about money.

112
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,232
Well, you know what?
God love you for that.

113
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,533
Got a call
from Terry Haight.

114
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,073
Bob Thomas is nervous.

115
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,736
That'll happen when you're about to
spend $130 billion on some aspirin.

116
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,575
Somebody's gotta
nurse him through this.

117
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,945
Why are you staring
at my breasts, Peter?

118
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,950
I need you, tiger.
Where is he?

119
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,385
- Aspen.
- Call Aunt Irma and tell her I won't be able to make it.

120
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,185
<i>You're a credit
to capitalism, Jack.</i>

121
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,192
Hey, Peter, let me
ask you a question.

122
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,593
An old girlfriend calls you out
of the blue on Christmas eve.

123
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,326
- What do you do?
- You suddenly having trouble getting dates?

124
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,666
- Yeah.
- Leave it in the past.

125
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,969
Old flames are like
old tax returns...

126
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,169
put 'em in the file cabinet for three
years, and then you cut 'em loose.

127
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,107
I'll leave from my office
tomorrow in the afternoon.

128
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,381
Call the group. Schedule an
emergency strategy session for noon.

129
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,389
That'll be a nice
little holiday treat.

130
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,550
Good night, Frank.
Hey, Mr. Campbell.

131
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,449
Why didn't you call down? I
would have had Joe get your ride.

132
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,022
I'm thinking I'll walk tonight.
It's a nice night for it.

133
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,091
I'll send your car home
for you. That'll be fine.

134
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,752
- And Merry Christmas to you, sir.
- To you too.

135
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,366
Eggnog? Yeah, dairy case. Five dollar.

136
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,378
Okay.

137
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,884
Hey, yo. Y'all do the lotto here,
right? Y'all do the lotto here?

138
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,485
Yeah. Cool. 'Cause I got a
winner, baby. I got a winner.

139
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,057
Certified, good as gold. I know lotto keep
a lot of brothers down, but not Cash Money.

140
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,568
Don't do me none, son,
'cause I'd be like...

141
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,639
Bang on the lottery! You know
what I mean? It's all good.

142
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,005
Relax, son. Relax. I got you
four numbers. Check it. Bust it.

143
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,308
6, 14, 16, 49.
That's a winner, son.

144
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,315
$238, B.
Cheddar coming.

145
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:10,286
Give me my money. I'm sorry. Your
ticket bad. You draw in the lines.

146
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,416
What are you talking about, B? You draw in
the lines with a pencil. I know about this.

147
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,224
Yo, buster, check the
ticket, son. No, you get out.

148
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,322
<i>Yo, you ain't even looked at the ticket.
You lookin' at me, son. Check the ticket.</i>

149
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,197
You get out now! You take
the ticket somewhere else!

150
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,498
Next customer in line!

151
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,768
You get out or I call 9-1-1.

152
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,570
Oh, my God!

153
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,908
Check the ticket, stupid.

154
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:39,348
Look at the ticket. Shit, now
I'm gonna make you call God.

155
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,080
<i>That's my word. You best check that
ticket, fool! Let me see the ticket.</i>

156
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,521
Was I talkin' to you?

157
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,923
Maybe I'll buy it from you. You
know, make a little business deal.

158
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,030
Stupid-ass white boy in $2,000 suit gets
capped trying to be a hero. News at 11:00.

159
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,935
That's what you wanna see? You wanna see
Cash up in here? You want me to set it, son?

160
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,453
Do you wanna die?

161
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:02,867
Do you wanna die?

162
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,039
Do you want to die?

163
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,605
No.

164
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,549
Look, I'm talking about
a business deal.

165
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,523
Okay? I buy the ticket
from you for $200.

166
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:24,392
I take it to a store where the guy behind
the counter doesn't have a death wish.

167
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,294
I just made myself
a quick $38.

168
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,867
Like I said, it's...

169
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,164
it's just a business deal.

170
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,248
All right. Yeah.

171
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,250
All right.

172
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,153
You blew it, B.
You blew it.

173
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,127
The ticket was real.
Damn, you had your chance too.

174
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,363
Come on, Jack.
Let's get out of here.

175
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,376
How'd you know my name
was Jack?

176
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,714
I call
all you guys Jack.

177
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,982
Here. Nice doing
business with ya.

178
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,117
Hey. Hey, um...

179
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,363
What do you want to carry
that gun around for anyway?

180
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,866
You're just gonna wind up
doing something you regret.

181
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,233
You're talking to the wrong
person about regrets, Jack.

182
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:43,775
I mean, there must be programs
out there and, um, opportunities.

183
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,312
Wait a minute. Are you
actually trying to save me?

184
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,447
This is bananas.

185
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,542
This man thinks
I need to be saved, yo!

186
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,553
Well, everybody
needs something.

187
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,216
Yeah? Well, what
do you need, Jack?

188
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,126
Me? You just said,
everybody needs something.

189
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,356
I got everything I need.

190
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,901
Wow. It must be great
being you.

191
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,597
I'm not saying that you'd be able to do it
without some hard work, some honest hard work,

192
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,038
and possibly some medicine.

193
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,512
You know, I'm gonna
really enjoy this.

194
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,707
You just remember that
you did this, Jack, okay?

195
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,342
You brought this
on yourself.

196
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,019
Merry Christmas.

197
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,009
Mmm, ten more minutes, Jack.

198
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,853
It's Christmas.

199
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,799
Never mind.

200
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,602
<i>- Who's here?
- Rise and shine.</i>

201
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,542
Don't you think
we should open some presents?

202
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,172
<i>- I think you should give Mama five more minutes in bed.
- Come on, Dad. Get up.</i>

203
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,876
Can we do that? Yea! It's Christmas!

204
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:44,752
<i>- It's Christmas!
- Look, your sister's jumping on the bed.</i>

205
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,315
<i>What is this dog doing on the
bed? He needs to get off the bed.</i>

206
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,759
Did Santa come? I don't
know. We'll have to go see.

207
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,388
- Let's go see the presents.
- You wanna get some presents?

208
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,558
<i>Mommy just needs
to wake up.</i>

209
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,797
Jack. Strong coffee.

210
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,815
Oh, Jack.
Merry Christmas, dear.

211
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,109
Lorraine. Ed.

212
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,814
Hey, Jack, you old bird dog.
Merry Christmas to ya.

213
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,357
Talk to him. One day a year
away from the Ponderosa.

214
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,189
<i>- I don't think that's asking too much.
- This is who I am.</i>

215
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,560
Tell her, Jack, for God's sake. You're
the only one around here that gets me.

216
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,362
- I need some eggnog.
- 'Course you do, sweet thing. Almost 8:00 in the morning.

217
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,096
Excuse me. Where you going, Jack?

218
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,940
Josh, Annie, giddyup! Where's
my car? Where's my Ferrari?

219
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,946
What?
Where's my Ferrari?

220
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,415
What the hell are you talking... What's
he talking about? You got a Ferrari?

221
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,952
Let me borrow your car and then
I promise I'll have it returned.

222
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,420
My Caddy?
Drive your own damn car.

223
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,923
Oh, just let him borrow your
precious Cadillac, for God sakes.

224
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,553
There's a perfectly good minivan
sitting out there in the driveway. Here.

225
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,188
What the hell's wrong
with him anyway?

226
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,027
- Tony, thank God!
- Sorry, pal. Entrance is for residents and guests only.

227
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,226
What? What are
you talking about?

228
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,702
Jack Campbell, penthouse "C."
What's the matter with you? Uh-huh.

229
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,899
Mrs. Peterson, I think there's
something wrong with our man Tony here.

230
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,908
Who is this man?

231
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,446
Oh, come on. What is going
on with you two this morning?

232
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,950
Is this like a, uh...
a Christmas joke?

233
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,248
"Who is this man?" Well, we're on
the co-op board together, Betty.

234
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,653
And we fought side by side
for garbage disposals.

235
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,056
And every morning we exchange
quasi-sexual witty banter.

236
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,685
Okay? Shall I call the cops?
I'm gonna call the cops.

237
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,287
No, I'm gonna call the cops!
You're scaring me.

238
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,163
- No, no, no, no.
- Thank you for not calling the cops.

239
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,897
Now, I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna
get some sleep. Then I'll be fine.

240
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,565
Sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige
isn't dead. Not yet anyway.

241
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,872
Let's, um... Let's get you some help. Surely
there's a shelter somewhere in this city.

242
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,969
A shelter?

243
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,141
Hey, hey, are you
smacked out of your head?

244
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,618
I'm the richest man in this building!
I've got twice the square footage you have!

245
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,315
And I'm going upstairs.
Take a walk, pal.

246
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,086
Oh, not cool.
Not cool!

247
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,718
You wanna get cute?
Get cute.

248
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,889
I'm gonna go to my office. I'm gonna file
a complaint to the manager of the building.

249
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:45,766
I'm gonna have you fired, Tony. And, Mrs.
Peterson, you're on notice with the co-op board!

250
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,568
So you better just stop whatever
this is that you're doing!

251
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,378
Oh, yeah.
Oh. Oh, yeah.

252
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,181
Oh, come on!

253
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,263
Frank, you won't believe what's been
happening to me. Is Adelle here yet?

254
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,266
Hold it right there.
Where's Mintz?

255
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,496
The building is closed, pal.
You have to come back tomorrow.

256
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:24,132
Frank, why do I feel the need to remind
you that I'm Jack Campbell, President?

257
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:29,009
I don't care who you are. It's Christmas,
and like I told you, the building is closed.

258
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,207
I don't think
you heard me correctly.

259
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,876
I'm Jack Campbell.

260
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,215
Jack Campbell!

261
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,056
President!

262
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,299
Have a nice holiday, man.

263
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,850
- That's my car!
- Hi, Jack.

264
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,654
- You stole my car.
- I know this whole thing is really bizarre to you...

265
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,752
<i>and you're feeling
quite shocked, but just hop in.</i>

266
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,492
I'll explain everything
to you, okay?

267
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,569
Come on.

268
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,569
Come on.

269
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,542
You're probably gonna wanna
buckle up, Jack. This thing moves.

270
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,817
- What's happening to me?
- Breathe into the bag, Jack.

271
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,859
This kind of thing makes a lot of guys
have to throw up. I seen it happen before.

272
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,418
So if you feel the urge, you roll
down the window and do it out there.

273
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,523
Try not to get
so worked up, Jack.

274
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,534
After all, you brought
this on yourself.

275
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,729
Brought what on myself?
I didn't do anything!

276
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,239
"I got everything I need. "
That sound familiar?

277
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:07,675
You mean 'cause you thought I was
cocky, I'm now on a permanent acid trip?

278
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,577
Bag yourself, Jack.

279
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,814
<i>Oh, my God! Ah!</i>

280
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,653
The way you intervened in that store last
night, you did a good thing there, Jack.

281
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,559
I mean, it was incredibly impressive
all the way across the board...

282
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,324
<i>Oh, God! To the upper
echelons of the organization.</i>

283
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:30,026
Please just tell me what's
happening to me in plain English...

284
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,899
without the mumbo-jumbo.

285
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,531
<i>This is a glimpse, Jack.
A glimpse?</i>

286
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,075
I... A glimpse of what?

287
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,044
You're gonna have to figure that out
for yourself and you got plenty of time.

288
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,876
- How much time?
- As much time as it takes,

289
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,075
which in your case is probably
gonna be considerable.

290
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,813
Okay, look, look. I-I-I
just want my life back, okay?

291
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,254
Now, what's it gonna take?
You wanna talk turkey?

292
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,020
<i>Let's talk turkey.
How much money?</i>

293
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,722
- It doesn't work like that, and I can't tell you why.
- Why not?

294
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,766
Because you have to figure
this thing out for yourself.

295
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,099
<i>Are you listening to me? Figure it
out, figure it out. Figure out what?</i>

296
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,469
- Let it come to you, man.
- I don't have time for this right now.

297
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:13,567
- I'm in the middle of a deal.
- Well, you're working on a new deal now, baby.

298
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,649
What's this?
Open it.

299
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,413
What is it,
some kind of a signal?

300
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,892
Will you come
whenever I ring it?

301
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,984
Now you gotta
get out of the car, Jack.

302
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,864
But what do I do? I'm sorry. I
can't spend any more time with you.

303
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,596
I got some other business I gotta take
care of. No, y-y-you did this to me.

304
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,831
You can't just
leave me like this.

305
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,843
Okay. Look, you wanna get some air?
Let's get outside, get some air.

306
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,916
We'll walk and I'll explain
everything to you, okay?

307
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,713
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

308
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,903
<i>Excuse me. Do you know
where Merrison Street is?</i>

309
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,136
Jeannie.

310
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,906
<i>I found Jack.
Oh, there you are, stranger.</i>

311
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,548
Where you been?

312
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,889
You look terrible.
Truth is, I expected you.

313
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,589
Kate called and asked
if I knew where you were, so...

314
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,433
Oh, I put the Barcalounger in the center
of the room. It's throwing everybody off.

315
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,437
What do you think?

316
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,678
It's a great room.
Great room.

317
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,576
You and me, buddy,
we know how to live, huh?

318
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,581
Come on.

319
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,613
Come on, Jack.
Come on...

320
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,155
Whoo!

321
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,450
Come on, buddy.
Take your seat.

322
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,226
Are you okay?

323
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,138
I mean, you take off Christmas morning and
you don't tell anyone where you're going.

324
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,611
- We're friends?
- Talk to me.

325
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,615
I'm having kind of
a bad day.

326
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,249
You know, I read somewhere that the
suicide rate doubles during the holiday.

327
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,123
What am I saying that for? You
don't wanna hear that. Come on.

328
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,996
Is it...
Is it trouble at work?

329
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,259
I... I don't think so.

330
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,304
Well, it's not Kate,
is it?

331
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,972
You see, huh? It's like we're
inside each other's heads.

332
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,148
Kate's my wife.

333
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,514
Just keep saying it over and over again,
Jack, like a mantra. Keep saying it.

334
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,958
Look, you know,
you fit the profile exactly...

335
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:55,465
in your 30s, house, kids,
financial responsibilities.

336
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,866
You start thinking this
isn't the life I dreamt about.

337
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,700
Where's the romance,
you know?

338
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,206
<i>Where's the joie de vivre?</i>

339
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,680
<i>Suddenly every lingerie ad
in the Newark Star-Ledger...</i>

340
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,375
represents a life
that you can't have.

341
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,717
It's just two kids,
right?

342
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,286
Come on. Come on.

343
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:27,125
<i>All right, sometimes it feels like you
gave up the whole world. I know that.</i>

344
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,565
But look what you got.
Look at that: Four bedrooms,

345
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,728
two-and-a-half baths,
a partially finished basement.

346
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,830
And good kids.
Look. You know what?

347
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,273
You probably don't wanna
hear this right now.

348
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,108
But remember last summer when I almost had
that thing with Arnie, Jr. 's speech therapist?

349
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,114
You remember what
you said to me?

350
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,082
You said, " Don't screw up
the best thing in your life...

351
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,055
just because you're a little
unsure about who you are. "

352
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,058
Okay?

353
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,593
Go get 'em, tiger.

354
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,806
<i>Could you hold on
a second?</i>

355
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:54,212
Um, never mind because...
because he just walked in.

356
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,549
Thank you. Thank you.

357
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,419
Do you... have any idea
what you put us through today?

358
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,063
You walk out of here
at 7:30 in the morning.

359
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,999
<i>You don't tell me where you're
going, or even that you're going.</i>

360
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,468
And I don't see you
till hours later?

361
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,007
I called all of our friends. I had
the state troopers looking for you.

362
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:20,202
I was on the phone with the
hospital, for God's sakes.

363
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:25,044
<i>What kind of man leaves his family Christmas
morning without a word about where he's going?</i>

364
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,414
What kind of a man does
that, Jack? I don't know.

365
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,682
Could you... Could you please
stop yelling at me?

366
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,452
Where were you?
I was in the city.

367
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,863
The city?
New York City?

368
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,197
Yeah.
Why?

369
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,643
Because that's where I live.
Don't start, Jack. Don't.

370
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,110
Look, you don't understand.

371
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,444
I... I... I woke up
this morning here.

372
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,346
And this is very strange
because...

373
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,354
this isn't my house.

374
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,482
And those aren't my kids.
I'm not Dad.

375
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,051
I- I-I'm not a dad.
You're not my wife.

376
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,563
You know what, Jack.
It's not funny this time...

377
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,531
<i>because I am really mad.</i>

378
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,159
<i>I mean, really mad.
I mean it.</i>

379
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,636
<i>I don't even...</i>

380
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,841
What...

381
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,140
What's that?

382
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,253
I like it.
Thanks, Dad.

383
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,822
That's mine. Hey,
I need that back.

384
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,153
She took my bell.

385
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,793
You missed the whole thing...

386
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,626
the pancakes
and the presents.

387
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,224
You spent six hours putting
that bike together for Annie,

388
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,897
and then you didn't even get to see
the look on her face when she opened it.

389
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,208
You missed Christmas, Jack.

390
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,981
I'm sorry.

391
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,146
You know, we don't even
have enough time for this.

392
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,485
And at least you're okay.
I'm okay, we're okay.

393
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,755
But you've gotta get dressed for the
Thompson party. And you are not wearing that.

394
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,092
<i>I don't care how hilarious
you think it is.</i>

395
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,666
Party? No, I'm not
going to a party.

396
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,100
You look forward to this party all
year. What is it with you today?

397
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,332
Believe me, Kate. I really don't
think that going to a party...

398
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,704
is the right move for me
at the present time.

399
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,905
Okay, fine. You know what? Then
you just do whatever you wanna do.

400
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:40,041
What are you doing? Telling my mother
she doesn't have to stay with the kids.

401
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,847
Why not?
Because you'll be here.

402
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,783
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

403
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:01,432
This is... This is
just subpar.

404
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,694
Lance, here you go.

405
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,897
Excuse me.

406
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,373
Kate. Jack.
Evelyn.

407
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,451
Come in. Hey, everybody,
Kate and Jack are here.

408
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,520
Hey!
Jeannie.

409
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,747
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

410
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,915
Jack,
Merry Christmas.

411
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:59,093
Whoops.
Here.

412
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,189
So, like the dress?
Oh, it's lovely.

413
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,861
I thought I saw you notice
it at the kids' recital.

414
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,200
It's lovely.
It's lovely.

415
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,649
There he is.

416
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,914
Hey, Jack. Happy holidays, man. Yeah.

417
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,586
<i>Jack, come on over.</i>

418
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,054
<i>Hey, Jack.
Cheers, baby.</i>

419
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,259
You guys see Van Horn last
night? Thirty-two points.

420
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,769
That kid's gonna take the Nets to the
championship. The Nets? Are you kidding?

421
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,772
They suck.

422
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,669
But they're due.
They're certainly due.

423
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,612
So, tomorrow's
the big day, Jackie.

424
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,446
Okay. Why?

425
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,146
My triple bypass.

426
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,815
I'm going under the knife
tomorrow. I told you that, right?

427
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,824
Triple bypass.
Yeah.

428
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,394
You really think you should
be eating all that? Eh.

429
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,395
Figure I'm going in
for a cleaning tomorrow.

430
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,590
Might as well load up on the
fried stuff tonight, right?

431
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,224
<i>That's good thinking, Bill.
Have another drink.</i>

432
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:15,601
Some fried pork, mashed potatoes.
He'll be dead by morning.

433
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,641
- How 'bout a cigar, Jack?
- Oh, no, thank you. I'm cutting down.

434
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,610
- Come on. They're American made, not Cuban.
- Oh, really?

435
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,304
Come on.

436
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,944
Very nice.
I thought you'd like 'em.

437
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,321
Mm. Mmm!

438
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,323
Superb.

439
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,087
How 'bout you, Arnie?
I'm all right. Thanks.

440
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,290
Finger food? No, thank you. I'm fine.

441
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,095
Come on. Soon as I put 'em
down, you're gonna grab a couple.

442
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,193
You always do.
No, I'm okay.

443
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,000
Let me. They will melt
in your mouth.

444
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,666
Yeah.

445
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,775
Good?
Fabulous.

446
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,513
At the end of this whole thing, she
made me this hand-embroidered sweater.

447
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,589
<i>It was really lovely.
How nice.</i>

448
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,182
<i>So I'm slipping it on and I notice that
she's misspelled the word "lawyers. "</i>

449
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,990
Uh-oh. I spent the entire
day walking around...

450
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:16,965
with a sweater that said,
"Nonprofit layers do it for free. "

451
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,498
So you're a lawyer?

452
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,535
A nonprofit lawyer?

453
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,839
Probono.

454
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,313
- You don't get paid at all? Nobody makes a dime?
- Jack?

455
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,382
"Anyhoo... "

456
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,568
I better go wake my mom.
There you go.

457
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,569
Uh, I don't think so.

458
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,731
- She's your dog, Jack.
- No, she's not.

459
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,207
You're right.
She's the kids' dog.

460
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,973
Maybe we should go wake Josh
and make him walk her.

461
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:15,218
If you take a dump sometime in this century,
then we could go home where it's warm.

462
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,724
If I can even remember
how to get home.

463
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,060
You remember,
don't you, girl?

464
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,134
Hello?

465
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,938
Hello?

466
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,981
- Hey!
- What?

467
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,089
Oh. That baby's crying.

468
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,182
And?

469
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:03,099
Don't give me that look, Jack.
Tuesday's your day and you know it.

470
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,601
And listen, try and get Josh
to day care on time, okay?

471
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,122
Yeah.

472
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,485
All right.

473
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,168
Holy Mother of God!

474
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,170
Ohh!

475
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,505
You're not really
my dad, are you?

476
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,672
No, I'm not.

477
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:27,547
I work on Wall Street, you
know, with the big buildings.

478
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,119
I live in an apartment
with a doorman.

479
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,883
And I can buy
almost anything I want.

480
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,686
This isn't my life.
It's just a glimpse.

481
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,029
Where's my real dad?

482
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,965
I don't know.
But don't worry.

483
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,765
He loves you, and I'm sure
he'll be back very soon.

484
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,732
What are you doing?

485
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,239
They did a pretty good job.

486
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,904
Who did?

487
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,916
The aliens
in the mother ship.

488
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,918
You look just like him.

489
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,853
Oh, thanks.

490
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,447
Slightly better looking
though, right?

491
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,228
Oh, no, you're not gonna
start crying, are you?

492
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,459
I don't think I could
really deal with that right now.

493
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,733
Do you like kids?

494
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,932
On a case by case basis.

495
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,777
Do you know how
to make chocolate milk?

496
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,281
I... I think I could
figure it out.

497
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:10,012
Promise you won't kidnap
me and my brother...

498
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,384
and plant stuff
in our brains?

499
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,116
Sure.

500
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,800
Welcome to Earth.

501
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:40,383
This is where babies go when
their parents are at work.

502
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,281
Check.

503
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,896
Just push the red button.

504
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,636
Okay.

505
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,583
Do I get a receipt
or something?

506
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:27,527
I have winter camping till 4:00
and ballet class until 5:30.

507
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,327
5:30. Okay.
And try not to be late...

508
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:34,803
'cause kids don't like to be the
last one picked up. Got it. Good tip.

509
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,806
Bye.
Bye.

510
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:44,078
- Hey, Annie. Where do I go now?
- Big Ed's.

511
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:48,049
Big Ed's Tires?
Why?

512
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:51,986
- 'Cause you work there.
- You mean I sell tires.

513
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,283
That's what I do.
I'm a tire salesman.

514
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,536
Good Lord!

515
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,762
- Morning, Jack.
- Hi.

516
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,598
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.

517
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,698
Hey, Jack.

518
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,512
<i>Jack, my boy.</i>

519
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:00,749
Hey, guess who I played
bridge with two nights ago.

520
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,122
Hell, you'll never guess.

521
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:07,664
One Sydney Potter. That's Sydney
Potter, C.E.O., BuyRite Transport.

522
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,825
Only the third biggest
trucking outfit in the state.

523
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,426
"Anyhoo," he's lookin'
for a new parts supplier.

524
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,234
We can handle volume
like that, now can't we, Jack?

525
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,269
I'm gonna have to
get back to you on that, Ed.

526
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,744
Right on.

527
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,747
Right on.

528
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:38,026
Excuse me. Uh, do I... do I have a
private office somewhere in the building?

529
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,893
Sure, Jack.

530
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,899
Where is it?

531
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,469
Oh, uh, it's...

532
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,561
it's right back...
right back there.

533
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,402
Thank you.
Yeah.

534
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,614
Oh, no.

535
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,059
You must've needed this
every day.

536
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,584
What are you smiling about?

537
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,157
<i>Eighty-eight?</i>

538
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,159
I was in London in 1988.

539
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,604
You never went to London.

540
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:39,575
<i>Jack, you're needed in mag
wheels. Customer waiting.</i>

541
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:49,652
I was the number one junior sales
associate for E.F. Hutton in 1988.

542
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,251
Did you know that? Uh, no. No, I didn't.

543
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,262
That's great.

544
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,924
That's the kind of thing you
could really build on, you know?

545
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:01,767
Uh-huh. Yeah. I mean, sales has
always been a feeder for M&A. Always.

546
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,703
Uh-huh.

547
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:07,334
Well, look, here we are.
The mag wheels. Mag wheels.

548
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,344
Oh.
So.

549
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,280
Hey, Jack, um,
are you sure you're okay?

550
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:17,012
Well, I'm just a little confused
right now about why I work here.

551
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,384
Uh...

552
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,890
I just started here
last Tuesday, so...

553
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,893
<i>The closing tip was
a mildly bullish plus-76.</i>

554
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:36,495
<i>Much of the market's action today was
fueled by the latest round of merger mania...</i>

555
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,369
to hit Wall Street...

556
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,740
when Global Health Systems and MedTech
Pharmaceutical announced their intentions...

557
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:46,475
<i>to join forces in a massive
$122 billion stock swap deal,</i>

558
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,813
the largest ever
in the health care industry.

559
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,683
When asked about the possible
anti-competitive implications,

560
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,518
<i>Global chairman Bob Thomas
referred reporters...</i>

561
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:58,924
to P.K. Lassiter & Company president
Alan Mintz, the architect behind the deal.

562
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:03,090
- That's my deal!
- Ironically, Mintz first met Thomas at a Lamaze class.

563
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,725
<i>While coaching their pregnant
wives, Mintz and Thomas... What?</i>

564
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,999
Struck up a dialogue, and two months
later, the deal with MedTech was born.

565
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:12,098
He wasn't the architect!
I'm the architect!

566
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:17,010
<i>Labor department officials announced today
that 275,000 new jobs have been created.</i>

567
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,106
The kids are asleep.

568
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,481
The kids, hon.
Honey.

569
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,521
Sweetheart, I said
the kids are asleep.

570
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:31,720
<i>That's just great. Those little
monkeys can be a real handful.</i>

571
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,661
Hey, I was watching that.

572
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,666
Not tonight.

573
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,466
Please leave
my socks alone.

574
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,209
<i>Wait.</i>

575
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:57,150
- You want me.
- That is the general idea, yeah.

576
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:02,185
Oh, well, maybe we should
grab a bottle of wine first.

577
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,260
Kind of break the ice.

578
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,524
Yeah, that's very funny.
Look, it's 10:30.

579
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,361
By 11:00 you're gonna be
snoring like a monster,

580
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,492
but that's very sweet.

581
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,036
I'll remember that
for next time.

582
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,936
Whatever you say...
honey.

583
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,066
Yeah.

584
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,024
Oh, God, you're beautiful.

585
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,097
Thanks, Jack.

586
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,599
No, I'm serious.

587
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,601
You're really stunning.

588
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,967
This is good stuff.
I want you to keep this up.

589
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:52,974
You were always a very pretty girl in
college. There's no question about that.

590
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,938
But this...

591
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:01,780
You've really grown
into a beautiful woman.

592
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,649
How can you do that?

593
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,922
What?

594
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:12,256
Look at me like you haven't seen
me every day for the last 13 years.

595
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,768
Okay, wait. Don't move.
Don't look.

596
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,997
Stay right there.

597
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,005
I got something.

598
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,807
Good night, sweetheart.

599
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,822
Okay, we're almost
out of here.

600
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,791
Mary Janes, Mommy.
You promised.

601
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,954
That's right. I did
promise. Okay. All right.

602
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,624
We're gonna stop at the
kids' shoe department first,

603
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,294
and then I gotta pick up my
watch from the battery store.

604
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,234
Then I'm gonna go
to the linen store.

605
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,500
Why don't we go
to all the stores?

606
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,668
Every single store in this
godforsaken shopping mall.

607
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,677
Wouldn't that
be exciting?

608
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,076
You know what?
Why don't I take the kids,

609
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:18,052
and you just stay here and hang
out in the men's department?

610
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,622
Come on, hon.

611
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,703
It's perfect
for your frame.

612
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,278
Why don't you try it on?

613
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:50,982
I might want to take an
inch out of the back. Okay.

614
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,987
<i>Lengthen the sleeve.</i>

615
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,993
You look amazing
in that suit.

616
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:04,465
I mean, really...
wow!

617
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,900
Off the charts, great.

618
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,234
It's an unbelievable thing.

619
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,174
Wearing this suit actually makes
me feel like a better person.

620
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,584
I'm gonna buy it.

621
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,357
It's $2,400.

622
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,484
Are you out of your mind?
Come on, let's go.

623
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,961
She got those shoes.
Those shoes were $25.

624
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,260
Come on.
Take it off, all right?

625
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:40,200
We'll go to the food court and get
one of those funnel cakes you like.

626
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,430
Daddy's a crazy guy.

627
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,439
No.

628
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,443
No.

629
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,107
Do you have any idea
what my life is like?

630
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:58,881
- Excuse me?
- I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva.

631
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,888
I drop the kids off,

632
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,720
spend eight hours
selling tires retail.

633
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,727
Retail, Kate.

634
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:09,356
<i>I pick the kids up,
walk the dog,</i>

635
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,401
which, by the way,
carries the added bonus...

636
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:16,495
of carting away
her monstrous crap.

637
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,803
<i>I play with the kids,
take out the garbage,</i>

638
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,809
get six hours of sleep
if I'm lucky.

639
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,811
Then everything starts
all over again.

640
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,574
<i>So what's in it for me?</i>

641
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,515
Wh-Where are my Mary Janes?

642
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,420
You know, it's sad to hear that your
life is such a disappointment to you.

643
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,755
<i>I can't believe it isn't
a disappointment to you!</i>

644
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:41,991
Jesus, Kate, I could have been a
thousand times the man I became.

645
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,760
I could have been one of
the richest... Forbes...

646
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:50,397
How could you do this to me? How could
you let me give up on my dreams like this?

647
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:54,341
Really, I want to know.

648
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,412
Who are you?

649
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,448
All right, look.
I'm sorry.

650
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:03,041
I'm sorry I was such
a saint before...

651
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,053
<i>and I'm such a prick now!</i>

652
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,419
But maybe I'm just not...

653
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:11,119
the same guy that I was
when we got married.

654
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,354
You know what?
Maybe you're not.

655
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:18,366
Because the Jack Campbell I married
would not need a $2,400 suit...

656
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,902
to feel better
about his life.

657
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,303
But I'm telling you, if that's
what it's gonna take, then buy it.

658
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:28,070
<i>Jesus! We'll take the money
out of the kids college fund.</i>

659
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,579
Forget it.
We'll get a funnel cake.

660
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,582
It'll be the highlight
of my week.

661
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,662
Listen, I'm really sorry
about that back in the store.

662
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,669
I don't want to fight
with you.

663
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:59,435
I just sometimes wonder how
we ended up here, you know.

664
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:03,000
I mean, back in college,
d- did you see us here?

665
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:06,275
Life has thrown us a few
surprises. I'll give you that.

666
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,874
<i>It really has, hasn't it?</i>

667
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,615
Yeah. So, if you had to, what would
you say was the biggest surprise?

668
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,659
Just out of curiosity.
I'm just asking.

669
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,527
- Well, Annie, for one.
- Surprise, we're pregnant.

670
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,532
Yeah, that must have been.

671
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:28,730
I mean, that... that was. That
was a very unexpected moment.

672
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:33,172
- What are you gonna do?
- I think it turned out all right, don't you?

673
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,335
Yeah.
I really like Annie.

674
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,379
Well, good, Jack.
Maybe we'll keep her.

675
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,380
No, I love her.
I love Annie.

676
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,313
I'm just...

677
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,921
We had a lot of good times,
didn't we?

678
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:51,355
Do you remember the place on
Charles Street where we used to go?

679
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,793
Charles Street?

680
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:58,099
In the village?

681
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,396
When we were living
in Greenwich Village.

682
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:04,371
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Great times. Great place.</i>

683
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,374
Why did we ever leave?

684
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,707
You can't really raise a kid
in an apartment in the village.

685
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,804
Then there was the whole trek out to
the hospital. That didn't help either.

686
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,585
You were great. I mean, surviving
the heart attack was one thing.

687
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,214
- You had a heart attack?
- Hey, Jack, stop that.

688
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:25,954
'Cause I am...
I'm still mad at you.

689
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:30,556
Who knows what would have happened
if you hadn't stepped in at the store?

690
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,534
That's why I work
for Big Ed.

691
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,364
That's why I work
for Big Ed. Yeah.

692
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:44,244
So we had a baby,
Big Ed had a heart attack.

693
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,339
Bought that house, and I've
been workin' for him ever since.

694
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,180
<i>Sayonara, Wall Street.</i>

695
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,254
Our life in a nutshell.

696
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:57,019
If you want to
look at it that way.

697
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:59,594
How would you look at it?

698
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,299
A great success story.

699
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:13,907
What do you say, Jack? Show 'em how
to do it, baby. Jack, we need a strike.

700
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:18,936
- Damn!
- Jesus, Jack. What are you doin'?

701
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:23,041
It's a league match. Where's your
follow through? Where's your stance?

702
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:26,315
You know what?
I'm doin' the best I can.

703
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,617
<i>It's okay, Jack.</i>

704
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,920
<i>Why am I so competitive
all the time?</i>

705
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:34,326
You can still pick up that
spare. Crack 'em, Jack!

706
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,298
<i>Here we go.
Hurt 'em.</i>

707
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:41,632
Youre Jack Campbell.
You're better than the sport.

708
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,230
You shot the rapids in Kanai. You
ran with the bulls in Pamplona.

709
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:48,139
You've jumped out of an airplane over
the Mojave Desert, for Christ's sake.

710
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,691
You can do this.
You can do this.

711
01:00:49,726 --> 01:00:51,138
You can do this.
You can do this.
