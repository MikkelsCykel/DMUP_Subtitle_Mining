<i>When we are chiIdren,
we beIieve the worId is fuII of magic.</i>

2
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:48,926
<i>We beIieve in myths and Iegends,
and that destiny awaits.</i>

3
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,264
<i>That is the worId I remember</i>

4
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,978
<i>and the one I wish I'd never known.</i>

5
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,609
<i>-Someone's there.
-Back in the house.</i>

6
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,501
Daddy!

7
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:37,975
Mommy!

8
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,227
Vivian, run!

9
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:52,484
Running. Always running.

10
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,736
<i>Never know when you're gonna need it.</i>

11
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,282
<i>Vivian, when he comes,
he'll expect you to be here.</i>

12
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,117
<i>Well, l won't be.</i>

13
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,536
<i>lt's an honor to be chosen, if it is you.</i>

14
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,831
And when he leaves you,
is that an honor, too?

15
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,584
These are the ways of our people.

16
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:11,336
<i>l don't need your advice today, Aunt Astrid.</i>

17
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,006
Oh, baby, you need something.

18
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,216
l remember being 19, you know.

19
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,926
<i>You're still 19.</i>

20
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,344
Funny.

21
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,223
When l was 19, l was pregnant.
lt was my choice.

22
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:26,268
<i>And what l found was it's best to stay
where you belong.</i>

23
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,520
lf you know where you belong.

24
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:32,941
We have a home here, Vivian, a safe one.
Thanks to Gabriel.

25
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:38,530
Your parents would have wanted you safe.
And you are.

26
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,868
<i>lt's only you you're running from.</i>

27
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,251
Are you sure this is the right address?

28
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,587
Yes, it has to be.

29
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,054
Vivian. Do you see anything you like?

30
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,891
<i>-Just here to drink, Drago.
-That's what they all say.</i>

31
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,271
ln your dreams.

32
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:44,072
<i>She's shy.</i>

33
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,872
<i>Don't give up, cousin. l think she likes you.
l see a real future there.</i>

34
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:54,791
Sweet of you to say.

35
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:58,420
A ring, a church wedding,
all her family would show.

36
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,381
<i>And then for the reception,
you'd kill them all.</i>

37
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,591
<i>l know. lt'd be magical.</i>

38
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:08,054
<i>You know what we are, Vivian?
We're romantics.</i>

39
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:10,682
<i>''We'' are nothing.</i>

40
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,060
And the thing about romantics is

41
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,441
they never give up.

42
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,985
Hey.

43
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,238
Yes, on top is how l imagine you.

44
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,407
That looks fun. Can l be next?

45
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,659
Absinthe all around. Her, too.

46
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:32,746
<i>Well. Out from their caves,
if it isn't the Fortunate Five.</i>

47
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:33,830
<i>We're in luck, gents.</i>

48
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,957
My cousin deigns
to honor us with her presence.

49
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,044
-Are you here to dance, Vivian?
-Dance. Yeah. Shake your pretty tail.

50
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,963
<i>l'd like to see how you'll dance for Gabriel.</i>

51
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,969
My cousin, you know you will.

52
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,974
<i>Seven years, it's almost time.</i>

53
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,643
He has other girls to choose from.

54
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,772
None like you.

55
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,694
To darling Vivian. Pride of the pack.

56
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:07,405
-And her bright future.
-Vivian!

57
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,619
Vivian.

58
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,155
Hello?

59
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,993
ls there somebody in here?

60
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,454
<i>ls there somebody in here?
You're asking me?</i>

61
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:44,586
Since when do they lock churches
in this country, huh?

62
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:50,049
This is a sacred place. Protected.

63
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,343
<i>Well, l didn't steal anything.</i>

64
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:54,804
You an American?

65
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:12,780
<i>Look, l don't need any trouble.</i>

66
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:16,075
l heard about this place.
l had to find a way in.

67
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,952
What is this?

68
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,831
<i>They're figure studies for a graphic novel.</i>

69
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,877
Like...

70
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,465
Like these.

71
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,677
-Which one has the wolves?
-The next one.

72
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,223
<i>My name's Aiden. Aiden Galvin.</i>

73
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,142
<i>l'm here for research.</i>

74
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:43,102
And trespassing.

75
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:48,608
Look. Bucharest is a treasure trove.

76
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:52,820
<i>l'd heard there were places
that wolves were almost, like, worshipped.</i>

77
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,490
<i>But l didn't think they meant it literally.</i>

78
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:58,701
<i>Strictly speaking,
they're not actually wolves.</i>

79
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,037
<i>They were called Ioup-garous.</i>

80
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:04,582
You mean werewolves.

81
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,418
Not as you and l think of them.

82
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,839
<i>They weren't monsters,
not in the legends here.</i>

83
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,344
-What were they, then?
-They were revered.

84
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,056
They were the best of man,
the best of beast.

85
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:23,726
Kind of shape-shifters, l guess.
Until they were wiped out.

86
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,645
ln the legends.

87
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,365
-So your comic book...
-Graphic novel.

88
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:40,618
<i>lt's not about monsters?</i>

89
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,288
Just us humans, right?

90
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:50,503
Hey, were you hiding or something?
What are you doing here?

91
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,674
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.
l'm leaving, all right, l'm outta here.</i>

92
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,634
Just tell me your name.

93
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,221
You do have a name, right?

94
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,808
Do they have names?

95
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,729
Why should we?

96
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,900
<i>lt's bad luck to break into a church.</i>

97
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:15,194
<i>Hey, what's your name?</i>

98
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,959
<i>l don't want to come.</i>

99
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,504
Go. Go, go, go!

100
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,726
Let me in! Help! Please!

101
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,988
Get out of here.

102
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,379
<i>Oh, come on now, cousin.
lt's not like we were going to hurt her.</i>

103
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,632
You have to let the boys have their fun.

104
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,384
You know the law.

105
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,135
The law.

106
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:06,013
<i>What's one girl, right? And another.</i>

107
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,641
<i>When they come,
they'll come in numbers with guns.</i>

108
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,810
<i>And not just for you.
They'll come for all of us.</i>

109
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,770
<i>Spoken like a bitch who's been there.</i>

110
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,690
<i>We weren't gonna hurt her, Vivian.
We were just playing games.</i>

111
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,734
We know the risks, Vivian, same as you.

112
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:22,154
<i>Yes, see, we all know Gabriel's law.</i>

113
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:26,283
<i>-''Hunt as a pack or not at all.''
-''Hunt as a pack or not at all.''</i>

114
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:32,039
<i>And the laws he'll have for you.</i>

115
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,175
<i>She's asleep.</i>

116
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,055
Gabriel,

117
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,393
she stayed home waiting for you.

118
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,981
Are you afraid of me?

119
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,233
No.

120
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,239
You know about our tradition.

121
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:08,284
Every seven years,
the leader of the pack takes a new wife.

122
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,119
<i>Don't you mean mate?</i>

123
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:16,709
Should show more respect for the rules.
Without them we cannot survive.

124
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:19,628
There are prophecies

125
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,756
about girls like you.

126
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,971
You come from a long line of leaders,
you know.

127
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,308
Women in your family
were legends in this city.

128
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,395
Your father should never have gone
to America.

129
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,480
l knew how he would end. l told him.

130
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,566
You must have hated him very much.

131
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,694
No.
But you know why we have survived here?

132
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,656
<i>lt's because we stand together.</i>

133
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,118
Your father thought of himself first.

134
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,704
<i>Don't insult my family.</i>

135
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:56,457
You have no family. You have heritage.

136
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,847
<i>lf you're the one from the prophesy,</i>

137
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,768
soon l will ask you to be my wife.

138
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,230
l see what you did to Astrid.

139
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,525
You come for one night,
she cries for a month.

140
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,737
<i>You want to be ordinary?
You're not ordinary.</i>

141
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,495
Ask the animal who is inside you.
She will teach you.

142
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,208
Fear.

143
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,463
Was l not worthy of your respect?

144
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,177
No trace of admiration?

145
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:39,560
<i>That's because you don't know the real me.</i>

146
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,360
Hey, scumbag, you are free to go.

147
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:36,658
Detectives? Where are you taking me? Huh?

148
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,661
What is this? Where are you taking me?

149
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,065
My friend, your arrest has made the paper.

150
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,859
You must be very proud.

151
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,862
What is this? And who are you?

152
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,574
Please, have a drink with me.

153
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,454
<i>Absinthe, it's an old ritual of mine.</i>

154
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,669
Why did you pay to get me out?

155
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,588
Drink.

156
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,683
You know, there are countries
where they call this poison.

157
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,688
<i>Of course, it doesn't come in a dirty needle.
And it's not sold to children.</i>

158
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,651
What you want? You want a cut?

159
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,320
You want in?

160
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:59,157
My friend,
you have escaped the law till now.

161
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,952
But in this city, we are the law.

162
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,330
As we have been for 5,000 years.

163
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,047
<i>We'll find out
who you've been selling your poison to.</i>

164
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,509
For tomorrow, tradition reigns.

165
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,224
Well, that makes all the difference.

166
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,875
<i>-Your chocolates.
-That's so nice. Thanks.</i>

167
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,501
Hey! Hey, Wolf-Girl!

168
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,791
Hello, sweet tooth. Ready to hunt?

169
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,588
All hail the queen of the night,
the beauty of Bucharest!

170
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,798
She will hunt and hunt supreme.

171
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,592
Mama.

172
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,852
<i>Willem, so he's chasing the meat, right?</i>

173
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,521
<i>Lands on it, turns it around, it's Gregor.</i>

174
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,608
-Did l tell you?
-No, l had no idea.

175
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,859
l had no idea.

176
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,337
Hell of a night.

177
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,083
<i>''ln fear l hurried this way and that.</i>

178
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,419
<i>''l had the taste of blood and chocolate
in my mouth,</i>

179
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:07,215
<i>''the one as hateful as the other.''
Remember that?</i>

180
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,133
<i>SteppenwoIf.</i>

181
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,053
<i>We're all lost souls, Vivian.</i>

182
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,432
<i>At least we're lost together.</i>

183
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,729
My lords and ladies,

184
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:06,149
we gather tonight
as our ancestors did for all time.

185
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:10,361
The first night of the full moon
when we gather as one.

186
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,029
For we are one.

187
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,366
And we hunt as one.

188
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:21,789
We have survived for 5,000 years
by hiding who we are.

189
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:27,712
We have been chased from everywhere,
England, France, America,

190
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,381
but not here.

191
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,633
Never here.

192
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,222
This thing before you

193
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,310
is called man.

194
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,189
But l call it menace.

195
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,568
The race of man is corrupt at its core.

196
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,322
<i>The only thing it's good at is destruction!</i>

197
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,908
And so, once in a while,
we must make an example

198
00:26:56,991 --> 00:27:00,328
to show this menace
that we may be outnumbered,

199
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,080
but we will never be outhunted.

200
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,470
So on this night,

201
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,558
let nature grace us to return

202
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,019
to who we truly are

203
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,315
in the wild where we once lived.

204
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,832
Please. l swear...

205
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,502
There is a river within those woods.

206
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:54,131
lf you reach the other side,
you win your life.

207
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,175
And if not,

208
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,095
<i>glory to the Ioup-garou who takes it.</i>

209
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:07,895
Run free.

210
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,569
No one ever reaches the river.

211
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,402
Help me!

212
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,017
<i>lt's who you are</i>

213
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,145
and always will be.

214
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,323
Help! Help!

215
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:40,167
<i>Bunâ, any mail for me? Letters, packages?
l'm in 204.</i>

216
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,919
No mail today.

217
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,505
Did you even check?

218
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,590
No mail for nobody.

219
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,391
<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

220
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,647
Yes, l am being careful. Thank you.

221
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,441
<i>Why don't you go sell something
for a change?</i>

222
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,698
<i>lt's not gonna taste any better
with you standing there watching me.</i>

223
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,283
Hey, Wolf-Girl.

224
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,913
<i>Don't ever call me that.</i>

225
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,666
So give me something else to call you.

226
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,501
How did you find me?

227
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,002
Find who?

228
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,089
Vivian.

229
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,842
<i>Look, l'm working. l can't talk.</i>

230
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,885
<i>And l really don't think
you should be back here.</i>

231
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,679
So ask me to leave.

232
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:37,975
Leave.

233
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,437
Now ask me like you mean it.

234
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,982
<i>What's it been, two, three weeks?</i>

235
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,568
What are you still doing in Romania?

236
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,528
Trying to work.

237
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,992
<i>-Don't you have a home to go back to?
-No, l don't.</i>

238
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,161
But l do have a train ticket in a few days.

239
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,290
And l was hoping
to spend some of them with you.

240
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,377
<i>Yeah, well, that wouldn't make my boyfriend
really happy.</i>

241
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,587
Oh.

242
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,843
Would you be at a church at 2:00
in the morning if you had a boyfriend?

243
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:22,102
<i>Why do you always run from me?
That's twice now, you've run from me.</i>

244
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,229
Are my drawings that bad?

245
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,611
-You have to go.
-That is starting to sound like you mean it.

246
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,281
What do you want with me?

247
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:38,452
l wanna know who you are
and what you love and what you dream.

248
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,620
l want to know
what you were doing there that night.

249
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,289
And l should just tell you?

250
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:45,792
<i>This coming from a guy who doesn't even
put his name on his comic books?</i>

251
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,669
You read my books?

252
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,338
l guess the library is out
of everything else, huh?

253
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,881
You need to leave now.

254
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,632
<i>One night. That's all l'm asking.</i>

255
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,636
Otherwise, l will be here,
all day, every day, buying chocolates.

256
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,140
Piata Romana. Tomorrow night, 7:00.

257
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,892
7:00.

258
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,978
<i>lt's for you, Wolf-Girl.</i>

259
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,026
Hi. Health inspector.

260
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,745
<i>-What's that?
-Trash.</i>

261
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,551
Give me that.

262
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,472
What, your trash? Your human trash?
Now, why would...

263
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,558
<i>-Oh, well, now.
-He doesn't know.</i>

264
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,435
Well, that much seems obvious.

265
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,270
<i>He's drawing pictures
for a book on Ioup-garous.</i>

266
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,980
l showed interest.

267
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,983
-Did you?
-Not like that.

268
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,194
<i>No? Didn't model your tail for him?</i>

269
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,822
<i>He doesn't know, Rafe. Leave him alone.</i>

270
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,032
<i>Now, cousin, why wouldn't l?</i>

271
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:05,122
<i>You want to have a meat-boy, l don't care.
l don't care if you have 100.</i>

272
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,667
<i>Just don't tell any stories
that you shouldn't.</i>

273
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,921
<i>They're good for fun, you know, pretty ones.</i>

274
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,383
They just never let us be ourselves.

275
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,510
Like that girl you killed?

276
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,221
lf he finds out it was you...

277
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,306
This will be my pack one day.

278
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,227
My rules, my law.
So l will do what l want, when l want.

279
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,896
And your pretty mouth will stay shut.

280
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,026
Now, run along, little Vivian.
The world must have its sweets.

281
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,284
Lovely!

282
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,827
<i>-You did it again.
-That's the second time.</i>

283
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,287
<i>You're too good at this.</i>

284
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,792
You, we need to talk.

285
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,969
How are you, Gabriel? Business good?

286
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,931
<i>How's the bitch-du-jour
you left my mother for?</i>

287
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,103
Have you and your friends
been hunting on your own?

288
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,730
Never.

289
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,109
There are rumors. You were seen with her.

290
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,613
<i>-Did Vivian say this?
-You didn't track her?</i>

291
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,617
-Well, not to hunt. lt was a game.
-A game?

292
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,871
Rafe, you are my son.

293
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,583
<i>But if it's true, l can't protect you.</i>

294
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,210
<i>-l won't.
-Vivian's a liar.</i>

295
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:38,173
This has nothing to do with her.
Did you hunt that girl or not?

296
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,802
<i>l didn't touch a hair on her pretty head.</i>

297
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,151
lf man suspects we are still here,

298
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,154
he will exterminate us.

299
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,740
-We must rule this city from the shadows.
-Because we fear them.

300
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,784
We are millions no more.

301
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,455
Please, hear my warning.

302
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,629
Because the day
you hunt outside your pack,

303
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,673
you are dead to it.

304
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,592
l got it. l got it.

305
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,205
<i>How's an American girl
end up in Romania anyhow?</i>

306
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,915
l was born here

307
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,586
in a community of expatriates from all over.

308
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,131
And my parents moved to the States
when l was little,

309
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,174
and then l moved back.

310
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,051
Without your parents?

311
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,305
They died in the States when l was little.

312
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,433
<i>l've lived with my aunt ever since.</i>

313
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,562
-Do you remember them?
-Every day.

314
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:03,401
My aunt says that they
used to take me to that church all the time.

315
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,616
<i>Do you always act
like you're being watched?</i>

316
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,869
<i>You're not allowed to take a walk
with a handsome starving artist?</i>

317
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,080
Who only puts his initials on his books.

318
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,583
<i>What's he hiding from?</i>

319
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,752
Well, l could tell you,
but l would have to kill you.

320
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:26,132
<i>So, how's your book coming?
l mean, what's the city taught you?</i>

321
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,885
That the werewolf stories
have got it all wrong.

322
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,805
<i>ln the Ioup-garou legend,
they're not cursed, they're blessed.</i>

323
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,226
<i>Like the moon turning them into wolves.
That's all how it was twisted later.</i>

324
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,312
<i>The Ioup-garous
can change whenever they want.</i>

325
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,607
<i>lt's mind over matter. Transcendence.</i>

326
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,320
You know, they believe they will change,
and in that moment they do.

327
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,989
Can you imagine that?
From a man to a wolf.

328
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,993
-lt sounds beautiful.
-lt is.

329
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,164
Supposedly, you could kill them with silver

330
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,500
but also with fire.

331
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,001
Really?

332
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,088
<i>And you couldn't become one.
You know, be bitten or whatever.</i>

333
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,965
<i>You're either born a Ioup-garou
or you're not.</i>

334
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,970
<i>And in the stories they say that
if you harm a Ioup-garou,</i>

335
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:17,183
if they bleed, that they show you just
a glimpse of what they really are.

336
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,894
<i>lt's all in the eyes, apparently.</i>

337
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,075
<i>Oh, no, what, this place is closed?
l can't believe it.</i>

338
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:38,538
They have this fantastic cafê on the roof.
Got the best views of the whole city.

339
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,415
Not the whole city.

340
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,669
How about l take you somewhere?

341
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,427
Vivian! This is private property.

342
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,348
Never stopped you before.

343
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,780
l have a great feeling about this.

344
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,802
One of the richest men in the city lives here.

345
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,970
<i>He's an art collector.</i>

346
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,056
This is so much better than the date
l had planned.

347
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,937
When l say run, run.

348
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,282
-You never said run.
-Run.

349
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:08,127
Now, this is the best view of the whole city.

350
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,180
<i>They're all that's left of Bucharest castle.</i>

351
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,017
Built by the Magyar princes
in the 10th century.

352
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,103
<i>lt was said that the princes' bloodline
was Ioup-garou.</i>

353
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:30,900
<i>So when the Magyars lost the throne,
it was said that the wolves' reign was over.</i>

354
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,487
<i>How'd you know they were here?</i>

355
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,281
<i>l thought you'd like to see them.</i>

356
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,576
<i>You're full of secrets, aren't you?</i>

357
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,163
<i>Don't you want to draw them or something?</i>

358
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,960
<i>Whenever l'm with you
l get the feeling you're hiding.</i>

359
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,883
My family has plans for me.

360
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:01,180
<i>Expectations. Where l go, who l'm with.</i>

361
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,352
<i>But your future is your own, isn't it?</i>

362
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,489
Let me tell you something.

363
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:26,580
My old man was an ex-Army Ranger
and an addict.

364
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:31,836
And he told me that l was gonna learn
to defend myself whether l wanted to or not.

365
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:37,133
<i>Truth is, all l really wanted to do was draw,
but that wasn't exactly on the agenda.</i>

366
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:43,013
So one day we had it out, you know.

367
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,559
l was 1 7, said l was leaving, the whole thing.

368
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:51,188
And he said he would kill me if l tried.

369
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,151
And l tried.

370
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,571
What happened?

371
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:04,785
Turns out l knew how to defend myself
better than l thought.

372
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,415
Which is why my name is not on my books.

373
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,626
<i>lf he finds me, he'll follow through.</i>

374
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,130
<i>There's an assault warrant out on me
in the States.</i>

375
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:21,010
So now l write from wherever l travel,
send it in to my publisher.

376
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,180
Since you were 1 7?

377
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,807
But my point is,

378
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:31,604
l know what it feels like not to want
what they want for you.

379
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,067
<i>But it's your life. You don't get another.</i>

380
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:43,365
<i>And in any other, l wouldn't be here.</i>

381
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,607
So am l going to see you again?

382
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,442
-No.
-Never?

383
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:23,489
-Ever.
-So l guess this is goodbye then.

384
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:42,091
<i>Your family don't have to know.
lf that's the way you want it.</i>

385
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,846
<i>lt's the way you should want it, too.</i>

386
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,630
<i>So what's your train ticket say?</i>

387
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,716
<i>l'm mean, what's the date on it?</i>

388
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:10,596
<i>l tore it up. l'm inspired now.
l'm starting over with the book.</i>

389
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,806
All over?

390
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,894
<i>lt's going to be about the Magyar princes
and Bucharest castle.</i>

391
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,771
<i>Back in the Ioup-garou glory days,
when they ran the city.</i>

392
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,357
And their rise and fall.

393
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,359
Why do they have to fall?

394
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,445
What? People who can turn themselves
into animals?

395
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,864
How could we not be threatened by that?

396
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,951
<i>Hey, if you don't want me to let them fall...</i>

397
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,680
<i>-Hey, what's the matter?
-Nothing, l cut myself.</i>

398
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,935
-You did? Let me see.
-No! l have to get home.

399
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,438
<i>-You don't have to go home.
-Yes, she does.</i>

400
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,066
Caution with my cousin, meat.

401
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,236
Many men have courted her,
none have survived to tell the tale.

402
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,612
Leave him alone, Rafe.

403
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,198
<i>Some girls will steal your heart,
this bitch'll eat it.</i>

404
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,783
Take your hands off her.

405
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,826
<i>What? Didn't she tell you?</i>

406
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,287
<i>She's promised to someone. A man.
An important man.</i>

407
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,330
Leave him alone!

408
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,666
The man who brought her home
after she got her parents killed.

409
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,000
She told you that, right?

410
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,628
That they were slaughtered
and it was her fault?

411
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,338
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

412
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:30,592
<i>She's taken, friend. She owes a man.</i>

413
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,470
<i>She's not for you.</i>

414
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,103
<i>He's a rare find, isn't he? Medium rare.</i>

415
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,397
Go to hell.

416
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,316
Yes, l probably will.

417
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,783
<i>What's he talking about, ''taken''?</i>

418
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,119
<i>We can't meet again.</i>

419
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:02,082
We can do whatever we want.
What the hell is wrong, Vivian?

420
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,042
l told you about my family from the start.

421
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,671
The hell with your family, right?
What, do they own you?

422
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,589
Are you gonna let them own you?

423
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,551
<i>l won't let you be my fault.</i>

424
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,772
They talk of secrets, our secrets.

425
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,608
These four heard her themselves.

426
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,820
ls she protecting the pack?

427
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,573
Who is he?

428
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,283
<i>He's meat.</i>

429
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,869
American brand.

430
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,832
<i>She talks to him of Ioup-garous, Gabriel.</i>

431
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,421
Or is Vivian above our law?

432
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,925
She has grown feelings for him?

433
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,479
Then you will take care of that for me.

434
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,731
-Me?
-Yes.

435
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,816
<i>l'm sure you'll know what to do.</i>

436
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,360
Bribe him, threaten him. Whatever it takes.

437
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,155
He spends not one more night in this city.

438
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,991
He stays, he dies.

439
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,379
<i>''Forgive me.
I've so much to say and so IittIe time.</i>

440
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:17,801
<i>''Meet me at SiIestru ChapeI
north of the city tonight at 6.:*00.</i>

441
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,845
<i>''Vivian. ''</i>

442
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,941
How is this for a resting place?

443
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,238
lt was built in the 13th century,

444
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:23,575
supposedly on soil brought
from the Holy Land.

445
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,579
So many people wanted to be buried here
that the cemetery overflowed.

446
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,456
So they improvised.

447
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,915
<i>Where's Vivian?</i>

448
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:35,336
<i>l like to think they're saying,
''Come on, it's not so bad.''</i>

449
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,339
<i>l asked where's Vivian.</i>

450
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,383
Not with you.

451
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:46,681
<i>Little Vivian, she's like a wounded animal,
you see:*</i>

452
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,725
<i>She's had her heart broken
one too many times.</i>

453
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,019
<i>You're here to protect her?</i>

454
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:56,149
<i>Merely from herself. So, when's your train?</i>

455
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:02,238
<i>-What if l'm not on it?
-Then what's left of you will be.</i>

456
00:54:03,364 --> 00:54:06,201
<i>Unless, of course,
you'd rather be buried here, you know.</i>

457
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:09,704
-As a ceiling fan or something.
-Why am l such a threat?

458
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,872
<i>She's a fragile girl.</i>

459
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,750
No, no, why am l such a threat to you?

460
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:20,924
<i>Oh, no, my friend. You're not a threat.</i>

461
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,426
This is a threat.

462
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,637
<i>You'll leave Romania on the next train.</i>

463
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,098
<i>You won't write to her, talk to her,
or come looking for her ever again.</i>

464
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,976
Because if you so much as breathe
her name...

465
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,734
Do you hear me breathing?

466
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:46,449
<i>Yes, look! Look what you've done!</i>

467
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:51,579
You stupid meat, l was here to save you,
to warn you.

468
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:55,208
<i>But now, now you're mine.</i>

469
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,138
Bless this food for our use
and us to thy service.

470
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:34,330
<i>l'll take the train, l swear it.
l'm gone. l'm on that train.</i>

471
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,874
l am the train.

472
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,820
<i>Oh, my God, it's silver.</i>

473
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:19,370
<i>So your playmate's home tonight.
You should come see me.</i>

474
00:58:19,453 --> 00:58:21,372
Not tonight, Astrid.

475
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:23,916
These old laws, you can change them.

476
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,378
Seven years, why seven?
Real wolves mate for life.

477
00:58:27,628 --> 00:58:29,672
Not another word.

478
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:35,678
Come on. We used to set this place on fire.

479
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:43,227
We all grow old, Astrid.
We have to do it with dignity.

480
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,715
Aiden? What...

481
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:17,178
Aiden, what happened?

482
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,512
Your cousin.

483
00:59:18,637 --> 00:59:21,599
-Rafe? What are you...
-Stay back.

484
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,186
Why do you know so much about wolves,
Vivian?

485
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:27,480
What are you talking about?
How badly are you hurt?

486
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:30,608
<i>ls it 'cause you knew he was one, huh?</i>

487
00:59:30,649 --> 00:59:34,737
<i>Loup-garou. Like the legend.
Like a comic book.</i>

488
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,657
Where is he?

489
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:41,160
Extinct.

490
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,129
Take it.

491
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,178
<i>Go on, take it. lt's silver.</i>

492
01:00:03,307 --> 01:00:07,686
-l wanted to protect you.
-Protect me from who? From you?

493
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,772
<i>You're not possible.</i>

494
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,858
Get out of town. Get out of Romania.
Get out and never come back.

495
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,527
<i>lf they find you, they'll kill you.</i>

496
01:00:14,568 --> 01:00:15,778
<i>Oh, it's ''they'' now, huh?</i>

497
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:17,571
What did you want from me, the truth?

498
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,116
Listen, my life is over. l just killed someone!

499
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:24,203
<i>They're gonna find my prints, my blood.
What am l gonna tell them?</i>

500
01:00:24,745 --> 01:00:27,248
What will you tell them?

501
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:31,293
<i>lt's just too much to ask, l guess,
just a human girl.</i>

502
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,088
<i>-Aiden, l never wanted...
-lt's too late for that.</i>

503
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:40,219
<i>lf you cared a goddamn thing about me,
you would've left me before we ever met.</i>

504
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,981
Aiden.

505
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,295
May l help you, sir?

506
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,925
Yes, as a matter of fact you can.

507
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:06,388
Are these real silver?

508
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:08,349
Of course.

509
01:02:08,432 --> 01:02:10,225
Thank you.

510
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,494
We went to find him.

511
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:35,250
<i>He'd been gone for so long.</i>

512
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,453
What is it, Vivian?

513
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,790
<i>His car's outside.</i>

514
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,687
<i>What's happened?</i>

515
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,649
Our son is dead.

516
01:03:59,084 --> 01:04:01,712
He will be avenged.

517
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,652
Do you need some help?

518
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:29,406
<i>No. No, thank you, Officers.
l'm just waiting for my train.</i>

519
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:31,700
The correct answer is yes.

520
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,780
My lords and ladies.

521
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:15,702
Man has forced us to hide our true nature.

522
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:18,580
He has persecuted us for centuries.

523
01:05:20,957 --> 01:05:24,086
Last night, he took yet another life.

524
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:30,133
The life of my son.

525
01:05:33,637 --> 01:05:38,433
But we will have vengeance,
for his murderer is here.

526
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:46,274
No!

527
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:47,693
Him!

528
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:48,777
Rafe went to kill him.

529
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:53,156
This man knew our secret
because one of us let him get too near.

530
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,325
And how would you know that?

531
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,538
Did Rafe hunt him down on his own,
or did you send him?

532
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:01,498
He killed my son.
He must pay with his blood.

533
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,875
You sent your own son to his death
over me?

534
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,169
Enough!

535
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:14,052
lf he lives,
he will bring the hunters in the night.

536
01:06:14,344 --> 01:06:18,849
Just like the ones who killed your parents.
And it will be all your fault again.

537
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:29,192
<i>There's a river within those woods.</i>

538
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:32,279
lf you reach the other side,
you win your life.

539
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,073
No.

540
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,411
Wish your enemy well.

541
01:06:44,457 --> 01:06:46,334
Wish him well.

542
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,948
Run.

543
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:11,753
You say man is a heartless killer.
How are we any different?

544
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,047
We only kill to survive.

545
01:08:15,048 --> 01:08:17,133
Take her to the car till l come back.

546
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,155
<i>Stupid girl. You are Ioup-garou.</i>

547
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:41,819
Creeks lead to rivers.

548
01:12:41,397 --> 01:12:43,316
But l crossed the river.

549
01:12:43,816 --> 01:12:45,359
The river.

550
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:31,197
What about your goddamn river, huh?

551
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,688
Oh, Jesus, no.

552
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,116
<i>l'm sorry, l...</i>

553
01:14:37,138 --> 01:14:40,307
<i>Please don't kill me.</i>

554
01:14:56,490 --> 01:15:01,996
<i>Hold on, there's a road ahead.
We have to get you to a hospital.</i>

555
01:15:02,246 --> 01:15:05,291
No, hospitals only make it worse.

556
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:07,418
Then where?

557
01:15:09,253 --> 01:15:11,172
<i>There's a place.</i>

558
01:15:57,301 --> 01:16:00,763
Vivian! You home, little girl?

559
01:16:05,684 --> 01:16:09,730
<i>They won't look for us here.
This is a film company.</i>

560
01:16:09,939 --> 01:16:12,858
Do you know what makes
photographs work?

561
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:14,944
Silver.

562
01:16:17,613 --> 01:16:22,535
<i>They say, even now,
it'll kill you to breathe it.</i>

563
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:24,286
Will it?

564
01:16:24,328 --> 01:16:27,122
<i>lt's already in my bloodstream.</i>

565
01:16:27,623 --> 01:16:31,794
<i>Once it's in, it stays in, unless it's treated.</i>

566
01:16:32,753 --> 01:16:34,213
Treated how?

567
01:16:34,296 --> 01:16:38,467
<i>There's an anti-serum for silver
called Antigen-AG.</i>

568
01:16:39,343 --> 01:16:41,887
l know where l can find some
but not until dark.

569
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:45,599
Come on.

570
01:16:50,854 --> 01:16:52,773
Vivian!

571
01:17:07,913 --> 01:17:09,707
<i>You didn't leave.</i>

572
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:13,669
<i>l'm running out of people to trust.</i>

573
01:17:14,545 --> 01:17:16,880
<i>l've never killed anyone.</i>

574
01:17:17,464 --> 01:17:20,592
At the hunts. Please believe me.

575
01:17:20,843 --> 01:17:23,721
Why do you even go?

576
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:30,227
<i>lt's not the hunt l live for. lt's the running.</i>

577
01:17:31,186 --> 01:17:33,856
The being free.

578
01:17:35,649 --> 01:17:39,319
They were my tracks the hunters followed
back to our house.

579
01:17:41,488 --> 01:17:43,198
<i>That doesn't make it your fault.</i>

580
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:45,659
Men kill us. We kill men.

581
01:17:45,743 --> 01:17:50,330
<i>Because anything we're not
is a thing we're taught to fear.</i>

582
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:25,491
<i>So is that fear you're feeling right now?
Or is that something else?</i>

583
01:18:28,577 --> 01:18:30,662
<i>lt's fear.</i>

584
01:18:31,955 --> 01:18:34,291
<i>Of what you'll do?</i>

585
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:41,423
Of what you think of me.

586
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:04,029
<i>When l draw you, Ioup-garou,</i>

587
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,574
<i>l'd wish that you were real.</i>

588
01:19:09,451 --> 01:19:13,497
So what right do l have
to wish you away now?

589
01:19:19,336 --> 01:19:21,004
You can control it.

590
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,674
l can control it.

591
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:56,790
Where would she hide, l asked.

592
01:19:56,873 --> 01:19:58,959
Where else but where l told her not to?

593
01:19:59,042 --> 01:20:02,462
<i>-Don't, Astrid.
-He's not one of us.</i>

594
01:20:04,423 --> 01:20:07,843
<i>Astrid, don't. There is another way.</i>

595
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:13,682
lt was man who killed my sister.
lt was man who killed my son.

596
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:16,560
lt was Gabriel that killed Rafe.

597
01:20:16,643 --> 01:20:21,565
<i>Just like he'll kill me.
lt's the only justice he knows.</i>

598
01:20:22,065 --> 01:20:25,485
<i>l'll protect you. l'll make him see.</i>

599
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:29,406
<i>Just like you'll make him see
who he really belongs with?</i>

600
01:20:29,656 --> 01:20:33,285
Your first love all went wrong.

601
01:20:33,577 --> 01:20:36,580
<i>Please don't take mine from me.</i>

602
01:20:45,505 --> 01:20:48,175
ls that silver?

603
01:20:49,092 --> 01:20:51,470
<i>We're going to the pharmacist's.
We're getting antigen,</i>

604
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:53,555
<i>and then we're leaving the city.</i>

605
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:59,603
<i>He can't love you if he fears you.</i>

606
01:21:02,314 --> 01:21:05,233
Tell me not to fall in love, Astrid.

607
01:21:05,984 --> 01:21:09,154
Tell me how much more to life there is.

608
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:19,081
Run, my little girl. Run free.

609
01:21:27,506 --> 01:21:29,299
Prescription.

610
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:39,768
Hands on the counter.
Gabriel owns this guy.

611
01:21:42,562 --> 01:21:46,942
You must be in some kind hairy situation?

612
01:21:53,907 --> 01:21:57,410
Got some splinter in your paw?

613
01:22:00,455 --> 01:22:04,084
Like lemonade on a hot day.

614
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:24,896
Stop! Drop the gun.

615
01:22:26,064 --> 01:22:30,068
Sorry, my furry friend. Drop the gun.

616
01:23:07,188 --> 01:23:08,815
Watch out!

617
01:23:15,363 --> 01:23:16,531
Run!

618
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:27,459
How many of us have to die
for your happiness?

619
01:23:28,209 --> 01:23:30,211
l can smell him on you.

620
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:19,719
You try to run a simple business...

621
01:24:23,056 --> 01:24:25,809
My new best customer.

622
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:30,105
l want your antigen,
your bullets and your dust.

623
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:57,590
How does it feel to be in a cage

624
01:24:57,715 --> 01:25:00,051
the way man would have you?

625
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:04,681
You could have been
a great inspiration to your people.

626
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:09,978
But look at you now. Our greatest shame.

627
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:17,193
When you put your trust in man,
you condemn us all.

628
01:25:17,277 --> 01:25:18,778
We condemn ourselves.

629
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,920
<i>Aren't we half-human?</i>

630
01:25:36,004 --> 01:25:39,299
<i>Don't you see that what you denounce
is a part of you?</i>

631
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:45,346
<i>lt's not part of me. lt's part of you.</i>

632
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,599
l know what l am.

633
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,606
You and your traditions can go to hell.

634
01:25:56,691 --> 01:25:59,235
Well, you are the future of this pack.

635
01:25:59,944 --> 01:26:02,280
<i>l'll let you name her fate.</i>

636
01:26:23,551 --> 01:26:26,429
What have you ever loved, Gabriel?

637
01:26:26,554 --> 01:26:31,225
<i>Power, hate, fear?
You're the most human of us all.</i>

638
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:32,894
You never understood.

639
01:26:32,977 --> 01:26:35,521
The ancient prophecy said a girl
from the bloodline of leaders

640
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,315
would one day command us

641
01:26:37,398 --> 01:26:40,109
and lead us into a new age
of hope and glory.

642
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:42,779
l thought that girl was you.

643
01:26:42,862 --> 01:26:45,698
And what will the new age of hope
look like?

644
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,700
How much blood will there be?

645
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:49,369
<i>Let's find out tonight.</i>

646
01:26:49,494 --> 01:26:52,372
We hunt, you and l.

647
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:08,846
<i>Quick, he's there!</i>

648
01:28:37,643 --> 01:28:39,186
Drink up.

649
01:29:27,234 --> 01:29:32,031
For you and all mankind.

650
01:29:39,413 --> 01:29:42,708
You want to shoot your own family?

651
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,548
You want to be that hunter
on that snowy night?

652
01:29:51,717 --> 01:29:54,512
Then l give you my back.

653
01:29:54,929 --> 01:29:57,556
<i>That's all you deserve.</i>

654
01:30:13,322 --> 01:30:14,907
Shoot him.

655
01:30:16,492 --> 01:30:18,077
<i>l can't.</i>

656
01:30:20,246 --> 01:30:21,914
Shoot him.

657
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:26,585
<i>l can't.</i>

658
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:15,426
Hey, Vivian! Vivian, help.

659
01:31:21,891 --> 01:31:24,977
May you know the age of hope
when you see it.

660
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:52,004
<i>So how are we going to get out of the city
if they're watching everywhere?</i>

661
01:31:53,631 --> 01:31:55,758
<i>There's one place they won't be.</i>

662
01:32:17,613 --> 01:32:22,326
<i>This is my worId. These are my peopIe.</i>

663
01:32:24,662 --> 01:32:28,374
<i>They beIieve in prophecies and destinies.</i>

664
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:31,168
<i>I beIieve we make our own.</i>

665
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:37,216
Where are we headed?

666
01:32:37,716 --> 01:32:39,760
How about the age of hope?

667
01:32:48,143 --> 01:32:50,854
Either that or Paris.
