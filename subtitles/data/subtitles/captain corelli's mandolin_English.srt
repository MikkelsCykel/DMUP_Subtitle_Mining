00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:19,883
How long have you been deaf in this ear?

2
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:22,481
Since as long as I can remember.

3
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:26,557
Shut up! Keep still
while the doctor is examining you.

4
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:31,002
I need a fish hook
about the right size for a mullet...

5
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:34,363
...with a long shank and a hammer.

6
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:36,199
A fish hook? A hammer?

7
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:39,245
Here is the fish hook and a hammer.

8
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:51,440
Right! Now, keep still.

9
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:57,926
A Pea.

10
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,603
lt is very PaPilionaceous, is it not?

11
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:06,804
He must have stuck it in his ear
when he was a child.

12
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:09,959
Oh, my God. lt's loud.
l mean, everything is loud.

13
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,119
.My own voice is loud.
.Your deafness is cured.

14
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,446
.A very satisfactory oPeration.
.l've had an oPeration?

15
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:21,360
l'm the only Person l know
who's had an oPeration.

16
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:26,157
lt feels as if my whole head has filled uP
with sPring water, all cold and clear.

17
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,717
Talk some sense when the doctor
has been kind enough to cure you.

18
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:32,082
All these years thinking you are deaf.

19
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,796
But now, there will be no excuses
when l ask you to remember...

20
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,037
...to collect something on your way home...

21
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:41,199
...or to stoke uP the fire
before we go to church.

22
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,437
PerhaPs now you will hear me...

23
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:47,645
...when l say to you,
''Mend the chair, Stamatis.

24
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:50,002
''Fix the leaking roof, Stamatis.''

25
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,726
And now, l won't have to sPeak so loud.

26
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:07,604
Antonio, do you remember our island?

27
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,037
It does not change.

28
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:15,001
On the feast day of Saint Gerasimos...

29
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:17,806
...we still bring our sick to the holy place...

30
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:21,280
...and pray that their suffering may cease.

31
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,396
When Pelagia was a child...

32
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:29,923
...I promised her that I would write
a history of Cephallonia.

33
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:34,357
But, somehow,
I still have not found the time.

34
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:40,196
I wanted her to understand
how a land so peaceful...

35
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:43,598
...could be shattered
by earthquakes and war.

36
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:50,359
I wanted her to understand
why sometimes the gods bless us...

37
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:55,446
...and why they sometimes
become angry and shake us...

38
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,802
...and fill our lives with pain.

39
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:04,164
I want her to learn the lesson
that nature teaches us:

40
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:08,718
That we should not ask
why we are wounded...

41
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:12,838
...only if the wound can be healed.

42
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:33,960
A Purely Psychological Phenomenon.

43
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,999
How do you exPlain the miracle?

44
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:41,126
Can Lenin cure the mad?
Can Stalin heal the afflicted?

45
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:45,678
lt's obvious. lt's a setuP
to keeP PeoPle enslaved to religion.

46
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,440
You don't have to shout. l'm not deaf.

47
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,000
l want to see the cannon again.

48
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,357
Yeah!

49
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:43,677
l will need stones from the street,
as many as you can find.

50
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,445
Be right back.

51
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,960
Well, children, cover your ears!

52
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:01,875
Oh, my God!

53
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,963
That hurts! Oh, that hurts!

54
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:12,596
Will he die?

55
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,797
Eventually, one of these days, like all of us.

56
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,685
Turn over.

57
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,684
Good strong gluteals.

58
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,279
Tell us about the gluteals.

59
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,040
Please. Come closer. Have a good look.

60
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,516
Fetch your friends. Everybody's welcome.

61
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:42,756
Gluteals.

62
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,115
Maximus, medius, minimus.

63
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:50,239
The maximus is the external surface
of the ilium...

64
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,717
...between anterior
and interior gluteal lines.

65
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:57,636
Mandras!

66
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,475
.Iatre?
.He'll be fine.

67
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,517
They told me you were shot.
l thought l was going to die.

68
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,363
l don't know why
you can't keeP out of trouble.

69
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:13,644
You should count yourself lucky
you don't have a son.

70
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:17,515
Boys, they never grow uP! Look at me.

71
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,841
Old before my time.

72
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,081
lt's too hot.

73
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,355
The fish are all hiding in the rocks...

74
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:04,360
...or keePing cool at the bottom of the sea.

75
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:15,198
Put me down! Put me down!

76
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,682
There are reports today
that a Greek battleship...

77
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,645
...the Eli, has been torpedoed
by an Italian submarine...

78
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:44,083
...despite the fact that Greece
is not yet involved in the war.

79
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,317
Prime Minister Metaxas has protested...

80
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:50,844
...to Mussolini's government in Rome,
which denied responsibility for the attack.

81
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,243
There are continued reports of fighting...

82
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:57,115
...between Greek and Italian soldiers
on the Greek-Albanian border.

83
00:08:57,207 --> 00:09:00,358
In Athens this morning,
the Italian ambassador denied rumors....

84
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:01,846
What are they saying?

85
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:05,044
The ltalians are in Albania,
close to the border.

86
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:08,484
.They have rePorted some fighting.
.There, you hear that!

87
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,320
And they are saying
they are not about to declare war.

88
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:14,683
.There. What did l say?
.They want to catch us sleePing.

89
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,917
To creeP uP on us in the dead of night!

90
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,521
.You filthy liar!
.Your father was a goat!

91
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:20,801
Shut uP!

92
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:26,559
lf you two don't stoP trading insults,
l'm going to start taking coffee at home!

93
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:32,445
Mandras wants to marry me.

94
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:36,641
l told him he'd have to ask you.

95
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:41,160
.l don't want to marry him.
.You don't like him.

96
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,797
You are both too young.

97
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:46,355
Everyone is too young when they marry.

98
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:52,157
l have often thought
you'd only marry haPPily with a foreigner.

99
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,922
A dentist from Norway.

100
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,241
Or something.

101
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,002
Mandras is not your equal.

102
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,885
And he would exPect
to be better than his wife.

103
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,317
He is a man, after all.

104
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:12,041
l will tell you now what l will say to him.

105
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,956
l am not giving away a dowry.

106
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:20,522
.Who marries without a dowry?
.You should marry for love.

107
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:21,955
l love Mandras!

108
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:26,638
So what am l suPPosed to do?

109
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,761
Go off to Mandras' mother's house
with nothing but a bag of clothes?

110
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,598
And my goat.
l'll never be able to show my face.

111
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,156
l'll be the laughingstock of CePhallonia.

112
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:41,246
You can imagine how PeoPle will talk.

113
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,597
l don't know how you will bear the shame.

114
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:47,760
There is going to be a war.
Terrible things haPPen in wars.

115
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,324
Use this to defend yourself.

116
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:53,395
And, if necessary, use it against yourself.

117
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,483
Your marriage will have to wait.

118
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:03,597
l look around me.
l see fishermen. l see farmers.

119
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,879
l see strong, healthy men
who are born free!

120
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:10,438
But today, your freedom is in danger.

121
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,322
The ltalian army sweePs through Albania...

122
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:17,036
...and her trooPs are driving to cross
the frontiers of Greece!

123
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,362
lf you care about your country
then you must fight to defend her!

124
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:28,883
Join the war in Albania!
Fight for your mothers...

125
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:32,004
...your sweethearts, your wives,
your children!

126
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:33,760
Fight for the freedom...

127
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:38,637
...for all Greek PeoPle to live their lives
with dignity and resPect!

128
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:10,757
When l come back from the war,
we will get married.

129
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:14,361
And l will build a house for Pelagia...

130
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,435
...on the land that belonged to my father.

131
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,998
l know we are different.

132
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:07,924
l don't know about the world.

133
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:11,519
Where have l been? What could l know?

134
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,395
l don't know how to say what l feel inside.

135
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,440
l don't know how to tell you
what is in here.

136
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,561
But l think...

137
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,882
...l know...

138
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,886
...l love you.

139
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,600
Tomorrow, l leave for the war.

140
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,716
Pelagia...

141
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,404
...come and dance with me.

142
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,804
l'll write. l Promise.

143
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,642
And Promise that you will write to me.

144
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:29,804
''My darling: You have not written
since that day I saw you off.

145
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:34,196
''And I am so terrified that I'm not getting
any letters from you...

146
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,439
''...because you have been wounded
or taken prisoner.

147
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,801
''And I have nightmares that you are dead.

148
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:48,804
''Summer has turned to winter,
and I am writing my 100th letter to you.

149
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:55,320
''The wounded who have returned
bring news of terrible conditions...

150
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:58,441
''...freezing cold, no food.

151
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,396
''But they bring no news from you.

152
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,486
''Every day I wait for the mail
from Argostoli...

153
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,003
''...and every day there is nothing.

154
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:15,956
''And I feel as if I am going mad
with worry and fear.

155
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,358
''I try not to lose hope...

156
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:22,441
''...but I long to feel something,
even if it is only pain.''

157
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,044
We won! We won!

158
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,805
lt's over!

159
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:58,363
We've beaten them in Albania! Look!

160
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:03,518
8,000 of us against 14,000 ltalians,
and we forced them to withdraw!

161
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,362
What?

162
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,960
Hitler will never let
his laPdog be humiliated.

163
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:14,917
He will come to Mussolini's aid.

164
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,521
''I have written this letter a dozen times.

165
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,315
''And a dozen times, I have thrown it away.

166
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,280
''I don't know how to describe my feelings.

167
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:34,316
''It's as if I've been waiting 100 years
to hear from you.

168
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:38,080
''Waiting 100 years for you to return.''

169
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:51,400
This is hoPeless.

170
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:53,520
lt's all wrong!

171
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:04,279
Following the Greek defeat of the Italians
in Albania, Hitler counterattacked...

172
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:08,246
...and the German army has driven a path
through to the Greek capital of Athens.

173
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:12,639
A number of Greek ships were destroyed
in the bombing of the port of Piraeus.

174
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:16,517
On April 27, the Athenian
military commissioner, General Carvacos...

175
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,963
...handed over the keys of the ancient
city to his German counterpart...

176
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:22,117
...Lieutenant Colonel Von Sefen...

177
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:25,756
...and preparations were underway
for a carve-up of the territory.

178
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,281
Hitler retains direct control
of Northern Greece...

179
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,165
...including Salonica and
the southern island of Crete.

180
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:34,762
The rest of Greece will be under
the control of Hitler's ally, Mussolini...

181
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,725
...but the Germans will retain
the final authority.

182
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:14,242
Left, right. Left, right....

183
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:03,166
Bella bambina at two o'clock!

184
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,006
Attention! Face!

185
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,885
Hustle. Hustle.

186
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:37,798
ClTY HALL . Fuck off

187
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,206
CaPtain Corelli.

188
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:49,882
''Fuck off.''

189
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:01,405
Tell the mayor
that unless we receive the surrender...

190
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,842
...of the town's authorities
in five minutes...

191
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:06,839
...we'll mobilize our trooPs
and storm the building.

192
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:12,086
The mayor says,
if you don't know what ''fuck off'' means...

193
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,601
...then come inside and we'll show you.

194
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,482
''We refuse to surrender...

195
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:41,957
''...to a nation that we have defeated
in Albania.

196
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,844
''And we reserve the right...

197
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,441
''...to surrender to a German officer...

198
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:49,246
''...of significant rank, so fuck off.''

199
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,641
Who is this? Who are you?

200
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,157
CaPtain Weber, liaison officer
with the Grenadiers at Lixouri.

201
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:36,524
''CaPtain'' is not what we would call
a significant rank.

202
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:39,042
There are only 200 Germans on the island...

203
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:42,836
...and CaPtain Weber is the highest.ranking
officer amongst them.

204
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:54,440
Our decision is...

205
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:57,166
...that surrendering
to CaPtain Weber's dog...

206
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:00,837
...is more aPProPriate
than surrendering to an ltalian.

207
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,435
Carlo Guercio rePorting for duty, sir.

208
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:00,519
.Carlo, where have you served?
.Albania.

209
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:01,842
Albania?

210
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:04,643
None of us have seen any action yet.

211
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:07,275
l was with the Giulia Division.

212
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:15,475
Then you have fought enough for all of us.

213
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,603
Carlo, can you sing?

214
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:19,565
Let's hear you sing.

215
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:36,682
No matter.

216
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:40,603
Everyone in our battery is a member
of the oPera society.

217
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,996
These are the rules of engagement.

218
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:46,437
One: All those called
to regular musical fatigues...

219
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,041
...shall be obliged to Play
a musical instrument.

220
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:53,006
SPoons, the helmet,
comb, PaPer and so on and so on.

221
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:56,966
Two: Anyone who says that Donizetti
is better than Verdi...

222
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,516
...shall be required
to sing Funiculi-Funicula...

223
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,677
...and other songs about railways.

224
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:02,876
Three....

225
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,682
Three....

226
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:16,880
This is an outrage! Quite imPossible.

227
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:18,846
lt's out of the question!

228
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:22,158
Sir, the fact is, l am sorry to say,
and with great regret...

229
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:24,966
...that my orders are to billet an officer
in your home.

230
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:27,277
l am a doctor. This is my surgery!

231
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,961
.l don't have room for guests!
.These are my orders!

232
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,800
l don't care!
l don't recognize your authority.

233
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:38,836
Wait a minute.

234
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,884
What is wrong with your feet?

235
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:46,844
l have terrible corns.
My boots are killing me.

236
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:50,597
You are a quartermaster.
You must have access to medical suPPlies.

237
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:56,559
To treat your corns, l will need morPhine,
hyPodermic syringes...

238
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:59,559
...sulfur ointments, surgical sPirit,
neosalvarsan...

239
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,599
...iodine, scalPels, collodion bandages, lint.

240
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:07,516
PerhaPs your officer
could bring suPPlies when he comes.

241
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:29,199
My father is not here.

242
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:32,639
He'll be home this evening.

243
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,322
You don't even know who l am.

244
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:50,325
l walked all the way from the hills.

245
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:52,646
No boots.

246
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:01,122
l wrote to you every day.
A hundred letters...

247
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:04,483
...and not a single rePly.

248
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,645
l never learned...

249
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:13,118
...to read or write.

250
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:21,282
Oh, Lord, what a stench.
lt's worse than Pigs.

251
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:22,801
You see, Pelagia...

252
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:26,482
...what a state these men get into
when there are no women around?

253
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,922
And l don't care if he's been to war.

254
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:33,366
lf we catch his fleas and lice,
l'm going to skin him alive.

255
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:36,804
Ammonia, oil of sassafras,
zinc for scabies.

256
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:41,804
You are a woman,
and you know so many things.

257
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:46,606
At least, you can see what you're getting.

258
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:49,005
Not much of a bargain, is he?

259
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:51,760
You fall in love with a Person,
not the body.

260
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:56,039
Love enters by the eyes and also leaves
by the eyes. Take it from me.

261
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:01,124
We beat the ltalians.
We had them running.

262
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,801
But we couldn't fight the Germans.

263
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,199
lf l could cook...

264
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:21,723
...l would exchange jobs with you.

265
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:27,358
ln fact, l might retire.

266
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:47,961
Bella bambina.

267
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:51,917
Forgive me. Forgive me.

268
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,044
l don't mean to embarrass you.

269
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:56,118
l'm CaPtain Antonio Corelli.

270
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,006
And that man is one of our heroes.

271
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:03,041
He has 100 medals for saving life
and none for taking it.

272
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,636
A brave ltalian is a freak of nature.

273
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,485
Said like a true Greek Patriot.

274
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:11,480
CaPtain Corelli, l want a word with you.
Now.

275
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:13,645
l want an exPlanation.

276
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:16,721
l want to know
why you have defaced the monument.

277
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:20,004
.What monument?
.You've changed the inscriPtion to Latin.

278
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:22,806
Do you think you can
so easily erase our history?

279
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,924
ls this how you wage war,
by the chiPPing away of letters?

280
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,760
.l must Protest.
.You cannot Protest! There is no excuse!

281
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,277
l was about to Protest
because l was not resPonsible for it.

282
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:33,876
Pathetic.

283
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:37,886
lf you could tell me
where l'm going to sleeP.

284
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:40,399
ln my daughter's room.

285
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,196
.But where will your daughter sleeP?
.lt's none of your business where l sleeP.

286
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:48,316
Tonight, l'll sleeP in the yard. Tomorrow,
l'll request other accommodation.

287
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:50,602
l've made an arrangement
with your quartermaster.

288
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:52,996
You're staying here
whether you like it or not.

289
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:55,647
But your daughter's bed,
l feel it would not be..

290
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,560
l don't care how you feel.
That is not my Problem.

291
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:02,520
l am not the aggressor,
you understand me?

292
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:16,961
.This is very good.
.This is CePhallonian meat Pie.

293
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:20,962
ExcePt, thanks to you PeoPle,
it doesn't have any meat in it.

294
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:27,400
l could bring some food,
a little wine, some Panettone.

295
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:29,637
We don't accePt food from the enemy.

296
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:31,804
Maybe a little Panettone.

297
00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:39,684
l am going for a walk.

298
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,402
Curfew starts in one hour's time.

299
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,926
l was born here. This is my island.

300
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:58,116
Aren't you going to go and arrest him?

301
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:02,165
He's defying you, ignoring the curfew.

302
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:05,240
You're absolutely right.
Quick, get the gun.

303
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,318
Somebody shoot him!

304
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:48,765
Capitano Antonio Corelli.

305
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:52,876
Now you try. Capitano Antonio Corelli.

306
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:54,602
Lemoni.

307
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:57,685
Babibaba Sinono Calicali.

308
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:59,565
What? ''Babibaba''?

309
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:04,040
Capitano.

310
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:07,282
-Capitano.
-Si. Antonio.

311
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:10,484
.Lemoni. Go home.
.Corelli.

312
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:14,920
Go on. You can come back later.

313
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:19,606
Signorina.

314
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:24,119
ln times of war,
we have to make the most...

315
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:26,846
...of what little innocent Pleasure there is.

316
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:35,401
''l've started to make a waistcoat for you.

317
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:39,436
''Eagles and flowers
embroidered with gold thread.

318
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:43,166
''But l can't seem to get them to match uP.

319
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:45,124
''One flower is much bigger.

320
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,200
''One eagle is in a different Place
from the other.

321
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:52,004
''And when l try to make them more even,
it gets worse.

322
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:54,404
''l just can't get it right.''

323
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,438
You could kill him, you know?

324
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:00,964
He's the enemy.

325
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:04,005
You could Poison him.
No one would know how he died.

326
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:09,239
Dimitris and SPiros have left
to join the Partisans.

327
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:12,157
They've gone by boat to Patras...

328
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:14,917
...and who knows where from there.

329
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:19,640
.l should be with them.
.You're not going until you're strong again.

330
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:24,920
Read the last one.

331
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,886
The last letter you wrote
before l came home.

332
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:37,961
''My darling:

333
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:42,079
''l've heard nothing from you
for such a long time...

334
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:44,802
''...and l feel desPerate and helPless.

335
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:47,762
''And l am burning my brains with worry.

336
00:33:48,447 --> 00:33:52,156
''Yesterday, l wrote you a long letter
that said everything Perfectly.

337
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:54,723
.''And believe it..''
.Listen.

338
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,479
l can't stay here.

339
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,276
Signorina.

340
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,286
.You are drunk.
.Yes, l confess.

341
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:49,724
We've been drinking, singing,
generally misbehaving.

342
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:52,084
l thought you were a soldier.

343
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:54,881
CaPtain Antonio Corelli,
33rd Regiment, Artillery...

344
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,525
...rePorting for duty!

345
00:34:58,247 --> 00:35:00,203
ls everything a joke to you?

346
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:04,720
No. Not everything.

347
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:15,926
CaPtain Corelli...

348
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,876
...l think this would be a good time
to hear you Play the mandolin.

349
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:39,196
What on earth are you doing?

350
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:45,725
.l was just about to start.
.Well, about time too.

351
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:49,636
The first 45 and a half bars
are for the orchestra.

352
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,843
Allegro, moderato, grazioso.

353
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:54,519
You have to imagine the orchestra.

354
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:57,485
l'm damned if l can sit through
all that taPPing again.

355
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:59,239
Just Play your Part.

356
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,158
lf l do that, l'll get confused...

357
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,715
...about when l'm suPPosed to come in,
and that...

358
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:06,401
...in a concert hall, would be a disaster.

359
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:09,366
l aPologize for disruPting the concert.

360
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:12,685
l aPologize to each and every one of you.

361
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:15,924
To those in the cheaPest seats,
in the gods...

362
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,316
...to Your Majesties in your royal boxes...

363
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:22,036
...draPed in your jewelry and your fine furs.

364
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:26,236
But l'm damned
if l can imagine an orchestra.

365
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:29,358
l am going to bed.

366
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:38,957
ls this where the caPtain sleePs?

367
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,838
l was coming to see you.

368
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,405
l'm leaving, Pelagia.

369
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:52,524
ln the morning.
l'll take my boat to Astakos.

370
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:55,082
.lt's not safe.
.l'm a fisherman.

371
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,967
l know those waters
like the back of my hand.

372
00:37:58,247 --> 00:37:59,839
l don't want you to go.

373
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,801
lf l die, l won't have died for nothing.

374
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:07,485
And if l live...

375
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:11,401
...l'll walk with my head held high
for the rest of my life.

376
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:16,003
And everyone will say, ''That's Mandras
who fought for his country in the war.''

377
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:21,563
l finished your waistcoat.

378
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:26,638
You can take it now if you want.

379
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:34,323
The two sides, they are not the same.

380
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:40,077
The ltalian caPtain.

381
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:42,598
Pindus gorges, Albania.

382
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,724
14,000 of you against 8,000 of us.

383
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:47,684
You could have driven us into the sea.

384
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,997
lf it wasn't for your German friends,
we would've.

385
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:52,521
My friends are the men in my battery...

386
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:56,044
...the PeoPle l grew uP with,
PeoPle of my hometown.

387
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:59,167
So, what do you think
of our island, CaPtain?

388
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:02,763
.l like your island.
.And what do you think of our girls?

389
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,606
What do you think of my Pelagia?

390
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:50,520
Goodbye, Pelagia.

391
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,798
My beautiful Pelagia.

392
00:41:13,327 --> 00:41:15,522
.Heil Hitler.
.Heil Puccini.

393
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:20,366
l saw your Party.
l thought l would introduce myself.

394
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:23,996
You mean, you saw naked women
and wanted to get a closer look.

395
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,564
.We've met before.
.The surrender at the town hall.

396
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:34,121
You're much better at having Parties
than at negotiating surrender.

397
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:39,361
Well, we're ltalian, famous for singing,
eating, making love.

398
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:44,437
.What's your name?
.Antonio Corelli. Grazie.

399
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:54,245
You Germans always have
the best tobacco, huh?

400
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,355
.How many of you are here now?
.APProximately 1,200 under Colonel Barge.

401
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:00,278
Here to keeP an eye on us.

402
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:03,806
Doesn't it feel good
to have your allies here?

403
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:06,561
l thought all you Nazis had blonde hair.

404
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:09,844
l come from the Tyrol.
Grew uP in the Austrian mountains.

405
00:42:10,247 --> 00:42:11,726
All my family...

406
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:15,004
...going back as far as we can remember,
have dark hair.

407
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,918
Like Adolf Hitler?

408
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:21,038
You neglected to tell me your rank.

409
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:25,200
l am the breve.
Massimiliano here is the semibreve.

410
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:29,077
He is the minim. Those boys are
the crotchets and the quavers.

411
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:33,319
Piero here is the semiquaver,
and Carlo is the rest...

412
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:36,041
...the Pause between the notes.

413
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:39,358
ln the oPera club,
we have our own ranking system...

414
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:43,402
...but otherwise, l am a caPtain,
33rd Regiment of Artillery.

415
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:48,039
.Do you sing?
.No, not really.

416
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:52,365
Maybe on my own, in the bath.

417
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:54,883
Have a drink. Be haPPy!

418
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:58,803
But just remember, if you ever exPress
admiration for Wagner...

419
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:03,005
...you will be shot without trial,
and without leave of aPPeal.

420
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,885
From the toP.

421
00:43:42,727 --> 00:43:44,126
Come on.

422
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:28,524
Buona sera, signorina.

423
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:35,558
Are you going to shoot me?

424
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:54,566
lt wasn't loaded.

425
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:06,202
l've never aimed a gun at anybody.

426
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:08,679
Never in my life.

427
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:15,763
lt must be very difficult for you
to have to Put uP with us.

428
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:19,716
lt must be very difficult for you
to have to live with yourself.

429
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:24,202
You lie in the sun and swim in the sea...

430
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:27,724
...and flirt with your Prostitutes.

431
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:31,482
And there are PeoPle l know,
PeoPle l grew uP with...

432
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:35,526
...who are fighting for their lives
and dying for what they believe in.

433
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,042
And all you do is sing!

434
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,319
What's there to sing about?

435
00:45:44,047 --> 00:45:47,960
We are in the middle of a war,
not an oPera house.

436
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:51,564
And here you think you are so cultured
with your Pasta...

437
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:54,445
...and your Panettone
and your Puffed.uP oPera.

438
00:45:57,327 --> 00:46:00,524
Why don't you take your holiday
on somebody else's island?

439
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:07,042
What is there to sing about?

440
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:12,084
There is singing
when babies are baPtized...

441
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:15,437
...when you celebrate a marriage.

442
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,324
Men sing as they work.

443
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:22,044
Soldiers sing as they march into battle.

444
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,762
And there is singing when PeoPle die.

445
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:31,404
l've always found something in life
worth singing about.

446
00:46:32,607 --> 00:46:35,360
And for that, l cannot aPologize.

447
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:45,236
For the fact that l've caused you Pain,
l cannot aPologize enough.

448
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:51,519
l have not been able to imagine until now...

449
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:54,198
...the offense l have given.

450
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:32,278
.What are those?
.My things.

451
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:35,487
l can see that. Why?

452
00:47:35,847 --> 00:47:38,566
l'm going to stay
in the encamPment with my men.

453
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:41,525
.l think it will be best.
.But you must understand.

454
00:47:41,607 --> 00:47:44,167
l made an arrangement
with your quartermaster.

455
00:47:44,247 --> 00:47:45,805
We agreed the terms.

456
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:50,041
l would not feel comfortable
letting him down.

457
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:54,325
Therefore, l think you should stay.

458
00:47:54,527 --> 00:47:56,916
l don't think your daughter would agree.

459
00:47:58,607 --> 00:48:02,236
She understands the imPortance
of honoring an arrangement.

460
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:06,440
l'll sPeak to the quartermaster, make sure
you continue to get medical suPPlies.

461
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:09,958
l've enjoyed meeting you.

462
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,358
l'm only sorry about the circumstances.

463
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:04,598
''Citizens of Cephallonia,
in these unfortunate and difficult times...

464
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:07,759
''...let us show the world
how two ancient cultures...

465
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:12,363
''...can coexist and behave
in a civilized manner towards one another.

466
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:15,719
''Please join us
in an evening of relaxation...

467
00:49:15,807 --> 00:49:18,844
''...as we extend the hand
of friendship to you all.''

468
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:17,045
l'll be back in a minute.

469
00:50:29,887 --> 00:50:32,003
My friend thinks you're very Pretty.

470
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:34,597
Why doesn't he tell me himself?

471
00:50:34,807 --> 00:50:36,126
He's too shy.

472
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:40,635
He wants to know if you'll dance with him.

473
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:44,725
No, l can't. Not with a German.

474
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:47,881
But tell him thank you.

475
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:50,641
Tell him l don't mean to be rude.

476
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,520
Can we dance now?

477
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:49,839
lt's Turkish.

478
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:52,325
From the Great War.

479
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:56,517
.We should exPlode it.
.The exPlosive must have decayed.

480
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,683
lt's been floating for about 20 years.

481
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:01,997
We could Put on a good show.

482
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:22,044
We are going to exPlode the bomb!

483
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:24,761
lt will be a fantastic exPlosion!

484
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:30,077
And when the time comes,
nobody must come down to the beach!

485
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:33,405
You must watch from where you are!

486
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:08,444
You must be one of the most stuPid PeoPle
l've ever met.

487
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:11,606
You wanted to show off,
so you nearly get us all killed.

488
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:14,918
l can see your liPs moving,
but l can't hear a word you're saying.

489
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:17,441
lt should Pass in a day or two.

490
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:20,286
Your father says
it will Pass in a day or two.

491
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:24,406
Does he? ls that what
the great doctor says?

492
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,126
What are you saying?

493
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:31,045
Are you saying how beautiful life is
since the ltalians arrived?

494
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:33,118
All my life, l've been waiting.

495
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:36,046
l don't know how l survived
before you came.

496
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:40,162
Are you saying
how much you missed having me around?

497
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:42,517
l miss you so much l can't sleeP at night.

498
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,962
The other night, when you were dancing...

499
00:56:45,047 --> 00:56:47,038
...the way you were moving...

500
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:49,558
...the turn of your head...

501
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,762
...l thought l could watch you forever.

502
00:56:56,047 --> 00:56:58,003
You think you can come here...

503
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:01,196
...and turn my whole world uPside down?

504
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:07,076
lodine.

505
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:10,241
Bandages. Dressings.

506
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:12,761
This is all l have.
l can't give you any morPhine.

507
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,997
And we need all the quinine we have.

508
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:18,159
12,000 of our men on the mainland
are sick with malaria.

509
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:20,044
SuPPlies are not getting through.

510
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,278
Nobody knows why.
Nobody knows what is haPPening.

511
00:57:23,447 --> 00:57:25,085
And l'm going to eat.

512
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:31,836
You know, when l met Pelagia's mother...

513
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:34,756
...she was betrothed to somebody else.

514
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,845
He nearly killed me.

515
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:43,362
l had to leave the island.
l had to lie low for a while.

516
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,561
She wants to train to be a doctor,
you know.

517
00:57:51,127 --> 00:57:53,277
You think she'd make a good doctor?

518
00:57:54,927 --> 00:57:57,441
l think she'd make a very good doctor.

519
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:07,359
Another thing.

520
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:12,125
This is a very ancient land.

521
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:17,077
We have had nothing but earthquakes
and slaughter for 2,000 years.

522
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:20,159
We've had massacres
at Sami and Fiskardo.

523
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:22,319
God knows where else.

524
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:24,840
There will be more.

525
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:28,198
lt's only a question of time.

526
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:32,682
So don't make any Plans.

527
00:59:39,927 --> 00:59:42,919
After the war, l'll leave it with you.

528
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,839
You're very sweet.

529
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:57,002
The Allies have landed in ltaly.

530
00:59:57,087 --> 00:59:58,759
We can all go home then!

531
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:04,037
l can't believe it.
You really want this war to be over?

532
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:06,398
What is wrong with you ltalians?

533
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:09,075
We don't have your advantages, Gunter.

534
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:10,801
Advantages?

535
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:14,516
The advantage of thinking
that other races are inferior to yours.

536
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:17,844
lt's a question of science.
You can't alter a scientific fact.

537
01:00:17,927 --> 01:00:21,283
l don't care about science.
lt's morality that counts.

538
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:22,835
What is your morality?

539
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:25,441
lf l were to see a man
being set uPon by others...

540
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:27,563
...l would think that man was my brother.

541
01:00:27,647 --> 01:00:29,080
That is my morality.

542
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,727
l would make myself believe it's Personal.

543
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:33,838
For me, too, the war is Personal.

544
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:36,043
l lost both my grandfathers
in the Great War.

545
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:37,765
A war that you started.

546
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:40,566
My father's brother,
two of my mother's brothers.

547
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:43,725
l grew uP in a country
where it was hard to survive.

548
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,838
We were hungry all the time.

549
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:48,801
All we ever knew about was defeat,
but now....

550
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:53,722
Sometimes it is better to lose
than to have so much blood on your hands.

551
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,357
lt's a beautiful night,
and everything is Peaceful.

552
01:00:57,647 --> 01:01:00,400
And we should think about falling in love.

553
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:51,966
That's beautiful.

554
01:02:53,047 --> 01:02:54,241
What is it?

555
01:02:55,327 --> 01:02:56,806
lt's Pelagia's Song.

556
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:55,081
l wrote you that song because l love you.

557
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,517
l don't care if the world knows it.

558
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:05,677
l couldn't care less if l never Pick uP
the mandolin again.

559
01:04:06,087 --> 01:04:10,285
When l was Playing,
it felt like my hands were lumPs of wood.

560
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:16,158
lt felt as if every note was sour or stale.

561
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:20,525
And then l realized...

562
01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:23,679
...it's useless.

563
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,755
lt's hoPeless.

564
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:30,879
lt can't begin to exPress
the way l feel about you.

565
01:05:54,527 --> 01:05:57,963
Next time you see him,
tell him l have got his mandolin.

566
01:06:01,527 --> 01:06:03,279
He left it in the square.

567
01:06:33,567 --> 01:06:37,685
Four more boys from the village
have left to join Mandras.

568
01:06:39,687 --> 01:06:41,564
Constantine's boys.

569
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:45,803
.Kostas's brother. What's his name?
.George.

570
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:48,765
He's only 15.

571
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:52,163
He always worshiPPed Mandras.

572
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:55,080
Do you love him?

573
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:58,123
We are engaged to be married.

574
01:06:59,647 --> 01:07:01,603
l am not talking about Mandras.

575
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:18,318
When you fall in love,
it is a temPorary madness.

576
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:23,680
lt eruPts like an earthquake,
and then it subsides.

577
01:07:24,927 --> 01:07:27,919
And when it subsides,
you have to make a decision.

578
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:33,118
You have to work out whether your roots
have become so entwined...

579
01:07:33,207 --> 01:07:37,405
...that it is inconceivable
that you should ever Part.

580
01:07:38,647 --> 01:07:42,879
Because this is what love is.

581
01:07:47,007 --> 01:07:50,158
Love is not breathlessness.
lt is not excitement.

582
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:53,159
lt's not the desire to mate
every second of the day.

583
01:07:53,247 --> 01:07:56,205
lt is not lying awake at night
imagining that he is kissing...

584
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,403
...every Part of your body.

585
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:05,440
Don't blush.

586
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:10,923
l'm telling you some truths.

587
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:15,757
That is just being in love...

588
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:18,884
...which any of us
can convince ourselves we are.

589
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:24,242
Love itself is what is left over...

590
01:08:24,327 --> 01:08:27,285
...when being in love has burned away.

591
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:32,006
Doesn't sound very exciting, does it?

592
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:37,961
But it is.

593
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,877
Do you think
that you could begin to imagine...

594
01:08:43,967 --> 01:08:47,642
...that that is how you will come to feel
with CaPtain Corelli?

595
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:01,356
You must act honorably...

596
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:04,725
...with resPect to Mandras and his mother.

597
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:10,120
And...

598
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:15,004
...Pray for the liberation of the island...

599
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:20,478
...because then,
everything becomes Possible.

600
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:15,606
Drosoula.

601
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:20,641
All night,
l've been thinking about Mandras.

602
01:10:22,127 --> 01:10:23,685
About me and Mandras.

603
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:29,442
Thinking about how long we've been aPart.

604
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:45,565
.When did you arrive?
.Where is your ring?

605
01:10:47,127 --> 01:10:49,004
My fingers got too thin.

606
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,958
l thought l would lose it.

607
01:10:57,607 --> 01:11:00,485
.Where will you stay?
.l want to ask you something.

608
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:04,717
We need to see the ltalian caPtain.

609
01:11:06,287 --> 01:11:10,599
l want you to ask him to meet with us.
As soon as you can.

610
01:11:12,247 --> 01:11:13,441
In Germany, the port of Hamburg...

611
01:11:13,527 --> 01:11:16,087
...suffered a second day
of continuous air raids...

612
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:20,558
...from nearly 800 British aircraft,
leaving much of the city in ruins...

613
01:11:20,647 --> 01:11:24,526
...while in Italy, Rome has finally fallen
to the Allied advance...

614
01:11:24,607 --> 01:11:26,404
...after weeks of fierce fighting...

615
01:11:26,487 --> 01:11:29,604
...and a huge bombing campaign
on the capital.

616
01:11:29,687 --> 01:11:33,043
Allied commanders are watching
the Mediterranean countries...

617
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:35,561
...occupied by German and Italian forces.

618
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:40,359
It's not yet clear what the German attitude
to an Italian withdrawal might be...

619
01:11:40,447 --> 01:11:44,679
...but Germany will assume sole command
of many strategic territories.

620
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,998
Hitler is expected to send
massive reinforcements...

621
01:11:48,087 --> 01:11:50,317
...through the Balkans and into Greece...

622
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:54,241
...as the Nazis struggle to maintain
supply routes to North Africa.

623
01:11:55,287 --> 01:11:58,916
Mandras is back. He wants to see you.

624
01:12:10,087 --> 01:12:11,998
lt's over! lt's all over!

625
01:12:12,087 --> 01:12:15,238
Mussolini has fallen! We're going home!

626
01:13:21,247 --> 01:13:24,284
Colonel Barge and l have agreed
the date for the surrender...

627
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:29,157
...of our heavy weaPons and machine guns:
SePtember 15.

628
01:13:29,287 --> 01:13:31,005
That's in five days' time.

629
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:37,801
Why should we lay down our arms?
They were our allies.

630
01:13:37,887 --> 01:13:42,119
.Why should they be dictating terms to us?
.We have surrendered.

631
01:13:42,207 --> 01:13:45,643
Mussolini has surrendered
to the British and the Americans.

632
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:49,720
.Not to the Germans.
.Colonel Barge and l have agreed.

633
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,236
lf we surrender our arms...

634
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:56,478
...do we have confirmation
that they will not use force against us?

635
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:59,798
l have a Personal undertaking
from Colonel Barge and his officers...

636
01:13:59,887 --> 01:14:02,037
...that our trooPs
will be allowed safe Passage.

637
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:05,324
My men will never agree
to return home without their weaPons.

638
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:08,001
lf you surrender your arms
in times of war...

639
01:14:08,087 --> 01:14:09,805
...then you are no longer a man.

640
01:14:09,887 --> 01:14:12,447
lf you were in their Position,
if you were German...

641
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:15,200
...you would want to be certain
for your own security...

642
01:14:15,287 --> 01:14:17,403
...that the weaPons will not be Passed on...

643
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:20,559
...to the Allied forces
or to the Greek Partisans.

644
01:14:20,647 --> 01:14:22,205
Or turned against you.

645
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:26,563
Or turned against you.

646
01:14:57,967 --> 01:15:00,606
You must be looking forward
to going home.

647
01:15:01,207 --> 01:15:04,324
There'll be PeoPle haPPy
to see you again, l'm sure.

648
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:09,317
Your family, your mother,
your wife, your girlfriend.

649
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:14,124
.You wanted to see me?
.We need arms.

650
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:16,846
Machine guns, ammunition, land mines.

651
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:20,320
.Anything you can sPare.
.How can l give you weaPons?

652
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:22,682
.You know l can't do that.
.You've surrendered.

653
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:25,440
lf you don't intend to fight,
you won't need your weaPons.

654
01:15:25,527 --> 01:15:27,324
We have a country to defend.

655
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:30,558
There is a massive builduP
of German trooPs on the mainland.

656
01:15:30,647 --> 01:15:33,639
The 117th Jaeger Division
is nearing the Corinth Canal.

657
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:36,596
The 104th is moving south
from Yugoslavia.

658
01:15:36,687 --> 01:15:40,282
.Then you are not in any Position to resist.
.Unless we act now.

659
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:43,564
Do you know, CaPtain, on Lefkada lsland...

660
01:15:43,647 --> 01:15:48,163
...all the ltalians who surrendered have
been sent to Prison camPs in the North?

661
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:56,081
.We heard they went home.
.The trains were diverted in Albania.

662
01:15:56,687 --> 01:16:00,760
ln this war, CaPtain,
it's hard to know who you can trust.

663
01:16:01,927 --> 01:16:05,840
But one thing is certain:
You can't trust the Germans.

664
01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:44,719
Last night, l dreamed l was sitting
in a restaurant in Piazza Navona...

665
01:16:44,807 --> 01:16:48,277
...eating zuppa di cozze piccante...

666
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:51,723
...then a Plate of taglierini alla boscaiola.

667
01:16:57,807 --> 01:17:02,005
Colonel Barge requested l withdraw
your battery from Antisamos Beach.

668
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:08,159
lf they wanted to bring in
heavy reinforcements...

669
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:10,597
...this is where they would do it.

670
01:17:11,647 --> 01:17:13,319
ls this an order?

671
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:16,444
CaPtain, don't you want to go home?

672
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,040
Halt!

673
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,004
Are you going to let us through?

674
01:18:20,087 --> 01:18:23,682
My orders are to suPervise the surrender
of your arms and weaPons.

675
01:18:32,127 --> 01:18:35,278
The deadline for the handover
is at noon tomorrow.

676
01:18:39,567 --> 01:18:42,445
This order comes from Colonel Barge.

677
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:46,237
He's asked me to assure you
that if you surrender your arms...

678
01:18:46,327 --> 01:18:48,841
...you will be guaranteed safe Passage.

679
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:52,845
Like the ltalian garrison at Lefkada?

680
01:18:54,327 --> 01:18:55,601
Lefkada?

681
01:18:56,607 --> 01:19:00,202
But they laid down their weaPons.
They went home.

682
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:42,964
You must be looking forward
to seeing ltaly again.

683
01:19:46,367 --> 01:19:48,562
You think we could keeP in touch?

684
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:52,002
l mean, after the war, of course.

685
01:20:06,047 --> 01:20:08,959
You can have my gun
when l finish my cigarette.

686
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:16,045
Get your hands off me!

687
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:34,120
l understand your concern.

688
01:20:34,207 --> 01:20:36,926
lf l were in your shoes,
l would be asking questions, too.

689
01:20:37,007 --> 01:20:39,396
Of course we'll investigate what haPPened.

690
01:20:39,487 --> 01:20:43,480
l can tell you what haPPened.
Four of my men are dead!

691
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:46,718
.We'll take the aPProPriate action.
.What does that mean?

692
01:20:47,807 --> 01:20:50,958
Does it mean that l can write
to the families of these men...

693
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:53,515
...and tell them
that their murderers will be charged?

694
01:20:53,607 --> 01:20:55,165
.That justice will Prevail?
.CaPtain.

695
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:58,717
You force us at gunPoint to line uP
and surrender our arms!

696
01:20:58,807 --> 01:21:00,525
You imPound our weaPons.

697
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:03,644
.We're suPPosed to be allies!
.CaPtain Corelli, Please!

698
01:21:05,287 --> 01:21:07,243
We need some kind of assurance.

699
01:21:10,647 --> 01:21:12,956
l can assure you that the order to disarm...

700
01:21:13,047 --> 01:21:15,481
...did not come from my headquarters.

701
01:21:18,727 --> 01:21:22,356
We have agreed to the surrender
of our arms by noon tomorrow.

702
01:21:22,447 --> 01:21:25,484
We would like your assurance
that no more of our trooPs...

703
01:21:25,567 --> 01:21:28,718
...will be forcibly disarmed
before that deadline.

704
01:21:29,487 --> 01:21:31,284
Herr General...

705
01:21:31,367 --> 01:21:36,202
...by noon tomorrow,
l guarantee you'll be on your way home.

706
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,085
This is not our war.

707
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:58,562
This is between the Greeks
and the Germans.

708
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,525
Would you Prefer we left them
to fight on their own?

709
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:07,598
The Fourth Regiment will hold Antisamos.
We'll keeP the Fifth in reserve at Assos...

710
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:10,360
...and l will take the Eighth
and Ninth to Argostoli.

711
01:22:14,807 --> 01:22:18,243
All gun lines to be in Position
by first light tomorrow.

712
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,996
.lf we resist now, we can beat them.
.What if the Germans send Planes?

713
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:12,238
Don't go near Argostoli.
Stay away from Antisamos Beach.

714
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:14,966
l want to lie across the road
so that you can't leave.

715
01:23:15,047 --> 01:23:18,437
KeeP a gun with you at all times.
Promise me.

716
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:23,517
.Come back to me.
.Promise me.

717
01:23:26,807 --> 01:23:29,924
When it's over, you will come back to me.

718
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,476
l know what you feel.

719
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:04,199
You think, if he died your world will stoP.

720
01:24:06,047 --> 01:24:08,163
l will look out for him.

721
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:51,961
Mama! Mama!

722
01:25:55,207 --> 01:25:57,437
Stay here! lt's not safe!

723
01:26:23,927 --> 01:26:27,203
.What are you doing?
.She's a traitor and a whore!

724
01:26:27,887 --> 01:26:31,084
HelP me! HelP me!

725
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:34,725
HelP me!

726
01:27:21,407 --> 01:27:23,284
The enemy's 100 meters away.

727
01:27:23,367 --> 01:27:26,040
There's heavy armor coming now.
Let's go!

728
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,835
WHORE . TRAlTOR

729
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:01,878
Come on, move!

730
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:21,718
Shoot me.

731
01:36:16,887 --> 01:36:18,161
He's alive.

732
01:36:22,647 --> 01:36:23,841
He's alive.

733
01:36:24,927 --> 01:36:26,838
He was alive when l found him.

734
01:36:36,847 --> 01:36:40,476
Fragments of uniform in the bullet holes.
SPlinters of rib.

735
01:36:40,807 --> 01:36:41,796
Just do it.

736
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:46,244
l am not a surgeon. l have no Penicillin.
l have no sterile water, no serum.

737
01:36:46,327 --> 01:36:48,204
Please, Father, do it!

738
01:37:03,847 --> 01:37:05,485
Hold.

739
01:37:22,647 --> 01:37:24,558
Four of his ribs are broken.

740
01:37:49,087 --> 01:37:50,361
PaPa!

741
01:37:50,647 --> 01:37:53,957
Antonio, don't move. Don't move!

742
01:37:54,487 --> 01:37:57,445
lf you even try to move,
you will hemorrhage to death.

743
01:37:58,007 --> 01:38:00,362
No, you must lie still.

744
01:38:05,447 --> 01:38:08,166
.l don't..
.You were lying under Carlo's body.

745
01:38:08,887 --> 01:38:12,562
lf it wasn't for him, you wouldn't be alive.

746
01:38:18,007 --> 01:38:19,440
How did l get here?

747
01:38:23,167 --> 01:38:25,078
Mandras found you.

748
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:42,603
Antonio, you should try
and drink something.

749
01:39:15,047 --> 01:39:17,197
What would you like for lunch?

750
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:22,204
Not that there's any choice, of course.
But if there was.

751
01:39:28,367 --> 01:39:30,039
We needed something...

752
01:39:30,767 --> 01:39:34,555
...steel, wire to bind the bones.

753
01:39:36,327 --> 01:39:39,637
Of course, they'll have to be removed
sometime in the future.

754
01:39:41,287 --> 01:39:44,199
l could try and get some new strings
from somewhere.

755
01:39:45,767 --> 01:39:47,678
l could ask around.

756
01:40:43,767 --> 01:40:46,964
.What are you doing?
.lf they find me, they'll shoot you.

757
01:40:47,047 --> 01:40:50,756
.They'll kill you if you leave.
.l don't belong here, Pelagia!

758
01:40:50,847 --> 01:40:52,519
l never belonged here!

759
01:40:53,127 --> 01:40:57,166
Ever since l came,
look what has haPPened all around you.

760
01:40:57,247 --> 01:40:58,316
l love you.

761
01:40:58,407 --> 01:41:02,161
l had no right to make you love me
when you weren't mine to love.

762
01:41:04,607 --> 01:41:06,438
Don't do that!

763
01:41:18,687 --> 01:41:22,441
Go to Dr. lannis' house. Go! Go! Go!

764
01:41:22,527 --> 01:41:24,802
Go now!

765
01:41:24,887 --> 01:41:29,165
Mama will be back!
Do you hear? Mama will..

766
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:46,320
Dimitris will row you to a boat
out in the bay.

767
01:42:51,087 --> 01:42:53,396
You should be home by tomorrow night.

768
01:43:28,447 --> 01:43:29,880
We must go.

769
01:43:44,247 --> 01:43:47,637
l had to see you again, one last time.

770
01:43:48,607 --> 01:43:50,279
We must go!

771
01:43:54,847 --> 01:43:56,519
Don't say anything.

772
01:44:02,287 --> 01:44:03,515
Look at me.

773
01:44:04,127 --> 01:44:06,118
.We must go!
.Go.

774
01:44:06,927 --> 01:44:08,360
Go!

775
01:44:51,807 --> 01:44:54,196
Why did you save him?

776
01:44:55,207 --> 01:44:57,323
Why didn't you leave him to die?

777
01:44:59,767 --> 01:45:01,803
l wanted you to love me again.

778
01:45:09,247 --> 01:45:11,363
ln Albania...

779
01:45:11,447 --> 01:45:14,007
...l made them read every one
of these to me.

780
01:45:15,567 --> 01:45:18,764
''Mandras, l love you. Mandras, l want you.

781
01:45:18,847 --> 01:45:20,963
''Mandras, when are you coming back?''

782
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:29,476
And then one day, a different letter.

783
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:36,561
''l don't know how to describe my feelings.

784
01:45:37,607 --> 01:45:40,883
''lt's as if l've been waiting 100 years
to hear from you.

785
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:43,640
''Waiting 100 years for you to return.

786
01:45:44,647 --> 01:45:47,957
''Once l thought my heart
was overflowing with love for you...

787
01:45:50,127 --> 01:45:52,436
''...but now all l feel is emPtiness.

788
01:45:53,807 --> 01:45:56,401
''And l think all the time,
it was a Pretense...

789
01:45:58,687 --> 01:46:00,757
''...that l never loved you at all.''

790
01:46:22,247 --> 01:46:23,805
l'm sorry.

791
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:31,525
l'm sorry.

792
01:46:48,927 --> 01:46:53,205
The war we thought
would never end is over.

793
01:46:54,647 --> 01:46:58,003
And the island we thought
we had lost forever...

794
01:46:58,087 --> 01:46:59,918
...is ours again.

795
01:47:07,647 --> 01:47:12,004
In the doctor's house,
there are three of us now:

796
01:47:12,687 --> 01:47:16,043
The doctor, his daughter...

797
01:47:16,927 --> 01:47:19,077
...who is training to be a doctor...

798
01:47:20,007 --> 01:47:21,201
...and Lemoni.

799
01:47:25,807 --> 01:47:27,445
lt's for you.

800
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:30,080
From ltaly.

801
01:47:52,687 --> 01:47:54,245
What is it?

802
01:47:58,847 --> 01:48:00,485
lt's a record.

803
01:48:43,247 --> 01:48:47,525
We should start making suPPer.
That's what we should do.

804
01:48:59,367 --> 01:49:02,006
''I do not know
if this letter will reach you...

805
01:49:02,647 --> 01:49:05,036
''...or even if you are alive.

806
01:49:06,687 --> 01:49:09,121
''Perhaps someone else
sent us your record...

807
01:49:09,687 --> 01:49:11,962
''...and that is why we found no note.

808
01:49:14,327 --> 01:49:17,239
''I would like to say that Pelagia is happy...

809
01:49:18,367 --> 01:49:21,439
''...but she is full of tears
she will not let fall...

810
01:49:22,047 --> 01:49:25,244
''...and of a grief no doctor can mend.

811
01:49:27,207 --> 01:49:30,244
''She blames herself for the pain
we have suffered...

812
01:49:31,247 --> 01:49:34,080
''...and, perhaps, the same is true for you.

813
01:49:35,887 --> 01:49:38,765
''You know I am not a religious man...

814
01:49:40,127 --> 01:49:42,083
''...but I believe this:

815
01:49:42,967 --> 01:49:45,606
''If there is a wound, we must try to heal it.

816
01:49:47,047 --> 01:49:50,039
''If there is someone
whose pain we can cure...

817
01:49:50,607 --> 01:49:53,167
''...we must search till we find them.

818
01:49:54,207 --> 01:49:57,597
''If the gods have chosen
that we should survive...

819
01:49:58,567 --> 01:50:00,125
''...it will be for a reason.''

820
01:52:56,127 --> 01:53:00,518
Where is your miracle today then?
What do we have to say about that?

821
01:53:39,327 --> 01:53:44,003
''Wake uP. Fetch the firewood.
Fix the roof. Paint the house.''

822
01:53:44,447 --> 01:53:46,278
She's driving me mad.

823
01:53:47,327 --> 01:53:50,763
When l was deaf,
l couldn't hear her nagging.

824
01:53:50,847 --> 01:53:52,280
But now....

825
01:53:53,287 --> 01:53:56,836
Iatre, l beg of you, helP me.

826
01:53:56,927 --> 01:53:58,804
Put the Pea back in my ear.

827
01:54:43,127 --> 01:54:44,958
l was looking for Lemoni.

828
01:54:46,047 --> 01:54:48,277
She's down the road.

829
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:51,198
l went to the house.

830
01:54:53,407 --> 01:54:55,637
lt doesn't exist anymore.

831
01:54:56,687 --> 01:54:58,405
We are building a new one.

832
01:55:00,047 --> 01:55:02,277
Your father wrote you got the record.

833
01:55:04,767 --> 01:55:08,123
lt's a guitar. lt's different.

834
01:55:18,207 --> 01:55:20,198
l tried to live without you.

835
01:55:22,127 --> 01:55:25,244
l tried to make myself believe
l could live without you.

836
01:55:42,167 --> 01:55:43,759
The scar healed well.

837
01:56:00,847 --> 01:56:04,157
Stamatis, do you love your wife?

838
01:56:05,647 --> 01:56:07,717
lf you love your wife...

839
01:56:07,807 --> 01:56:10,765
...my advice is be nice to her.

840
01:56:10,847 --> 01:56:13,407
Bring in the wood
before she asks you for it.

841
01:56:14,367 --> 01:56:18,326
lf she is cold,
then Put a shawl around her shoulders.

842
01:56:19,807 --> 01:56:23,800
And bring her a flower
every time you come back from the field.

843
01:56:24,887 --> 01:56:28,880
.You won't Put the Pea back in my ear?
.Oh, no.

844
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:32,240
That'd be against the HiPPocratic Oath.

845
02:03:29,047 --> 02:03:31,038
