1
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:34,942
Got some.

2
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:28,383
- Dad peed in his pants.
- Get used to it, son.

3
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:30,617
When I'm old,
you'll have to change my diaper.

4
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:38,946
Another year over. I can't believe it.

5
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:40,859
I can't believe our sons are 7.

6
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,416
In a couple years,
they'll be starting a band...

7
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,020
...growing their hair long...

8
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:47,064
...stealing your Suburban
to go on tour.

9
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:52,178
Charlie, we have ourselves
a situation.

10
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:53,621
Okay, I'll be a minute.

11
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:54,856
Phil. Phil.

12
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,265
Rare. Good. See?

13
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,617
Save room for cake.

14
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:13,498
Never mind that on the cake.

15
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,777
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, slow down.

16
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:23,099
It was the end of Summer Olympiad
between us and our rival camp.

17
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,337
The final event: The relay race.

18
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:28,419
Coming down the stretch,
I was flying like the wind.

19
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,179
You were sweating sheets of rain.

20
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:32,178
You could barely move
in a straight line.

21
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,144
- I was still in the lead.
- Whatever.

22
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,026
I hand the baton to Charlie,
he drops it, we lose everything.

23
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:40,338
Then Lance Warner flew
right past you to the finish line.

24
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:44,386
I hated that snot-nosed little brat.
He's why I didn't have a good time.

25
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:49,096
Honey, why is Ben going on and on
about going off to camp?

26
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,781
The permission slip's been
on the fridge for three weeks.

27
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:54,256
He really wants to go,
and I think he should.

28
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:57,464
Well, Phil and I have talked,
the boys aren't going.

29
00:03:57,627 --> 00:04:00,221
- What do you mean?
- I mean, they're not going.

30
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,617
All those snakes and spiders
and wedgies.

31
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:05,506
Just because you had
a bad experience as a kid at camp...

32
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,703
...doesn't mean
our son will have one too.

33
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:11,496
- What are you talking about?
- I was there. You were scarred for life.

34
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,976
I'm on the ground,
staring up at my father.

35
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:16,058
He stands there
with a look of disapproval.

36
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:18,946
Just over some stupid camp game.

37
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:22,782
I won't allow my son to let
anything like that happen to him.

38
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:26,257
He will know I love and support him
no matter what.

39
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:30,144
Good. Then you can love
and support him going to camp.

40
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:32,502
You didn't hear what I just said?

41
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:37,104
Yes, I did, and he's not you,
and you definitely are not your father.

42
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:41,026
Oh, and you're driving them.

43
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,664
There it is. Camp Canola.

44
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,256
You don't want to go to rival Canola.

45
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:06,940
But that's where everyone goes.

46
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,144
No, if you wanna go to camp,
you wanna go to Driftwood.

47
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,457
Yeah, Camp Canola's
some rundown shack...

48
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:14,299
...on a piece of swamp land.

49
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,976
At least, it used to be.

50
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:42,304
- Cool.
- Awesome.

51
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,023
It's a lake. I don't remember a lake.

52
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,298
Well, this ain't nothing.

53
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,298
Wait till you see
where you are going.

54
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,741
Camp Driftwood.

55
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:17,826
What the heck?

56
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:27,265
Yeah, well, you're crazy, Morty.
That's the best offer...

57
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:29,497
...you're ever gonna get
for this craphole.

58
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:33,660
I'm doing you a favour, butthead.
You're crazy, Morty.

59
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:37,344
- Are you folks lost?
- No, we're here to check out the camp.

60
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:41,665
You want to bring your kids here?

61
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:47,186
That's beautiful.

62
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,896
Yeah.

63
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,620
Hey, good luck with that.

64
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,864
Okay, kids, come on.

65
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:04,177
Didn't you hear? Camp's closed.

66
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:05,416
- Yes.
- Yes.

67
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:08,340
What happened?
This place used to be the best.

68
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:12,056
Well, now seems
like everybody wants newer, better...

69
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:14,616
...properly licensed and bonded.

70
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:17,984
They want Camp Canola
down the road.

71
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,580
You guys went to Driftwood?

72
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,339
Yeah, we were here
when we were kids.

73
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:25,659
Then you know. This place really used
to be something special.

74
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:29,661
And Canola was a dump.
Then some rich family bought it...

75
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:33,456
...eventually turned it over
to that mutant son of theirs.

76
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,299
What's gonna happen to Driftwood?

77
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,618
Well, soon I'm gonna have no choice
but to sell it to Canola.

78
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:43,099
It's a pity. Because all he wants
to do is bulldoze over it.

79
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,541
Can you believe it?

80
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:48,336
That kid has been a pain in my heinie
since he won the '77 Olympiad.

81
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:52,861
I just hate to give that jerk
Lance Warner the satisfaction.

82
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,216
Warner? Lance Warner?

83
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:58,298
He wants to buy this camp
and tear it down?

84
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,456
Our camp?

85
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:01,026
You bought a what?

86
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:03,906
Not the whole camp,
a partnership with the original owner.

87
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,627
I know the day care centre
has been successful...

88
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,096
...but you've spent a lot
fixing this house up...

89
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,541
...to accommodate more kids.

90
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,824
The Daddy Day Care brand
means a lot in this town.

91
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:16,706
Re-purposing that brand into summer
is just smart business.

92
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,380
Do you know how to run a camp?

93
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:21,857
That's just it. I'm not gonna run
the camp, Uncle Morty is.

94
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,745
Phil and I are just gonna help out.

95
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:26,137
So I'll spend as much time
with Ben as possible.

96
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,740
But you hate the outdoors.

97
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,741
Yes, but I hate Lance Warner more.
No way my son's going to his camp.

98
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:35,422
Please just send him to Canola.
That's where all his friends are.

99
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:36,656
No. No way.

100
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:43,426
Listen, my father sent me to camp
and it didn't go so great. Okay?

101
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:46,943
Maybe I can give Ben
the positive experience I never had.

102
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:51,902
Just promise me you'll let...

103
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,456
...this Uncle Morty do
the real outdoorsy stuff.

104
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:56,538
I don't wanna have to send
a search party...

105
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,096
...to come rescue your lost butt
in the woods.

106
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,543
Come on, Sally, now,
don't play hard to get.

107
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,060
Oh, you little tease.

108
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,616
Oh, you... I've gotcha.

109
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,656
<i>It's another beautiful</i>
<i>woodchuck day, baby. </i>

110
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,466
Hey, that's great.
You remember the old cheer.

111
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:22,142
I can't thank you guys enough.
I mean, you saved the old place.

112
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,867
Yeah, well, with your help,
I'll show that Lance Warner...

113
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:27,063
...how to run a good
old-fashioned summer camp.

114
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:29,422
Swell. I'll see you guys
in September.

115
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:30,576
Say what, now?

116
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,020
Uncle Morty?

117
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:37,664
Excuse me. Morty, you can't leave.

118
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,785
You're supposed to be overseeing
the camp. We're partners.

119
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,097
I've been watching over this camp
for 30 years.

120
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:45,827
It's time I took a vacation, partner.

121
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:48,057
Don't worry.
Dale here will show you the ropes.

122
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:52,061
- He's the best counsellor I got.
- No, Morty, wait. You can't leave.

123
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,783
Wait. Come back.

124
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,616
What was that about?

125
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:07,865
This is my first day.

126
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,819
Charles Hinton?

127
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:26,899
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm from FM J Bank.

128
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,022
No doubt your uncle Morty
informed you of the liens...

129
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,826
...we have against your property.
- Informed?

130
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,943
He just took his little fishy
up the road.

131
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:36,540
As the business has no clients...

132
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,743
...therefore no discernible
means of income...

133
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:41,865
...the bank will have no choice
but to foreclose on the property.

134
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:43,096
- Foreclose?
- Foreclose?

135
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:46,299
Let me ask you something.

136
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,300
What if this camp could show
discernible means of income?

137
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:51,221
Continue.

138
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,662
We have run
the Daddy Day Care Center...

139
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,738
...successfully
for the past several years.

140
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:58,467
Allow us to use the hard-earned trust
that name brings...

141
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,060
...to build in new clientele.

142
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,738
I suppose I could recommend
to the bank...

143
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:05,660
...that we extend the debt
for about a month.

144
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,182
Assuming, of course,
that you can maintain the camp...

145
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:10,542
...and a client base
of at least 30 children.

146
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:13,342
We'll have it in tiptop shape
in no time.

147
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:26,143
Yeah, you got a methane problem,
all right.

148
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,377
Gonna have to have
that baby pumped.

149
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:29,662
Oh, crap.

150
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:32,705
Yeah, you said it. Gonna need
a whole new septic tank...

151
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:36,223
...new plumbing, the works.
Cost you about 14.

152
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:38,298
- Hundred?
- Thousand.

153
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:42,063
You know what?
We'll buy the kids gas masks.

154
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,866
It's your party, pally,
but that methane is dangerous.

155
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,541
You boys best be careful.

156
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:54,940
- Phil.
- What? That wasn't me.

157
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,938
Okay, here's your lunch, sweetie.

158
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:05,985
It's a sugar-free, wheat-free,
gluten-free, tofu nugget.

159
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:10,265
You have your Sidekick with text,
GPS locator in case you get lost...

160
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:12,736
...and waterproof sunscreen,
in case it gets sunny...

161
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:15,740
...while it's still raining.
- Mother, it's day camp.

162
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:17,818
I'll be seven miles away.

163
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:20,023
And home before dinner.

164
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:21,666
Did you take your Xanax?

165
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,025
I don't wanna go to camp in the rain.

166
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,257
I wanna stay home
watching nudie flicks.

167
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:30,305
The brochure said there would be sun.
Please behave yourself.

168
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,345
And for the love of God,
try not to make anyone bleed.

169
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:35,896
Take your Dramamine now
before you get on the bus...

170
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,978
...then later if you ride a horse...

171
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,377
...or anything that bounces
or gently sways.

172
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:43,505
- What about my Pepto?
- Save that for lunch.

173
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,135
And your Beano,
in case you have a snack.

174
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:08,020
<i>It's another beautiful woodchuck day. </i>

175
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:16,062
Promise you'll put those games away
and try to be social this summer.

176
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:18,616
Die, alien scum, die.

177
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,026
Carl, please don't let the other kids
tease your brother.

178
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,185
What am I? Dr. Phil?

179
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:28,384
I've got nothing to work with here.

180
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,778
Archibald Lawrence Mapleton?

181
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:35,418
Call me, Mullet. Business up front,
party in the back, baby.

182
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:37,339
Juliette Stone?

183
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:39,577
Present.

184
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:43,586
Holy Hogwarts.

185
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:47,902
Watch the merchandise, dude.

186
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:11,304
- I still got it, huh?
- I can't hear! My ears!

187
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:19,544
Okay, this is it. Time to give them
a summer they'll never forget.

188
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:34,457
They won't forget that.

189
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:48,180
Nature walkers, lotion up.

190
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,978
Okay, Robin Hoods, gather around.

191
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:53,745
Everybody take a bow.

192
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:55,340
There you go.

193
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,418
There's enough for everyone.
There you go.

194
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:16,865
Hey, Romeo.
If you like her, go in that group.

195
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:20,702
No. That's okay.
I've only got to kill one more Orc.

196
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:24,462
Right. Kill your Orc, you dork.

197
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:27,539
Dad, I want to be
in the group with Max.

198
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:30,585
I'm older than these babies.
I should be in that group.

199
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,181
I didn't sign up to be with no skirts.

200
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:34,575
They got cooties.

201
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:36,226
There's no such thing as cooties.

202
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:39,220
It's simply a term used to express
age-appropriate discomfort...

203
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:41,184
...of those not of our gender.

204
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,261
Stop arguing.

205
00:16:57,987 --> 00:17:00,182
You wanted to accommodate children
of all ages.

206
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:02,258
Well, at this point,
we can't be too picky.

207
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:12,182
Look, here we have grass.
Some grass and a big rock.

208
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:13,939
How many more to go?

209
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,463
Everybody gather round. Get in here.

210
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:20,983
Can anyone tell me
what kind of tree this is?

211
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,056
An oak?

212
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:25,787
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

213
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:29,144
Look over here, some berries,
maybe a strawberry thing.

214
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,537
I wouldn't eat them, though.
Watch out.

215
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:35,700
Poison ivy. Keep moving, slowly,
behind the bush.

216
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,937
Come on, slowly. Don't touch it.

217
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:40,667
Careful, careful. Okay.

218
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,505
That would be a leaf.

219
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,538
Ready. Aim.

220
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:49,902
Wait. There's a bunny.

221
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,023
We can't shoot with a bunny
in the field.

222
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,257
He's way off to the side.
You'll never hit it.

223
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:56,987
Yes, we can. That's good eating.

224
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,375
No, it's not.

225
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:03,177
Wait. All right, kids, hang on.
Back up.

226
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:07,058
So the rebel Borg rogue vessel...

227
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,616
...circles around Barkon IV...

228
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,460
...loops over the <i>Enterprise</i>
and doubles back...

229
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,458
...through the space nebula.

230
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:23,061
We passed this tree twice already.

231
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,106
Because it's a very important tree
and I wanted to emphasise it.

232
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,666
We're not lost.

233
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:33,025
- Alligator.
- Calm down. Stop. Calm down.

234
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:35,860
Stop.

235
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:38,780
We don't have alligators
on the nature hike.

236
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:40,539
It's not that good a camp.

237
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:44,218
See, kids?
Everything's gonna be just fine.

238
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:45,422
Air varmint.

239
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:58,860
I appreciate that you kids
are such quick learners...

240
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:03,100
...but these knots are not supposed
to be used for evil.

241
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,306
See? Just a big, dumb empty log.

242
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:11,540
Bees. Scatter.

243
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:26,743
Now put two thumbs up.

244
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:29,341
You guys, two, three,
or four of you are out...

245
00:19:29,507 --> 00:19:31,543
...because I didn't say, "Simon says. "

246
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:33,459
All right, Simon Says.

247
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,819
Ben. Hey, Ben.

248
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,701
Simon says, "Wave at Daddy. "

249
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:45,905
Good concentration, son.
You know, because I'm not Simon.

250
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,818
Good job, Dale.

251
00:19:57,427 --> 00:20:00,783
Oh, no, so many are out right now,
I can't even count how many.

252
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,500
- Can I help you?
- Felix.

253
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,455
Simon Says. A classic.

254
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:17,466
I was showing the kids here...

255
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:19,299
...where the go-cart track will be...

256
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,459
...once you and your team of idiots
run your camp into the ground.

257
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,822
First of all, it's not for sale.

258
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:28,660
Yeah, well, from what I heard,
that may not be up to you.

259
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:32,020
Yeah, a little something
called foreclosure.

260
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,223
Axe coming down.

261
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,303
See all those kids
running around down there?

262
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,218
Does that look like
a business in trouble?

263
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:42,378
It's only day one, buddy boy.

264
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:46,426
Once all those kids see how much fun
we're having at Camp Canola...

265
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:49,499
...they'll be jumping ship
like harbour rats.

266
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:55,746
And to make matters worse...

267
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:59,900
...you will never be able
to beat the Chief in the Olympiad.

268
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,217
That's him. He's the Chief.

269
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,218
And you poop in your shorts.

270
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:06,776
Nice son you got there, Lance.

271
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:09,256
He ain't my kid. I hate kids.

272
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:15,497
First of all, there ain't gonna be
any Olympiad. And secondly...

273
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,465
...I care about building these kids up,
not tearing them down...

274
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,538
...with some futile attempt
at competition.

275
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:22,740
That's pathetic.

276
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,341
You won't last a month.

277
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:29,022
Yeah. Thirty-one days. Or 30.

278
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,576
Except for February,
which stands alone.

279
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:35,223
All right, let's go.

280
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,656
Dang, he looks familiar.

281
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:45,057
All right, Camp Canola.

282
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,025
Let's head out.

283
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,742
Wait. Oh, good Lord.

284
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:03,064
Watch and learn.

285
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:10,943
- Mullet. Come on.
- Hurry up.

286
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:13,575
I want candy.

287
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:40,341
Dale, make sure
you count them twice.

288
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:43,783
Everybody on the...
Hey, no fighting.

289
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:47,667
On the bus. Get on the bus.

290
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:54,099
Oh, thank God.

291
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:59,057
See? This is exactly
where I thought we'd come out.

292
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:02,424
Get down to the bus.
It'll be leaving any second.

293
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:04,498
I've gotta drop the kids off
at the pool.

294
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,656
We have a pool?

295
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:07,865
No.

296
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:12,862
This is the worst camp ever.

297
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:16,177
Thanks for coming.

298
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:20,697
No, no, Max.
All right, no, Max, Max.

299
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:25,621
Okay, off the bus.
Everybody off the bus.

300
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:29,662
Yes, off the bus. Okay. Okay. Relax.

301
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:32,940
What's wrong with him?

302
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:36,224
He was born with no sense of smell.

303
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,861
What's his problem?

304
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:41,666
- Mayhoffer's gonna blow.
- What?

305
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:59,065
<i>Phil, we got a situation here.
<i>I need help. </i>

306
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:02,742
<i>I need backup. I repeat, backup for... </i>

307
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:10,102
All right.

308
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:20,019
Code blue. Code blue, Phil.

309
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,542
- What else could go wrong?
- No, please...

310
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:45,776
I think we're gonna need
more toilet paper.

311
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,419
Baby...

312
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:58,102
...it's just not your area of expertise.

313
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,622
You need someone
with more outdoor experience.

314
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:02,903
Someone like your father.

315
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:04,216
You're gonna call Grandpa?

316
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:07,584
No. Mommy's just making a joke.

317
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:09,180
I don't need Buck.

318
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:12,657
Kids all over town are bathing
in tomato juice, thanks to you.

319
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:15,864
It was one lousy skunk
and a harmless methane explosion.

320
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:17,460
Your father's a military man.

321
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:20,664
You told me yourself Buck knows
everything about the outdoors.

322
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:23,421
Roughing it, managing troops,
survival skills.

323
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:26,784
Yeah, and he realises it
through anger, shaming, and criticism.

324
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:28,824
Here, baby, sponge yourself.

325
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,616
Look, I know that you two have had
your problems.

326
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:34,106
Problems? No.

327
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:37,259
Nothing I ever did was good enough,
including sports, school, work.

328
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:38,906
But other than that?

329
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:41,827
He could help,
and Ben would be thrilled to see him.

330
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:44,217
I think it's time you give him a chance.

331
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:48,175
Look, baby, this is my thing, okay?
I'll handle it.

332
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,384
Phil and I got special
camp consultants coming tomorrow.

333
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:53,663
It's a fresh start and a new day.

334
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:55,419
Consultants?

335
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,656
Yes.

336
00:25:56,827 --> 00:26:01,139
- It's all right here in our Idea Binders.
- That's for you.

337
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:03,867
You just trust us.

338
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:06,905
- Syl. Come to me.
- I'm right here.

339
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,659
Be with me, think with me.

340
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:11,102
We could have
this entire area carpeted.

341
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:12,859
Shag carpet.

342
00:26:13,027 --> 00:26:15,063
Like a child, a universe grows.

343
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,626
That was a waste of time.

344
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:25,779
Hey, don't worry.
When those 35 kids get off that bus...

345
00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:28,984
...we're gonna show them adventure,
Charlie and Phil style.

346
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:44,785
Okay. See, Phil, it's all we needed.
A new day, fresh start.

347
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:48,539
Way to go, Dad.

348
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,777
What?

349
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:58,617
That's all we got. The other parents
are demanding a full refund.

350
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:02,262
Let's go this way, guys.

351
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:11,139
We only got seven kids left, Phil.

352
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,138
There's no other way
to cover these bills.

353
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:14,979
We can't afford to hire consultants...

354
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:16,978
...much less make
the foreclosure payment.

355
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:20,981
We can't even afford to give refunds.
That money went back into repairs.

356
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:23,217
You're gonna have
to swallow your pride...

357
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,617
...and get a man in here
to help run this camp.

358
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:33,423
Historically,
the art of using troops is this:

359
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:36,784
When ten to the enemy's one,
surround them with tanks.

360
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,984
At five times the strength,
you attack with air strikes.

361
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:43,662
Napoleon: All manoeuvres were
on horseback.

362
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:46,864
Saladin: Camels...

363
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,217
Colonel here.

364
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:53,257
Just a sec.

365
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:55,942
Civilians, you're dismissed.

366
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,101
That's better. How can I help you?

367
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,781
No, no. No, the time is fine.

368
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:15,579
You don't say?

369
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:19,103
And that's how you treat
an acute poison ivy breakout.

370
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,265
I'd like to apologise to you guys
for letting you play...

371
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:25,099
...in what I thought was clover.

372
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:28,816
Jack, I wouldn't go number two
for a few weeks if I were you.

373
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:31,421
I think you used that "clover"
for toilet paper.

374
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,938
If you'd all sign these waivers...

375
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:37,337
...acknowledging you've been briefed
on safety...

376
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,146
- Here you go. Okay.
- Excuse me.

377
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:42,218
With the exception
of emancipated minors...

378
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,617
...I don't believe
that a personal injury waiver...

379
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:47,984
...with confidentiality clause,
executed by a child...

380
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:50,456
...is a legally binding document,
Uncle Phil.

381
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,737
It's a raid.

382
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,904
Camp Canola!

383
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:17,463
Get the flag.

384
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:41,663
I can use the second mortgage
on the house...

385
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:44,182
...to pay off the bills for the camp?

386
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:47,703
Great. No, Mr. Thumson,
I don't need you to come out here.

387
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:50,427
No, business is fine. It's just...

388
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:52,657
You know,
we have such a full house.

389
00:29:58,587 --> 00:30:00,498
Can I call you back?

390
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,344
What the heck is going on here?

391
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,902
Open your ear-holes, dweebers.

392
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:35,379
"We, the mighty troops of Fort Canola,
have braved hill and dale...

393
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,458
...so that we may find...

394
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,176
...who are the greatest warriors
in the land. "

395
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:46,379
No. No. No way.

396
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,219
You are way out of line, Lance.

397
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:49,945
Behold!

398
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,737
This spear of honour...

399
00:30:54,907 --> 00:30:59,059
...garnished with the flame of truth.

400
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,657
Now, I challenge ye...

401
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:07,582
...to the XLV Annual
Intercamp Olympiad.

402
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:12,544
That's the 37th Olympiad to you,
pea brain.

403
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:13,935
Forty-fifth.

404
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:17,338
I told you before, there isn't going
to be any competition.

405
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:22,456
Well, then let the onslaught continue.

406
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:50,779
Now's your chance.
Go say something.

407
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:56,857
Do you like World of Warcraft?

408
00:31:57,027 --> 00:31:58,142
World of what?

409
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:02,306
I'm a Level 40 Blood Elf Druid.

410
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:05,345
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

411
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:09,021
Goodbye.

412
00:32:09,187 --> 00:32:12,543
I like causing destruction,
not cleaning up after it.

413
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:16,222
Is that why you threw a paint grenade
at your own campmate during a raid?

414
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:20,221
What can I say?
War is hell, skunk-boy.

415
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:25,095
<i>Fight. Fight. Fight. </i>

416
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:27,542
<i>Fight. Fight. Fight. </i>

417
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:30,858
Cut it out. Stop it. Stop fighting.

418
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:34,138
A ten-hut.

419
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,465
I see this unit's morale is flagging.

420
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:43,187
There is only one solution for that.

421
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:46,305
All of those who are my grandson,
front and centre.

422
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:49,027
- Come here, you little peanut.
- Grandpa Buck.

423
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:52,540
Do you remember this manoeuvre?

424
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,299
Sneak attack at tickle point.

425
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:03,062
Everyone, this is my father,
Colonel Buck Hinton.

426
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:06,299
- Reporting for duty, corporal.
- Please don't call me that.

427
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,461
All right, then, private.

428
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:16,021
Gentlemen. Ladies.
What I just witnessed was a mutiny.

429
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:18,303
Among campers,
that is unacceptable...

430
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,981
...from this point forward.

431
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,656
Now...

432
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:24,818
...front and centre. Double time.

433
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:28,024
I'll make you soldiers
if it's the last thing I do.

434
00:33:28,187 --> 00:33:31,862
No, wait a minute. There is no mutiny.
Everything is under control.

435
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,301
This is not why I called you.

436
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:38,579
- Why the misconduct, soldier?
- We got raided by Camp Canola.

437
00:33:38,747 --> 00:33:41,784
- Yeah.
- Sneak attack, huh?

438
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:43,300
Well, I'm sorry, private.

439
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,139
We should be planning
a counterattack.

440
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:48,504
Meet force with force.
I say we hit them at nightfall.

441
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:51,420
- Yeah.
- No. No.

442
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:54,101
Driftwood Day Camp.

443
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,497
Hit them at 5,
when the sun's in their eyes.

444
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,100
Yeah.

445
00:33:58,267 --> 00:33:59,985
Okay, guys.

446
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,900
Guys, can you excuse us
for a minute?

447
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:08,143
This is not a boot camp. All right?

448
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:10,901
We're not looking for Colonel Hinton,
war games consultant.

449
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,786
We're looking for Colonel Hinton,
experienced team builder...

450
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:16,336
...slash King of the Outdoors.

451
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:18,941
We're not trying to turn these kids
into Marines.

452
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:23,099
What's wrong with being a Marine?

453
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:26,583
Maybe if you had enlisted...

454
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:30,786
...you could work yourself out of a jam
instead of calling in reinforcements.

455
00:34:30,947 --> 00:34:33,336
Listen. Yes, I do appreciate
your coming.

456
00:34:33,507 --> 00:34:34,906
Yes, we do need your help.

457
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:38,537
But we don't want to get into this thing
with Camp Canola.

458
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:41,663
- No war games?
- No.

459
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,101
Hand-to-hand combat?

460
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:48,063
- Guerrilla warfare?
- No war.

461
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:49,296
No war.

462
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:52,027
Just help us run Driftwood,
all right?

463
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:53,779
Can you follow those orders, Dad?

464
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,981
That's colonel to you, private.

465
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:01,666
Line up.

466
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:31,386
In through the nose.

467
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:34,425
Out through the mouth.

468
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,577
In through the nose.

469
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:43,904
Out through the mouth.

470
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,862
The samurai warrior meditates...

471
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:52,181
...to blend mind
and body into harmony.

472
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,584
Come here. Come to me.

473
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:04,739
Hey! Hey!

474
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:09,176
Hey, old man, what's with the séance
in the middle of our off-road track?

475
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:12,180
What? Get them out of here!

476
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:15,066
Get your kids out of here!
Get them out of here!

477
00:36:15,227 --> 00:36:17,457
Somebody's gonna get hurt!

478
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:22,941
Relax, General Depends.

479
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,297
Shouldn't you be
in some bingo game or something?

480
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,823
L-27. G-13.

481
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,501
All right, boys. Let's move them out.

482
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:37,024
- B-7.
- G-40.

483
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:39,098
That tears it.

484
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,427
Rules of engagement...

485
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:45,821
...been overruled.

486
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:58,579
There's the objective.
Anyone unclear on their role?

487
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:00,021
No, sir.

488
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:03,224
- Anyone wanna go home?
- No, sir.

489
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,539
Operation MoonPie is a go.

490
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:15,943
It's right up here.

491
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:19,296
You know, I've never been up here.

492
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:38,855
Help. Help. Come on, y'all.
Give me a lift. Come on, please.

493
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:43,698
Go, go.

494
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:58,146
Where is it? Where is it?
I know that loser from somewhere.

495
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:01,617
Where is it?

496
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:07,858
Jackpot.

497
00:38:10,907 --> 00:38:13,467
Charlie Hinton.

498
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:19,980
Can I help you?

499
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:22,422
- Hi, my name's Becca.
- I'm Juliette.

500
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:24,066
And we've come to offer you...

501
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,138
...the Driftwood
Olive Branch of Peace.

502
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:27,899
In exchange for our friendship...

503
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,262
...all we ask is
that you return our flag.

504
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:35,867
Did big bad Charlie send
his little bitty girls...

505
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:38,541
...to do his bidding for him, huh?

506
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,301
Let's put it this way:
Either you give it back...

507
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:43,583
...or we take it.

508
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:46,307
You and what army, Petunia?

509
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,226
You had to ask.

510
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,737
Ask what?

511
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:02,026
What the...?

512
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:10,976
Get him.

513
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:13,985
You're messing with Lance Warner.

514
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:23,218
Stuck.

515
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:35,502
Yes.

516
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:38,780
Hey, Warner.

517
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:46,857
- Yes.
- That's my boy.

518
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:49,336
Sound the alarm. Red alert.

519
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:52,863
We're under attack.
This is not a drill, people.

520
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:56,815
Everyone to your stations!
Security's been breached!

521
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:59,262
The perimeter's
been compromised!

522
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:01,497
Lock the gates! Call my dad!

523
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:07,903
Hey, Dale, you seen Buck?

524
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:10,103
Supposed to be back
with the kids an hour ago.

525
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:11,700
I wouldn't sweat it.

526
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:16,019
Your dad's like
the most responsible guy I ever met.

527
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,261
Yeah, you're probably right.

528
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:25,625
Get back here, you little rodents.

529
00:40:25,787 --> 00:40:27,015
Come on. Come on.

530
00:40:27,187 --> 00:40:31,738
No! No, no, no.
Give me my pants back.

531
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,022
Here's your diaper.

532
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:36,497
Clean yourself off.

533
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:39,660
Move out.

534
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:46,738
Let go. Get back here, you cowards.

535
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:49,944
No one messes with Lance Warner,
you hear me?

536
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:52,337
No one.

537
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,338
<i>G.I. Joe is turning red. </i>

538
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:17,338
<i>Someone farted on his head. </i>

539
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,384
<i>G.I. Joe is turning pink. </i>

540
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:21,299
<i>Someone puked in the kitchen sink. </i>

541
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:23,185
<i>G.I. Joe is turning white.

542
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:25,458
<i>The zippers on his pants</i>
<i>are really tight. </i>

543
00:41:25,627 --> 00:41:27,379
<i>G.I. Joe is turning blue.

544
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:29,458
<i>There are peanuts in his poo. </i>

545
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:31,743
Company, halt.

546
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,181
Where have you guys been?

547
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:35,781
Your nature hike was supposed
to be back an hour ago.

548
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:38,139
Present colours.

549
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:46,218
- You didn't?
- Yes, sir.

550
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:48,665
Robert, what happened
to your head?

551
00:41:48,827 --> 00:41:51,341
It's just a battle wound.

552
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:54,778
Dale, go get the first-aid kit.

553
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:57,745
You take these kids off our premises
without permission slips...

554
00:41:57,907 --> 00:41:59,386
...and bring them back like this?

555
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:01,021
Affirmative.

556
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:03,655
See, this is exactly the thing
I was afraid of.

557
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:07,098
We restored our honour, Dad.
It was just...

558
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:14,738
What kind of insane militant
nut factory you running here, huh?

559
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,616
Huh, Charlie Hinton?
Driftwood Class of '77.

560
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:21,017
- That's right, I know who you are.
- Listen, Lance.

561
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:22,939
I'm really sorry about this.
In fact...

562
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,985
...my father and I were just about
to have a discussion about it.

563
00:42:26,147 --> 00:42:28,502
This is your father?

564
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:32,265
Oh, this is classic. Oh, sure.

565
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,463
The chicken's come home
to roost, huh?

566
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:37,585
Now I know why you don't want
to compete in the Olympiad.

567
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:39,897
You're afraid of getting
your butt kicked again...

568
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,785
...in front of Lieutenant Prune Juice.

569
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:43,016
Colonel.

570
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:45,257
Oh, Colonel. Sorry.

571
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:49,136
Look, Lance, I'm just trying to teach
these kids about sportsmanship.

572
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:53,505
No, the only thing you can teach
these kids is how to lose.

573
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:55,826
Or have you forgotten?

574
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:59,861
"Daddy. Look at me.

575
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:10,941
I'm a failure. "

576
00:43:15,507 --> 00:43:18,783
You know why my parents bought
Camp Canola for me?

577
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:20,175
No, why?

578
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,225
Because that summer
when I kicked your butt...

579
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:26,782
...that was the best moment
of my life.

580
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:30,098
And now, every day when I wake up,
I get to live that dream.

581
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:32,542
And it is fantastic.

582
00:43:32,707 --> 00:43:34,777
Peaked when you were 11,
did you, Lance?

583
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:37,142
See, I get it, Charlie.

584
00:43:37,307 --> 00:43:40,697
You don't want your kid
to end up a loser like you.

585
00:43:42,147 --> 00:43:44,217
Like father, like son.

586
00:43:47,987 --> 00:43:49,978
Oh, sure. No, that's cool.
You walk away.

587
00:43:50,147 --> 00:43:52,217
Yeah, because refusing to compete...

588
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:53,945
...just proves to the community...

589
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:56,063
...which camp they should send
their kids to.

590
00:43:56,227 --> 00:43:58,422
Mine.

591
00:43:58,907 --> 00:44:00,625
Adiós.

592
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,787
What I'd really like to do
is kick your butt.

593
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:12,823
Being as we're trying to set
a good example here, mister...

594
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:15,103
...you got yourself an Olympiad.

595
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:16,985
Yeah!

596
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:20,221
Fantastic.

597
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:27,346
Yeah.

598
00:44:28,387 --> 00:44:30,105
Good, good job.

599
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,780
The great Julius Caesar
once said...

600
00:44:31,947 --> 00:44:34,939
You were way out of line
with what you did today.

601
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:37,667
If we do this, we do it my way.
You got it?

602
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:42,265
- Affirmative.
- Good.

603
00:44:42,427 --> 00:44:45,817
Now. What do you think
we should do?

604
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:50,897
A sleepover?

605
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,978
I thought the whole purpose
of day camp...

606
00:44:53,147 --> 00:44:55,707
...was sending the kids home
at the end of the day.

607
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:58,142
It was your idea to get
my father involved.

608
00:44:58,307 --> 00:45:00,662
According to Buck,
the best way to build team unity...

609
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:04,183
...is to put the kids in a new situation
where they have to work together...

610
00:45:04,347 --> 00:45:05,496
...to overcome stuff.

611
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:09,785
Well, I think someone wants
to impress his own father.

612
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:13,817
Listen, this Olympiad is gonna
be good for business.

613
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:16,820
Once those Canola parents see
how well our kids work together...

614
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:18,625
...we might drum up new customers.

615
00:45:18,787 --> 00:45:21,142
If you think parents
are gonna switch camps...

616
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:24,344
...based off of wins
some silly events...

617
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:29,299
Mrs. Hinton?
I'm Edward Thumson from the bank.

618
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:36,063
Yes, I'm aware of who you are,
but what are you doing in my house?

619
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:38,582
Is that real Tiffany crystal?

620
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:41,026
It is standard procedure to do...

621
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:43,257
...a pre-inventory
prior to the foreclosure.

622
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:46,146
But the first instalment is not due
until next week.

623
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:48,184
True. But with only six campers...

624
00:45:48,387 --> 00:45:54,098
...it is mathematically impossible for...
- Actually, there's seven campers.

625
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:58,101
- What's going on?
- Oh, I'll tell you what's going on.

626
00:45:58,267 --> 00:46:00,178
We overextended ourselves
with the camp.

627
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,303
Now strange men are touching
the furniture...

628
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:03,946
...messing with my mama's vase...

629
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:06,462
...Mr. Thumson's threatening
to take my house away.

630
00:46:06,627 --> 00:46:08,777
Okay, okay.

631
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:10,903
- I know what I gotta do.
- What?

632
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:13,137
- I'll sell the camp.
- Listen to me.

633
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,104
If you believe by winning
this Olympiad...

634
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:16,985
...more kids will come to the camp...

635
00:46:17,147 --> 00:46:19,661
...then you go kick
some Lance Warner butt.

636
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:28,339
Come on. Come on, soldier.

637
00:47:36,027 --> 00:47:37,301
Yes.

638
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:40,186
Ben! Hey!

639
00:48:18,587 --> 00:48:21,465
Come on, son.

640
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:23,538
- I know the song.
- Well, what?

641
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:26,096
You don't like being
in the support vehicle with me...

642
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:29,418
...instead of out there with poison ivy,
rocks and whatnot? Bugs.

643
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:34,422
It's supposed to be a hike.
I look like a goober.

644
00:48:34,587 --> 00:48:38,262
Okay. You're right.

645
00:48:41,467 --> 00:48:42,695
Oh, look at her.

646
00:48:43,867 --> 00:48:47,098
She even puts on bug spray
like an angel.

647
00:48:47,267 --> 00:48:50,577
You're pathetic. Go walk with her.
Get your groove on, dude.

648
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:52,977
What makes you such an expert?
You're only 6.

649
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:56,822
I know I won't spend
my best years buried in video games.

650
00:48:56,987 --> 00:48:59,262
Shut up. Don't make...

651
00:49:03,587 --> 00:49:05,100
Here, buddy.

652
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:09,344
Stop it. Stop it.

653
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:14,341
Hey, Billy? What's going on?

654
00:49:14,507 --> 00:49:15,940
Nothing.

655
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:18,496
No wet willies to dish out?

656
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,976
Maybe you could switch over
to the purple nurple.

657
00:49:21,147 --> 00:49:23,820
No, I already gave one to Mayhoffer.

658
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:28,139
It's just... I don't like sleepovers.
That's all.

659
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:29,899
And why is that?

660
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:35,746
Come on, Billy, you can always trust
a fat guy. I won't tell anybody.

661
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:38,740
Cross my heart, hope to diet.

662
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:42,784
- I sometimes wet the bed.
- What?

663
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,578
I sometimes wet the bed.

664
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:50,462
You know what?

665
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:52,902
I had the same problem
till I was darn near 10.

666
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:56,059
Really? What did you do
at sleepovers?

667
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,502
An excellent question,
my young friend.

668
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,578
I think you'll be intrigued
by the answer.

669
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:09,058
Get that equipment up, Brown.

670
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:11,104
This is dumb.
Why we gotta walk so far?

671
00:50:11,267 --> 00:50:13,417
Far? Halt.

672
00:50:13,587 --> 00:50:15,703
Now you listen up, hippie-hair.

673
00:50:15,867 --> 00:50:17,983
How are you gonna compete
against Camp Canola...

674
00:50:18,147 --> 00:50:20,217
...tomorrow morning
with that kind of attitude?

675
00:50:21,347 --> 00:50:24,783
We have 12 events staring at us
dead in the eye.

676
00:50:24,947 --> 00:50:26,938
We have got to toughen up.

677
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,782
When I was your age, I used to march
six miles into the woods...

678
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:34,701
...just to spend the night alone
in a tree. Focus on a goal.

679
00:50:37,187 --> 00:50:39,417
I used to put rocks in my backpack...

680
00:50:39,587 --> 00:50:41,657
...just to get stronger.

681
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:45,342
That's how you grow up to be a man.
Ain't that right, Ben?

682
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:47,737
All right. Let's head out.

683
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:50,137
Forward, march.

684
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,578
Hey, Ben.
What are you doing there, son?

685
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:01,339
Nothing.

686
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:15,419
I'm so full.

687
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:19,577
I'm fuller than you.

688
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:23,896
No one's as full as me.

689
00:51:26,307 --> 00:51:29,822
But now I've got room for dessert.
Who wants S'mores?

690
00:51:33,347 --> 00:51:34,905
Anything I can help you with?

691
00:51:35,907 --> 00:51:38,137
Can't find the chocolate
or the marshmallows.

692
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:41,026
What are you talking about?
They're in my bag.

693
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:45,782
Who wants chocolate?

694
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:50,297
What are we gonna roast?

695
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:09,103
Nice job, Hinton.
Your dad is such a schwing.

696
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:11,417
I gotta roast something
with a pit in it.

697
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:14,465
Shut up. I don't like it
any more than you do.

698
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:15,855
It's not my fault.

699
00:52:19,147 --> 00:52:20,865
Dude, trust me.

700
00:52:21,027 --> 00:52:25,020
A star-filled sky,
the warm glow of a fire...

701
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:28,065
She'll be like Silly Putty
in your hands.

702
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:30,946
What makes you such an expert?

703
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,826
Look, you know how grownups
are always saying...

704
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:36,057
...they wish they knew then
what they know now?

705
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:39,344
- Yeah.
- Well, I know.

706
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:42,783
How are we ever gonna beat Canola
with runts like you on our team?

707
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:48,146
Yeah. What you gonna do, tiny?
Bang your pan until they surrender?

708
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:56,785
I think I burned my banana.

709
00:53:03,587 --> 00:53:05,498
- Hello.
- Hey.

710
00:53:06,467 --> 00:53:08,617
How are you doing
this fine evening?

711
00:53:08,787 --> 00:53:12,143
Pretty good. Never roasted
a pear before, but it smells good.

712
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:16,220
Yes, smells are good,
and you, too, smell, Juliette.

713
00:53:16,387 --> 00:53:18,696
I mean, things smell...

714
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:21,825
I mean, good, you smell.

715
00:53:21,987 --> 00:53:25,457
Sorry, it must have been
from the hike, because...

716
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:27,583
No, no, I mean...

717
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:30,576
It's a nice night.

718
00:53:30,747 --> 00:53:34,456
Starry skies, a warm fire.

719
00:53:34,627 --> 00:53:36,538
Good food.

720
00:53:44,227 --> 00:53:45,546
Idiot.

721
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:53,422
Great place you got there.
What's the mortgage like?

722
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:54,576
What are you doing?

723
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:56,658
Sleeping in a hollowed-out log
or something?

724
00:53:56,827 --> 00:53:59,102
It's called camping, private.
You should try it.

725
00:53:59,267 --> 00:54:01,064
Yes, right.

726
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:06,737
Jack, I think that banana is about
as cooked as it's gonna get there.

727
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:09,341
It's so slimy.

728
00:54:09,507 --> 00:54:12,021
No, it's roasting.
It's supposed to bring out the flavour.

729
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:15,256
Try it. You'll like it, I promise.

730
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:21,017
Good, right?

731
00:54:28,427 --> 00:54:29,826
No!

732
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:34,986
I'm done with that.

733
00:54:35,587 --> 00:54:37,418
That's nasty.

734
00:54:38,227 --> 00:54:40,138
You feel better?

735
00:55:09,587 --> 00:55:12,147
Sure you're gonna need that, son?

736
00:55:15,507 --> 00:55:18,704
Good Lord's filling the sky
with a million nightlights.

737
00:55:19,427 --> 00:55:20,496
Just for you.

738
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:29,624
Don't know why you got your panties
in a wad tonight, Mayhoffer.

739
00:55:29,787 --> 00:55:32,665
We're all getting butt spackled
tomorrow anyways.

740
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:34,306
What are you talking about?

741
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:37,664
You don't seriously think we can beat
those rich Canola kids?

742
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:39,499
Yeah, they're gonna cream us.

743
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,976
Cream? Cream is for coffee.

744
00:55:43,547 --> 00:55:45,663
Okay. Listen up, troops.

745
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:50,618
It's come to my attention some of you
don't believe we can win tomorrow.

746
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:52,815
Okay.

747
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:57,026
Maybe they have fancy equipment.
Gold-plated toilet paper.

748
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,542
But we got something
those snotty-nosed...

749
00:55:59,707 --> 00:56:01,663
...silver-spoon brats will never have.

750
00:56:01,827 --> 00:56:04,944
- Do you want to know what that is?
- Lice?

751
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,416
Driftwood spirit.

752
00:56:07,587 --> 00:56:09,305
I didn't think you guys had it...

753
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,822
...but the way you pulled yourselves
together today...

754
00:56:11,987 --> 00:56:14,581
...made me prouder
than any platoon I've ever led.

755
00:56:16,387 --> 00:56:18,776
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Nonsense.

756
00:56:18,947 --> 00:56:21,620
You couldn't have done it
without this.

757
00:56:21,787 --> 00:56:25,336
Because it's Driftwood Camp spirit
that links us all together...

758
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,338
...and makes it all possible.

759
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:31,582
You're not just a bunch of kids
that came together in camp.

760
00:56:31,747 --> 00:56:34,580
You're a team. Team.

761
00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:36,942
- Team.
- Team.

762
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:38,301
- Team.
- Team.

763
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:41,186
<i>Team, team, team!</i>

764
00:56:41,347 --> 00:56:42,575
And listen, team.

765
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:46,296
Tomorrow, you're gonna take
those lobster-eating...

766
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:47,502
Yeah!

767
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,976
...those Humvee-driving...
- Yeah!

768
00:56:50,147 --> 00:56:53,025
...Canola cretins and you're gonna
throw them in the dumper.

769
00:56:53,187 --> 00:56:55,621
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

770
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:58,706
Yeah!

771
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:02,297
You don't think you're setting them up
for a pretty big letdown?

772
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:05,501
Well, in order to win the battle...

773
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:09,023
...one must first believe
in the success of the mission.

774
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:12,224
It's been a long time
since you've been in battle.

775
00:57:13,187 --> 00:57:15,496
A minor technicality.

776
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:18,465
Hey, have you guys seen Ben?
I can't find him.

777
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:22,297
- Ben?
- Ben?

778
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:23,900
- Ben!
- Ben?

779
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:27,864
- Ben!
- Are you in there?

780
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,056
- Ben.
- Come out.

781
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:45,337
Guys, I found him.

782
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:46,781
Ben.

783
00:57:46,947 --> 00:57:50,940
Ben, get down from there.
What are you doing?

784
00:57:51,107 --> 00:57:55,225
Get down. Where you been, man?
We been looking all over for you.

785
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:58,777
Listen, don't ever scare me
like that again, you hear me?

786
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:03,099
I'm okay. I just wanted to be
like Grandpa, that's all.

787
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:06,464
So you wandered off by yourself?
You know how dangerous that is?

788
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:09,187
Grandpa said
it's what made him tough...

789
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:11,907
...so I thought it'd do
the same for me.

790
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:13,659
What?

791
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:18,461
All right, guys, listen up.
Listen to me.

792
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:21,141
Let me tell you something
about being tough, okay?

793
00:58:21,307 --> 00:58:23,423
Being tough doesn't necessarily
make you a hero.

794
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:28,058
Sometimes tough people grow up
to be arrogant, selfish and stubborn.

795
00:58:28,227 --> 00:58:30,297
You guys just need to be yourselves.

796
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:32,219
And know that
by being yourselves...

797
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,298
...you're gonna be winners,
no matter what.

798
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:36,458
Even if we choke like you?

799
00:58:36,627 --> 00:58:39,539
Especially if you choke like me.

800
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:40,696
Listen.

801
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:44,223
I want you guys to grow up
to be kind and caring...

802
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,776
...and accepting of people.

803
00:58:46,947 --> 00:58:49,620
Even if they make mistakes.

804
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:53,826
So, Ben,
don't try to be so tough, okay?

805
00:58:53,987 --> 00:58:57,184
Just try to be your best.
That's all that matters.

806
00:58:57,347 --> 00:58:58,462
- Okay.
- Okay?

807
00:58:58,627 --> 00:58:59,821
Okay.

808
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:04,306
Okay, my little Olympians,
time to rest up for the big day.

809
00:59:04,467 --> 00:59:06,901
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.

810
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,058
Calling Buck, man,
what was I thinking?

811
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:14,138
It's the only way he knows, Charlie.

812
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:17,185
If that means him jeopardising
any more kids, he can keep it.

813
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:20,862
I don't want Ben to grow up
to be anything like my father.

814
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:24,377
Let's go.

815
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:54,140
Shoot.

816
01:00:05,347 --> 01:00:08,384
What the heck is...? Oh, you nasty...

817
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:13,177
This is a mistake.

818
01:00:40,227 --> 01:00:42,138
Wait for me.

819
01:00:49,027 --> 01:00:52,861
Yes. It worked. I'm dry.

820
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:54,938
See? Told you, Billy.

821
01:00:55,107 --> 01:00:57,496
You always fool
the bed-wetting goblins...

822
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,578
...if you sleep in your day clothes.

823
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:01,658
Go play with the kids.

824
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:24,217
Oh, my neck. I'm so cold.

825
01:01:24,387 --> 01:01:26,537
Feel like a human pincushion.

826
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:30,461
- Relax, Charlie. Look around.
- Oh, thank you.

827
01:01:33,347 --> 01:01:35,577
Would you look at that?

828
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:37,817
They're running around,
having a good time.

829
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:41,821
Oh, Buck's gonna go on and on
about how he was right...

830
01:01:41,987 --> 01:01:44,706
...and I'm way too overprotective.

831
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,427
Buck's not gonna go on and on
about anything.

832
01:01:47,587 --> 01:01:49,976
I haven't seen him all morning.

833
01:02:04,227 --> 01:02:07,264
Sign up for camp, please?
Driftwood?

834
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:09,987
Hey, do you wanna sign up...? No?

835
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:13,420
Well, as you can tell, we've obviously
destroyed their camp...

836
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:14,940
...over the last couple years.

837
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:18,622
I'm thinking, once we kick
Driftwood's butt one more time...

838
01:02:18,787 --> 01:02:20,823
...this is where
the new hardware goes.

839
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,899
What do you say?
It's gonna be great.

840
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:26,937
Hey, Chuck E. Cheese!

841
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:29,339
Getting a little nervous?

842
01:02:30,307 --> 01:02:32,662
Let me give you the 411
on the day's events.

843
01:02:32,827 --> 01:02:34,101
Okay.

844
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:38,146
The Olympiad starts.
Your team sucks. You lose.

845
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:39,899
The end.

846
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,657
Good luck, Lance.

847
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:46,939
I don't need luck.

848
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:57,181
Okay, I'll take it from here.

849
01:02:59,427 --> 01:03:02,100
Forfeit! I forfeit!

850
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:07,101
- Have you seen Grandpa Buck?
- Col. Buck has been gone a long time.

851
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:11,419
Guys, I'm sure he'll be here.
Okay, so just reach to the left.

852
01:03:11,707 --> 01:03:12,696
Stretch.

853
01:03:14,547 --> 01:03:17,505
No news yet on Buck.
Margaret's driving all over town.

854
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:19,737
But I did find this in your office.

855
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:22,467
"Charlie, Uncle Sam called
about another job...

856
01:03:22,627 --> 01:03:25,619
...which is just as well, seeing
as things aren't working out here.

857
01:03:25,787 --> 01:03:27,903
Your tough Colonel Buck. "

858
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:30,422
- I'll keep looking.
- Okay.

859
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:32,703
Is that from Grandpa?

860
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:36,377
Yes. Yes, it is.

861
01:03:36,547 --> 01:03:39,220
He's not coming back?

862
01:03:39,387 --> 01:03:41,582
Well, no.

863
01:03:41,747 --> 01:03:44,341
He's the one that showed us
how to do everything.

864
01:03:44,507 --> 01:03:46,896
We're gonna get whupped.
I don't get whupped.

865
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:48,386
I do the whupping.

866
01:03:48,547 --> 01:03:50,936
We're doomed. Doomed, I tell you.

867
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,699
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

868
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:56,223
Just because Buck got called away
to serve his country last night...

869
01:03:56,387 --> 01:03:59,743
...doesn't mean we take everything
he taught us and just let it go to waste.

870
01:04:00,867 --> 01:04:03,665
- He deserted us.
- Without so much as a "see you. "

871
01:04:03,827 --> 01:04:07,740
No, no, no. He didn't.
It's here in the letter, listen.

872
01:04:07,907 --> 01:04:10,626
"Dear Ben, Max, Juliette, Robert...

873
01:04:10,787 --> 01:04:14,860
...Carl, Jack, Becca, Billy,
and Mullet:

874
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:17,939
Sorry to leave in the night
without even saying, 'See you'...

875
01:04:18,107 --> 01:04:21,338
...but it's important
that you don't panic.

876
01:04:21,507 --> 01:04:24,544
The 103rd Airborne is staging
manoeuvres tonight...

877
01:04:24,707 --> 01:04:28,985
...and let's just say they could learn
something about teamwork from you. "

878
01:04:29,147 --> 01:04:32,219
The 103rd was retired
after World War II.

879
01:04:32,387 --> 01:04:34,537
Tell you what?
They're bringing it back.

880
01:04:34,707 --> 01:04:37,938
- We can't do this without Buck.
- Yeah.

881
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:41,019
Sure we can. You know what?
He would've wanted it that way.

882
01:04:41,187 --> 01:04:43,098
You know why?
Because we're a family.

883
01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:46,384
We'll pull each other up,
because that's what families do.

884
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:49,664
If family's so important,
why'd Grandpa Buck leave?

885
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:51,579
Yeah.

886
01:05:09,107 --> 01:05:11,905
- Going that well, huh?
- Best day of my life.

887
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,427
Well, Ben seems upset
about Buck leaving.

888
01:05:16,227 --> 01:05:17,501
Yeah.

889
01:05:18,627 --> 01:05:22,779
You know why grandkids
and grandparents get along so well?

890
01:05:22,947 --> 01:05:25,256
They're united by a common enemy.

891
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:28,219
Makes sense.

892
01:05:29,347 --> 01:05:33,659
I'm saying, if you and Buck could unite
around each other's strengths...

893
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:36,182
...Ben could have
the best of both worlds.

894
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,986
Go get them, coach. For all of us.

895
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:53,021
Good news.
Found this in Buck's cabin.

896
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:59,424
I'll watch after the kids.
You go make things right.

897
01:05:59,587 --> 01:06:01,179
Thanks.

898
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:45,987
You missed your train.

899
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,505
I missed a train.

900
01:06:49,987 --> 01:06:52,376
Haven't really decided
which one I'm getting on yet.

901
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:56,662
I thought you had
to be back for manoeuvres.

902
01:06:56,867 --> 01:07:00,064
That's true, but next year.

903
01:07:00,547 --> 01:07:03,584
That's about as often
as they let a broke-down retiree...

904
01:07:03,747 --> 01:07:05,817
...come out and play
with the reservists.

905
01:07:08,867 --> 01:07:10,744
"Retiree. "

906
01:07:14,307 --> 01:07:16,696
About the only action
I get these days...

907
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:19,586
...is when college students
are doing...

908
01:07:19,747 --> 01:07:22,056
...research papers
on military history.

909
01:07:26,947 --> 01:07:28,380
So...

910
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:31,744
...you abandoned your post
this morning.

911
01:07:31,907 --> 01:07:34,626
Good soldier knows
when he's in hostile territory.

912
01:07:35,707 --> 01:07:38,426
You heard me last night, didn't you?

913
01:07:38,747 --> 01:07:42,740
I guess I've had a few things
on my mind over the last...

914
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:45,102
...30 years or so.

915
01:07:45,947 --> 01:07:48,541
I didn't even know you felt that way.

916
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,427
Strange, getting older.

917
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:59,703
Easier remembering things
the way you wish they were.

918
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:06,781
I want you to know I'm proud
of the man you've become.

919
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:11,863
The way you make adjustments
in the field...

920
01:08:12,027 --> 01:08:15,383
...like opening a day care centre
when you lost your job.

921
01:08:18,747 --> 01:08:20,658
Me, I wouldn't be able to do that.

922
01:08:23,587 --> 01:08:26,147
I've always needed more structure.

923
01:08:30,427 --> 01:08:35,057
I'm far from perfect, believe me.
Far from it.

924
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:43,256
I know one thing though,
those kids are gonna be crushed...

925
01:08:43,427 --> 01:08:47,102
...unless your leathery old butt
comes back.

926
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,385
Do you smell gasoline?

927
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:35,906
That's right.

928
01:09:41,907 --> 01:09:46,139
Minor setback, people.
We'll get them in the next event.

929
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,140
Wrestling?
Have you seen Max wrestle?

930
01:09:49,307 --> 01:09:51,218
He's right. I suck.

931
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:55,665
Yeah. And that Canola guy's
hairier than my grandmother's mole.

932
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:56,816
We're stewed.

933
01:09:56,987 --> 01:09:59,262
Can't we just go home?
This is embarrassing.

934
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:01,895
No one's going anywhere
until we win this thing.

935
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:05,298
- Grandpa Buck.
- Yay.

936
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:08,664
Okay. Hands in, soldiers.

937
01:10:12,787 --> 01:10:15,665
<i>It's another beautiful woodchuck day. </i>

938
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:22,101
I knew you'd come back, Grandpa.
We couldn't do this without you.

939
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:25,339
That's where you're wrong.
Your dad is the hero.

940
01:10:25,507 --> 01:10:26,496
My dad?

941
01:10:29,787 --> 01:10:32,779
Don't you realise he did
all this just for you?

942
01:10:33,787 --> 01:10:36,506
You're pretty lucky
to have Charlie Hinton...

943
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:38,897
...as a father.

944
01:10:39,507 --> 01:10:42,579
He's a better soldier than I'll ever be.

945
01:10:43,227 --> 01:10:45,104
I could never run a camp
like he can...

946
01:10:45,267 --> 01:10:47,656
...or watch over you
and your mom like he does.

947
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:51,384
He may be a little overprotective...

948
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,619
...but it's only because he loves you
so much.

949
01:11:01,947 --> 01:11:05,906
- Colonel, we've got a problem.
- Yeah, dude.

950
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:08,058
What's the situation on the ground,
soldiers?

951
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:11,742
My calculations suggest
they've cheated in nearly every event.

952
01:11:13,027 --> 01:11:14,938
Cheaters, huh?

953
01:11:15,747 --> 01:11:16,975
Well...

954
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:20,617
...the only way to beat cheaters
is by outsmarting them.

955
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:23,420
I've got an idea.

956
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:26,056
Okay. Okay, okay.

957
01:11:26,267 --> 01:11:29,339
First, we're gonna need the skunk.

958
01:11:29,507 --> 01:11:33,295
Here we go. Come on, good D,
thattaway.

959
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:35,697
Thattaboy. There we go.

960
01:11:35,867 --> 01:11:38,540
Ref, come on, man. I'm growing old.

961
01:11:40,507 --> 01:11:41,986
Look, here he comes.

962
01:12:31,227 --> 01:12:33,183
Ref. Substitution.

963
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:16,457
Good job, Robert. Good job.

964
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:18,936
Yeah, thattaway, purple.
There we go, yeah.

965
01:14:27,267 --> 01:14:30,464
That's too bad, Driftwood.
That's tough luck.

966
01:14:30,627 --> 01:14:34,176
Good hands, though, kid.
Good hands.

967
01:14:36,707 --> 01:14:41,223
We've got a sharpshooter.
We gotta do something.

968
01:14:42,747 --> 01:14:45,307
Give me a balloon.

969
01:14:46,587 --> 01:14:50,262
Billy? The water pump's over there.

970
01:14:50,427 --> 01:14:53,783
No, I'm not filling it with water.

971
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:58,896
I've been holding this in all night.

972
01:15:06,427 --> 01:15:09,658
You shouldn't pick on kids
smaller than you.

973
01:15:12,547 --> 01:15:14,902
Yeah. Good catch. Good catch.

974
01:15:15,067 --> 01:15:18,616
It's pee! It's pee! It's pee!

975
01:15:18,787 --> 01:15:22,063
It's pee! Mom, it's pee!

976
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:25,502
Yes!

977
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:33,622
We're the tiebreaker.
We're gonna get the tiebreaker.

978
01:15:36,227 --> 01:15:40,300
<i>It's another beautiful woodchuck day. </i>

979
01:15:46,427 --> 01:15:48,497
Suck it up. Let's go.

980
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:51,545
Jeez, embarrassing.

981
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:59,547
Okay, let's go get them.
Remember what we talked about.

982
01:15:59,707 --> 01:16:02,301
We need this one.
We need this one.

983
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:05,022
That look familiar, Charlie?

984
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:07,860
You lose this,
it's déjà vu all over again.

985
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:11,417
Yeah, well, I got my best athlete here,
waiting to change history.

986
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:13,259
Let's go, buddy, come on.

987
01:16:14,587 --> 01:16:15,736
You okay?

988
01:16:15,907 --> 01:16:20,025
I twisted my ankle when I fell.
I could shoot the arrow fine, but...

989
01:16:20,187 --> 01:16:24,226
- But can you climb?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

990
01:16:24,387 --> 01:16:26,264
You can forfeit, Charlie, if you like.

991
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:29,578
No, no, that's okay.
Who's our best climber?

992
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:39,580
- I can do it, Dad.
- All right. Come on, son.

993
01:16:41,467 --> 01:16:44,140
You're gonna race that kid.
That's gonna be tough, huh?

994
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:46,741
- Yeah, real tough.
- Like father, like son, huh?

995
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:48,545
Don't listen to him. Come on.

996
01:16:48,707 --> 01:16:50,743
All right. Come on, let's go.

997
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:52,818
- All right.
- Go get him.

998
01:16:52,987 --> 01:16:55,547
Okay, Ben, listen to me.

999
01:16:55,707 --> 01:16:57,777
Whatever you do...

1000
01:16:58,107 --> 01:17:01,304
...don't drop the baton, okay?

1001
01:17:02,907 --> 01:17:04,499
Ben.

1002
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:07,386
Just enjoy it.

1003
01:17:13,827 --> 01:17:15,499
Okay, here it comes.

1004
01:17:15,707 --> 01:17:18,426
All right, focus. Here we go.

1005
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:20,620
Come on, Ben.

1006
01:17:39,107 --> 01:17:40,301
Go get him.

1007
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:42,738
- Go Ben!
- Go Ben!

1008
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:47,824
- Come on. Get up there.
- Come on, Ben.

1009
01:17:47,987 --> 01:17:51,423
- Get them little legs going.
- Come on, Ben.

1010
01:17:51,587 --> 01:17:52,702
Go, Ben.

1011
01:17:53,347 --> 01:17:55,383
Come on, Ben.

1012
01:18:01,827 --> 01:18:03,818
It's okay. It's okay, son.

1013
01:18:04,027 --> 01:18:06,905
I told you, you're a loser,
just like your old man.

1014
01:18:07,067 --> 01:18:08,785
You're not a loser, Ben.

1015
01:18:08,947 --> 01:18:12,622
He greased the wall. He's cheating.

1016
01:18:13,307 --> 01:18:16,936
No, don't listen to her.
She's a compulsive liar.

1017
01:18:17,107 --> 01:18:19,496
And she steals.

1018
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:23,262
- You cheated.
- You're a cheater. You're a cheater.

1019
01:18:23,427 --> 01:18:27,215
Canola cheats. He's cheating.
He's a cheater.

1020
01:18:27,387 --> 01:18:30,902
He's a cheater. Canola cheats.
He's a cheater!

1021
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:34,742
Ben, no, no. Get down from there.
That's dangerous, Ben.

1022
01:18:34,907 --> 01:18:37,819
Ben. Please, please, Ben.
Ben, get down from there.

1023
01:18:38,907 --> 01:18:41,296
No, no, that's dangerous.
Ben, that's dangerous.

1024
01:18:43,227 --> 01:18:44,785
Pounce, Bobby J. Here we go.

1025
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:46,700
Up that wall.

1026
01:18:49,907 --> 01:18:51,260
Bobby J, go, go, go.

1027
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:52,940
Go!

1028
01:19:08,667 --> 01:19:11,420
That's my baby. That is my...
That's my baby. Yeah!

1029
01:19:11,587 --> 01:19:15,023
Oh, whoa, hey, what...? Hey.
All right, Bobby J, come here.

1030
01:19:15,187 --> 01:19:16,984
- Come here, buddy.
- I did it, Daddy.

1031
01:19:17,147 --> 01:19:20,298
- I know it, buddy.
- I love you, Dad.

1032
01:19:21,307 --> 01:19:25,346
I love you too, son.
I love you too, you crazy kid.

1033
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:27,065
You call that Canola?

1034
01:19:27,227 --> 01:19:29,616
That was embarrassing.
What are you, a moron?

1035
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:31,664
Moron? You're the moron.

1036
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:38,897
Wall coming down.

1037
01:19:43,827 --> 01:19:47,581
That's for telling everyone
you're not my dad.

1038
01:19:47,747 --> 01:19:49,783
I'm so excited. I'm so excited.

1039
01:19:49,947 --> 01:19:53,019
Let's go tell my mom.
She's here to pick me up.

1040
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:56,020
You were really great
in the Egg Relay.

1041
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:03,655
What'd I tell you?
Chicks love gold medallists.

1042
01:20:03,827 --> 01:20:06,102
Teach me everything you know.

1043
01:20:06,267 --> 01:20:09,816
Well, first you got a bird,
and then you got a bee.

1044
01:20:13,867 --> 01:20:15,698
Why?

1045
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:18,062
Why?

1046
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:23,100
Okay.

1047
01:20:23,267 --> 01:20:25,622
- Mr. Hinton?
- Hi.

1048
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,938
All the parents think
Camp Canola may not set...

1049
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:30,904
...the best example for our children.

1050
01:20:31,067 --> 01:20:33,945
And so, if it's not
too short of notice...

1051
01:20:34,107 --> 01:20:37,622
...we'd like our kids to come
to your camp as soon as possible.

1052
01:20:37,787 --> 01:20:40,824
Too short notice? Don't be silly.
There's room enough for everyone.

1053
01:20:40,987 --> 01:20:45,617
Yeah, Dale and I can sign all
you guys up. Welcome.

1054
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:51,779
- It was really my son who did all this.
- Colonel?

1055
01:20:52,507 --> 01:20:54,941
Job well done.

1056
01:20:58,267 --> 01:20:59,825
Just call me Dad.

1057
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:10,624
Hey, what do you say
we go get the trophy?

1058
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:13,665
- Yeah!
- Okay.
