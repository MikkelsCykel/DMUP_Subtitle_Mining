I always get the shake before drop.

3
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,535
I had the objection,

4
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:36,770
hypnotic prep,

5
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,779
and federation shrink
scan my brain wave.

6
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,923
Everything checked out.

7
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,064
Doc said it wasn't fear.

8
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:57,384
I could've told him that.

9
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:02,680
A horse locked in the starting
gate isn't afraid.

10
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,378
He just ready to run.

11
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:14,048
STARSHIP TROOPERS: INVASION

12
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,025
A team, our mission is to seize
and control the B dock carrier,

13
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:52,337
and clear away the bugs
and evac the survivor.

14
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:56,708
And once we land, we join forces
with K-12 team at the fort.

15
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:58,156
It's a standard grab and go.

16
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:00,588
After the rescue, we
return to the ship,

17
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:03,494
take off and then we blow
the fort and the bugs.

18
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,901
Are we clear?

19
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,776
Loud and clear sir.

20
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,421
Go..

21
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:21,600
Go, go, go..

22
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:01,271
Report!

23
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,865
Pretty bad sir. Someone of our man
are still in the bar corridor.

24
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:05,807
Then let's get them out of there.

25
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:08,784
Mech, we're done here.
We have to blow.

26
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:09,165
Sir!

27
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:14,182
Holy Man and Chow, on the cover.
Biggest and Grimeshock hold position.

28
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,027
The rest of you, follow me.

29
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,043
We're on the rescue mission people.

30
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,906
Lt Jordan, what's your status?

31
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:33,558
Too many bugs, no way
to take back Fort Casey.

32
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:36,219
We'll hold until the
John A. Warden evacuates.

33
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,591
Alesia will stand-by
for immediate evac.

34
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:41,346
- Keep me posted.
- Roger that.

35
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:42,291
Mech, what's your ETR?

36
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,713
Almost there sir.

37
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,402
Done. Let's go.

38
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,202
Charleston down. Medic!

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,733
I'm on it.

40
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:16,508
Have you completed loading the crates?

41
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,720
Note that is your priority.

42
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,672
What the hell is this about Carl?

43
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,664
Wonderful to see you again Carmen.

44
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,445
You commandeer my damn ship.

45
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,467
Borrowing it. I'll give it back.

46
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,787
You're never going to take
the John A. Warden from me.

47
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:44,147
Guards I believe Capt. Ibanez
need an escort to the East Wing.

48
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:46,662
What do you want with my ship Carl?

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,975
Carmen, that's classified.
But I can tell you this,

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,147
this mission, oh this mission
will turn the tide.

51
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,546
You always were such an asshole.

52
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:01,045
And I'm always so fond of
you as well, Carmen.

53
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,723
See you on Terra.

54
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,909
Friend always, right?

55
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:22,891
A team reload!

56
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,782
This is A team leader
to Fort Casey.

57
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:28,272
Evac, come in

58
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,343
About god damn time.

59
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,038
It's a little crowded out here,
exit now. Dock B.

60
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,085
On our way.

61
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:34,257
Show some hassle.

62
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:37,072
It's quiet now but that
ain't going to last.

63
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,165
Evac coming out.

64
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,277
Keep your eyes open
and your heads down.

65
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,801
I don't to lose anyone
to friendly fire.

66
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:49,633
Who's in charge?

67
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,039
Acting commander sir!

68
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,546
Major Henry Varro was been
relieved of duty.

69
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,320
Relieved? What the hell happen?

70
00:05:56,311 --> 00:06:00,121
This was a suicide mission from
the gecko. Fucking-headcase!

71
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:03,006
Shut your mouth Ratazz.
You want to be busted like Hero?

72
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:49,829
We're outta here.
Let's get back to the ship.

73
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:52,807
Mech, how is it coming
with that charge?

74
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,925
Armed and dangerous.

75
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:05,650
You have to be kidding me!

76
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,213
Thanks for waiting Jack-ass

77
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:21,119
Command, if there's a new order
let me know god damn it.

78
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:24,182
Are we going to escort the
John A. Warden or not?

79
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:36,674
Behind us!

80
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:40,519
Sir! This is Biggest, can't
hold on anymore. We're...

81
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,285
Fuck son-of-bitches....

82
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:48,351
Captain Jonah, this is A team.
Landing ship destroyed.

83
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:49,288
Boarding directly now.

84
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,476
Roger that, as soon as you're
abroad, Alesia will depart.

85
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,631
Left formation! Fall back
to the Alesia.

86
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,955
Hold formation!  Hold formation!

87
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:34,108
My arm! My god damn arm!

88
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,569
Medic!

89
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:45,436
424!

90
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:47,746
425!

91
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:49,699
426!

92
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,082
Return to the ship!

93
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,713
428!

94
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:57,767
429!

95
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,260
30!

96
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,551
431!

97
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:04,383
Trig, move your god damn ass!
We're taking off!

98
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,578
Come on.

99
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,961
Come on.

100
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,773
Jump!

101
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:37,861
Thanks.

102
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:39,806
Anytime.

103
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:42,322
- Score?
- 430.

104
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,236
Give or take.

105
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:16,067
You going to do it or what?

106
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:18,594
Hit it Maestro

107
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:23,055
3, 2, 1.

108
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,827
BOOM!

109
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:35,488
Come on guy, this shit ain't over yet.

110
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,817
Haha yeah, alright.

111
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,694
So what the hell happen
to you guys down there?

112
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,249
We were right on top of a
mother-fucking ant hill.

113
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:02,937
Varro save our ass, then that ESP
prick, Jenkins sent us on a death run.

114
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:06,077
Straight into a god damn hive.

115
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,449
But you didn't hear that shit from me.

116
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:10,289
Ah I'm sorry, did you say something?

117
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,416
Attention!

118
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,585
You can all be proud of yourselves.

119
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,436
We save some lives

120
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:24,647
and we kill some bugs

121
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,859
But we lost some good troopers today.

122
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,508
Here's to the dead.

123
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,008
And to the next man to die.

124
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:33,521
Now let's get back to Terra

125
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,992
and we can put some real
glasses in these hands.

126
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,535
Hey, check that out.

127
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:51,758
What's the matter, you never saw
a flanking without an arm before?

128
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:54,165
Yeah, but they usually
looks like Ratazz.

129
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,294
Ratazz?

130
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:57,692
That's what they call me

131
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:00,258
because you didn't give a
rat-ass about anything.

132
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:01,129
What a surprise.

133
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:04,921
Hey, you wanna me to
show you to the shower?

134
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,929
I could wash you back.

135
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,990
You don't want to wash my front?

136
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,535
Shut up!

137
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:41,779
Captain on the bridge.

138
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:45,374
Stand down, this is your
ship not mine Captain.

139
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:49,260
Simple respect Captain Ibanez
for what happen in Planet B.

140
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:52,731
If only more stripes were executed that way.

141
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,517
I had a good team.

142
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:56,680
What can you tell me?

143
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,745
- About?
- Where's my ship?

144
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,522
And why does Jenkins want it so badly?

145
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:04,812
Captain, believe me if I could
provide with any information

146
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:07,600
This ship is in pursuit of
the John A. Warden isn't it?

147
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,628
I understand your concern
of John A. Warden

148
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,877
Captain Ibanez but this is the
Alesia and we command it.

149
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:15,439
Our orders are to return to Terra

150
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:17,774
Then show me that data on
the John A. Warden's path.

151
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:19,418
Where is she headed?

152
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:20,496
We don't know Captain.

153
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:23,801
We lost her signal shortly
after we began pursuit.

154
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,000
Please contact me if you found
the John A. Warden.

155
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,293
Aye, aye, Captain

156
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,853
Don't have of a joint or some kind?

157
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,503
This is a serious wound.

158
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:46,368
Could have been a lot worse.

159
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,344
I can't keep something like
this off the record.

160
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:52,391
I'm going have to
take your arm off.

161
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:53,962
Fine. But look..

162
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:57,205
At least do what you can so
it doesn't get back to my folks.

163
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,300
You can at least do that, right doc?

164
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:06,056
Let's do this.

165
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:08,727
Why don't we wait until
the shaking stop?

166
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:09,792
The ship will be fine.

167
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:11,388
I'm not talking about the ship.

168
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,426
Hey noob, dance class
is down the hall.

169
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:55,511
No, it's right here. Care to dance?

170
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,823
This ring, is for fighting.

171
00:14:58,824 --> 00:14:59,975
Humor me.

172
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,685
- What's your name?
- Chow.

173
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:04,842
Well Chow,

174
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:07,161
I don't usually dance with guys,

175
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:09,450
but in your case, I'll
make an exception.

176
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:11,591
Who's your money on?

177
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,067
Ratazz is bigger.

178
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:15,817
- Not much upstairs though.
- Whatever dude.

179
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,544
Ratazz get him one good solid hit,
Chow is going down.

180
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,060
Shit, if he could ever land a punch.

181
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,919
Chow is fast man.

182
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:28,262
Alright fighters to your corners.

183
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:35,224
You back up down,
I won't think even less of you.

184
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:39,951
When I ring the bell,
come out fighting.

185
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,639
We're going to miss you
when you're gone.

186
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,261
Good thing there's
not much upstairs,

187
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:14,647
don't have to worry
about brain damage.

188
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,014
Hey, damage this...

189
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:32,311
Hey..

190
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,850
You see that?

191
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,617
Didn't know you had it in you.

192
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:56,524
Flash of inspiration.

193
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:02,581
E-057..

194
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
E-057..

195
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,024
E...0..5...7

196
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:28,504
Thanks. I really appreciate..

197
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,451
it.

198
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,798
They can't get me a
bed until tomorrow.

199
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,840
Thanks for letting me use the comm...

200
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:44,029
Tia

201
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:45,862
Tia Durer

202
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,560
- Trig is fine.
- Ottis hags.

203
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:50,505
Bugspray.

204
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:53,862
Hey...

205
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,222
Thanks for the catch..

206
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:58,436
at Fort Casey.

207
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:00,782
You're sleeping with a gun?

208
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,740
You must know something I don't.

209
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:07,150
Barreta XXX4.

210
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:09,295
A classic.

211
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:16,418
You've got a nice smile for a soldier.

212
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,749
Thanks.

213
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,011
I think.

214
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:22,102
So..

215
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:23,317
Up for a little training?

216
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:27,954
I think I have about all the target
practice I could stand today.

217
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,615
Yeah, I was thinking something
a little more...

218
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,286
Extreme-less.

219
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:40,580
You didn't really use the
intercom, did you?

220
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,212
Would you like to know more?

221
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:54,046
Everyone is doing their part.

222
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:10,209
Major Henry Varro..

223
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:15,896
One of the most decorated
officer in the federation.

224
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:22,302
You earn long range ops
in places even god won't.

225
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:29,227
What did you do?

226
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,797
Why won't you talk?

227
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,029
And why won't your men talk?

228
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:49,571
HE-RO

229
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,497
They're a couple of
modifications you can

230
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:03,125
score on the black market
when you get to Terra.

231
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,705
But as far as the federation
would pay for it,

232
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,226
it's still pretty
good prosthetic.

233
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:07,875
Got it.

234
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:09,570
Nice job.

235
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,414
Don't know what you're nervous about..

236
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:13,518
I bet this looks good
as all the others.

237
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,432
What others? You're my first.

238
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,782
As the matter of fact,
you're the first guy

239
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,190
that I've work on that actually live.

240
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:30,175
Every Commander
I've ever served under,

241
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:32,438
tries to get me to use
regular machine gun.

242
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:36,087
That is until they see how
many I kill without one.

243
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:38,705
And they don't ask me anymore.

244
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,220
My parents leave me that rifle.

245
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:50,988
There's an armory in my hometown.

246
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,262
Everyone worked there.

247
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:02,048
That is until the bugs melted
the place with a plasma bomb.

248
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:07,221
Soldiers, civilian, families.

249
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:09,385
Everyone died.

250
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:16,733
I swore then that I'd kill
just as many bugs.

251
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:22,105
And I would do it with that gun.

252
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,309
That's why you count?

253
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:29,741
No, that's why it counts.

254
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:10,900
God damn you Carl.

255
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:22,101
Where did you learn
that hay maker?

256
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:23,147
Dance class.

257
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:25,734
Shit! I knew it!

258
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,438
I just felt it.

259
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:30,579
We aren't going to see Terra
anytime soon.

260
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:31,431
Well private...

261
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:32,462
Specialist actually.

262
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:35,127
Well...Almost

263
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,911
5 short points on the ESP test,

264
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:39,411
if one more jacket had
have been a diamond,

265
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:41,578
I wouldn't be here
with your dumb asses.

266
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:45,277
You son-of-a-bitch!

267
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,549
That's how you always know
I was in the shower.

268
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,886
So, can you tell what
I'm thinking now?

269
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:54,976
Hell, even I know what
you're thinking now.

270
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,039
You make me sick.

271
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,802
What's up Lt Daugherty?

272
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,278
I thought you were in medical?

273
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:05,950
Ah...

274
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,521
Wasn't as bad as it looks.

275
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,101
Ah..glad you two could make it.

276
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:25,771
At ease.

277
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:30,407
I wanted you brief you all personally.

278
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:31,144
First and foremost,

279
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:35,089
because I know of the great sacrifices
of both the crew of the Alesia

280
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:37,292
as well as the defender
of Fort Casey of Maine

281
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,499
and the great losses
that you suffered

282
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,749
and second, I know you could
use a little RNR about now

283
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,891
Believe me, I've been there myself.

284
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:48,044
But unfortunately,
we have a situation.

285
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:49,575
What?!

286
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:50,279
Stowen!

287
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,262
The John A. Warden have gone silent.

288
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:56,311
The Alesia is the only starship in
the areas of last contact.

289
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,376
I've ordered your Captain
to divert course,

290
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:01,225
find the Warden and investigate.

291
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:04,461
Any question?

292
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:06,258
Yeah.

293
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,937
I think I speak for everyone from
Fort Casey when I say this..

294
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,452
Shut the fuck up!

295
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,625
It's okay, go on.

296
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:17,961
We're only going in if
Hero takes point.

297
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:18,723
Hero?

298
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:20,637
Major Henry Varro.

299
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:23,113
Commander of Fort Casey, General Rico.

300
00:24:23,324 --> 00:24:23,902
Right...

301
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:28,196
Arrested by Dr. Carl
Jenkins for insubordination

302
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:29,910
at the battle at Fort Casey.

303
00:24:30,858 --> 00:24:31,389
Fine!

304
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,821
If Major Varro chooses to
participate in this mission,

305
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:37,159
the mobile infantry will
accept his service.

306
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,327
However, it will not in any way
be prejudicial to his trial.

307
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,365
Is that understood?

308
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:42,632
Understood sir.

309
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,062
We probably lose communication
as you cross the Nebula...

310
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,312
Godspeed Alesia!

311
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:50,227
Dismissed!

312
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,922
Assemble in the staging area.

313
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:56,745
A word Captain Ibanez.

314
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:01,448
Why did you let him take my ship?

315
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:06,477
Carmen, it's not your ship, it
belongs to the Terran Federation.

316
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,474
General Rico, perhaps you recall
there were a certain young trooper

317
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,000
who was with me when the
Rodger Young when down

318
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,209
I vowed that would never happen
to a ship under my command.

319
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:20,631
This is not my choice

320
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:21,381
Honey, look.

321
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:24,255
I don't care what you thought
about Carl when you knew him

322
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:25,670
and I don't care what you
think about him now.

323
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:27,588
He's minister of
paranormal warfare

324
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:31,115
and high command has authorized
to use the John A. Warden.

325
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:33,561
Look, Carmen...

326
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:37,775
This is a mission that's so classified
I don't even know what the hell..

327
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:39,240
And look how well It's going.

328
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,443
You know that the John A. Warden
like the back of your hand

329
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,527
I need you to go abroad
with the insertion team.

330
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:46,773
I looked at the manifest.

331
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,320
That ship didn't just go dark,

332
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,086
her signal was turned off.

333
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,350
And you know as well as I do,

334
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,593
the only one who has
the gull to run a

335
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,711
Federation Starship's
dark is Carl Jenkins.

336
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,631
And how do you know we're
even close to my ship?

337
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:08,006
Before we lost contact, we analyze
some of the scattered signals.

338
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:09,534
Calculating course and speed,

339
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,276
we were able to get a good
estimate of it's location.

340
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:13,343
Now it's not spot on,

341
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,322
but we can get you
pretty damn close.

342
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:19,433
Fine!

343
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:21,933
I'll do it.

344
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:24,543
But not to save Carl sorry ass,

345
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:27,933
I'll do it to take back my ship.

346
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:29,616
You just be careful.

347
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:33,760
We need you back, intact,
when this thing is over.

348
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:37,262
Thank you Johnny.

349
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,137
Hey Carmen...

350
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,747
When this thing is over, maybe you
and I could meet at Zim and a..

351
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:45,582
Yeah..

352
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:47,856
Yeah...

353
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:55,970
I gotta tell ya, this will no way to
be prejudicial to your trial.

354
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,127
Ah..come on,

355
00:26:59,392 --> 00:27:01,353
I didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

356
00:27:01,408 --> 00:27:03,799
I'm just a damn janitor
trying to clean it up.

357
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:08,879
Look, Major...

358
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:12,684
I'm no war enthusiastic about
saving Carl Jenkins than you are..

359
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,018
But your men want you.

360
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:20,729
And something tells me,
we're going to need you.

361
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:24,690
Lt Daugherty..

362
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,862
We found the John A. Warden

363
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:31,235
Tell Captain Jonah to move to
stand off range. I'll be right up.

364
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,050
So, which is it?

365
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,929
Get this chain off me.

366
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:13,503
It'll be too bad if a stray
shot hit Jenkins.

367
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:16,191
Look, I know you're pissed,
but even think about shit like that.

368
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:19,732
They threw Hero in the brig, you
or me, Holy Man or Kharon,

369
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,213
what do you think they
do to grunts like us?

370
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:25,252
They shoved us out of
the god damn air lock.

371
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:26,838
So I gotta watch my ass?

372
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:30,026
Yeah, but if you're not gonna
do that, at least watch mine.

373
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:41,039
Aw man, fuck you!

374
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:44,922
Can't believe I'm the only who's
didn't get laid around here.

375
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,358
Looks like you've got all
your bases covered.

376
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,123
Tell me Holy Man, which one
going to save you today?

377
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:06,371
I can take care of myself.

378
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,380
Women, they make the highs higher
and the lows more frequent.

379
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:18,973
Are atheist the only
philosopher you can quote?

380
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:25,000
I find a believer such as you seek
so few things worth rating down.

381
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:26,626
And I found..

382
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:32,895
That he who look so forward to the
abyss is simply afraid of the light.

383
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:36,189
I'm gonna get you a pen.

384
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:38,189
Wait, did you just make that up?

385
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:41,041
No, I'm not writing that down.

386
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:49,642
John A. Warden, this is the
Alesia, please respond.

387
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:56,043
I try everything, voice, radio flash,
even light code. Nothing.

388
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:57,933
Keep trying Lieutenant.

389
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:59,777
Zoom in on the bridge.

390
00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:02,991
Maybe they can't hear us.

391
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:06,694
They have to know what
our objective is.

392
00:30:07,802 --> 00:30:11,114
Bridge, this is your
Captain, respond now!

393
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:14,111
If you do not
respond we will board.

394
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:25,231
Board it, that's not my ship anymore.

395
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,393
Kids?

396
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:01,885
Husband?

397
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:06,667
Died on planet 4976.

398
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,307
Hey, the way I figured it,

399
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:12,208
the bugs got more reason
to be sacred than I do.

400
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:16,661
I killed hundreds of them.
They kill zero of me.

401
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:22,477
Ahh man..

402
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:28,757
Listen, I want you
to do me a favor...

403
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:29,507
Yeah?

404
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:31,475
If I don't make it,

405
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:34,331
I don't care what
happens to my body

406
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:37,572
but try to get my
rifle's scope will you?

407
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:40,282
And have it bury in my hometown.

408
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,104
Look, I don't like fumes.

409
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:46,328
Do me a favor,

410
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,906
don't get killed.

411
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:21,528
Okay, boys and girls..

412
00:32:22,763 --> 00:32:25,296
Looks like this is going
to be my last mission,

413
00:32:25,297 --> 00:32:26,879
so let's make it a good one.

414
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:30,578
Our job is to retake the 
John A. Warden,

415
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,482
rescue any and all survivors

416
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,676
and exterminate any
resistance we might find.

417
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:36,872
You got that?

418
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,239
Sir yes sir!

419
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,800
Alright troopers..

420
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,449
Let's get the lady her ship back.

421
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,149
Initiate docking procedure.

422
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,679
Initiating docking procedure.

423
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:07,690
Team 1, Lt Daugherty, Ice,
Trig, Mech, Shock Jock

424
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:09,760
will lead Capt. Ibanez to the bridge.

425
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:16,533
Team 2, Jace, Kharon, Chow, Bugspray,
Gunfather, Ratazz, Holy Man

426
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,228
and the rest of you,

427
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:18,994
you're coming with me
to the engine room.

428
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:22,861
Don't know we gonna find in
there so be ready for anything.

429
00:33:23,354 --> 00:33:24,401
Let's go..

430
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:36,698
Gravity zero, oxygen level yellow.

431
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:38,480
Ready to board the John A. Warden.

432
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,124
We're in.

433
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:09,182
Team 1 moving towards the bridge.

434
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,979
Team 2 boarding, moving
towards the engine room.

435
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:47,934
Something up ahead..

436
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:50,786
No..

437
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:56,622
Oh my god...

438
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:02,755
Team two, we got bodies 
near the bridge.

439
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,808
We got bodies everywhere.

440
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,906
Ah man, they've been bug-ripped

441
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:15,321
Infestation confirm,
stay sharp people.

442
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:16,930
Nearing objective.

443
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:22,667
Daugherty to team 2,
we're on the bridge.

444
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,660
And it ain't pretty.

445
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:38,542
Got multiple casualties.

446
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:41,939
And one dead bug.

447
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,361
All clear!

448
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:50,783
Shock Jock...

449
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,071
Massive tearing wound...

450
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:07,194
My crew.

451
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:16,529
Bridge is secured, team 2
what's your status, over.

452
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,147
Entering engine room now, over.

453
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:34,806
Fucking blood bath..

454
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:38,001
Team two scout, I got dead
troopers and bugs.

455
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:41,322
Holy shit!

456
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:43,143
Amen.

457
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:48,527
Why they all die here?

458
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,816
Focus on the mission troopers.

459
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,292
Chow, prep the engines.

460
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:55,024
Yes sir!

461
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,337
Major, I have a survivor

462
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:11,131
Well, find him.

463
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,374
Chow, what's the
status on that engine?

464
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:14,991
- Give me 10.
- You got 5.

465
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:15,522
Yes sir

466
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:18,699
Team 1, engine operative in 5.

467
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:21,551
Is that a real 5 minute
or sorta 5 minute? Over.

468
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:22,644
Hard 5!

469
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:27,077
And we got a possible survivor,
going to investigate, over.

470
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:35,461
Gunfather, have team hold position.
Bugspray and Ratazz cover Chow.

471
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,125
Like paint Major.

472
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:47,479
Looks like they were trying
to make this into a lab.

473
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:02,587
What is that thing?

474
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:06,182
Holding cell, to keep a bug inside.

475
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:10,589
Now, it looks like they were  trying to
keep them out and somebody else in.

476
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,984
Emergency power supply from
Alesia seems to be working.

477
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:26,202
Team 1, team 2, gravity
restoration in 5, 4..

478
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:27,156
3

479
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:28,101
2

480
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:37,355
Fuck!

481
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:42,647
Internal oxygen level is green.

482
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,100
I feel a whole lot of better I knew
what happen to those bugs.

483
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:53,733
Weren't we all?

484
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:17,131
Who's there?

485
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:19,819
Major Varro.

486
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:23,265
What're doing here? You're
suppose to be on trial.

487
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:26,590
Yeah, well looks like
that plan is about as

488
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:28,661
successful as your
little experiment here.

489
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,747
What happen on this ship Jenkins?

490
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:33,232
I act her, so she hits me

491
00:40:33,623 --> 00:40:34,561
She?

492
00:40:34,928 --> 00:40:36,498
What do you mean she?

493
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,929
We're the opponent, she act
everything, me, the ship.

494
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,029
Everything!

495
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:45,628
Well of course she did, she
knew what I wa thinking,

496
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:46,967
thoughts become words,
words become teeth,

497
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:48,259
thought becomes word,
words become teeths.

498
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,550
thought becomes word,
words become teeths.

499
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,297
thought becomes word,
words become teeths.

500
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,895
We're going to get you out of here.

501
00:40:52,896 --> 00:40:55,461
You and I can settle our score
later, open the door Jenkins.

502
00:40:55,493 --> 00:40:56,523
And let you kill me? NO!

503
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:59,853
Besides, it's safer in here,
safest place on the ship.

504
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:02,673
Safe place. Yes, safe place,
my safe house.

505
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:03,955
Open the door Jenkins.

506
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,604
You think it's funny?

507
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:07,597
Turning tables, tables turned.

508
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,242
I arrested, now I'm
the one in the cage.

509
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:11,804
You think that's funny, do you?

510
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:12,216
Do you?

511
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:14,798
I'll leave you ass here,
don't think I won't.

512
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:17,302
You figured it out while we
clear the rest of the ship.

513
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:19,107
Have this door open by
the time we get back.

514
00:41:19,153 --> 00:41:23,694
There's nothing to clear.
The crew is dead, everyone is dead.

515
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:24,978
Darkness..

516
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:30,947
Darkness is your friend, whatever
you do, don't turn on the lights.

517
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,358
Let there be light!

518
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:41,069
Yes!

519
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,070
Varro to Chow, do not restart
the engine. Do you copy?

520
00:41:55,737 --> 00:41:57,909
Don't be afraid of the dark.

521
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:06,672
Good job Chow.

522
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,649
The bridge is free.

523
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:28,578
Grenade!

524
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:31,586
Bugs!

525
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,984
We got bugs, multiple contacts.

526
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,258
Holy shit!

527
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,121
Is that the abyss you
were talking about?

528
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:52,841
Engine room, we're under attack.

529
00:42:52,872 --> 00:42:54,716
Take position, they're coming.

530
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:13,032
Get back to the airlock,
move and fire.

531
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,810
No..

532
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,841
I'll draw them off, you go!

533
00:43:36,577 --> 00:43:37,319
No!

534
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:39,212
We're not leaving him.

535
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,860
Go, I'll see you on the other side.

536
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,059
Holy Man, hold position and fire.

537
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:01,122
Die bugs.

538
00:44:02,278 --> 00:44:05,004
You think I give a rat-ass about god?

539
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:07,781
This way.

540
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:35,929
Get to the airlock.

541
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:43,748
V, we headed to the airlock
and they're right on our ass.

542
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:44,927
Roget that.

543
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:46,875
God damn it!

544
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:09,278
Bugs.

545
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:39,160
Chow!

546
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:46,594
Alesia, we're under massive bug
attack, request immediate evac.

547
00:45:46,688 --> 00:45:49,469
Repeat, request immediate evac.

548
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:53,641
Roger that, Alesia is preparing
for your retrieval.

549
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:57,928
Let's go!

550
00:46:01,608 --> 00:46:04,326
This is Alesia, ready for
your arrival, over.

551
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:16,372
Contact!

552
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,223
It's jammed!

553
00:46:41,658 --> 00:46:44,751
Don't suppose you have
replace parts to fix this.

554
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:49,087
You gonna make it..

555
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:50,642
Oh that's right...

556
00:46:51,423 --> 00:46:55,846
You can't let me die, I the only one
of your patient who said to lived.

557
00:47:14,716 --> 00:47:16,162
Open the airlock.

558
00:47:19,952 --> 00:47:21,038
Shock Jock, you go first.

559
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:22,115
Yes, sir.

560
00:47:30,656 --> 00:47:32,444
What the hell? Evasive action!

561
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,233
Shock Jock!

562
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:45,109
Close the door.

563
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:51,565
What the hell just happen?

564
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,182
The Alesia is gone.

565
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:54,658
Did we just fired on them?

566
00:47:54,728 --> 00:47:57,816
Alesia, Captain Jonah, answer me!

567
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:06,953
Listen up everybody,
we head to the bridge.

568
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:07,667
Now!

569
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:12,316
Since when did she gives the orders?

570
00:48:12,353 --> 00:48:14,329
Since we boarded her ship.

571
00:48:14,377 --> 00:48:16,603
Just asking...

572
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:17,806
Bugs!

573
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:30,109
I act her so she hit me.

574
00:48:30,164 --> 00:48:32,531
I act her so she hit me.

575
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,765
I act her so she hit me.

576
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,585
I act her so she hit me.

577
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:37,187
I act..

578
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,966
Are you alright Captain?

579
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:55,326
You know, if I wanted to
run this much..

580
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:58,372
I'd have joined the mobile infantry.

581
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:04,446
Captain Ibanez to the L6 Base.

582
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:05,985
High Command?

583
00:49:06,453 --> 00:49:11,655
This is the John A. Warden,
Johnny? Please respond.

584
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:14,679
Communications is always
jagging your world.

585
00:49:14,804 --> 00:49:18,234
Recommend we position ourselves
away from the Nebula.

586
00:49:18,273 --> 00:49:22,421
How did the cannon fired?
And why target our own ship?

587
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:24,522
Jenkins try to warn us.

588
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:26,882
Carl is alive?

589
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:28,273
Locked himself in the bug cage.

590
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:30,710
And you're just now telling me this?

591
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:31,984
Look Captain..

592
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:35,312
If you're ready for a full
debriefing I'm all for it.

593
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:36,914
Hero..

594
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:42,332
Jenkins found a queen on Fort Casey,
he ordered us to capture it alive.

595
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:44,532
What the...

596
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,123
Tell her the rest.

597
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:49,301
Yes Major, tell me the rest of it.

598
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:53,145
I knew trying to take the queen
will resulting in heavy casualties

599
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,700
I wasn't going to sacrifice
my men for a bug hunt.

600
00:49:56,795 --> 00:49:59,413
So that's why he had you arrested.

601
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:02,710
But he got the queen after all.

602
00:50:03,238 --> 00:50:07,886
Wait a minute, how the hell can
a bug control a Starship?

603
00:50:08,074 --> 00:50:10,590
You're going to have to
ask Jenkins that.

604
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,509
What the?

605
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,067
We're moving again.

606
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,489
- Where?
- No idea.

607
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,255
But if the queen is in control...

608
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:37,684
We need to stop her
from getting there.

609
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:38,381
How?

610
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:40,967
Back to the engine room,
shut them down.

611
00:50:41,014 --> 00:50:43,115
Negative, not enough soldiers or ammo.

612
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:50,743
What the hell are you doing?

613
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:56,390
- Praying.
- Well keep it up.

614
00:50:56,465 --> 00:50:58,511
We're going to need all
the help we can get.

615
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:09,900
Now, we're back in business.

616
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,467
Captain..

617
00:51:14,663 --> 00:51:17,023
You need to take a look at this.

618
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:24,508
She's heading straight
for the Martian Home Wormhole.

619
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:27,734
It will take her straight to earth.

620
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:36,515
This is Captain Ibanez to the L6 Base.

621
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:39,999
Captain Ibanez calling L6 Base.

622
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:43,195
This is Captain Ibanez to Johnny Rico.

623
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:46,179
L6 Base, come in.
This is Captain I....

624
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:53,650
What the hell are you doing?

625
00:52:02,076 --> 00:52:06,084
If she is in the engine room,
then I'm gonna hunt her down.

626
00:52:06,615 --> 00:52:08,115
I'll back you up.

627
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:08,874
No..

628
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:10,991
You stay.

629
00:52:11,686 --> 00:52:15,038
Besides, you weren't be
able to fit through here.

630
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:18,395
I'll be back.

631
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:31,792
You're not going to stop her?

632
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:35,171
She's a big girl. She knows
what she's doing.

633
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:41,039
Do we?

634
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,503
I bypassed the circuit board,

635
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:46,742
if we can gain control
with out being detected...

636
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:48,595
Strap yourself in.

637
00:52:55,787 --> 00:52:57,701
I'm not gonna seat in that blood seat.

638
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:01,998
Do it!

639
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:20,894
She's on to us.

640
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,114
Damn it!

641
00:53:26,902 --> 00:53:27,894
Fire!

642
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:36,933
General, a Federation Starship is just

643
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:39,169
emerged from Martian Home Wormhole.

644
00:54:39,212 --> 00:54:40,751
It's...

645
00:54:40,814 --> 00:54:43,689
- It's the John A. Warden.
- On screen.

646
00:54:43,852 --> 00:54:46,391
- They're receiving our signal sir.
- Any response?

647
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:48,331
No sir, they’re not responding.

648
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,176
Something's wrong.

649
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:54,518
Why would they head
back towards earth?

650
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:59,141
Sir, if they keep their current
trajectory, the John A. Warden..

651
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:01,044
Sir, it's heading straight for us.

652
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,004
John A. Warden, this is
General Rico, come in.

653
00:55:07,113 --> 00:55:09,738
John A. Warden, this is the L6 Base.

654
00:55:10,118 --> 00:55:12,690
If you do not change
course immediately,

655
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:14,509
we will be forced to engage.

656
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:18,217
Repeat, the L6 Base  
will take defensive

657
00:55:18,218 --> 00:55:21,010
action if you do not change course.

658
00:55:21,787 --> 00:55:24,068
John A. Warden, respond!

659
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,620
Talk to me Carmen.

660
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:53,506
The L6 Base, we gotta warn Johnny.

661
00:55:56,912 --> 00:55:58,158
Morse code.

662
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,209
We can't use the beacon, she
has control of the ship.

663
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:02,639
Yeah?

664
00:56:03,774 --> 00:56:05,703
She doesn't have control of this.

665
00:56:14,861 --> 00:56:18,171
General, there's fire on the bridge
of the John A. Warden

666
00:56:18,265 --> 00:56:21,092
Get me a closer look at that ship.

667
00:56:29,744 --> 00:56:31,502
It's morse code.

668
00:56:32,548 --> 00:56:34,931
They're trying to send us a message.

669
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:39,435
Repeat, bugs in control.

670
00:56:43,258 --> 00:56:46,516
How the hell did bugs
control a Starship?

671
00:56:49,912 --> 00:56:52,248
God damn you Carl.

672
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,247
Deployment status.

673
00:56:56,906 --> 00:57:00,298
Sheraaton, Ishizu Therma and the
Franklin are heading to intercept.

674
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:36,334
The Sheraaton are taking
catastrophic damage.

675
00:57:52,495 --> 00:57:54,909
The Franklin is critical
but operational.

676
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:59,483
Franklin, disengage. Get clear
of the John A. Warden.

677
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:19,791
The John A. Warden is approaching,
on a crash course.

678
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:22,174
Ready to intercept sir.

679
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:24,401
Main cannon arm and ready.

680
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,299
Carmen...

681
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,147
Carl..

682
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:32,031
Commander..

683
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,707
Open..

684
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:41,406
Fire!

685
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,284
Fire!

686
00:58:50,335 --> 00:58:53,517
Sir, we can't fire now,
they're too close.

687
00:59:12,525 --> 00:59:14,062
They missed us sir.

688
00:59:14,415 --> 00:59:15,181
Yeah..

689
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,591
But why?

690
00:59:18,094 --> 00:59:19,983
Commander, I have the
Warden's Trajectory,

691
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:21,767
it's heading straight
for the earth.

692
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,315
They never meant to ram us.

693
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:27,157
We were just in their way.

694
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,807
This is General Rico to
earth defense command,

695
00:59:34,808 --> 00:59:36,756
the John A. Warden is
under bug control

696
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:38,315
and entering earth’s atmosphere.

697
00:59:38,716 --> 00:59:41,973
It's what? The John A. Warden?

698
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:46,667
Rico, I don't care if John A. Warden 
is on that ship himself.

699
00:59:46,714 --> 00:59:49,746
If that ship is infested,
you take it down.

700
00:59:49,783 --> 00:59:51,809
Just give me a chance to do both sir.

701
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:55,030
Rescue our men and gain control.

702
00:59:55,065 --> 00:59:56,081
Rico..

703
00:59:56,132 --> 01:00:00,522
Commander, I promise, a bug invasion
will not happen on my watch sir.

704
01:00:01,373 --> 01:00:03,186
It better not!

705
01:00:04,498 --> 01:00:07,529
Space-board command, prepare a drop.

706
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:16,606
What now?

707
01:00:16,816 --> 01:00:20,957
Daugherty, you stay here
and protect the Captain.

708
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:24,368
The rest of you, lock and load.

709
01:00:25,338 --> 01:00:27,817
It's time we exterminate that bitch.

710
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,383
She's trying to crash the ship.

711
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:50,836
Do what you have to do.

712
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:06,595
I don't know what to do.

713
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:14,953
Trig, where are you now?

714
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:18,108
Trig, location.

715
01:01:19,127 --> 01:01:20,697
Trig, come in.

716
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:23,350
Trig, respond.

717
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:27,032
- Where are you? Trig!
- Central storage area.

718
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,668
- Have you found the queen?
- Oh yeah.

719
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:32,213
This bitch is disgusting.

720
01:01:32,581 --> 01:01:34,370
Take her out.

721
01:01:34,882 --> 01:01:35,702
Done.

722
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,394
We're running out of time,
do you read me?

723
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,177
Loud and clear Captain.

724
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:53,489
Shit!

725
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:55,737


726
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:14,720
That's it.

727
01:02:32,578 --> 01:02:33,242
No.

728
01:02:53,094 --> 01:02:54,031
Shit!

729
01:02:54,465 --> 01:02:55,325
438.

730
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:57,145
439.

731
01:02:58,577 --> 01:02:59,952
440.

732
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:05,797
Trig...

733
01:03:06,526 --> 01:03:08,184
All hands prepare for impact.

734
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:14,473
Magnetic stabilizer disarm.

735
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,932
All hands, report.

736
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:15,069
Can anybody hear me?

737
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:17,940
Hero?

738
01:04:19,153 --> 01:04:20,161
Anybody?

739
01:04:29,848 --> 01:04:31,140
Lieutenant..

740
01:04:48,872 --> 01:04:50,257
Thank you.

741
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:10,036
Rico, you're not a trooper
anymore, remember that.

742
01:05:10,775 --> 01:05:12,595
I'm always a trooper.

743
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:16,067
And if there any of our
man alive on that ship,

744
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,942
I'm getting them out.

745
01:05:19,694 --> 01:05:21,983
Should've known you said that.

746
01:05:22,141 --> 01:05:24,008
Kill them anyway you can.

747
01:05:24,314 --> 01:05:25,705
Kill them all.

748
01:05:27,074 --> 01:05:31,035
In t-minus 30, we'll send
nukes to sanitize that site.

749
01:05:31,956 --> 01:05:34,737
So be out of there before we hit.

750
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:39,757
Don't wait for me, if I'm
not out in 30, nuke it.

751
01:05:55,979 --> 01:05:56,924
Ice..

752
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:02,350
Holy Man...

753
01:06:03,082 --> 01:06:04,956
What the hell kinda bug is that?

754
01:06:09,652 --> 01:06:11,090
Fuck me!

755
01:06:18,472 --> 01:06:20,728
I was just starting to believe you.

756
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,431
Fall back, Now!

757
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:36,723
Troopers, our mission is to storm
the wreck of the John A. Warden,

758
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,243
rescue our surviving men

759
01:06:40,258 --> 01:06:42,749
and kill the last every last
son-of-bitch bugs we see.

760
01:06:43,486 --> 01:06:46,187
- Do you understand?
- Yes sir!

761
01:06:46,209 --> 01:06:49,911
We got 25 minutes before
they level that site,

762
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:50,935
so move fast.

763
01:06:51,648 --> 01:06:53,173
And remember..

764
01:06:53,258 --> 01:06:56,311
We're not fighting for some
rock across the galaxy,

765
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:58,960
we're fighting for our home.

766
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:01,160
Commence the attack.

767
01:07:23,217 --> 01:07:24,233
Over here..

768
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:26,234
This way?

769
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:54,617
- Are you alright Captain?
- Yeah. Thanks.

770
01:07:56,052 --> 01:07:58,683
Come on, let's get to the airlock
and get out of here.

771
01:08:02,297 --> 01:08:03,937
That voice..

772
01:08:13,765 --> 01:08:15,335
Approaching...

773
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,619
Now!

774
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,693
Come on you aces.

775
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,517
You wanna live forever?

776
01:08:29,228 --> 01:08:30,989
Kill them all.

777
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,303
She still have the ship.

778
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,700
Ice, you guard the Captain.

779
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:58,133
The rest of you are
coming with me,

780
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,444
we gonna kill the queen
and take back this ship.

781
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:03,463
Good luck.

782
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:12,424
Don't worry, you see
your kids again soon.

783
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:16,120
But those bugs, we're
taking their mama down.

784
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:23,404
Holy shit!

785
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:24,637
Take evasive action!

786
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,092
Incoming, burn and turn.

787
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:37,081
Listen...

788
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:40,179
It's the engine.

789
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:44,513
- Mech, still have explosive?
- Some C-4s

790
01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:14,764
Trig...

791
01:10:15,162 --> 01:10:16,459
No..

792
01:10:17,984 --> 01:10:19,523
Trig..

793
01:10:20,513 --> 01:10:22,201
Trig!

794
01:10:23,705 --> 01:10:26,120
No...

795
01:10:34,956 --> 01:10:36,855
Ambush.

796
01:10:46,915 --> 01:10:49,689
Go sir, I'll hold them off
for as long as I can.

797
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,220
441.

798
01:10:55,016 --> 01:10:56,098
442.

799
01:10:56,567 --> 01:10:57,848
443.

800
01:10:58,442 --> 01:11:00,262
444.

801
01:11:36,281 --> 01:11:37,774
Damn!

802
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:41,265
What the hell?

803
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:47,719
This is what I've been working on.

804
01:11:50,952 --> 01:11:55,411
T-minus 60 to launch,
starting final countdown.

805
01:11:55,499 --> 01:11:59,460
56, 55, 54,

806
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:03,420
53, 52, 51

807
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:15,132
Carmen, get down!

808
01:12:37,113 --> 01:12:38,637
Johnny..

809
01:12:40,085 --> 01:12:41,950
Are there any other survivors?

810
01:12:41,951 --> 01:12:44,374
Four more, heading
to kill the queen.

811
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,561
And..

812
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:50,132
Jenkins, you're still alive?

813
01:12:50,184 --> 01:12:54,092
I can't die yet, not until we
won the war at least.

814
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:57,276
So, by controlling the bugs, you...

815
01:12:57,311 --> 01:13:00,433
I can bring us some step closer
to winning this war.

816
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:03,848
And I can get you close
enough to kill the queen.

817
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:10,793
Then, let's get moving.

818
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:35,015
Let negotiate.

819
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:37,386
Daugherty?

820
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:45,561
Surrender Jenkins to us

821
01:13:45,562 --> 01:13:49,017
and we will let you live.

822
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:51,830
They fear me.

823
01:13:51,918 --> 01:13:54,051
Maybe they just think you're an asshole.

824
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,329
Fuck off!

825
01:13:56,384 --> 01:13:59,227
Then, you'll die.

826
01:14:16,063 --> 01:14:19,110
These are the last ones I
can control directly for now.

827
01:14:19,195 --> 01:14:21,419
If I could've finish my research.

828
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:22,335
Then finish it

829
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,318
So, we can end this.

830
01:14:26,078 --> 01:14:28,189
- Run!
- What?

831
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,520
I said run!

832
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:44,079
3, 2, 1, launch.

833
01:14:52,973 --> 01:14:54,637
455.

834
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,647
456

835
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:59,229
4-5-7.

836
01:14:59,366 --> 01:15:01,327
458.

837
01:15:01,402 --> 01:15:03,434
4-5...

838
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,400
Carl..

839
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:30,285
Johnny Rico...

840
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:32,843
I should leave you ass
here to get nuked.

841
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,257
What do you mean nuked?

842
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:36,543
Let's go.

843
01:15:46,697 --> 01:15:49,408
Johnny, the landing ship is here.

844
01:15:50,996 --> 01:15:53,105
I'm coming.

845
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:12,659
We lost contact with the landing ship.

846
01:16:12,683 --> 01:16:14,738
T-minus 15 till impact.

847
01:16:24,255 --> 01:16:26,146
Where's the ship?

848
01:16:33,533 --> 01:16:35,643
No...

849
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:51,817
They took out the nukes.

850
01:17:05,172 --> 01:17:08,024
S-she's one.

851
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:12,759
- I still have one.
- One what?

852
01:17:13,026 --> 01:17:16,151
The shuttle I use to evacuate from Fort Casey.

853
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:17,649
Then let's use it.

854
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:19,726
She'll never let us leave.

855
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,327
You son-of-a-bitch.

856
01:17:26,848 --> 01:17:29,012
Now, that's not nice.

857
01:17:29,433 --> 01:17:30,517
Tell her.

858
01:17:30,518 --> 01:17:32,548
I set explosive on
the main engine.

859
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:33,728
What?

860
01:17:34,956 --> 01:17:39,535
- Mech, still have explosive?
- Some C-4s.

861
01:17:39,853 --> 01:17:41,760
Good..

862
01:17:41,803 --> 01:17:43,972
If we put C-4 in the main engine,

863
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:46,907
we can blow up the ship
and the queen with it.

864
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:49,241
- Huh?
- Whoa..

865
01:17:50,444 --> 01:17:52,756
We might not make it out in time.

866
01:17:54,465 --> 01:17:57,027
At least they won't.

867
01:17:58,078 --> 01:18:00,265
Okay..

868
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:02,664
Then do it.

869
01:18:02,876 --> 01:18:07,251
- Ratazz, watch his back.
- Yes sir!

870
01:18:09,494 --> 01:18:12,103
So the extraction team been wiped out?

871
01:18:13,264 --> 01:18:15,679
Just 10 minutes left.

872
01:18:18,451 --> 01:18:20,506
Johnny what're you doing?

873
01:18:22,612 --> 01:18:25,222
Get to the shuttle!

874
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:27,687
Johnny...

875
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:31,024
Let's go.

876
01:18:31,405 --> 01:18:33,092
Follow me.

877
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:53,390
Shit!

878
01:19:05,962 --> 01:19:07,478
Are you Varro?

879
01:19:07,893 --> 01:19:08,972
Yes sir!

880
01:19:09,226 --> 01:19:10,726
Where's Jenkins?

881
01:19:10,862 --> 01:19:11,972
He's safe.

882
01:19:14,758 --> 01:19:16,080
Varro!

883
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:18,966
Good..

884
01:19:20,612 --> 01:19:24,026
Make sure he keep everybody
else that way.

885
01:21:07,055 --> 01:21:08,516
He did it.

886
01:21:08,584 --> 01:21:10,334
59 seconds.

887
01:21:10,403 --> 01:21:11,349
Where's Johnny?

888
01:21:29,379 --> 01:21:32,260
Captain, take us home.

889
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:33,714
Aye, aye, sir.

890
01:21:51,839 --> 01:21:54,073
You're going to do it or what?

891
01:21:56,584 --> 01:22:00,820
3, 2, 1,

892
01:22:00,859 --> 01:22:01,936
BOOM!

893
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,207
I thought the good guys

894
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:57,679
and hot girls always
survive in the end.

895
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:00,314
No..

896
01:23:00,713 --> 01:23:02,721
Not all of them.

897
01:23:02,933 --> 01:23:05,808
He's to the dead.

898
01:23:05,863 --> 01:23:07,949
And to the next man to die.

899
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:17,631
I hope you feel better.

900
01:23:17,698 --> 01:23:22,783
Do you realize, that you not only
destroy my ship, and kill my crew,

901
01:23:22,783 --> 01:23:27,204
but you also put the entire
planet at risk for infestation?

902
01:23:27,348 --> 01:23:30,215
My apologies for your loss.

903
01:23:30,312 --> 01:23:32,991
But my research is going
to save an entire galaxy.

904
01:23:34,889 --> 01:23:36,651
Just like I saved you.

905
01:23:40,563 --> 01:23:41,883
It was you..

906
01:23:42,304 --> 01:23:44,632
You told me how to find Hero.

907
01:23:46,218 --> 01:23:48,249
Well, that's classified.

908
01:23:48,345 --> 01:23:52,142
You see, nothing can stop us when
3 of us are working together.

909
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:53,880
Are we Carl?

910
01:23:53,923 --> 01:23:55,321
Pardon me?

911
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:57,689
Are we working together?

912
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:01,687
Cheer up Johnny, you're a Hero.

913
01:24:01,688 --> 01:24:03,353
No.

914
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,059
No I'm not.

915
01:24:06,554 --> 01:24:08,617
But I've met one.

916
01:24:34,345 --> 01:24:43,249
