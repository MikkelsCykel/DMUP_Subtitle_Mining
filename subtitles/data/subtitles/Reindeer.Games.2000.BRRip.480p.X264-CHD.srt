1
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:05,826
To tell ya the truth,
I never was much for the holidays.

2
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:09,059
It's been forever
since I'd known a holiday,

3
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:12,103
since I'd seen my family,

4
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:16,461
since I'd been with a girl,
since I'd driven a car.

5
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,733
You see, cars are what put me here.

6
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,768
Iron Mountain, maximum security.

7
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:25,813
I was riding a hard five
for grand theft auto.

8
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:31,015
Meanwhile, my esteemed raping and murdering
colleagues were up for parole at three.

9
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,488
World works like that sometimes.

10
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,760
All the time in my experience.

11
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:40,693
That's me, Rudy Duncan,
menace to society, on the left.

12
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,934
The guy on the right's
Nick Cassidy, my best friend.

13
00:01:43,997 --> 00:01:46,666
Back then, we were both looking
at three days to a new start.

14
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,439
That's what ya talk about
inprison.

15
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:53,871
How you're gonna get it right.
How you'll never make the same mistakes.

16
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,286
We walk outta here, we hit that road,

17
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,517
what's the first thing
you're gonna do ?

18
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:09,458
Hot chocolate.

19
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:12,899
- What ?
- That's the first thing I'm gonna do.

20
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,297
I'm gonna go out and get myself
a mug of hot chocolate.

21
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,268
And a piece of pecan pie.

22
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:20,604
That's right.
A piece of pecan pie.

23
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:22,773
Yeah.

24
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:25,880
She's gonna be
out there, man.

25
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:29,310
She's gonna be
right there waiting.

26
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,991
She got us a motel
on Highway 5.

27
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:36,451
Lock ourselves in
the whole week,

28
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:40,091
drinkin' wine,
takin' baths, man.

29
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,306
Yeah.

30
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:51,507
Nick, all those pictures
she sent ?

31
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:54,073
You sure that's really her
in the pictures ?

32
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,867
I did hear sometimes these girls
send pictures that's not really them.

33
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,776
It's like their prettier cousin
or somethin' like that.

34
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,174
Why ya gotta say
a thing like that, man ?

35
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:04,916
- I'm just sayin'...
- Why ya gotta say a thing like that ?

36
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:09,283
I'm just sayin',
maybe I should take her out.

37
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,526
Spend a day or two with her.
Make sure she's the right girl.

38
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:16,864
Just a day or two.
Maybe a night or two ?

39
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:20,461
Whatever it takes. Just make sure
you're gettin' the right merchandise.

40
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:24,204
- You know ?
- You know what ?

41
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,738
Enjoy your hot chocolate, Rudy.

42
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:30,377
I think I'll take my chances
with Ashley.

43
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,714
Yeah, I figured.
I figured.

44
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:42,524
- Hold it up close.
- Pop gate three.

45
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:45,193
Oh, shit !

46
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:48,695
- What's up ?
- Alamo's back.

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,167
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.

48
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,835
Bro, I'm fucked.

49
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:57,840
Pincher said he thinks I'm the one
who ratted him out for beating up Creed.

50
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:00,478
'Cause I was there, he thinks
I'm the reason he ended up in solitar.

51
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,709
Fuck, Rudy.

52
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:04,741
Move out!

53
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:16,628
And stop !

54
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,402
Move in !

55
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:22,403
Listen to this.

56
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:25,302
"I've made my list
and I've checked it twice.

57
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,036
"As long as you're naughty,
it's gonna be nice.

58
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:34,415
"All that gets me through the day, is to
close my eyes and imagine holding you,

59
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,073
"kissing you, touching you.

60
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:41,026
"Because I know I'll feel
at that moment...

61
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:45,154
I've found the reason
for my whole entire life."

62
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:47,626
She sounds pretty mature
for 25.

63
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:50,294
Yeah !

64
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,797
You grow up in Detroit,
you get matured real quick.

65
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:57,134
Yeah. Either that
or those pictures are ten years old.

66
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:04,244
Sure as hell don't
make me miss Millie Bobeck.

67
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:07,446
Guess I owe Millie, though.

68
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,084
Ifl hadn't been
rolling her,

69
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:12,450
I would've never
ended up here.

70
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:16,163
Yeah. You hadn't have cracked that guy's head open,
you never would've found true love.

71
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:18,592
Jealous.

72
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:23,220
Ya know, Nick, what if
she sees you and, you know,

73
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:25,995
you just don't do it for her,
you know, I mean physically ?

74
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:30,133
She just... It's not there.
What're you gonna do ?

75
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:34,939
Well, me and her,
we got a connection.

76
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,250
Jesus Christ.
Get this fuckin' shit...

77
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:45,689
- out of my face.
- You should've written to that magazine.

78
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:47,693
I should've, yeah.

79
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:50,798
I'm gonna walk outta here. I'm gonna
walk right into a relationship.

80
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:55,063
And you, my friend,
will walk out with your bus fare.

81
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,159
Searching for
the drunkest skirt in the room.

82
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:01,099
That's right.
"Morning, gorgeous. More eggnog ?"

83
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:06,876
- Should've written, Rudy.
You'd have got yourself a girl.

84
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,245
Yeah, should've done
a lot of things.

85
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:17,020
All I want is just
to make it back to Sidnaw,

86
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:20,431
sit down for Christmas dinner,

87
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:23,329
sleep in my old bed,

88
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,229
watch some ball games
with my old man,

89
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,335
eat leftovers for about six months.

90
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:33,202
I just wanna go home.

91
00:06:58,194 --> 00:06:59,967
Keep the line movin'.

92
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,802
- What's this ?
- Holiday Jell-O.

93
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:06,806
- What this shit in it ?
- Swallow it and you'll see.

94
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,613
Just so you know,

95
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:13,844
this man and I are outta here
in two days.

96
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:17,285
So while we're inhaling
London broil and lobster bisque,

97
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:21,425
you're still gonna be standing
here smelling up the myster cream fuck.

98
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:24,751
Who's in prison now ?

99
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,255
Hey, Alamo, how ya doin' ?

100
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,601
Out of solitar ?
Look good. Lose some weight ?

101
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,668
Look, man,
it wasn't me.

102
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:41,504
- It wasn't me.
- Two days, man. Come on.

103
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,755
Remember how her brother's
a truck driver down there ?

104
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:54,454
I'm thinkin' he might be able
to get me some work.

105
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:57,227
What work, security ?

106
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,065
I'm through with that shit.
Ashley's right.

107
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:05,069
I gotta start doin' somethin'
I got a stake in, get a business goin'.

108
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:08,969
I don't know, man.
I been in the business world.

109
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:13,671
Hot-wiring cars, Rudy, does not
qualify you as a small business.

110
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,080
"Chop-shop consultant"
doesn't work on a resume.

111
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:19,582
I always wanted to be
the boss of something, ya know?

112
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:22,553
Have people working for me.

113
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,925
Man, what's wrong with you ?

114
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,895
Monsters... in the gelatin.

115
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,066
- It's just a roach, Zook.
- Yeah, it's protein. It's good for ya.

116
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:40,071
- Monsters... in the gelatin !
- Calm down.

117
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:45,106
There are monsters
in the gelatin !

118
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:49,183
Monsters... in the gelatin !

119
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:51,789
Look at this shit !

120
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:53,488
Hey ! Jesus !

121
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:56,846
- Sit down !
- Son of a bitch !

122
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:01,422
You eat this shit !

123
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:05,801
- Get down, don't move.
- Stay out of it, Rudy !

124
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:11,870
You want
some fucking monsters ?

125
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,341
Two days, man.

126
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:19,743
Fuck !

127
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:25,653
Don't move !

128
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:29,021
We had nothing to do with it!

129
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:34,632
Rudy, watch out !

130
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,708
Cassidy's down ! Cassidy's stabbed!

131
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,149
- I gotta be there.
- Oh, my God !

132
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,181
- Rudy, Ashley.
- You're gonna be all right.

133
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:59,154
- Hold on, hold on. Guard ! Jesus, guards !
- Ashley's gonna be there.

134
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:02,063
- Nick, you gotta...
- Gotta be...

135
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:04,586
Guard ! Guards !

136
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,921
Jesus Christ.

137
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,928
- Nick. Nick ! Nick !
- Get him outta here now!

138
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:31,789
Well, at least
he won't be comin' back.

139
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:39,462
You need some company tonight, Rudy,
you just give me a holler.

140
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:48,939
You gonna take that from him ?
You gonna take that shit, Rudy ?

141
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,263
Open outer gate.

142
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:58,513
Your world and welcome to it,
you dumb fucks.

143
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:01,287
Don't be a stranger now.
We'll keep the lights on for ya.

144
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:04,322
Over here !

145
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,313
Over here.
Hey, how you doin' ?

146
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:57,276
"And all that gets me
through the day, is to close my eyes...

147
00:12:57,372 --> 00:13:01,343
"and imagine holding you,
kissing you,

148
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:05,149
touching you."

149
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:10,186
Don't do it, Rudy.
Don't you fucking do it !

150
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:22,572
Jesus Christ.

151
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,365
Are you Ashley ?

152
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,246
I'm Nick !

153
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,239
Look, Ashley, I'm sorry.

154
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:35,003
I was scared that
I was gonna walk out there,

155
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,203
and you were gonna take one look
at me and just... turn around.

156
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:41,354
I was scared I was walkin'
into heartache.

157
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,283
All those letters, those words,
and you have a picture in your mind.

158
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,861
I was scared you'd see me,
and I just wouldn't be that...

159
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,261
picture that you had
in your mind.

160
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:58,398
I figured you walked outta there
and saw my clothes or something,

161
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:01,278
and you just walked
right the other way.

162
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:05,240
- You know, maybe you saw my coat or my hair...
- Hey, I like your coat !

163
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,637
Maybe you...

164
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:12,486
Maybe you saw me and I didn't...

165
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,448
Ashley, no. That was me.

166
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,497
I thought you said you,
had curly hair.

167
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:27,260
I do. It's ver curly.

168
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:30,930
When it gets long, it's really curly.
But I cut it short.

169
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:34,672
I can grow it out again, if you want.
I can get it pretty bushy.

170
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,239
No ! No, no, no.

171
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:41,617
I want you to be
who you wanna be.

172
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,973
Do that again.

173
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,621
What ?

174
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,353
Smile like that.

175
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,463
Come on.
One more time.

176
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,471
God, I have been dreaming
about that smile...

177
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,141
for so long,

178
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,705
Ashley Mercer.

179
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:18,786
You're better than the pictures
in my mind, Nick.

180
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:24,219
You're real !

181
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:35,493
Can I ask you somethin' ?

182
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,538
Is this the first time you ever
done somethin' like this ?

183
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,968
You, look at you.

184
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,304
So pretty, sweet.

185
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:50,653
Why were you writing to a guy,
some con, you don't even know ?

186
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:54,616
- I told you, Nick. Remember ?
- Tell me again.

187
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:04,061
All the guys
I've ever been with,

188
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,470
they never wanted
to get to know me.

189
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:14,175
Who I am... inside.

190
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:17,939
They just wanted to...
get inside.

191
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:23,089
A guy like you, Nick.

192
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:27,687
God, I mean, six months
before you could even touch my face.

193
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,418
I figure
a guy like that...

194
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:35,454
is gonna have to work
to get to know me some other way.

195
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:51,418
But when I read
what you wrote to me,

196
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:58,122
"Here's a guy they say is a criminal,
but he's not.

197
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:00,124
"Just protected his girl.

198
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:05,556
"Somebody got killed,
but he's not a killer...

199
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:12,469
"'cause he did what he had to do
to save somebody.

200
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:16,399
And the world just
didn't see it that way."

201
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:18,839
State of Michigan, anyway.

202
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:22,311
You wrote me
some wonderful things.

203
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:25,815
It wasn't all me, you know.

204
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:28,556
It was all you.

205
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,217
The guy I was in with, you know,
he helped me with some of the romantic stuff.

206
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:35,365
He's a good guy, actually.
You'd like him.

207
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:40,765
I'm talkin' about the heart,
not the words.

208
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:43,570
Yeah, well,

209
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:47,000
some of the heart
might've been his too.

210
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:49,001
Yeah ?

211
00:19:57,845 --> 00:20:02,045
You should've signed his name,
then he'd be here right now.

212
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:27,778
Merry Christmas !

213
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,281
Merry Christmas, Santa !

214
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:33,889
Provisions, Nick.
Provisions.

215
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,150
Come here.
You need a coat.

216
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,393
No boyfriend of mine is gonna walk around
in a negative five degree wind chill...

217
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,426
without a good-looking goddamn coat.

218
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:46,534
But you already got me all this stuff.
I didn't get you anything.

219
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:50,496
Nick, you got out.
You're here.

220
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:53,041
You're my Christmas.

221
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:55,502
It's $ 200, Ash.

222
00:20:55,574 --> 00:21:00,485
I know !
But you forget where I work.

223
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:06,022
- Beauty and fragrances.
- Yep. Fifty percent off, my friend.

224
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:19,275
Just till the holidays, Nick.

225
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,734
We'll let her have her holidays,

226
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:23,776
then we'll tell her.

227
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:45,298
I'm gonna tell them not to bother us
for the rest of the year.

228
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,458
When I get back in that room, you better
be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

229
00:21:57,174 --> 00:22:01,073
I have no gifts to bring

230
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:10,226
A gift to give a King

231
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:14,053
I've got a girl...

232
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,055
Hi, Nick.

233
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:40,859
Ah, shit !

234
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:47,929
I oweyou a drink !

235
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,569
Welcome home, Nick.

236
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:59,481
Look, man, you don't know me.

237
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:03,108
I know ya.

238
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,141
- I know you real well.
- You can't.

239
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:07,248
The hell I can't.

240
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,344
- Watch out, baby,
- Ashley !

241
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:11,993
I'm bringin' in the tree !

242
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:29,132
Looks like somebody's
been havin' some fun.

243
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,275
Hey, sis, happy holidays.

244
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,642
No ! You bastard ! No !

245
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:42,437
- Take it easy. Don't hurt her.
- Right. Sorry, Monster.

246
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:48,089
So,

247
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:52,665
this is the guy you've been waitin' for,
the man of your dreams.

248
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,834
Gabriel, what are you doing ?

249
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:58,796
- I read a lot about you, Nick.
- Gabriel, what are you doing here ?

250
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,497
I read you're a man
of some knowledge.

251
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,406
- Gabriel.
- A man of some travels.

252
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,953
Look, man, I'm not him. Whatever you
want from Nick, you got the wrong guy.

253
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:16,814
- Nick ?
- I'm sorry, Ashley. I'm sorry.

254
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:22,798
No ! No !

255
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,270
- Who are you now ?
- I'm not him, man !

256
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,626
- She just thinks I'm Nick. I'm not him.
- Put him in the truck.

257
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,629
Wait a minute !
I was in the joint with him.

258
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:35,371
That's how I knew about him and her.
I took his place.

259
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:40,084
- You what ?
- Okay. I got out. Nick didn't.

260
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:44,213
I knew about her letters,
and Jesus Christ, man,

261
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,945
whatever you want from Nick,
I'm not him, okay ?

262
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,354
I just... I wanted to be.

263
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,360
You're not Nick Cassidy ?

264
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:59,560
No, man, I just shared his cell.

265
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,638
But you were saying you were.

266
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,670
Yeah.

267
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:07,745
So you could get with my sister.

268
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:09,768
Yeah.

269
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,377
- So you could get down her chimney.
- Yeah.

270
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:18,725
And you think tellin' me,
that's gonna help your cause.

271
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:23,822
No !

272
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,085
No ! No !

273
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,995
- Is this him ?
- Please don't hurt him, Gabriel. Don't !

274
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:33,938
- Is this the fucker you been writin' all year ?
- Don't ! Please, don't.

275
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,897
- Is this Nick Cassidy ?
- Yes !

276
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,879
Yes !

277
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:43,904
Well, he better learn
to give you some respect.

278
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:49,753
- Get her outta here.
- No !

279
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,716
No !

280
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:58,021
Man, they got a shitload
of cookies.

281
00:25:58,093 --> 00:25:59,722
Take 'em.

282
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:03,026
What about the tree ?

283
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:06,977
- You want the tree ?
- Yeah.

284
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:21,647
I read your letters, convict.

285
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,996
Don't play no reindeer games
with me.

286
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:40,905
He read your letters.

287
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:44,616
One day I wasn't there
and he came in.

288
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,078
Jane tried to stop him,
but he read your letters.

289
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:50,976
What letters ?

290
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:53,822
He knows you worked
at that casino.

291
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,488
What ?
Oh, my God, you set him up !

292
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,991
No, no, I didn't. I didn't.

293
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:09,035
When did you decide
to do it, Ash ?

294
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:13,445
After which one of his letters ?
What, the for tieth, fiftieth ? The first ? What ?

295
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,874
- No, Nick, you're not...
- Look, I'm not Nick !

296
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:19,377
Okay ? You thought
you'd fuck him over ?

297
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:21,879
Ah, shit ! Guess what ?
He fucked you !

298
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:25,653
Because I never worked in any casino,
and I can't help you because I'm not him !

299
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:29,022
- No, you don't understand. I love you !
- Jesus...

300
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:32,723
- Christ!
- Hey, hey, watch your mouth. It's Christmas.

301
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:35,997
Listen to me. Listen to me.

302
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,397
My brother has killed people.
I know this.

303
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:42,337
You don't know him. You don't know
what he's capable of. He will kill you.

304
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,673
If you keep telling him
that you're not you, he will kill you.

305
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:49,906
Says here the retail industry
does fifty percent of its business...

306
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:54,087
between December 1 and December 25.

307
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,216
That's half a year's business
in one month's time.

308
00:27:57,288 --> 00:28:02,356
It seems to me an intelligent countr would
legislate a second such gift-giving holiday.

309
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:06,056
Create, say, a Christmas Two,
late May or early June,

310
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,402
to further stimulate growth.

311
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:12,364
Ever since you been goin' to night school,
you been giving me headaches, Jumpy.

312
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:16,066
Christmas Two.

313
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:27,451
Just...

314
00:28:32,853 --> 00:28:37,430
"My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy.

315
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:40,962
"I have been dreaming of you
constantly,

316
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:43,497
"and knowing you are out there
makes these walls...

317
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:47,699
"not seem so close
or so strong or so cold.

318
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:52,244
"Someday I'm gonna take you
up by Lake Superior.

319
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:56,854
"Before I went in,
before goddamn Millie,

320
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,158
"I used to work up
at this casino,

321
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,483
"workin' security.

322
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:07,696
"I used to watch for people
stealin' chips, counting cards,

323
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,719
"getting piss-drunk,
that kind of stuff.

324
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:14,068
Indian place.
Easiest job I ever had."

325
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,071
You're a good writer, Nick.

326
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:22,273
I give this writing... an A-plus.

327
00:29:23,336 --> 00:29:26,183
You just tell us
what we need to know,

328
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:30,249
and you two kids, you get to go
live happily-ever-after.

329
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:34,118
You give me
little nieces and nephews.

330
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:39,195
- Listen to me, man. I never worked at a casino.
- No, Nick.

331
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:43,731
That guy who wrote that letter ?
That's Nick Cassidy.

332
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,868
I was in the joint with him.

333
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,901
He rode a two-year
manslaughter bit...

334
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:51,163
for killing some guy who was bothering
his girlfriend in a bar.

335
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:56,012
He's dead. He wrote those letters.
He worked at a casino.

336
00:29:56,075 --> 00:30:00,184
Me ? My last job
was at a Quick Lube.

337
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:04,655
I did five for lifting cars. That's it.
He was my cellmate. That's how l know him.

338
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:07,127
I'm sorry about your sister.

339
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:09,630
I just got out of the joint.

340
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:12,330
I just wanna...

341
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:15,198
I don't know anything. I don't
remember anybody. I just wanna go home.

342
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:27,907
- Bur this guy.
- No. Gabriel, no. - What ?

343
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,983
- Gabriel, you promised.
- I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone.

344
00:30:32,057 --> 00:30:34,215
When he helped us.
This guy doesn't wanna play.

345
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,111
No, you promised me!

346
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:39,292
And you promised me
you'd get your sweetheart to help !

347
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:45,693
He'd rather die... than be with you.

348
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,665
He'd make a fucked-up
boyfriend anyway.

349
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:54,432
Bur this guy
all over the place.

350
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,705
No. No ! Gabriel, no !

351
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:00,312
Shut up !

352
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,465
Don't get no blood
on my shoes.

353
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,866
All right, all right. What do you want to know ?
About the casino, the Tomahawk ?

354
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,276
Jesus Christ,
what do you wanna know ?

355
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:43,759
Six months writing love letters,
my pen pal fucks me over.

356
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,730
Thanks for the stamps, Ash.

357
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:49,035
All right.
What do you wanna know ?

358
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,693
Everthing.

359
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:54,039
Nick, I love you, baby.

360
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:58,000
- Nick, I love you.
- Hey !

361
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:01,242
She said she loves you.
Say something.

362
00:32:02,348 --> 00:32:04,611
I had better sex in prison.

363
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,709
Throw him back in the rig.

364
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,786
Monster, he's not the guy.

365
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,928
Whole time you were drivin',
he was tellin' her he's not the guy.

366
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,430
He's not the guy. I understand
why he'd tell us he's not the guy,

367
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:28,206
but why would he tell her
that he's not the guy ?

368
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,740
Maybe...
Maybe he's not the guy.

369
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,305
Look, if I went in the joint with a library card,
I'd come out with a librar card.

370
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,470
The man who wrote those letters
loved Ashley, boys.

371
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:09,317
He lived for her.

372
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:15,927
Where's she work ?

373
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,981
What ?

374
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:21,192
Wrote you a hundred letters,
didn't she ? Where's she work ?

375
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:23,193
Lindstrom's, beauty and fragrances.

376
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:26,469
What's her middle name ?

377
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:28,271
Samantha.

378
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:36,602
What'd they call her
in high school ?

379
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:40,554
- What'd they call her in college ?
- What college ?

380
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,349
- What's her greatest fear ?
- Brother.

381
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:47,821
Oh, wrong. It's drowning.

382
00:33:47,915 --> 00:33:50,991
Wrong, it's her brother.

383
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,197
That's love.

384
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:05,931
It's time to start talking,

385
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:08,183
Nick.

386
00:34:09,278 --> 00:34:12,886
Time to start tellin' tales.

387
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:19,423
- Get him up here.
- No, no, no ! Fuck that !

388
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,394
Nick doesn't do anything
till Nick gets something for Nick.

389
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:25,199
Ya got it ?
I want some hot chocolate.

390
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:29,098
You wanna hear
about some job of mine ?

391
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:32,602
I wanna see some goddamn
hot chocolate...

392
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,043
and some pecan fuckin' pie !

393
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,107
Sure nice pie.

394
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,417
So, when you worked there...

395
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:56,530
You knew the place...

396
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:12,076
Okay.

397
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:16,205
You know what ? I could really go
for some onion rings.

398
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:18,551
You said talk.
That's all you s...

399
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:21,856
Gabriel, you said
you wanted to talk.

400
00:35:27,694 --> 00:35:30,000
- How much money is in that casino ?
- Hard to say.

401
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:32,773
Well, take a guess.

402
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,100
Five million ?

403
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:41,134
- Jesus. Come here.
- You, you wrote Ash a letter with a stor...

404
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,511
about working Christmas Eve.

405
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:47,682
About how they send half the security
guys home. Nobody's comin' in and out.

406
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:50,018
And the rest of ya
are gettin' shit-faced.

407
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,322
That a true story or not ?

408
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,855
Christmas Eve.

409
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:58,755
We're takin' down that casino,
convict.

410
00:35:58,828 --> 00:36:02,998
And you're the guy
that's gonna tell us how.

411
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,764
That's what we can see.

412
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:13,039
Now, you tell us what we can't see.
Where the private doors go,

413
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:16,542
where the alarms are,
what the upstairs looks like, all of it.

414
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:19,973
- That's not the Tomahawk.
- What the hell are you talkin' about ?

415
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:24,456
What's this, the cage ?
I mean, the cage is over here.

416
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,457
Ya got...
This whole thing's mixed up.

417
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,552
- That's what it looks like, Romeo.
- Since when ?

418
00:36:28,657 --> 00:36:30,524
I mean, what's this ?

419
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:34,663
- That's the prime rib buffet. $ 5.99.
- Buffet ?

420
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:37,864
Buffet is over here
by the bar.

421
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:40,972
They must've remodeled
the place.

422
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:43,400
- What ?
- Big guy, the boss.

423
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:48,049
- The guy that ran the place, was in charge.
- Jack Bangs.

424
00:36:48,144 --> 00:36:51,981
Jack Bangs ! Was always talkin'
about giving the place a makeover.

425
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:54,317
Must've gone ahead and done that
while I was in the Mountain.

426
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,289
I mean, this thing's
all changed around.

427
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,155
I can't help you with this. I don't
know where security or anything is.

428
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:05,421
- I have no idea.
- Look, I don't care about the pancake breakfast. I...

429
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:07,422
You wanna know about money,
right ?

430
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:11,874
Okay. Where you got the buffet down here ?
That used to be Bang's office.

431
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:14,939
And he kept a safe in there.

432
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:19,736
And that safe had all the money
that he was skimming in there.

433
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:23,812
- And it was called the pow-wow safe.
- Pow-wow safe ?

434
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:26,920
Yes, pow-wow safe.

435
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:29,892
'Cause he was stealing money
from the tribe.

436
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,728
The guy had thousands in there.
Millions probably.

437
00:37:32,822 --> 00:37:37,325
Millions ?
In the pow-wow safe ?

438
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,901
Millions.

439
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:44,269
But, I mean, you know,

440
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,865
it's just that now you
tell me his office is moved.

441
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,441
God knows what else is different.
You know ?

442
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:52,475
The security, the...

443
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:56,780
You want me to show you
what goes where, l have no idea!

444
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,223
Well, I guess
we don't need you then.

445
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:12,962
Well, not necessarily.

446
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:18,696
Because, if you get me inside,
then I know where the money moves.

447
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:21,772
I know the security routines.
I know their signals to each other.

448
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:24,807
I know how they operate.
You get me in there,

449
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:28,956
then I can work with this map,
and I can tell you if anything's changed.

450
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:31,282
Wrong, convict.

451
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,889
You walk in there,
they recognize you.

452
00:38:33,993 --> 00:38:36,224
So what ?

453
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:39,268
If they recognize him, they'll
remember him when the job goes down.

454
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,000
- They won't recognize me. Trust me.
- Why not ?

455
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:47,629
'Cause you're gonna get me
a disguise.

456
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,039
What happened to working together?

457
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:55,638
- Your at herbeback in the Mountain ?
- Might as well be.

458
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:59,985
Don't get 50 channels
in the Mountain. Sleep well.

459
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,354
Tomorrow you got singin'
for your supper to do.

460
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:10,131
Help yourself.

461
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:13,227
Sure, take that.
I don't need it.

462
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,451
Nick. Nick.

463
00:39:29,544 --> 00:39:31,546
Let me help you.

464
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:34,652
- Get your own room, Ashley. Get your own room.
- Let me help you.

465
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:37,186
He said when you come out,
he wants to talk to you. That's all !

466
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,552
I thought he meant after
New Years, back in Detroit.

467
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:42,962
- But you knew what he wanted. Right ?
- I thought we had more days.

468
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:45,737
For what ? What are you gonna do ?
Talk me into helping ?

469
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,300
You know how I feel about my brother !
You know how I hate him.

470
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:52,836
What did you think's gonna happen ?
This thing's gonna be over and he's gonna let me go ?

471
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,671
He's gonna shoot me
in the back of the head like this !

472
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:59,405
Or I'm back in prison for the rest
of my life, and that's it for me !

473
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:03,148
This is my life too, you know.
You think he's just gonna let me walk ?

474
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:06,817
You think he's not gonna
take this out on me ?

475
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,894
I'm in this too,
and I'm really scared.

476
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:16,661
Please ! Nick.

477
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:23,406
Do you remember all
those letters you wrote me ?

478
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:27,034
About me and you
against the whole world ?

479
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:34,312
God !

480
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:38,817
You know, it's just my luck.

481
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:43,551
I finally meet a boy that I'm crazy about,
and my brother wants him worse than I do.

482
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:45,552
Why didn't you tell me
your brother was a criminal ?

483
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:49,764
Gabriel knows some guys
in Miami and New York.

484
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:52,600
Guys that he helps
get guns to Detroit.

485
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:55,707
- That's it. That's all I know.
- And that's who he's working for on this one ?

486
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:58,773
No. He doesn't
wanna work for anyone.

487
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:02,078
- What's the last place they took down ?
- What ?

488
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:05,779
Monster and his merry men.
What's the last place they robbed ?

489
00:41:05,872 --> 00:41:07,885
Who they ripped off ?
What did they do ?

490
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:15,132
I don't think they've robbed anywhere
before. They just... They drive guns !

491
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:18,489
They've never done a robber ?

492
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,338
Really ?

493
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:28,039
They really do need me.

494
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:31,344
They actually need me.

495
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,917
A cowboy.

496
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:48,495
You're sending me into an lndian casino
dressed like a cowboy.

497
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,165
- Thought this through entirely ?
- It was that or a ballerina.

498
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:56,429
Well, I mean, I'm gonna need
some money. It is a casino.

499
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,282
- Ten bucks ? What am I gonna do with ten bucks ?
- Don't tip.

500
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:07,743
Look, if we're
gonna be workin' together,

501
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:10,683
you shouldn't send me in there like the
Lone Ranger with ten bucks to throw down.

502
00:42:10,787 --> 00:42:15,687
You want me to not get noticed. Not
gettin' noticed costs at least a couple hundred.

503
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,554
Ante up, boys.

504
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:55,433
Don't lose.

505
00:42:55,495 --> 00:43:00,071
Yeah. Do I get, like, a countr-western
name, or are we just gonna...

506
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:04,399
You get recognized, you get
a countr-western funeral !

507
00:43:04,503 --> 00:43:06,943
Come on. Come on.

508
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:09,852
Get your hands off me !

509
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:14,858
Are you ready
to go gamblin', darlin' ?

510
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,622
Here. She is now.

511
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:22,187
All right. You all keep an eye
on my guitar now.

512
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:33,029
Jumpy.

513
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:43,581
Nick, you're making it
really hard to apologize.

514
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:46,188
Is that what you're trin' to do ?
Say it with car keys.

515
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,190
Nick, a lot of relationships start out
like this, you know, family problems ?

516
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:52,120
Save it, Bam-Bam.

517
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,656
You wanna know the problem
with the Tomahawk Casino ?

518
00:43:56,729 --> 00:44:00,900
You wanna know the one thing
holding us back from greatness ?

519
00:44:00,963 --> 00:44:05,163
Snow. S-N-O-fucking-W.
Snow.

520
00:44:05,236 --> 00:44:08,572
There is no snow in Las Vegas, okay ?

521
00:44:08,636 --> 00:44:10,669
They don't want it.
They don't need it.

522
00:44:10,742 --> 00:44:13,578
As a matter of fact,
I think they have laws against the shit.

523
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:19,479
You guys hired me because you wanted
Las Vegas quality. I brought it to you.

524
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:22,952
You wanted Las Vegas press.
I gave that to you.

525
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:25,630
But I cannot give you
Las Vegas profits...

526
00:44:25,683 --> 00:44:29,093
until you people get together
around a campfire, smoke a pipe,

527
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:33,096
and do some kind of spirit dance
about this goddamn snow !

528
00:44:33,169 --> 00:44:36,871
They did a lot of work. This restaurant
here is the main expansion.

529
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:39,978
And, they moved the games around.

530
00:44:47,014 --> 00:44:49,381
Do you know that guy ?

531
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:52,687
Yeah, that's... that's Mike.

532
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,523
Mike. He works here.

533
00:44:56,586 --> 00:44:59,996
Spend some of your brother's money.
I'm gonna go look around.

534
00:45:01,664 --> 00:45:04,730
I was just thinkin', maybe you fellas
would like to stick around,

535
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:08,868
try the $ 5.99 prime rib.

536
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,155
A couple of rum and cokes, please.

537
00:45:25,218 --> 00:45:28,991
Barry, gimme a bottle
of any goddamn thing ya got. Hurry up.

538
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:33,026
Cheap two dollar fuckin' bettors.

539
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:37,968
Hey, how ya doin', cowboy ?
How are ya ?

540
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:40,471
- Great.
- Jack Bangs is the name. I run the place.

541
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:44,975
Let me ask you something.

542
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:48,675
How'd you hear about us ?
Radio ? TV ? Cable ?

543
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,575
Prison. Prison.

544
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:00,761
I can't go back to Vegas.

545
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,241
We won! We won!

546
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:18,474
What the hell
was that all about ?

547
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:21,478
Nothing, man. He just wanted to know
how I heard about the place.

548
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,480
Just fuckin' tone down a little bit,
all right ? Ease up off me.

549
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:28,181
Oh, my God !
I'm sorry.

550
00:46:28,255 --> 00:46:30,183
Jesus Christ.

551
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:32,321
I'm sorry. Here, hold this.

552
00:46:32,394 --> 00:46:34,322
What are you doing ?

553
00:46:34,396 --> 00:46:38,796
Security's not all that changed.
Let me go clean this up.

554
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:41,935
- What was that ?
- His face fell off. Take this.

555
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:03,495
Hey, a hundred bucks
to wear this jacket.

556
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:06,654
- Jesus, don't kill me !
- Relax, kid, nobody's gonna kill you.

557
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:08,803
Santa's gonna give you a hundred bucks
and a wild west jacket.

558
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:15,965
Hey, baby.
Gimme one of those.

559
00:47:20,344 --> 00:47:23,118
- How're you ?
- Fuckin' freezing.

560
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,476
How long you work here ?

561
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:29,948
Five years, since it opened.

562
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,950
- How long since your makeover ?
- My what ?

563
00:47:33,023 --> 00:47:36,693
I'm talkin' about the place. The
remodeling, moving everthing around.

564
00:47:36,756 --> 00:47:41,489
The Tomahawk's been the same ever since I started,
buddy. It's the losers that change.

565
00:47:44,138 --> 00:47:46,567
Lyin' motherfucker !

566
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:51,873
Go, kid, go !

567
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,882
Hey !

568
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:03,885
Shit !

569
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:30,243
- It's your jacket, you can have it !
He gave me a hundred bucks. - Shit !

570
00:48:37,717 --> 00:48:40,961
- What the hell happened, man ?
- The man fucked up !

571
00:48:41,023 --> 00:48:44,736
This building is the same from day one !
It hasn't been changed !

572
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,906
Monster, he was talkin' to the manager
inside there. There he is !

573
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,371
Go, go, go, go !

574
00:48:56,444 --> 00:48:58,571
Come on !
Get him back !

575
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:22,968
Keep on running, Romeo !
Keep on running !

576
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:26,440
As fast as you go,
we'll get there !

577
00:49:26,503 --> 00:49:30,475
- We're truckers, motherfucker!
We drive for a living !

578
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:57,574
Help ! Help !

579
00:49:57,635 --> 00:50:00,982
He thinks he's gettin' away.

580
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,081
Oh, shit !

581
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:24,432
No !

582
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,428
Come on. Come on!

583
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,373
We gotta get to those trees.

584
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:15,760
Oh, shit !

585
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:57,665
C'mon ! Get 'em outta there !
C'mon !

586
00:51:57,737 --> 00:52:00,167
- Is she all right ?
- All right, all right !

587
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,213
At the rate you're goin', I'm gonna
have trouble considerin' you family.

588
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:08,841
Hey, there !
You folks need some help ?

589
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:16,723
- I say, you need some help ?
- Get outta here, man !

590
00:52:16,786 --> 00:52:20,226
- Shut the fuck up !
- Get the fuck outta here !

591
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:24,461
Well, if you need
some help...

592
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:29,142
Gabriel, no!

593
00:52:29,195 --> 00:52:33,197
Gabriel, he won't hurt us.
He won't remember us. Don't do it.

594
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:35,199
Shut the fuck up !

595
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:39,151
No !

596
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:44,886
Oh, God !

597
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:59,231
What's this ? What's this ?
This isn't the Tomahawk. No.

598
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:01,233
No, I've never seen this before.

599
00:53:01,296 --> 00:53:03,777
They must have given the place
a makeover. Yeah !

600
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:07,781
The buffet was over here, the blackjack was over here,
the bar used to be over here.

601
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,908
I don't know. I can't help you.
I have no idea.

602
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:12,181
I have no idea !

603
00:53:12,243 --> 00:53:15,517
Somethin' tells me you're not
being totally honest with me.

604
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:17,519
What'd you tell
that casino manager ?

605
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:21,491
- Nothin'. Nothin'.
- You was talking to him. What'd you tell him ?

606
00:53:21,554 --> 00:53:23,650
Nothin'.

607
00:53:23,724 --> 00:53:25,693
He thought I was some gambler.
Nothin' I said.

608
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:27,799
Maybe something about a robbery ?

609
00:53:27,894 --> 00:53:30,031
No, man, I swear to...
I swear to God.

610
00:53:33,607 --> 00:53:37,537
Jesus Christ, man !
He thought I was some gambler !

611
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,915
He didn't know me, man !

612
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,939
He didn't recognize me ! Jesus Christ !

613
00:53:44,044 --> 00:53:47,473
I've been drivin' rigs
a long time, convict.

614
00:53:47,578 --> 00:53:51,728
Four, five million miles of road.
Hard road.

615
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,231
Tell 'em I was tired, shit,
they'd just hire someone else.

616
00:53:55,283 --> 00:53:59,663
A thousand miles by sundown
or the gang don't eat come sunrise.

617
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:02,393
Shit.

618
00:54:02,468 --> 00:54:06,034
And ever road, ever mile,

619
00:54:06,096 --> 00:54:11,673
it's nothin' but moms and pops and
car-seat kiddies giving me that look...

620
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:15,677
- to go to hell and get off
their happy goddamn highway.

621
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:20,087
So I have worked...

622
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,850
and I have slaved,

623
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:27,063
and I have waited...
for the highways to split open...

624
00:54:27,115 --> 00:54:30,920
and for the rivers to roil
and for God in the heavens...

625
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:35,467
to reach down and show me
some sign of my reward,

626
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:38,771
to grant me with my gift
and say to me,

627
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:44,736
"Gabriel, my son,
you are done with the road."

628
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:49,739
Well, convict,

629
00:54:50,814 --> 00:54:52,888
that gift was granted.

630
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:55,286
Look, man, I swear to God,

631
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:57,820
he just wanted to know how I heard
about the place, that's all.

632
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:02,158
He didn't know it was me, Gabriel.
He didn't know it was me ! Please !

633
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:06,005
Man, Monster, just don't
start tring to hit me.

634
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:13,408
Nick, I've been tring
to hit you.

635
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:22,843
Because I do not deserve
to be in some shit-bag motel...

636
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:25,555
in the middle
of bum-fuck Michigan,

637
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,983
throwing darts at a worthless...

638
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:30,685
convict!

639
00:55:39,432 --> 00:55:42,602
You know somethin' ?

640
00:55:42,675 --> 00:55:45,375
My little sister...

641
00:55:45,437 --> 00:55:48,149
she deserves
a world better than you.

642
00:55:51,203 --> 00:55:53,611
Tonight we're gonna take
one more look at that map,

643
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:58,616
and this time, you better have
somethin' worth saying.

644
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,693
What did they do to you, Nick ?

645
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:05,227
He had some... points to make.

646
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:07,426
What the fuck did you do to him ?

647
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:12,369
Bastard.
Get out ! Get out !

648
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:14,370
Just get out !

649
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:17,571
Okay. Come here.

650
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:19,573
Jesus.

651
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:21,606
There you go. Okay.

652
00:56:23,608 --> 00:56:26,413
All I wanted to do was to
make it back to Sidnaw...

653
00:56:26,485 --> 00:56:28,717
and have some of
Mom's gravy, you know,

654
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,251
and some of Aunt Elizabeth's
cranberry cakes.

655
00:56:31,324 --> 00:56:35,098
She makes 'em with, real cranberries.

656
00:56:35,151 --> 00:56:37,830
It's... really good.

657
00:56:37,893 --> 00:56:39,905
- We'll get there, baby.
- Jesus.

658
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:43,199
We'll get there.

659
00:56:43,262 --> 00:56:45,701
Just rest, okay ?

660
00:56:51,343 --> 00:56:53,772
You saved my life, Nick.

661
00:56:56,117 --> 00:56:58,818
You could've run, but you didn't.

662
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,382
- You saved me.
- You saved me.

663
00:57:01,486 --> 00:57:04,688
I saved you because
I love you, Nick.

664
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,128
Why did you save me ?

665
00:57:10,891 --> 00:57:15,595
The guy I was in with...
Rudy, the car thief...

666
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:19,869
sometimes I read him your letters.

667
00:57:19,942 --> 00:57:23,080
I mean, I know
they were private, but,

668
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:25,081
you know,

669
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:30,911
I'd read 'em to him,
and he'd get this look on his face.

670
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,363
I swear, I think he imagined
you were writing to him.

671
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:39,095
And I know sometimes,

672
00:57:39,157 --> 00:57:41,399
I think,

673
00:57:41,462 --> 00:57:44,569
he fell in love with you too.

674
00:57:45,726 --> 00:57:48,677
You gave a couple of guys hope, Ashley.

675
00:57:49,906 --> 00:57:52,639
Hope is a good thing.

676
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,141
We're gonna get out of this... together.

677
00:57:56,214 --> 00:57:59,114
I promise you. I promise you.

678
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,910
Start singing, Nick.

679
00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:30,174
I have no gifts to bring...

680
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:35,022
A gift to give a King...

681
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,933
It's a joke, anyways.

682
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:56,677
All right.

683
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,712
What you wanna do,

684
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:03,309
is get to the top level
up here.

685
00:59:03,381 --> 00:59:07,311
Okay ? And you do that through
this door on the western wall.

686
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:11,763
When you...

687
00:59:11,817 --> 00:59:13,891
You wanna get to the security,

688
00:59:13,963 --> 00:59:16,166
and then from the security
you get down to the cashier cage,

689
00:59:16,226 --> 00:59:18,166
and then you go
into the count room.

690
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:21,002
There'll be a guard in there,
but he doesn't have a gun.

691
00:59:21,064 --> 00:59:23,430
The door's accessed
by a keypad.

692
00:59:23,504 --> 00:59:27,330
- The cashier'll know the code.
- What about the pow-wow safe ?

693
00:59:27,403 --> 00:59:30,083
That's upstairs !
You'll wanna get to that.

694
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:32,241
We're gonna get
to the pow-wow safe.

695
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:34,546
That's good.
We're gonna get there.

696
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:37,380
What you wanna do is,
you got to get a guy in the cage...

697
00:59:37,444 --> 00:59:40,019
and a guy on the foor
and somebody up top.

698
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:42,293
Then you need a sweeper
on the side,

699
00:59:42,356 --> 00:59:46,629
look out out front
and somebody watching the back.

700
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:48,903
So that's... how many ?
That's six.

701
00:59:48,956 --> 00:59:51,029
Well, we got five.

702
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:53,229
We're keeping Ashley outside.

703
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:56,639
And you need six.

704
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:58,641
No.

705
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:03,144
I... Look, man, I'm not
making this shit up, you know ?

706
01:00:03,218 --> 01:00:07,149
You go in there with five guys, you're gonna
either leave an exit or an alarm unguarded.

707
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:10,224
- No.
- I know what I'm talking about.

708
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:12,757
Raise your hand if you've
ever done a robber before.

709
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:16,491
Anyone ? Anyone ?
Who's done... done a robbery,

710
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:18,493
raise your hand.

711
01:00:18,554 --> 01:00:21,538
Okay. I have.

712
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:27,595
You need six, Gabriel.

713
01:00:27,668 --> 01:00:31,005
You do. What are you
gonna do about it ?

714
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:42,484
All right. I want a drawing
of that security level.

715
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:45,684
Ever door, ever guard,
ever ashtray.

716
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,823
Yeah. All right.

717
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,959
So, six guys,
that's six guns.

718
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:54,464
No way.

719
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,298
Well, what am I gonna do ?
I'm no threat without a gun.

720
01:00:57,372 --> 01:01:02,439
- No, you're not.
- What's the matter, Gabriel ?

721
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,141
Isn't this what
you wanted him for ?

722
01:01:07,214 --> 01:01:10,989
- Areas of expertise ?
- No guns.

723
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,992
Well, you know, fine.
It's up to you.

724
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:16,589
What you've got to figure out is how you're
gonna get up to that security level...

725
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:18,590
without anybody knowing
anything's wrong.

726
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:21,624
I can tell you right now, going
in there with A.K.s and ski masks...

727
01:01:21,697 --> 01:01:25,628
ain't gonna do that.

728
01:01:25,701 --> 01:01:28,307
Well, that part, Nick,

729
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:31,070
was planned out the day
I read your letters.

730
01:01:31,132 --> 01:01:34,605
Oh, yeah. What ? We're all gonna
dress up like cowboys ?

731
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:37,315
No, no, not cowboys, Nick.

732
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:39,578
Not on Christmas Eve.

733
01:01:49,086 --> 01:01:51,360
You gotta be kidding me.

734
01:01:52,924 --> 01:01:54,864
'Tis the season, convict.

735
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,294
Coming up at 11:00...

736
01:01:59,366 --> 01:02:01,442
on the channel five news,
these top stories.

737
01:02:01,494 --> 01:02:05,040
- The search intensifies for a Michiganman...
- Here's your Picasso.

738
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:07,146
reported missing this morning
on the Tallahassee Lake.

739
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:10,180
- Investigators suspect foul play to be involved.
- It better be.

740
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:12,181
Also, lotter fever...

741
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,024
How long have you guys
been going out ?

742
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:03,667
- Set us up with free drinks.
- Oh, yeah.

743
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,310
Shit !

744
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:48,750
Only guy in the gun club
who doesn't keep a gun in his truck.

745
01:03:54,985 --> 01:03:56,924
Shit!

746
01:03:56,986 --> 01:03:59,594
Fucker decided
to build him a silicone tongue...

747
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:01,596
so that the boy could talk.

748
01:04:01,668 --> 01:04:04,899
Now, you ever see a motherfucker with
a breast-implanted tongue ?

749
01:04:04,962 --> 01:04:09,070
This guy I'm talking about... black-ass
lung is the least of his problems, man.

750
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:12,303
He had so much smoke
comin' out of his skin,

751
01:04:12,376 --> 01:04:17,495
- people would say, "Hey, where's
the barbecue ?" - Yeah.

752
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:26,045
No! No!

753
01:04:26,117 --> 01:04:29,892
No! Getaway from me, goddamnit!

754
01:04:31,195 --> 01:04:33,625
Stay the hell away from me.
You want me to scream ?

755
01:04:33,699 --> 01:04:35,627
I'll fucking scream,
I swear to God.

756
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:39,338
- Listen, I was just trying to stop him.
- You just about killed me !

757
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:42,862
When I saw you fall, I could have put
the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger.

758
01:04:42,937 --> 01:04:46,616
I swear to God, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

759
01:04:46,669 --> 01:04:50,140
I know that you
have tobe with him,

760
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:52,153
but it is killing me.

761
01:04:53,653 --> 01:04:56,354
Gabriel, we just have to
keep doing this, and...

762
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:58,981
He's helped us do the map.

763
01:04:59,055 --> 01:05:01,358
He's done what we need.

764
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:03,360
We don't need him anymore.

765
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,362
No !

766
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:08,836
Jesus !

767
01:05:11,765 --> 01:05:13,704
You drive me crazy,
you know that ?

768
01:05:13,766 --> 01:05:15,977
- Hey...
- No!

769
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:20,252
You listen to me, because
we have to be smart about this.

770
01:05:20,302 --> 01:05:24,046
The more he wants me,
the more his help's for real.

771
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:26,455
He's manpower.

772
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:29,885
- That's all he is.
- He wants the money.

773
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:31,888
No, baby.

774
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:38,196
He wants me.

775
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:42,469
Your little sister.

776
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,402
If only Ma and Pop...

777
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:51,905
Could see us now.

778
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,016
lf only this guy would
play the game by the numbers.

779
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:03,219
From where I stand, the only thing
he's been doing right so far...

780
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:05,752
is fucking my girlfriend.

781
01:06:05,824 --> 01:06:07,796
Baby.

782
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:11,798
- He's nothing. Nothing.
- See you later, assholes.

783
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:13,801
- Who's Jumpy calling ? Which one ?
- Ex-wife, probably.

784
01:06:13,864 --> 01:06:16,970
All the ex-wives he's got, he's probably
gonna have to take down three casinos.

785
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:21,506
- You track down Gabriel ? - Nah, he's with his
girlfriend, making up for lost "Nicky" time.

786
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,946
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

787
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:26,376
No, l should go and check on Romeo.

788
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:29,379
Go smile on
the motherfucker in love.

789
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,380
Shit !

790
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,562
You know what ?
I'll meet you in the bar.

791
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:09,560
Fuck !

792
01:07:36,314 --> 01:07:38,952
Come on.

793
01:07:42,153 --> 01:07:44,092
Come on.
Give me something.

794
01:07:44,156 --> 01:07:47,158
I can hot-wire cars. I should
fuckin' hot-wire a hotel room.

795
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:51,267
Damn.

796
01:07:58,376 --> 01:08:01,275
Who's slamming doors ?

797
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,869
How ya doin' ?

798
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:43,157
And your... your charges, sir.

799
01:08:43,262 --> 01:08:45,192
Happy holidays.

800
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:58,673
That's for the hundred bucks'
worth of pay-per-view.

801
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,677
That's for the two hundred
you took out of the mini bar.

802
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,148
- That's enough !
- It was on my credit card !

803
01:09:06,211 --> 01:09:08,682
I figured since you guys
were paying for the room...

804
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:15,220
So, you wanted a weapon, convict ?

805
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:21,433
Don't ! Don't !

806
01:09:25,302 --> 01:09:29,337
Well, now, look at what
Santa's dwarves have brought you.

807
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:32,537
What do you say to Santa's dwarves ?

808
01:09:32,641 --> 01:09:34,717
Elves. Santa's elves.

809
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,949
You say, "Thank you," motherfucker.

810
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:45,352
You hang around with criminals,

811
01:09:45,424 --> 01:09:47,426
you end up making
a lot of plans.

812
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:50,793
But all the jobs I ever pulled,

813
01:09:50,888 --> 01:09:55,997
all the cars I ever stole, no plan ever
went down the way it had been drawn up.

814
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,573
My plans to escape never worked.

815
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:03,107
And being on parole,
going to the police wasn't an option.

816
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:06,110
What's the matter ?
You nervous ?

817
01:10:08,153 --> 01:10:10,614
Right now you're
just a truck driver.

818
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:13,252
You haven't done
anything wrong yet.

819
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:17,286
If you do this, you're gonna spend the
rest of your life wishing you hadn't.

820
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:19,987
Thanks for the reminder, Nick.

821
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:23,324
Relax. Have a drink.

822
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,528
Ain't that your thing ?

823
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:51,099
Hey, hey! Thirsty!

824
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:55,802
This diversion you're doing...

825
01:10:55,896 --> 01:10:58,534
you'd better do it
just the way Monster planned.

826
01:10:58,627 --> 01:11:02,204
Or there ain't gonna be
no more rest of your life.

827
01:11:15,049 --> 01:11:20,127
- And all through the house,
not a creature was stirring.

828
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:27,737
Why don't you send
most of your boys home, Ed.

829
01:11:27,832 --> 01:11:30,563
Tom, why don't you go spend Christmas
with your family.

830
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:33,900
Don, you can shove off.
Merry Christmas, Jack.

831
01:11:36,006 --> 01:11:38,601
Nobody even comes here
to cheat.

832
01:11:38,705 --> 01:11:42,647
Hello !

833
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,409
Eggnog for everyone !
Santa's here !

834
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:48,579
Good to see you. Merry Christmas !
Merry Christmas !

835
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:52,324
We'd like some money, please.

836
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:55,294
We're here to win money.
Do you have any money ?

837
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,296
How are you gentlemen
doing tonight ?

838
01:11:57,368 --> 01:11:59,329
Ver good, captain,
except that we're out of work.

839
01:11:59,392 --> 01:12:02,374
Season's greetings.
He's from Lindstrom's.

840
01:12:02,426 --> 01:12:04,667
I'm from Saveaway.
How ya doin' ?

841
01:12:04,771 --> 01:12:08,140
No more toys for the kiddies,
but we do have charitable donations.

842
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:15,886
All right. All in ?

843
01:12:17,085 --> 01:12:19,015
Hey, sweetheart,
how ya doin' ?

844
01:12:19,087 --> 01:12:21,047
- I'm fuckin' freezin'. What can I get you ?
- Twenty-one.

845
01:12:21,152 --> 01:12:25,052
- Oh, Jesus ! You just hit for my card !
- I'm not sorry, mister.

846
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:28,357
- Dealerhas 18.
- And look at that, grandpa.

847
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:30,556
Yeah, I'm gonna win your sled.

848
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:33,798
- Save away !
- Over here. I saved you a seat.

849
01:12:33,903 --> 01:12:36,332
- Play my hand.
- Lindstrom's, how ya doin' ?

850
01:12:36,405 --> 01:12:38,335
Aren't you gonna
take those beards off ?

851
01:12:38,408 --> 01:12:41,107
No, I'm not gonna take this beard off.
It's my lucky beard.

852
01:12:41,212 --> 01:12:43,912
Mind my beard. Watch out for this guy.
He's a fucking jinx.

853
01:12:44,016 --> 01:12:46,748
Okay, Santa number three,
what can I get you ?

854
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:49,752
Could fat man with fying horse
get quarters, please ?

855
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,088
- Watch my bank.
- All right.

856
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:56,288
Five. Nine.

857
01:12:56,382 --> 01:12:59,927
No wa... Pop, you're... Damn it,
you're hitting for my card. No.

858
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,959
- You don't even know what it is.
- He doesn't hit.

859
01:13:02,033 --> 01:13:04,066
Why don't you go find a chimney
somewhere and fall in?

860
01:13:04,161 --> 01:13:08,342
Son of a bitch !
You are killing me here !

861
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:10,040
That's the way it goes.

862
01:13:10,103 --> 01:13:12,345
There's two more coming.

863
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:16,505
There you go. That's what l like to see.
Now that's the spirit.

864
01:13:16,578 --> 01:13:20,384
- Jack, is there a union for department store Santas ?
- Hey, who the fuck knows ?

865
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:23,282
Get... Go... Get another table
for old people !

866
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:25,858
You're taking Santa's money !

867
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,361
- There is no other table.
- Then open another table !

868
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:31,696
What kind of a people
cheats Santa Claus ?

869
01:13:31,758 --> 01:13:33,698
- What the hell are you doing ?
- For God's sakes !

870
01:13:33,761 --> 01:13:36,827
- That was Santa's money! You took it!
- Security !

871
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:39,275
- Hey ! Come here, buddy !
- You cheated !

872
01:13:39,329 --> 01:13:42,175
Lay down, pop. It's all right.

873
01:13:42,236 --> 01:13:45,678
Santa Claus is kicking the shit
out of your guards.

874
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:54,248
Security room. Downstairs.

875
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,490
Right, right. Take a right.
Security room.

876
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:02,621
Fuck.

877
01:14:05,759 --> 01:14:07,698
Fuckin' convict ! Jesus !

878
01:14:09,534 --> 01:14:12,537
Turn off the fucking alarm !

879
01:14:12,609 --> 01:14:15,570
Drop 'em ! Put the guns down !

880
01:14:15,643 --> 01:14:18,042
Put the guns down !
Put 'em down !

881
01:14:18,114 --> 01:14:20,419
Get away from that alarm !

882
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:23,244
Put 'em down, fucking right now !

883
01:14:23,317 --> 01:14:26,225
Now, now, now ! Drop 'em !

884
01:14:26,277 --> 01:14:28,155
Get down !

885
01:14:31,283 --> 01:14:33,659
Don't !

886
01:14:33,732 --> 01:14:36,495
Your piss is all you need, Romeo.

887
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:44,471
- Move, goddamn you !
- Come on ! These guys aren't fucking around !

888
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:47,808
Let's go ! Get in there !

889
01:14:47,871 --> 01:14:51,405
All right. Just...
Just do what my friends say.

890
01:14:51,478 --> 01:14:54,481
They're a little bit, disturbed.

891
01:15:08,524 --> 01:15:10,830
What's the security code
for the count room ?

892
01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:12,904
You just use... use a key.

893
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,334
- Nick said code !
- Who the fuck is Nick ? Who's Nick ?

894
01:15:34,195 --> 01:15:36,698
Drop your gun !

895
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,054
All right, all right, all right !

896
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:42,735
You motherfucker !
No guns in the count room !

897
01:15:45,299 --> 01:15:47,540
Fuck you !

898
01:15:51,315 --> 01:15:54,547
- No guns in the count room !
- Forget about him and get the money !

899
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,914
Forget about him
and get the fucking money!

900
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:04,056
Forget about him.

901
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:07,257
There's no future for people
like you and me, Nick.

902
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:12,428
The places we come from...
plant towns, mill towns, small lives !

903
01:16:12,492 --> 01:16:15,494
No future, just more of the same !

904
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:18,069
You want a future,
you gotta stand up and steal it.

905
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:31,155
Oh, my God !

906
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:33,614
Oh, my God.

907
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:36,617
Oh, my God.

908
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,863
The pow-wow safe ! I want
the pow-wow safe ! Where is it ?

909
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:45,469
I can't go back...
I can't go back to Las Vegas.

910
01:16:48,502 --> 01:16:50,568
Fuck !

911
01:16:50,631 --> 01:16:54,436
I do not give a shit about Vegas !

912
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,605
The money is in the car.

913
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:59,441
- Let's get out of here right now.
- He won't tell us where it is.

914
01:16:59,513 --> 01:17:02,089
- What ?
- The pow-wow safe.

915
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,321
Remember Nick Cassidy ?
A security guard named Nick Cassidy ?

916
01:17:05,383 --> 01:17:08,720
Yeah, Nick Cassidy. Nick.
Where is he ?

917
01:17:08,794 --> 01:17:11,723
Gabriel, we have enough money.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

918
01:17:11,796 --> 01:17:13,725
Where is he ?

919
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:20,408
That's not Nick Cassidy.

920
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:24,234
Nick Cassidy worked for me
two years ago.

921
01:17:29,073 --> 01:17:32,181
Cowboy. Hope along.

922
01:17:34,045 --> 01:17:35,985
Fuck !

923
01:17:36,048 --> 01:17:39,186
It's the stor of your life, Ash.

924
01:17:39,248 --> 01:17:41,823
You fucked the wrong guy !

925
01:17:44,587 --> 01:17:47,828
Rudy Duncan, honey. Are we still
gonna spend Christmas together ?

926
01:17:47,892 --> 01:17:50,498
- You fucking bastard !
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

927
01:17:50,561 --> 01:17:52,636
No, goddamn it !

928
01:17:52,698 --> 01:17:55,274
You are lucky, convict.

929
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,810
You're gonna be spending Christmas
with the birthday boy Himself.

930
01:18:00,873 --> 01:18:03,354
Wait a minute.
There is a pow-wow safe. All right ?

931
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:05,783
There is a pow-wow safe.
I did time with Nick Cassidy.

932
01:18:05,856 --> 01:18:07,785
Some shit he told me,
some shit I remember.

933
01:18:07,857 --> 01:18:10,455
He told me the manager keeps
a secret stash in his office.

934
01:18:10,516 --> 01:18:12,457
- A pow-wow safe.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

935
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:15,324
- No, there is no safe ! He's stalling us !
- He told me ! He said it !

936
01:18:15,396 --> 01:18:17,994
- There is no safe !
- I over heard it!

937
01:18:18,066 --> 01:18:21,496
- He's been stalling us from day one. There's no safe.
- There's a pow-wow safe !

938
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,528
- I heard it!
- Then where the fuck is it ?

939
01:18:23,602 --> 01:18:26,177
Behind the liquor cabinet.

940
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:33,777
Oh, Jesus !

941
01:18:56,707 --> 01:18:58,864
- Hey, hey !
- Oh, please.

942
01:18:58,937 --> 01:19:00,866
- Get up. Get up. Open it.
- Oh, please, sir.

943
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:03,869
- I can't go back to Vegas. I can't go...
- I don't give a fuck about that !

944
01:19:03,942 --> 01:19:05,870
Get up ! Open it !

945
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08,613
Hurry up !

946
01:19:19,091 --> 01:19:21,394
Pow-wow.

947
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:23,866
Pow-wow.

948
01:19:41,851 --> 01:19:43,957
Hey, Santa Claus !

949
01:19:44,009 --> 01:19:45,960
Welcome to the Tomahawk !

950
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:57,126
Oh, shit !

951
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,448
Get up.

952
01:20:31,762 --> 01:20:35,141
Yeah. God... is good.

953
01:20:36,674 --> 01:20:40,646
Now, what do you say...

954
01:20:40,718 --> 01:20:42,648
to Santa's dwarves ?

955
01:20:44,576 --> 01:20:48,485
You say, "Thank you."

956
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:05,932
Never make
the same mistake twice.

957
01:22:06,006 --> 01:22:09,164
You just did.

958
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:32,530
I picked the wrong guy.

959
01:22:32,593 --> 01:22:35,198
We took the place down
with the wrong guy !

960
01:22:35,262 --> 01:22:38,264
Is this Christmas ?

961
01:22:38,337 --> 01:22:40,538
Is this Christmas ?

962
01:22:42,842 --> 01:22:45,981
God bless us, everyone.

963
01:23:24,391 --> 01:23:26,444
Come on.

964
01:23:27,853 --> 01:23:30,448
Smart, aren't you ?
So smart.

965
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:32,857
You're smarter than everbody ?

966
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:36,495
Pow-wow safe. A little gift for us
in the pow-wow safe.

967
01:23:36,559 --> 01:23:41,730
Well, I've got a gift for you from Pug
and Merlin and Jumpy, you son of a bitch.

968
01:23:41,803 --> 01:23:44,410
You're going where they went,
and they're gonna find you there,

969
01:23:44,472 --> 01:23:46,974
and they're gonna kick
your fucking ass !

970
01:23:47,037 --> 01:23:49,310
You feel smart ?
You think you're lucky ?

971
01:23:49,372 --> 01:23:51,645
Well, let's see how lucky you are.

972
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:55,045
Come on !
Here's how lucky you are.

973
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:58,454
You got out of the Tomahawk,
into your car,

974
01:23:58,528 --> 01:24:02,458
made it half way to Canada
until you caught some ice in the road.

975
01:24:07,628 --> 01:24:10,038
Get down there !

976
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:12,696
Take a look !

977
01:24:12,768 --> 01:24:16,845
By the time you hit the bottom down there,
the whole car was burning like a comet.

978
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:19,108
Must have burned up
all that money too.

979
01:24:21,111 --> 01:24:23,582
Was it your idea, Monster ?
Or was it hers ?

980
01:24:23,643 --> 01:24:28,284
Well, she told me about
the convict magazines.

981
01:24:28,357 --> 01:24:32,287
Had to figure there'd be some guys
in the pen with some useful knowledge...

982
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:36,667
with nobody to talk to
and nobody to listen.

983
01:24:36,718 --> 01:24:40,762
So, we just stocked up
on stationer.

984
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:46,102
It's a hard life
being a trucker's girl.

985
01:24:46,176 --> 01:24:49,106
Aw, baby.

986
01:24:49,178 --> 01:24:51,107
Come here.

987
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,417
- I saved your life.
- You shouldn't have.

988
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,588
He really loved you,
you know that ?

989
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:06,120
Nick. He really loved you.

990
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:13,565
Who wouldn't ?

991
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:18,904
Maybe this is where
you wanted him, Ashley.

992
01:25:18,966 --> 01:25:22,241
Some stranger at the bottom
of a ravine with a burned-up heart.

993
01:25:22,313 --> 01:25:25,346
Maybe.
But it didn't happen.

994
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:29,277
- 'Cause what you did for him - you made
him the happiest he'd ever been. - Shut up.

995
01:25:29,349 --> 01:25:31,320
Get up. Come on.

996
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,386
- Get in the car !
- Get in the car !

997
01:25:34,449 --> 01:25:37,629
Hey. Hey ! Gabriel !

998
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:44,469
Don't go getting
all noble with me, Rudy.

999
01:25:45,898 --> 01:25:48,639
A guy takes a shiv for you,
you go chasing his girlfriend ?

1000
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:52,496
- Don't talk to me about greed !
- What ? What did you say ?

1001
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:55,708
I said, "Don't talk to me about greed !"

1002
01:25:55,772 --> 01:25:59,378
No, not about that. About...
You said, "A guy takes a shiv for you."

1003
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:02,787
I never said anything about a shiv.
How'd you know there was a shiv ?

1004
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:05,018
You said it. You said
the real Nick died saving you.

1005
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:07,991
No, I didn't.
I said he died.

1006
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:10,493
- I never said how.
- Yes, you did.

1007
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,798
No. I never said how.
I said he died.

1008
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:16,666
- You said he was stabbed.
- I said he died.

1009
01:26:16,728 --> 01:26:18,729
I never said how.

1010
01:26:18,802 --> 01:26:21,575
You said he was stabbed...
that he took a shiv,

1011
01:26:21,628 --> 01:26:23,903
a knife, a shank, whatever.

1012
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,147
- Ash ?
- How'd she know it was a shiv ?

1013
01:26:31,783 --> 01:26:34,046
Ash ?

1014
01:26:35,819 --> 01:26:38,592
How'd she know ?

1015
01:26:45,056 --> 01:26:47,527
Jesus Christ.

1016
01:26:47,599 --> 01:26:49,530
Men !

1017
01:27:50,367 --> 01:27:52,295
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

1018
01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:10,553
We made it, baby.

1019
01:28:10,616 --> 01:28:13,994
Oh, yes, we did.

1020
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:16,120
We made it.

1021
01:28:16,193 --> 01:28:18,851
It got a little messy, but...

1022
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:21,958
I'll tell you all about that
once we're on the road.

1023
01:28:29,466 --> 01:28:31,509
For your information,

1024
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:34,439
I never fuck the wrong guy.

1025
01:28:36,514 --> 01:28:40,318
So, Rudy,

1026
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:43,020
I want you to meet Millie Bobeck.

1027
01:28:43,082 --> 01:28:45,022
Remember Millie Bobeck, don't you ?

1028
01:28:46,084 --> 01:28:48,025
My girlfriend before I went in.

1029
01:28:48,086 --> 01:28:52,831
Worked in that bar in Motor City
where I manslaughtered What's-His-Name.

1030
01:28:52,895 --> 01:28:57,137
See, Millie here,

1031
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,337
she used to serve drinks
to these gunrunning truckers.

1032
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:03,039
Real big talkers,

1033
01:29:03,099 --> 01:29:05,948
scheming about a real score one day.

1034
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:08,877
Two years in the Mountain, man.
What the hell ?

1035
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,451
Why not let her get friendly
with them ?

1036
01:29:11,515 --> 01:29:14,017
Tell them her real name
was Ashley.

1037
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,989
Tell them about this idea she had...
about writing guys in prison.

1038
01:29:18,063 --> 01:29:21,692
Find a sucker who could
show them a sure thing.

1039
01:29:21,764 --> 01:29:23,891
You know,

1040
01:29:23,963 --> 01:29:27,466
they would have never
done it without you, Nick.

1041
01:29:29,772 --> 01:29:31,700
I mean, Rudy.

1042
01:29:31,773 --> 01:29:35,432
I always wanted
to rob that casino, Rudy,

1043
01:29:35,505 --> 01:29:37,435
way back when I worked there.

1044
01:29:37,508 --> 01:29:40,583
What better way than to get
some guys to rob it for me ?

1045
01:29:40,646 --> 01:29:43,848
Paid the Alamo a hundred
to put the shiv in me.

1046
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,017
He's a lifer, man.
What does he care ?

1047
01:29:47,089 --> 01:29:50,092
He was supposed to stab me
in the yard later that day.

1048
01:29:50,154 --> 01:29:55,462
But when the food fight started, man,
I couldn't believe it.

1049
01:29:55,525 --> 01:29:57,859
A slash across the ribs,

1050
01:29:57,932 --> 01:30:00,601
a little homemade blood capsule...

1051
01:30:00,664 --> 01:30:03,511
gets you a nice, warm hospital bed.

1052
01:30:03,563 --> 01:30:07,869
Paid a guard to spread
the word I'd bought it.

1053
01:30:07,942 --> 01:30:13,676
And once the wound healed up,
got out of the Mountain this morning.

1054
01:30:13,749 --> 01:30:18,680
Tonight, I'm arich man.

1055
01:30:19,756 --> 01:30:21,683
Get in the car.

1056
01:30:27,992 --> 01:30:29,932
Keep your gun on him, honey.

1057
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:33,871
How'd you know I'd do it ?

1058
01:30:33,934 --> 01:30:38,741
Because every time
I read her letters, Rudy,

1059
01:30:38,804 --> 01:30:40,805
you listened.

1060
01:30:42,077 --> 01:30:45,749
Besides, man,
if you hadn't taken the bait,

1061
01:30:45,811 --> 01:30:48,553
we'd have still had a shot.

1062
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:51,889
She'd have just had to convince 'em
they could do it alone.

1063
01:30:51,962 --> 01:30:55,090
But what do you know ?
Good ol' Rudy came through.

1064
01:30:55,162 --> 01:30:57,164
Good old predictable Rudy.

1065
01:30:57,228 --> 01:31:01,502
Goes for the easymoney...
every time.

1066
01:31:01,564 --> 01:31:05,474
Five Santas walked into
that Tomahawk, Rudy.

1067
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:07,977
That's what the witnesses will say.

1068
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:12,241
So we gotta have
five Santas not walk out.

1069
01:31:12,303 --> 01:31:14,242
Gotta have five.

1070
01:31:14,306 --> 01:31:18,184
How many things could have gone wrong ?
A thousand.

1071
01:31:18,248 --> 01:31:22,750
You think we don't know
what a long shot is ?

1072
01:31:22,825 --> 01:31:25,347
My girl Millie was steering you, man.

1073
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:29,329
You fucked it up,
she would have cutandrun.

1074
01:31:29,393 --> 01:31:32,624
They'd be looking for Ashley Mercer.

1075
01:31:32,697 --> 01:31:36,201
Whoever she is.

1076
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:42,372
Six months of telling you
Tomahawk stories.

1077
01:31:43,438 --> 01:31:46,044
I guess now you know why.

1078
01:31:49,276 --> 01:31:53,384
You gave 'em the confidence
to walk in there, Nick Cassidy.

1079
01:31:54,456 --> 01:31:56,387
That's all we needed you to do.

1080
01:31:56,459 --> 01:31:59,190
You said some nice things
about me, man.

1081
01:31:59,253 --> 01:32:01,756
I appreciate it.

1082
01:32:01,829 --> 01:32:06,291
You know what ?
You're right. I do love her.

1083
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,004
And she...

1084
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,070
She loves me.

1085
01:32:14,142 --> 01:32:18,573
You had that part right all along.

1086
01:32:23,057 --> 01:32:25,517
It's Christmas, sugar plum.

1087
01:32:27,351 --> 01:32:29,386
Let's light up the tree.

1088
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:46,671
Shit ! Shit !

1089
01:32:49,414 --> 01:32:52,085
Write me.

1090
01:32:52,147 --> 01:32:55,742
Aw, shit ! It's like riding a bike.
Like riding a bike.

1091
01:32:57,923 --> 01:33:01,321
Good-bye, Rudy, my man.
Nice spending...

1092
01:33:02,396 --> 01:33:05,501
time with you !

1093
01:33:08,265 --> 01:33:11,903
Never put a car thief behind the wheel !

1094
01:33:22,778 --> 01:33:26,251
No ! No !

1095
01:33:50,908 --> 01:33:54,611
Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy.

1096
01:33:54,683 --> 01:33:56,613
That's what the witnesses will say.

1097
01:33:56,686 --> 01:34:01,220
So we gotta have five Santas
not walk out.

1098
01:34:02,284 --> 01:34:04,724
Gotta have five.

1099
01:34:22,314 --> 01:34:24,242
Rudy.

1100
01:34:24,315 --> 01:34:26,713
Rudy, you and me, man.

1101
01:34:26,785 --> 01:34:30,215
You and me.

1102
01:34:30,288 --> 01:34:32,790
We can split the money?

1103
01:34:32,854 --> 01:34:35,597
Rudy, that whore, Millie Bobeck ?

1104
01:34:35,649 --> 01:34:37,598
You think I was serious about her, man ?

1105
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:40,297
I was gonna kill her.

1106
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:43,197
You gotta believe me.

1107
01:34:43,259 --> 01:34:45,199
You gotta believe me. I swear it.

1108
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:48,171
- Believe me!
- Believe this.

1109
01:34:48,232 --> 01:34:51,507
Rudy ! Rudy, help me !

1110
01:37:11,282 --> 01:37:15,014
All I wanna do
is make it back to Sidnaw,

1111
01:37:15,088 --> 01:37:17,591
sit down for Christmas dinner,

1112
01:37:17,664 --> 01:37:20,165
watch some ball with my oldman,

1113
01:37:20,229 --> 01:37:22,292
sleep in my own bed,

1114
01:37:22,364 --> 01:37:25,900
have leftovers for about six months,

1115
01:37:25,973 --> 01:37:29,069
eat some of
that Christmas turkey.

1116
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:48,399
Like I said, I never was
much for the holidays...

1117
01:37:48,452 --> 01:37:50,901
until now.
