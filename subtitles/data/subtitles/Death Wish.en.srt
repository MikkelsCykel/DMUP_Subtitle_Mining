1
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,282
Hold it right there.

2
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,362
Hold it again.

3
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,721
Come on, Paul.

4
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:34,922
One more.

5
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:45,324
- You won't show those to anyone.
- Why? You've got a prime figure.

6
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,919
- You really have.
- That's a euphemism for "fat."

7
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:01,557
Wanna go back to the hotel?

8
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,726
What's wrong with right here?

9
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,008
We're too civilised.

10
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:10,920
I remember when we weren't.

11
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:14,684
But we'll go back to the hotel.

12
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,919
I don't wanna go back home.

13
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:49,518
Passenaers on TW 76
from Honolulu to New York

14
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,517
should proceed from the check-in
counter to boardina.

15
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,318
Wanna know what was happening
while you were living it up in Maui?

16
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:40,238
There were 15 murders the
first week and 21 last week.

17
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,763
That's a lot.

18
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,921
Decent people will have to
live elsewhere.

19
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,842
You mean, people who can afford to.

20
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,718
Christ. You're such
a bleeding-heart liberal.

21
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,437
For the underprivileged, yeah.

22
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,999
The underprivileged
are beating our brains out.

23
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:01,366
I say, stick them
in concentration camps.

24
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,962
- Henry.
- Hello.

25
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:08,329
I'm running cost and profit on the
Jainchill development in Arizona.

26
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:13,962
Based on the figures, I don't see how
Blueridge can underwrite 50 percent.

27
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:18,521
Jainchill has been very successful
in a small way.

28
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,723
I suggest you send a man down from our
San Francisco office to step it out

29
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:26,563
redesign it if necessary.

30
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:30,119
Because that's a high risk
for the acreage involved.

31
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:34,204
I'll talk to lng about it.
Thanks, Paul.

32
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:40,268
How does it feel to be back
in the war zone after Hawaii?

33
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,969
Good until I ran into Sam and he
delivered the crime rates statistics.

34
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,518
We need more cops than people.

35
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:53,320
You'll have to find other options.
No one could pay the taxes.

36
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,157
$2.17.

37
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:36,323
Would you have these delivered, Mary?

38
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,928
Hey, I'm gonna do a thing.

39
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,725
- Shit, man, got business.
- Let's go, man.

40
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,124
I'll get it.

41
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,163
Who is it?

42
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:43,763
Groceries, ma'am.

43
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,200
Nobody gets hurt. Don't move.

44
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,885
- What do you want?
- You know what we want.

45
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:11,728
- You won't hurt us?
- Not if you got money.

46
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:14,718
Nobody, nobody.

47
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:22,046
Look at the artiste doing his art.
Ain't that beautiful?

48
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:25,127
- My purse is in the kitchen.
- Stand still.

49
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,726
We'll do as they say, Carol.
Where's your purse?

50
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,165
You only got 4 bucks.

51
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:40,559
I got 3 and 2 bits.

52
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,363
You gonna get the shit
kicked out of you.

53
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,958
- It's all we have.
- Rich people like you? We want money!

54
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,325
It's true! That's all we have!

55
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,246
- Wanna get fucked?
- No!

56
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:58,526
I'm gonna stab you in the ass.

57
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:02,718
Leave her alone!

58
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:08,397
Goddamn rich cunt!

59
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,526
I kill rich cunts!

60
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:13,641
Mother's getting the shit
kicked out of her.

61
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,679
Let's screw this one.

62
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:28,928
- No, man. Let's travel.
- No, man, let me paint her ass.

63
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,126
I'll show you how to paint.

64
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm gonna pee into her mouth.

65
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,723
Pee into her mouth.

66
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,318
I hope she likes my paintbrush.

67
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,804
Swallow all that pink, honey.

68
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,801
Open her goddamn mouth!

69
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,604
Eat it, bitch!

70
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:57,965
I'm gonna bust her mouth!

71
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,605
Mother's going for the phone!

72
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:07,519
Shit! Let's split.

73
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:35,121
Will you get my wife
on the phone, please?

74
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,122
Mr. Kersey's office.

75
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,518
- Is it my wife?
- No, sir, it's your son-in-law.

76
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:49,558
Hello, Jack.

77
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,006
Dad. Dad, we got trouble.

78
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:56,127
You and Carol?
Don't tell me about it.

79
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:58,724
No

80
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:04,049
it's Mom and Carol. They're taking
them to emergency receiving.

81
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,962
- What the hell for?
- I don't know.

82
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,807
The police just called.

83
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,325
- What's happening?
- I don't know any more.

84
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,407
I'm going to the hospital.
Meet me there.

85
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,124
- How are they?
- I don't know, I just got here.

86
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:34,362
You know anything?
Were they cut, stabbed, what?

87
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,361
No, sir. Just beat up.

88
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:39,726
This is Officer Joe Charles.
He came in the ambulance.

89
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,001
- They gonna be all right?
- I told him all I know.

90
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,327
If there's anything I can do,
ask for me at the 21 st Precinct.

91
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:49,163
Come on, Dad.

92
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,320
What did they tell you?

93
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,523
- Not much.
- Well, what?

94
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:59,122
- They beat them both up.
- Who did? Why?

95
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,765
Take it easy.
I'm just as rattled as you.

96
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:06,126
The officer said
Carol wasn't making sense.

97
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:11,926
Maybe three men. She opened the door
thinking it was the delivery boy.

98
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,925
Jesus. God.

99
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:23,323
When are we gonna know something?

100
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,318
They know we're here?

101
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,958
The nurses know.
I spoke to one of them.

102
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:37,329
There's a man over there,
he's bleeding and nobody comes.

103
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,560
Nurse, what happened
to my wife and daughter?

104
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,929
- A doctor will see you after his exam.
- We've been waiting a long time.

105
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,844
It hasn't been that long.
Just two or three minutes.

106
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,240
- Mr. Toby?
- Yes.

107
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:59,242
Your wife is all right.
We've sedated her.

108
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:03,448
My name is Paul Kersey.
How's my wife?

109
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,728
I'm sorry, she died
a few minutes ago, Mr. Kersey.

110
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:16,524
Almiahty God, we commend to you
our neiahbour, Joanna

111
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:22,640
trusting your mercy and believing
in the resurrection to eternal life

112
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:27,326
through our
Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

113
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:32,324
Almighty God, Father of the whole
family in heaven and on earth

114
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,520
stand by those who sorrow

115
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,527
that on your strength,
they may be upheld

116
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,159
and believe the good news
of life beyond life

117
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:46,278
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.

118
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:07,405
I'm going back with Sam and Adel.
They go right by my place.

119
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:13,519
- Don't you wanna come to our apartment?
- It's time I went to my own.

120
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:17,568
Baby?

121
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,527
Baby?

122
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:22,763
I'm going back with Sam.

123
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,318
You get plenty of rest.

124
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,524
She'll be all right, Dad.

125
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,321
Residents will need time to dia
themselves out of a snowstorm

126
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,522
that's takina many counties
by surprise.

127
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,160
In New York City, liaht snow flurries
linaerina till midniaht..

128
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:17,367
- Turn that off.
- Why haven't you found my dog?

129
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:22,160
He's vital to my income. He paints
marvellous pictures with his paws.

130
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,006
- Yes?
- Where can I find Officer Charles?

131
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,848
- What's your business?
- I'm Paul Kersey.

132
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:36,925
Couple days ago my wife and daughter
were attacked. He was on the scene.

133
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,803
Is Joe Charles there,
or has he gone on duty yet?

134
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,962
Someone out here
wants to talk to him.

135
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,959
Have a seat, he'll be right out.

136
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:56,125
.. came up from behind me.
Do I have a description?

137
00:16:56,289 --> 00:17:00,567
- The man came from behind me.
- You didn't see who it was?

138
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,926
- Hello, Mr. Kersey.
- Officer Charles.

139
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:08,128
Any information on the people
who attacked my family?

140
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,127
I'll take you
to the detective in charge.

141
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:26,047
Lieutenant, this is Paul Kersey, case
884. Wife and daughter assaulted.

142
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,358
Mr. Kersey.

143
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,488
I'm going on duty now,
so I'll leave you.

144
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:34,520
Will you have a seat?

145
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:38,320
Have you found out anything?

146
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:45,236
Supermarket security and one of the
checkers remembers three characters.

147
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:51,519
But they haven't been able
to pick the faces out of a mug book.

148
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:56,757
- How is your daughter, Mr. Kersey?
- She's under doctor's sedation.

149
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:02,845
But today I had the funeral for
my wife and she was able to make that.

150
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:06,167
Your daughter
didn't give much information.

151
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,526
We wish she would take a look
at the mug books.

152
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,765
Did she refuse?

153
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,639
Her husband asked us to wait. But
the sooner she looks at the books

154
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:20,125
the better chance she has
of recalling their faces.

155
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:24,163
I'll talk to my son-in-law,
see what can be done.

156
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,718
I'd appreciate that.

157
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:30,325
Is there any chance
of catching these men?

158
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,007
There's a chance, sure.

159
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,242
Just a chance?

160
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,845
I'd be less than honest
if I gave you more hope.

161
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,525
In the city, that's the way it is.

162
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,119
I thought you were asleep.

163
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:01,208
Are you aettina
the most out of life?

164
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:04,361
Are you satisfied,
fulfilled, happy?

165
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,919
Our bank has helped many
to a better future.

166
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,886
- Morning, Mr. Kersey.
- Morning.

167
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:06,318
Give me $20 in quarters, please.

168
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,919
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning.

169
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:26,719
You really are tough.
I told lves you'd come in.

170
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:32,925
I said you're not the kind to leave
pieces of his life lying around.

171
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,729
Just a matter of keeping busy.

172
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,563
- Paul, welcome back.
- Morning, Henry.

173
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,481
- Lunch, Paul?
- Sure.

174
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:46,762
Paul, I'm giving you a vacation.
From New York, that is.

175
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:51,127
The Jainchill development
in Tucson, Arizona.

176
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:55,720
Take it over. Redesign it
if necessary. Whatever you have to.

177
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:57,123
All right?

178
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:03,160
Can I answer in a week? I don't wanna
leave New York now because of Carol.

179
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,765
Fine. When you're ready,
let me know.

180
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,718
A beautiful place, Tucson.
They can breathe out there.

181
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,727
She's sleeping too much.

182
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,726
It's not normal.

183
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:28,764
I've got TV dinners in the oven.
Just be a couple of minutes.

184
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,722
This drink's enough for me.

185
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,444
- You never drink without eating.
- I'm not hungry.

186
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:42,002
I think you ought to take Carol
to see another doctor.

187
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:46,561
I did. Today. A psychiatrist.

188
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,848
He feels it might help if I
took her to another environment.

189
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,638
Out of New York.
On the shore someplace.

190
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:57,608
Sounds good. I'll go along with you.

191
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,364
No, Dad. He felt it best

192
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:06,000
if she didn't associate with
anyone who reminded her of that day.

193
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:10,561
- How do I remind her of that day?
- You know how it is, Dad.

194
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,118
It happened at your apartment.

195
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,365
And you're living there.

196
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,123
You remind her of Mom.

197
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:22,920
Dad, don't make it tough for me.

198
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,328
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.

199
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,839
Ives asked me to go to
Tucson, Arizona on a job.

200
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,125
How long will you be gone?

201
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:34,559
I don't know till I look it over.

202
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,369
But you call,
let me know how Carol is.

203
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:40,726
Well, sure I will, Dad.

204
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:44,200
I hear Tucson's
a really beautiful place.

205
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:46,559
That's what everybody says.

206
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,320
How are you today, sir?

207
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:41,039
All right, you son of a bitch.

208
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,325
Turn around, son of a bitch.

209
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:45,924
Motherfucker, I said turn around.

210
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:47,921
Now hand me the money.

211
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:12,925
- Paul Kersey.
- Yeah.

212
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:16,121
- Ames Jainchill.
- How do you do, Mr. Jainchill?

213
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,047
Ames. I'll call you Paul.

214
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,759
- How'd you know who I was?
- You look like a New Yorker.

215
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,321
Howdy, Judd.

216
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:51,809
Wanted you to see this country
before you looked at the drawings.

217
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,641
Give you a better idea.

218
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:58,121
I don't wanna change these hills,
don't wanna bulldoze them flat.

219
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:03,122
You'll waste a lot of building space.

220
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:05,847
Wasting space.

221
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:11,163
Those are words you big developers
have to change for something else.

222
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:12,524
Such as?

223
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,727
Space for life.
Like old Judd up there.

224
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:19,558
Space for people, for horses, cows.

225
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:23,918
I got funny ideas
about building things.

226
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:34,527
Welcome to Old Tucson,
the famous movie studio.

227
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:39,441
Let's wet our whistle
before I trot you back to the motel.

228
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:43,528
.. boardwalks of the Red Dog Café,
the Gunsmith Shop...

229
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,284
- What's happening here?
- That's a phoney Western town.

230
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:51,721
They shoot movies here, but the rest
of the time it's for tourists.

231
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:54,921
This is where the performance
will take place.

232
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:57,848
This fellow's good, you wanna watch?

233
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,958
Where the Wild West lives again.

234
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:04,918
- Where's the marshal?
- He's in the bank.

235
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:07,922
- What do you got in mind to do?
- You steal my horse.

236
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,239
That's a good trick.

237
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:14,528
You spot yourself on the porch,
while I draw the marshal out.

238
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,327
Hey, marshal!

239
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,925
- What's the matter?
- Somebody stole my horse.

240
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:22,524
I told you
to get out of town by sunset!

241
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:27,797
You missing a mare that was tied
to the rail? I saw a fella take him.

242
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:32,042
- What'd he look like?
- Well, he was about this tall..

243
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:33,927
Get him, Frank!

244
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:01,528
Let's put him inside and get to the
bank and make that withdrawal.

245
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:08,123
All right, boys. The fun's over.

246
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:11,520
Throw out your guns
and put your hands up!

247
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:14,243
Listen up, marshal.
I've got dynamite.

248
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:16,207
Don't be a fool.

249
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,526
The outlaw life seemed a shortcut
to easy money

250
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:38,522
which could buy liquor and women.

251
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:41,926
But there were honest men
who would fight..

252
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:43,727
Let's get that beer.

253
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:47,564
.. who planted the roots
that would grow into a nation.

254
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:55,923
Blueridge won't buy it.

255
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:00,765
I don't build a thing
that'll be a slum in 20 years.

256
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:05,958
And I won't doze those hills.
What I build conforms to the land.

257
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:09,963
And you can't hear the toilets flush
next door.

258
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,724
You want our help,
you'll have to let me work on it.

259
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:16,804
Up to a point, I want your help.

260
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:19,324
And up to a point, I'll give it.

261
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,528
When do I get a look-see?

262
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,919
In a couple days.

263
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,729
Guard said you were here
until after midnight.

264
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:18,721
That's the way I work.

265
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:21,523
Somebody once said,
I forget who

266
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:26,359
that he never looked back, because
something might be gaining on him.

267
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,521
What's gaining on you, Paul?

268
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:32,647
Twenty-million-dollar investment,
what else?

269
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:38,521
I was gonna ask you to dinner but
I don't think you'd be good company.

270
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:40,242
No, I don't think I would.

271
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:44,448
Might amuse you. Maybe you've
never seen a club like this.

272
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:48,318
It's a gun club. We shoot guns.

273
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:54,248
So much hoopla
from gun control people

274
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:57,401
half the nation's scared
to hold a gun.

275
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,117
Like it was a snake that would bite.

276
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,524
Hell, a gun is just a tool.

277
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,048
Like a hammer. Or an axe.

278
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:08,723
Used to put food on the table.

279
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:13,440
Keep foxes out of the chicken coop,
bandits out of the bank.

280
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,806
How long since you held
a pistol in your hand?

281
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:19,325
A long time.

282
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:24,327
- Which war was yours? Korea?
- Yeah.

283
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,440
- See much action?
- A little.

284
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:28,520
Were you infantry?

285
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:32,199
I was a C.O. in a medical unit.

286
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:35,122
A commanding officer, huh?

287
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,519
Conscientious objector.

288
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,008
Oh, Christ.

289
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:43,719
What a guest to bring to a gun club.

290
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:45,760
You one of them liberals

291
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:50,321
thinks we shoot our guns because
it's an extension of our penises.

292
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,238
I never thought about it that way.
It could be true.

293
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:58,642
Maybe it is. But this is gun country.

294
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:03,519
Can't own a gun in New York.
Here, I hardly know a man who doesn't.

295
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:09,838
And unlike your city, we can walk
our streets at night and feel safe.

296
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:14,605
Muggers out here, they just plain
get their asses blown up.

297
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,158
Here, slip these on.

298
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:20,401
All right.
This is a percussion pistol.

299
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,162
1842.

300
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:28,323
You ever handled one before?

301
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,326
You know how to fire it?

302
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:36,081
Watch the kick. You'll think
your arm's gonna hit the ceiling.

303
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:49,318
Goddamn! Paul, you hit dead centre.

304
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:52,641
- Mind if I try this hogleg Colt?
- No.

305
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:56,000
You're a peculiar
conscientious objector.

306
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:58,524
- These notches for real?
- Yeah.

307
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:02,722
Belonged to a gunfighter
named Candy Dan in 1890.

308
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:08,441
I do know something about guns.
I grew up with them. All kinds.

309
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:13,205
My father was a hunter. I guess
out here you call them gunmen.

310
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,685
My mother
was the other side of the coin.

311
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,599
When my father was killed
in a hunting accident..

312
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:23,317
Some fool mistook him
for a deer, you see.

313
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:28,518
My mother won the toss.
I never touched a gun since.

314
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:31,321
I loved my father.

315
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,925
There are your hills.

316
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:49,807
Every house has a part of one
for a backyard for kids, dogs.

317
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:53,325
400 houses.
100 more than you allowed for.

318
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:55,724
And you still have 12 hills.

319
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:02,484
I'm catching the 10:40 to New York.
What do I tell them?

320
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:06,121
You tell them
I'll buy it if they will.

321
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,247
You checking this bag in?

322
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,962
- Yeah.
- Good.

323
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:31,202
A little going-away present for you.

324
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:34,167
Thank you.

325
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:45,123
Good morning, sir.
How are you today?

326
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,438
Checking one bag?

327
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:49,607
I can't thank you enough
for what you did.

328
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:54,837
I want you to know if you ever
get tired of living in that toilet

329
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:57,446
you're welcome here.

330
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:08,445
- Welcome home.
- Hi, Jack.

331
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,998
I halfway expected to see Carol.

332
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,404
Let's go get your bags.

333
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,002
What is it?

334
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:19,604
She's in the hospital.

335
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:26,398
When I last spoke to you,
you said she was feeling better.

336
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:32,405
I didn't see any need to get you
disturbed on a long-distance call.

337
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:39,198
Come on, Dad. Don't do a number.

338
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,201
Don't do a number on me.

339
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,798
There was nothing you could do.

340
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:47,800
They haven't even let me see her
for two days.

341
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:52,323
They tried insulin shock yesterday.

342
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,799
She's not responding.

343
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:58,727
You want technical jargon?
I can reel it off.

344
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:04,407
Catatonia, dementia praecox,
passive schizoid paranoia.

345
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:09,082
It boils down to this: She's had
an experience she can't face

346
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:12,799
and she's running away from it
inside herself.

347
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,199
You didn't handle it right.

348
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:24,363
Oh, Christ, Dad.

349
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:29,646
I'll get other doctors.
Who are these doctors you have?

350
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,686
They're good doctors.

351
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:37,244
She's almost a goddamn vegetable.

352
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:12,198
If you don't sign the papers,
what happens?

353
00:37:13,009 --> 00:37:17,525
They keep her until the insurance
runs out. That won't be long.

354
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,001
If you sign the papers
and she's committed, what then?

355
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:26,528
I've got insurance that covers it
up to $600 a month.

356
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:30,398
They've recommended
a sanatorium in Long lsland.

357
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:36,807
This commitment,
is it a one-way thing?

358
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,408
Nobody can answer that, Dad.

359
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:46,240
You want to know what they are?
Statistics on a police blotter.

360
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:49,799
Mom and Carol, along with
thousands of other people.

361
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:53,206
And there is nothing we can do
to stop it.

362
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:55,440
Nothing but cut and run.

363
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:22,204
What a bummer. That was the
worst fucking movie I've ever seen.

364
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,000
You got money, man?

365
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:59,485
I'll kill you. Give me your money
or I'll bust you up.

366
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:42,405
Oh, Jesus.

367
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:25,200
Good morning, inspector.

368
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:27,841
Good morning. What do we got?

369
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:30,728
We got a corpse.
One bullet hole in his chest.

370
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:35,008
Fellow over there was jogging,
found him on the path.

371
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:38,246
- The dead man?
- Thomas Leroy Marston.

372
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:44,007
He had a parole card. Served 42 months
of a 5-year hitch for grand larceny.

373
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:47,918
He's a drug addict,
probably popping smack again.

374
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:52,799
We found this on the grass next to him.
The thing hasn't been fired.

375
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:56,803
Deceased had a gun clip on his belt,
must be his.

376
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:02,844
What would you say if I suggested
he tried a heist and got shot?

377
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:05,808
Maybe two guys
trying to heist each other.

378
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:10,799
No, this man wasn't robbed.
He still has money in his wallet.

379
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:37,000
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning.

380
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:39,922
- Hi, Paul.
- Morning, Sam.

381
00:44:40,169 --> 00:44:44,242
Well, we've marked it out
as you've indicated.

382
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:46,047
It's beautiful.

383
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:48,245
What's our profit?

384
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:51,481
Not quite three million, but

385
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:56,040
our investment can be amortised
in two years. It is a show-place.

386
00:44:56,289 --> 00:44:58,245
Look at that wasted space.

387
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:02,402
Jainchill loves those hills.
Besides, it's take it or leave it.

388
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,083
It's too pretty to leave.

389
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:08,204
Okay, I'll run it for the board.

390
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:11,401
- I may need your help, Paul.
- Okay.

391
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,606
Tucson agreed with you. You look well.

392
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:18,607
I feel good.

393
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:49,238
- Was he a white man or a black man?
- I just don't know.

394
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:51,445
They were under that light.

395
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:54,726
I wasn't seeing good,
I had blood in my eyes.

396
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:58,848
Well, was he tall, short, thin, fat?

397
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:01,728
Frank, forget it, huh?

398
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,608
Ride the ambulance to the morgue.

399
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,649
When they get the slugs out

400
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:11,006
run them over to the lab
for ballistics.

401
00:47:17,689 --> 00:47:20,203
You saw him pretty good, didn't you?

402
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:24,198
You're full of shit.

403
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:26,004
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

404
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:33,485
If we had the brains
to live in the country

405
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:36,368
we wouldn't be here
for the reason we are today.

406
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:39,208
We'd be going
into the city to work

407
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,805
Mom and Carol would be
safe at home waiting for us.

408
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:46,121
Nothing to do but cut and run.

409
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:47,927
What else?

410
00:48:48,169 --> 00:48:52,242
What about the old American
social custom of self-defence?

411
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:57,005
If the police don't defend us,
maybe we ought to do it ourselves.

412
00:48:57,249 --> 00:49:00,207
We're not pioneers anymore, Dad.

413
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:04,245
- What are we, Jack?
- What do you mean?

414
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:08,004
I mean, if we're not pioneers,
what have we become?

415
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:10,798
What do you call people

416
00:49:11,009 --> 00:49:14,206
who, when faced
with a condition of fear

417
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,806
do nothing about it?
They just run and hide.

418
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:21,206
Civilised?

419
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:26,400
No.

420
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:35,129
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to start
this investigation somewhere.

421
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:37,200
So let's start here.

422
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:45,799
Motive: revenge.

423
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,040
I want the records checked.

424
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,120
Go back, say

425
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:52,644
three months.

426
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,880
Limit it to homicide.

427
00:49:55,129 --> 00:49:59,281
We could be looking for a man
who's had a member of his family

428
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,406
killed by muggers.

429
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:07,002
Now, he shoots that pistol
pretty good, right?

430
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:09,807
Okay.

431
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:11,601
Combat veteran.

432
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:16,718
Put Vietnam vets at the top of the
list because they're young and tough.

433
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:20,245
Then work through
Korea and World War ll.

434
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:23,003
Oh, my God.

435
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,401
Who said that?

436
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:30,320
Whoever said it,
you're right on the button.

437
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:35,199
By God and Jesus Christ,
it's impossible.

438
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:40,523
But until we find a shortcut,
we at least keep busy.

439
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:44,398
So when the media demands to know
what we are doing

440
00:50:44,649 --> 00:50:48,767
we'll tell them
we have definite clues.

441
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:51,407
Okay?

442
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:55,404
We won't tell them we have
1000 definite clues.

443
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:50,003
Did anybody see what he looked like?

444
00:53:50,249 --> 00:53:55,198
We're in Commissioner Dryer's office
waiting for a press conference.

445
00:53:55,449 --> 00:53:59,727
Last night, there was another killing
which appears to be the work

446
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:03,604
of the person the media has dubbed
"the vigilante."

447
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:20,082
This is the first official statement
from the commissioner.

448
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:22,399
I can see the commissioner now..

449
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:27,160
Good morning.
With me is lnspector Frank Ochoa

450
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:31,599
who's been placed in command
of a police detail

451
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:35,728
assigned to what we've all
been calling the "vigilante murders."

452
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:40,719
Now, it has been confirmed
by our ballistics laboratory

453
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:46,487
that the same gun, a.32 pistol,
used in the previous homicides

454
00:54:46,729 --> 00:54:51,007
was used last night in a shooting
aboard a subway train.

455
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:55,242
Now, I know that this person
has captured the imagination

456
00:54:55,489 --> 00:55:00,643
of many people in our city.
And I want to say to our citizens

457
00:55:00,889 --> 00:55:03,926
murder is no answer
to crime in a city.

458
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:08,242
Crime is a police responsibility.

459
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:12,038
And if this person
is listenina to my voice

460
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:15,042
l urae him in the name
of law and order

461
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:19,043
to desist
from this one-man crusade

462
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:24,409
and turn himself in to the police.
He'll be aiven fair treatment.

463
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:28,528
That's our police commissioner,
the king of clichés.

464
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:31,641
- Viailante's identification?
- No comment.

465
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,598
Do you think he's crazy?

466
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:40,008
He's aot a wire down, all riaht,
but I don't believe he's a maniac.

467
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:45,522
It's rumoured the rate of muaainas
has dropped. Is that true?

468
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:46,918
Not true.

469
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:49,524
If it were, would you announce it?

470
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:51,999
Or are you afraid of imitators?

471
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:55,440
I don't want to aet
into hypotheticals.

472
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,283
I'll bet muggings are down.

473
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:01,999
One way to find out.
Take a walk on Columbus Avenue.

474
00:56:02,209 --> 00:56:05,406
I think I'll wait
for the official report.

475
00:56:12,209 --> 00:56:14,404
Yes?

476
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:18,807
You want to confess
to the vigilante killings.

477
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:22,399
All right, I'll put you
through to Rosenberg.

478
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:25,806
He's in charge
of confessions today.

479
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,200
He's the 23rd. Put him through.

480
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:32,447
We couldn't get prints
off the groceries.

481
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:36,398
- Wasn't there a sales slip?
- Yeah. Here.

482
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:40,722
D'Agostino's.

483
00:56:43,729 --> 00:56:47,438
Some of this code must identify
the particular store.

484
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:49,247
Find out where it is.

485
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:54,563
Get records and check on families
that have somebody killed by muggers.

486
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:59,519
Put them through the computer
and see if any live near this store.

487
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:03,722
People are inclined to buy groceries
in their own neighbourhoods.

488
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:07,443
Hi, Jack. Come on in.

489
00:57:07,649 --> 00:57:09,844
Make yourself a drink.

490
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:14,839
What do you think? The new paint.

491
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,843
- It's a little hard on the eyes..
- On the eyes? It's cheerful.

492
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,565
Turn it up, I can't hear.

493
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:35,245
We got liver and spaghetti for dinner.
How do you like your liver?

494
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:38,646
Hey, no drink? Let me make you one.

495
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:42,446
Listen, that's all right.
I'll get it myself.

496
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,521
I saw Carol today.

497
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:52,963
- Aren't you gonna ask how she's doing?
- I went up to see her yesterday.

498
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,720
What are you so high about?

499
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:59,848
You want me to moan and groan
for the rest of my life?

500
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:03,400
You want your liver medium?

501
00:58:05,129 --> 00:58:07,962
Medium. I'll make it medium.

502
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:25,048
Hey, there goes the pussy posse.

503
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:53,243
Hey, mister, you got a match?

504
00:59:55,889 --> 00:59:57,242
Yeah.

505
00:59:57,449 --> 00:59:59,644
What else you got?

506
01:00:02,209 --> 01:00:04,439
Let's see the money, man.

507
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:06,646
You'll have to take it.

508
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:46,446
He went that way.

509
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:08,763
Who rode in the ambulance with them?

510
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:10,243
I did.

511
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:13,323
Well, was he talking?

512
01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:15,924
He said he cut whoever shot him.

513
01:02:16,169 --> 01:02:19,844
Exact words: " I cut that motherfucker,
I hit him."

514
01:02:20,569 --> 01:02:23,641
Can't save him.
Too much internal bleeding.

515
01:02:23,889 --> 01:02:26,562
One slug chewed up the liver. Here.

516
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:32,758
Thirty-twos.

517
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:38,242
The mysterious viailante
is in the news aaain.

518
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:42,926
Two hours aao in a subway underpass
two men were shot.

519
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:47,242
One died on the spot,
the other manaaed to reach the street.

520
01:02:47,449 --> 01:02:49,326
He died shortly afterward.

521
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:53,718
The two men are Joseph
Roscoe Adams and Georae Riche.

522
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:56,284
Both had lona criminal records.

523
01:02:56,529 --> 01:03:00,442
The viailante himself
may have been wounded.

524
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:04,244
The actions of a viailante,
lawless as they may be

525
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:08,721
seem to be aivina others
a new attitude toward crime.

526
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:13,884
Instead of allowina themselves
to be muaaed, a few are fiahtina back.

527
01:03:14,129 --> 01:03:18,122
Mrs. Alma Lee Brown
today successfully defended herself

528
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:21,441
aaainst two muaaers
with an unusual weapon.

529
01:03:21,689 --> 01:03:26,126
- Tell us, how did you drive them off?
- With a hatpin.

530
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:31,767
- You ever seen a hatpin?
- I can't say that I have.

531
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:35,558
That's what we used to use
to hold our hats on with.

532
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:39,563
I ain't aot no aun
like this viailante fellow.

533
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:45,009
But I went to my closet,
and everybody better look out for me.

534
01:03:45,729 --> 01:03:49,847
Because I been robbed
too many times. And I've had enouah.

535
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:54,520
The men buildina this skyscraper
made a citizen's arrest today.

536
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:57,567
Andrew McCabe, a foreman,
will tell you.

537
01:03:58,009 --> 01:04:01,046
Me and my crew was workina
down in the hole.

538
01:04:01,289 --> 01:04:06,124
One of the boys yelled down, "There's
a muaaina. " So we come out

539
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:12,444
and we cauaht this auy and
rouahed him up before the police came.

540
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:16,927
The hospital reports the man
had broken arms and cracked ribs.

541
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:21,321
No kiddina? Jeez, the poor auy
must have fell down.

542
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:24,481
Walking distance from D'Agostino's

543
01:04:24,729 --> 01:04:28,244
two blocks across,
six blocks uptown and downtown.

544
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,845
That's how far I'd be willing
to walk to a market.

545
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:34,847
Good. Very good, Miss Chamitti.

546
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:39,879
12 families within this area suffered
a death in the past three months

547
01:04:40,129 --> 01:04:43,087
from mugging, stabbing,
shooting, assault.

548
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:45,638
Two families have no male members.

549
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:48,488
One has only
an 80-year-old grandfather.

550
01:04:48,729 --> 01:04:50,640
That leaves nine families.

551
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:53,847
Total number of males
in these families

552
01:04:54,049 --> 01:04:58,440
old enough to have served in
Vietnam, Korea or World War ll

553
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,844
comes to 14.

554
01:05:01,249 --> 01:05:05,845
Wild. It's a real wild shot.

555
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:10,640
But the vigilante plugged
his first victim in Riverside Park.

556
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:15,565
Exactly two and one half blocks
from that D'Agostino's Market.

557
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:20,166
Even if all of them are clean,
we can't ignore that coincidence.

558
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:23,845
No, sir.
Our friend lives in that neighbourhood.

559
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:28,964
But, Frank, he was on a subway
with groceries five miles uptown.

560
01:05:29,169 --> 01:05:33,082
There's no better come-on
for a mugging than groceries.

561
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,924
Means he's got some money
and his hands are occupied.

562
01:05:37,169 --> 01:05:41,048
He might have been carrying
those groceries for hours.

563
01:05:42,049 --> 01:05:45,837
I want a preliminary on these names.
Where they work

564
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:48,557
service record, reputation

565
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:50,845
police record, if any.

566
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:54,445
And I want it fast.

567
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:58,238
Like today, huh?

568
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:04,044
It's probably having as much effect
on crime as a Band-Aid on a leper.

569
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:08,168
I don't know. A mugger will
think twice about who he hits.

570
01:06:08,409 --> 01:06:10,764
Sure, they hit more old ladies.

571
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:14,046
Paul, how you doing?
Let me get you a drink.

572
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:17,887
The guy's a racist.

573
01:06:18,129 --> 01:06:22,042
- He kills more blacks than whites.
- More blacks are muggers.

574
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:27,118
You want to up the proportion of white
muggers to have racial equality?

575
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:31,242
What? Racial equality among muggers?
I love it.

576
01:07:06,449 --> 01:07:10,840
- What have you got here?
- Guy named Paul Kersey.

577
01:07:11,089 --> 01:07:15,048
Wife was murdered in their apartment.
Interesting detail:

578
01:07:15,249 --> 01:07:18,480
The attackers
gained entrance to the apartment

579
01:07:18,729 --> 01:07:22,517
posing as delivery boys
from our D'Agostino's Market.

580
01:07:22,769 --> 01:07:25,567
- What else about him?
- He lives alone now.

581
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:28,721
Development engineer for Blueridge.

582
01:07:28,969 --> 01:07:31,437
Served in Korea, medical corps.

583
01:07:31,649 --> 01:07:33,640
Conscientious objector.

584
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:37,808
No police record.
His credits, reputation, excellent.

585
01:07:38,009 --> 01:07:41,160
Conscientious objectors
are unlikely vigilantes.

586
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,441
- We got a finger?
- Yeah.

587
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:48,047
Over there. Patrolman Joe Charles.

588
01:07:48,289 --> 01:07:49,358
Good.

589
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:54,602
Good morning.

590
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:58,241
- Joe Charles, Mr. Kersey.
- Of course.

591
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:00,525
Good to see you again.

592
01:08:00,769 --> 01:08:02,487
How's your daughter?

593
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:04,243
The same.

594
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:06,442
Take care.

595
01:08:09,329 --> 01:08:10,842
Follow him.

596
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:25,438
I'll see to that, Mrs. Cohen.

597
01:08:27,849 --> 01:08:30,124
One moment. You're not residents.

598
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:33,844
- I'll call who you wish to see.
- No, you won't.

599
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:16,048
The district attorney
will see you now.

600
01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:28,239
- Commissioner.
- You know the district attorney.

601
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:31,441
- Mr. Peters.
- Inspector.

602
01:10:32,449 --> 01:10:35,247
Commissioner says you have
a good suspect.

603
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:39,038
Well, he fits the bill
in some respects.

604
01:10:39,289 --> 01:10:43,726
We got a blood sample from the
knife used on him in the subway

605
01:10:43,969 --> 01:10:47,882
and checked it against the sample
I found in his apartment.

606
01:10:48,129 --> 01:10:49,528
It narrows it down.

607
01:10:49,769 --> 01:10:51,566
But he could be the man.

608
01:10:51,809 --> 01:10:55,848
Yeah. Yeah, he could be.

609
01:10:58,529 --> 01:11:02,078
Suppose this Paul Kersey
is the vigilante.

610
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:04,285
All right, let's say that.

611
01:11:07,169 --> 01:11:09,239
We don't want him.

612
01:11:10,329 --> 01:11:11,318
Okay.

613
01:11:11,929 --> 01:11:17,447
Inspector, on my desk I have a
statistic red-hot out of the computer.

614
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:21,085
Mugging has gone down
by how much, sir?

615
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:24,924
From 950 a week
to 470 reported last week.

616
01:11:25,169 --> 01:11:27,637
Not too many people know that.

617
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:33,725
- And you want to keep it that way.
- No, we have to keep it that way.

618
01:11:33,929 --> 01:11:35,647
This city would explode.

619
01:11:35,849 --> 01:11:40,843
We'd have vigilantes killing anybody
who looked greasy. You can see that.

620
01:11:41,049 --> 01:11:43,961
We want this man to quit, desist

621
01:11:44,209 --> 01:11:47,963
go away. To stop.

622
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:52,039
So the mugging rate can go up?

623
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:55,086
Why not arrest him?

624
01:11:55,329 --> 01:12:01,438
- I don't want a martyr on my hands.
- All right. All right.

625
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:04,249
I just want to hear you say it.

626
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:11,361
I'll try to scare him off.

627
01:12:12,009 --> 01:12:14,045
But that's as far as I'll go.

628
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:17,486
That's right, Frank. Scare him off.

629
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:21,239
Scare him off.

630
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:39,919
A call from an old friend, who
wonders if you'll recoanise his voice.

631
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:43,161
Do you want it,
or shall I insist upon his name?

632
01:12:43,369 --> 01:12:46,839
- Okay, I'll take it.
- I'm puttina you throuah.

633
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,478
Hello?

634
01:12:49,729 --> 01:12:51,481
Is this Paul Kersey?

635
01:12:51,689 --> 01:12:53,281
Yes, who's this?

636
01:12:54,849 --> 01:12:58,080
Mr. Kersey, you're under
police surveillance.

637
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:00,644
You're beina watched.

638
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:10,639
Scare him off.

639
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:25,721
Paper, papers!

640
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:29,120
Read all about the vigilante!

641
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:31,246
Get your papers here!

642
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,440
Read all about the vigilante!

643
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:35,446
How are you this evening?

644
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:38,243
Paper, papers!

645
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:41,486
Read all about the vigilante!

646
01:13:56,649 --> 01:14:00,278
All right, get your hands up.
Hands on the car.

647
01:14:00,529 --> 01:14:02,042
Spread your legs.

648
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:11,447
Okay, turn around.

649
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:14,244
Let's see some identification.

650
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:22,327
- Where do you live?
- Thirty-three Riverside.

651
01:14:22,569 --> 01:14:27,245
Sorry to rough you up. We're looking
for a guy by your description.

652
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:30,247
He's armed,
so we couldn't take chances.

653
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:32,087
I hope you understand.

654
01:14:32,609 --> 01:14:37,080
- If you want to make a complaint..
- It's all right, nobody was hurt.

655
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:39,445
Thanks. Good night.

656
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:47,482
Okay?

657
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:51,085
Yeah. Okay.

658
01:15:10,649 --> 01:15:15,439
Went in the building 10 minutes ago.
Went to D'Agostino's first.

659
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:14,447
Let's check him, huh?

660
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:17,643
Go to that phone and call him.

661
01:16:17,849 --> 01:16:21,444
- He's up there.
- Check him anyway.

662
01:17:32,529 --> 01:17:35,680
Police! I need the phone. Come on.

663
01:17:35,929 --> 01:17:37,408
Who is this guy?

664
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:40,362
He said, " Police."
I didn't see a badge.

665
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,638
I'll call as soon as he gets off.

666
01:17:48,849 --> 01:17:49,838
Thanks.

667
01:17:50,089 --> 01:17:52,045
Yeah, up yours.

668
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:00,757
No answer. He could be in the shower.

669
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,840
Stay here.

670
01:18:56,329 --> 01:18:58,843
- Good night, Mr. Kersey.
- Good night.

671
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:28,240
Has Paul Kersey gone up?

672
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:32,277
Yes, sir. He went up and came down.
Just walked out.

673
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:04,282
- Where'd you go?
- Did he show here?

674
01:20:04,529 --> 01:20:08,647
Can I ask a simple question?
Ls this Paul Kersey the bird?

675
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,845
I won't ask any more questions.

676
01:20:12,049 --> 01:20:15,644
- Go home, will you? I don't need you.
- Weird.

677
01:20:44,289 --> 01:20:47,918
Come on down, motherfucker.
We gonna take you.

678
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:52,247
That's right, motherfucker.
And you can't go back up either.

679
01:20:59,649 --> 01:21:02,288
Come down
and bring us the money, honey.

680
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:06,044
How much money you got, honey?

681
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,121
What the fuck?

682
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:53,838
.. units at the 26 Precinct. A 1034.
125 Street on the West Side hiahway.

683
01:23:12,449 --> 01:23:13,768
Fill your hand.

684
01:23:19,449 --> 01:23:21,041
Draw.

685
01:23:30,889 --> 01:23:33,608
All right, get back!

686
01:24:01,689 --> 01:24:03,361
Where's this patrolman?

687
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:20,044
- You're Reilly?
- Yes.

688
01:24:20,249 --> 01:24:22,444
- I'm Ochoa.
- Yes, sir.

689
01:24:24,089 --> 01:24:27,126
- You were the first on the scene?
- Yes.

690
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:28,643
God bless you, sir.

691
01:24:28,929 --> 01:24:34,561
Never mind that. They told me
on the radio you had to see me.

692
01:24:34,809 --> 01:24:36,242
Paul Kersey.

693
01:24:37,209 --> 01:24:40,838
- You spoke to him before the ambulance?
- No, sir.

694
01:24:41,049 --> 01:24:43,165
- What did you get?
- His address.

695
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:46,447
Is that all?

696
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:49,558
Well?

697
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:01,925
- You enter this on your report?
- Not yet, sir.

698
01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:04,998
Why not?

699
01:25:05,929 --> 01:25:09,205
I was waiting for instructions, sir.

700
01:25:09,409 --> 01:25:10,808
You never saw it.

701
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:14,247
Yes, sir.

702
01:25:16,929 --> 01:25:19,727
Oh, what's your full name?

703
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:22,523
Jackson Reilly, sir. 21 st Precinct.

704
01:25:23,449 --> 01:25:26,839
Okay. I'll remember it.

705
01:25:38,609 --> 01:25:41,123
- Do you have the vigilante?
- No.

706
01:25:41,329 --> 01:25:43,559
Well, who have you got there?

707
01:25:47,929 --> 01:25:51,842
You in charge? How is he?
Wounds are clean, nothing vital.

708
01:25:52,049 --> 01:25:55,644
Soon as we get some blood in him,
we'll sew him up.

709
01:25:55,889 --> 01:25:59,245
- All right if I go in?
- He won't be able to talk.

710
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:02,247
- Can he hear me?
- He is conscious.

711
01:26:12,569 --> 01:26:15,322
Police. I'd like to have him alone.

712
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:31,640
Good evening, Mr. Kersey.

713
01:26:37,849 --> 01:26:39,726
This is your gun.

714
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:45,527
We gave you a chance to get rid of it.
You wouldn't take it.

715
01:26:46,849 --> 01:26:49,044
Do you hear me okay?

716
01:26:50,209 --> 01:26:53,884
We have here a peculiar situation,
Mr. Kersey.

717
01:26:54,129 --> 01:26:59,681
It's necessary to make a proposition
since you won't favour us by dying.

718
01:27:00,489 --> 01:27:05,040
You work for a company
with lots of offices.

719
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:08,361
Get a transfer to another city

720
01:27:08,609 --> 01:27:11,840
and I'll drop this gun
in the river.

721
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:19,041
Are we connecting, Mr. Kersey?

722
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:25,643
We want you to get out of New York.
Permanently.

723
01:27:30,529 --> 01:27:32,042
Inspector

724
01:27:35,729 --> 01:27:38,163
by sundown?

725
01:27:52,729 --> 01:27:54,048
There he is.

726
01:27:54,249 --> 01:27:55,682
Do you have the vigilante?

727
01:27:55,929 --> 01:27:58,443
- Like to give us some information?
- No.

728
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,925
- Is the wounded man the vigilante?
- He's just a mugging victim.

729
01:28:02,129 --> 01:28:06,964
- What about reports that he is?
- False reports.

730
01:28:07,209 --> 01:28:11,248
- Then he's still out there.
- That's right.

731
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:14,600
Was he shot by the vigilante?

732
01:28:30,049 --> 01:28:33,359
Mr. Kersey.
Fred Brown. Welcome to Chicago.

733
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,679
- Nice trip?
- It was okay.

734
01:28:35,889 --> 01:28:39,643
I found a nice apartment for you
on Lakeshore Drive

735
01:28:39,849 --> 01:28:43,205
a view of Lake Michigan.
Your office is ready too.

736
01:28:43,409 --> 01:28:45,877
There's a good golf club we can play.

737
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:48,768
- I think you'll enjoy it here.
- Excuse me.

738
01:28:49,768 --> 01:28:59,768
