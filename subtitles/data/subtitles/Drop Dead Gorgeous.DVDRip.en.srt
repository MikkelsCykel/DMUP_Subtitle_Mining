1
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:40,644
You can run, but you can't hide
from the Lord.

2
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:46,178
You can never
judge a woman with bad...

3
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:28,482
Sarah Rose knows
you're a beautiful person.

4
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:34,248
Sarah Rose knows
you have an unusual talent.

5
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:39,170
Sarah Rose knows
you're a teenage girl.

6
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,894
And she definitely knows...

7
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,469
that you are ready for
the ultimate in teen glamour.

8
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:52,777
The American
Teen Princess Pageant!

9
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:55,460
And now, a few words
from last year's host...

10
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,767
Mr. Adam West!

11
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:00,191
The American
Teen Princess Pageant...

12
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:05,863
has been enriching the lives of
American-made girls since 1945.

13
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,418
The American
Teen Princess Pageant...

14
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:12,768
provides personal growth,
scholarship, travel!

15
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,487
And you might even meet
a few celebrities.

16
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,765
Yes!

17
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:19,209
At the national level...

18
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:22,624
thousands of seventeen-year-old
girls like yourselves...

19
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:25,545
compete around the country
in places like...

20
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,912
beautiful Mount Rose,
Minnesota...

21
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:31,775
and make it all the way
here to Lincoln, Alabama...

22
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:35,778
to compete for the title
of American Teen Princess.

23
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:39,112
So which one of you will it be?

24
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:44,677
Like sands through the hourglass
so are the "Days Of Our Lives. "

25
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,922
God, Iris, you taped
your shows over it.

26
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,237
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:59,267
Now, ladies,
the rest of the tape...

28
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,639
which is now gone forever...

29
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:04,804
goes on about starting
that great journey...

30
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,841
which we call the American
Teen Princess Pageant.

31
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,540
So any of you young ladies...

32
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:11,235
who'd like to start
on that journey...

33
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,574
you just come right down here
and sign up.

34
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:16,391
And, please, help yourself
to some coffee and bars.

35
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:19,944
Showtime.

36
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,757
Do you think
most people would say...

37
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,996
that teenage beauty pageants
are a good idea?

38
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,406
Oh, yeah, sure.

39
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,034
I know what some of your
big-city, no-bra-wearin'...

40
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:30,472
hairy-legged
women libbers might say.

41
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:31,912
They might say that a pageant...

42
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,214
is old-fashioned
and demeaning to the girls.

43
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,191
What's sick is women
dressing like men.

44
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:37,759
You betcha, Iris.

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,688
No, I think you boys
are going to find something...

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,411
a little bit different
here in Mount Rose.

47
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,718
For one thing,
we're all God-fearin' folk.

48
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:45,411
Every last one of us.

49
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,639
And you will not find a
"back room" in our video store.

50
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:52,672
No, that filth is better
left to the sin cities.

51
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,687
A.k. a. Minneapolis, St. Paul.

52
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,896
Oh, yeah, sure.

53
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:19,303
Freda, sure.

54
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:21,573
She was the oldest
living Lutheran.

55
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,226
Now she's as dead as a doornail.

56
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,686
It's the damn Shriners
who won't take down...

57
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,347
that goddamn sign,
the lazy sons of bitches.

58
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,231
Every year... every damn year,
I tell 'em...

59
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:34,631
"Take down
the goddamn Freda sign...

60
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:36,103
"you lazy sons of bitches!"

61
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:52,804
Today's "to do" list includes
a trip to the Mall of America...

62
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,727
where we are going
to be buying outfits...

63
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,069
for the physical fitness number.

64
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,087
Nothing too showy.

65
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:58,655
No. You betcha, Iris.

66
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,998
We need that third judge.
Gosh, don't let me forget...

67
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:02,209
We need to think of a theme.

68
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,581
Gladys, look out!

69
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:06,503
Gosh darn it.
Hello, Father Dunegan.

70
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:08,227
Sidewalks? Sidewalks?

71
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:12,191
Iris, stop it.
It's not his fault.

72
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:15,647
The communal wine just proves
too tempting for some of them.

73
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:17,095
That's why we Lutherans
use grape Kool-Aid...

74
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,438
for the blood of Christ.

75
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:21,222
There's a parking space
over there.

76
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,231
Oh, no.
That's just a compact. Sorry.

77
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,963
You'd think they'd have
the parking lot of America...

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,527
to go with the Mall of America.

79
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:29,186
It's a $200 fine!

80
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:32,071
I told you I would move the car
if a cripple came.

81
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:35,201
Now just run in the store
and pick out some outfits.

82
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:36,254
All right, let's go.

83
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:37,735
Wait, wait, wait.

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,977
What?

85
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:40,641
I think I just thought
of the theme.

86
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,265
Oh, what?

87
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,791
"Proud to be an American. "

88
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:48,995
So, what was the theme
of the pageant last year?

89
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:51,682
Oh, that was "Buy American. "

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,411
And the year before that was...

91
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,553
"U.S.A. Is A-OK!"

92
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:58,242
And can you remember the theme
of your favorite pageant?

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,189
Can I?

94
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,955
"Amer-I Can!"

95
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:05,344
People ask me where I get this.

96
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,718
I don't know.
A gift from God or something.

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,552
Hi.

98
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:23,104
Just introduce yourself
and tell us why...

99
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:24,550
you're signing up
for the pageant.

100
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,656
OK. Hi. Hi.

101
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:29,184
I'm Leslie Miller.

102
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:32,704
I'm signing up 'cause,
you know...

103
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,718
I always watch
the pageants on TV...

104
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,793
and my boyfriend
thinks I'll win.

105
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,358
For my talent,
I'm going to be doing...

106
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,959
You've been talking
to this guy long enough.

107
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,941
I'm trying to tell him...

108
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,161
Now?

109
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:51,238
Hi, Pat.

110
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,700
Go Muskies!

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,484
Hi. I'm Amber Atkins,
and I'm signing up...

112
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,105
'cause my two favorite people
in the whole world...

113
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:05,085
competed in pageants...

114
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,811
my mom and Diane Sawyer.

115
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,254
Course, I hope I end up...

116
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,621
a little more like Diane Sawyer
than my mom.

117
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,293
Do you do
any of the embalming?

118
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,749
Oh, my God, no. Oh, God.

119
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,646
I just do the hair and makeup
on the deceased.

120
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,166
I'm lucky I have
an afterschool job...

121
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,606
where I can practice my talent.

122
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:41,211
Oh, yeah, sure.
Every pageant is special...

123
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:46,404
but this one
is extra-super-special to me.

124
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:49,668
When I was seventeen...
I don't know if you know this...

125
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:55,715
I was crowned Mount Rose's
American Teen Princess...

126
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,823
and this year...

127
00:07:57,862 --> 00:08:00,481
drumroll, please...

128
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,375
my lovely daughter
Rebecca Ann Leeman is competing.

129
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,129
Is this my mark?

130
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,821
Hi. I'm Rebecca Leeman,
and I believe this pageant...

131
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,683
is an important experience
for every young woman.

132
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,759
It...

133
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,678
Well, it teaches you what's
really important in life...

134
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,558
and it has the power
to change you...

135
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,500
in ways you've never dreamed of.

136
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:37,955
My mom gave me this nine-mill
for my thirteenth birthday.

137
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,576
Yeah. I'll always remember
what she wrote in the card.

138
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,556
"Jesus loves winners. "

139
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,915
That's why no matter what I do,
I aim to win.

140
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:54,847
Why?
Well, it's kinda like asking...

141
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:58,498
why all the guys chew
Copenhagen, you know?

142
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,028
If you're seventeen...

143
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,648
and you're not a total fry,
it's just what you do.

144
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,550
Have you decided what
your talent is going to be yet?

145
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,754
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm gonna sing and dance...

146
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,895
to "New York, New York. "

147
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,584
I just fell in love with
the Big Apple last summer...

148
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,924
when I was visiting
my brother Peter there.

149
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,837
He followed his dream
all the way to New York.

150
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:24,034
Wait.

151
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,812
Here's Peter as... Liza!

152
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:29,788
Here's him as Madonna.

153
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,219
As Barbara.

154
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:44,509
I don't know what
my talent's gonna be yet.

155
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,932
Kenny! Kenny, come.
Come, Kenny.

156
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:51,965
Oh, Kenny!
Oh, this is Kenny.

157
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,599
Spike, my German shepherd...

158
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,125
he went to live
with a nice family on a farm...

159
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:57,888
after he attacked me...

160
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:00,260
but it wasn't his fault,
was it, Kenny? No.

161
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:03,011
I had beef jerky
in my front pocket.

162
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:10,432
They remade my belly
with skin from my butt.

163
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,587
I was Mount Rose American
Teen Princess in 1945.

164
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:19,844
We were at war with the Japs.

165
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,983
Didn't even get to keep
my damn tiara.

166
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:25,468
I had to turn it in for scrap.

167
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:36,538
So we adopt Molly three year ago
when we come to America...

168
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:39,964
to help acclimate us
to American.

169
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,144
To America, Dad.

170
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,883
She all-American girl.

171
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:49,503
She our Teen American Princess.

172
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,719
Oh, Ma.

173
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:59,044
English!

174
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:01,476
Speak English,
you stupid little retard!

175
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,179
So, Molly, tell movie man
what you talent do.

176
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:08,068
I'll be line dancing.

177
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,370
Country western!

178
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,293
Clint Black, ruff!

179
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:15,741
Hey, what he got that I not got?

180
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,164
So have you decided what
your talent is going to be...

181
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:21,506
for the pageant yet?

182
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,469
Yeah. I'll be doing
a dramatic monologue...

183
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:29,371
and right now
I'm thinking "Othello... "

184
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:31,169
or "Soylent Green... "

185
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:34,336
Well, my own version of it.

186
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,893
You know, a lot of girls
make a smooth transition...

187
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,242
from pageants into acting.

188
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,804
Competing for the title...

189
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:44,100
of Minnesota's American Teen
Princess sure was exciting...

190
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,020
but I never could have won...

191
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,922
without my Saint Paul
pork products.

192
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:53,023
I've been enjoying Saint Paul
pork products for years.

193
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,778
I grew up right next
to these stockyards.

194
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:58,464
It's still the same
family-run business...

195
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:02,494
that Walter and Vera Pularski
started in 1920...

196
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:05,860
when they raised
and slaughtered their first pig.

197
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:13,278
I just love
Saint Paul pork products.

198
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,186
In fact, I love 'em so much...

199
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:18,465
I work here now!

200
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:22,786
Oh, help yourself.

201
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,711
Thanks.

202
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:29,210
You're welcome.

203
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:31,194
My talent will be...

204
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:32,578
an interpretive...

205
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:37,055
dance...

206
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:39,548
while I sign...

207
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:42,370
"Through the Eyes of Love. "

208
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:45,536
Yeah. Well, see...

209
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,580
I have a dream...

210
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,719
of spreading sign language...

211
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:53,211
around the world.

212
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:59,613
Mom, will you be so kind?

213
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,530
Tammy Curry...

214
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:11,393
and I'm signing up
for the pageant...

215
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:12,540
'cause of
the scholarships and all.

216
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,467
This one's for varsity soccer.

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,841
I'm captain.

218
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:19,259
I run track, and right here
I'm the new president...

219
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,729
of the Lutheran
Sisterhood Gun Club.

220
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,074
Love that one.

221
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:29,763
Would you say...

222
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,771
you have a good chance
to win this pageant?

223
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,700
Yeah. You bet I do.

224
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:37,180
I mean, maybe other people think
I can't win a beauty pageant...

225
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,423
but other people didn't think
I could beat out...

226
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,737
Becky Leeman for president of
the gun club, either, and I did.

227
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,082
It's just like
Anthony Robbins says...

228
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,294
"I'm a winner.

229
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,983
"Nobody can stop me but me. "

230
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,576
Well, you know, I think
everybody's doing really well...

231
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,889
considering the fact
she was so young.

232
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:07,581
It's always hard to see
the young ones called home.

233
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:10,521
Especially
on an exploding thresher.

234
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:13,912
It's just so odd and gross.

235
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,395
You know, sometimes...

236
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:18,527
it's hard to understand
God's great plan.

237
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,147
But the show must go on.

238
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,936
I gotta get ahold of Ted...

239
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:25,913
and ask him if we can use that
barn light as a spot again...

240
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,028
so you watch
the Jell-O salad, OK?

241
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,172
You girls gonna sign up
for the pageant this year?

242
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:32,121
I ain't gonna be
in no goddamn pageant.

243
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,051
Look what happened
to that dork-ass farm girl.

244
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,065
Tammy Curry?

245
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,246
Yeah. Everyone says
this is a big accident?

246
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,203
She got iced
because she wins everything...

247
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,177
and this time someone
didn't want her to win.

248
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,713
This pageant's
like a Roach Motel.

249
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,675
Girls check in,
but they don't check out.

250
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:47,554
Yeah, and they say smoking's
bad for your health.

251
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:55,490
And... tendu, close.
Tendu, close.

252
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,011
Tendu, close, plié.

253
00:14:58,051 --> 00:14:59,229
And repeat.

254
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,478
Tendu...

255
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,457
Suck in the bellies, girls!

256
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:04,474
And tuck in the tushes!

257
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:05,922
Close those legs.

258
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:08,705
You look like a bunch
of bowlegged cows.

259
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:11,160
Other side!

260
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,530
And tendu, close. Tendu, close.

261
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:15,872
Tendu, close, plié.

262
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:18,591
Yeah, you boys
sure picked a good year.

263
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,515
If I was a betting woman...

264
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:21,922
and there was a line
on this in Vegas...

265
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,573
I'd lay down ten to one
that it all comes down...

266
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:26,750
to Amber Atkins
and Becky Leeman.

267
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,543
Oh, sweet Jesus.

268
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,008
What a showdown this should be.

269
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:31,906
If Cain and Abel...

270
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,011
Oh, God!

271
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,709
That's so embarrassing.

272
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:46,235
My winning the Mount Rose...

273
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:52,287
American Teen Princess Pageant
really changed my life.

274
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:56,382
Amber does my hair once a week.

275
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:58,590
Well, it's the least I can do...

276
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:03,329
for the reigning Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

277
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,566
- Oh, God.
- What?

278
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:08,385
Oh, just a little snarl.

279
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,011
Don't tell.

280
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:14,232
What? Oh, my God.

281
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:18,017
Lights, camera, and me
without a stitch of makeup on.

282
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,993
What are you guys doing here?

283
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,693
What are you doing here?

284
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:26,750
Oh, Amber, like you're
the only one who visits Mary?

285
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,926
Who are you?

286
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:33,153
"Who are you?"
Oh, Mary, you kill me.

287
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:34,975
She always says that.

288
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,531
It's a little game
we play every week.

289
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,578
Same dippy little look
on her face.

290
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,920
"Who are you? Who are you?"

291
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:43,362
Just like that.

292
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:45,882
It's me... Becky.

293
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:49,434
And I brought your favorites.

294
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:52,190
Real nice, Becky.
She's anorexic.

295
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:56,023
She's skinny, Amber, not deaf.

296
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:21,087
So, beyond this pageant
you must have certain dreams...

297
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,009
and certain things
you aspire to, yeah?

298
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,238
Yeah, I got dreams.

299
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:30,045
Sometimes I dream of winning.

300
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,642
I dream of getting out
of Mount Rose...

301
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:35,195
and being a big-time reporter
like Diane Sawyer.

302
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,984
I mean, guys get out of
Mount Rose all the time...

303
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:40,636
for hockey scholarships...

304
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:42,015
or prison.

305
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,279
Yeah, 1963.

306
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,875
Her beauty worked against her...

307
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:50,078
when she started as a reporter
in Louisville, her hometown.

308
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:51,673
Those were different times.

309
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,776
That's my mom.

310
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,541
Hey, Amber,
did you get my smokes?

311
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:58,913
Yeah. I'll get 'em in a sec.

312
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:00,986
Aw, shit.

313
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:02,335
They're from Los Angeles.

314
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,541
They wanted to see my room
and film me for their movie.

315
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:07,545
Yeah, well, if they ask you
to take your top off...

316
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,496
get the money first.

317
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,425
And go get my smokes!

318
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,671
Hey, hey, you like it?

319
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,120
- Open it.
- This?

320
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,561
Yeah, the globe.

321
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,252
Go on,
pull on the North Pole there.

322
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,435
Here, watch.

323
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:38,488
Honey, this isn't a showroom.

324
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:40,701
See, this holds three
full-size booze bottles.

325
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,942
Tape cassette
comes out of Afghanistan.

326
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:46,785
All right, all right.

327
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:49,501
How quickly they forget
where this all comes from.

328
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:50,944
Taiwan.

329
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:53,498
That's enough, young lady.

330
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,457
I beg your pardon.
Would you like a drink?

331
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,246
Impartial?

332
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:59,802
When I'm outside these walls,
I am Gladys Leeman...

333
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:02,111
president Civil Servettes,
impartial as the day is long.

334
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:04,088
But I'm in my house now,
and I gotta warn you...

335
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,268
I'm wearing my wife apron
and my mom hat...

336
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,128
so I can safely say
that I am the mother...

337
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:11,031
of the most talented contestant
Mount Rose has ever had.

338
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:12,961
Oh, gosh, she's been
singing and dancing...

339
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:14,684
since she was knee-high
to a pig's eye.

340
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,794
Yeah, she's damn
near as good as...

341
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,720
you know, that little...
that black fellow...

342
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:20,247
the one with the glass eye...

343
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,369
the Candy Man...

344
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,776
- Sammy Davis, Jr.
- Yeah, the Jew.

345
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,467
Nice one, Dad. He's dead.

346
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,716
Yeah. Then we have
the Judges Interview.

347
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:41,600
Where each girl has a little
ten-minute get-together...

348
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,967
with the judges
prior to the pageant.

349
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,408
Then we have the...

350
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,131
Hello, Tony.

351
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:55,353
Hey to the folks.

352
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:56,669
Yeah, all right.

353
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,362
Gladys, the Judges Interview.

354
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,669
So you've judged a lot
of pageants over the years?

355
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,974
No. No. No way. No.

356
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,896
Never judged a pageant
before in my life.

357
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,279
No way.

358
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,230
Never been around young girls.

359
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:25,051
I mean, even if I was...

360
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,128
I mean, why would I want
to be, you know?

361
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,827
I don't get off
on that kind of thing.

362
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,522
That's really
why you're asking, right?

363
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,167
Someone say something?

364
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,827
Do you judge the pageant
every year?

365
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:47,101
No. I've never judged
nothin' before.

366
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:49,854
Harold, are we on "Cops"?

367
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,001
Are we on "Cops," Harold?

368
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,317
Shut up, Hank.
This here's business.

369
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,048
Harold,
Mom said not in the head!

370
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,510
Well, Mom's dead,
so shut your flytrap.

371
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:01,974
I will if you shut your piehole.

372
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:12,864
Don't make me...

373
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,041
Don't make me kick you
where the good Lord...

374
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,023
Don't make me
split you where you...

375
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,690
Come on!
You want some of this!

376
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:21,018
So, are you excited?

377
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:22,431
Oh, you bet.

378
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,853
We're happier than the day
Hankie got acquitted.

379
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:27,580
I get made a judge, then
the furniture store hires us...

380
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:29,624
to paint the whole damn thing.

381
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,551
We're going to use the money...

382
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,493
to get our mom
a proper headstone...

383
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:36,733
and to move her out
to the cemetery.

384
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,714
Listen, guys,
if you see anything you like...

385
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:45,621
you just let me know because
I happen to know the owner.

386
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:47,737
So, here we are.

387
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:49,980
My place of business,
my little house of worship...

388
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:52,666
the world's largest
Conestoga wagon.

389
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:54,460
Right here, we have
a very attractive unit.

390
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:57,212
Farmers like that one.

391
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,833
OK, showtime.

392
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:02,654
Hey, Tim, Carla, listen...

393
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,077
you two don't Jew me down
too much on that dinette...

394
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:07,421
I'll throw in a hutch
for free, OK?

395
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,365
See, that's my specialty.

396
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,018
You don't pay less,
I give you more.

397
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:16,667
The secret is... the hutch
is included in the price.

398
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:19,257
Ain't that right, Jean?

399
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,500
Take a memo, sweetheart.

400
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,443
Five, six, seven... and one...

401
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,585
Get that tempo right.
Kick it!

402
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,736
Come on, kick it!

403
00:22:46,752 --> 00:22:49,403
Just watching the young girls.

404
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,643
Contestants. You know...

405
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,069
like the rest of my friends
and neighbors.

406
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,223
Are you getting her?

407
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,717
The third one, the blond one.

408
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,418
Leave him alone. It's OK.

409
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:13,142
It's just a camera I keep
in the glove compartment...

410
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:17,209
for... car accidents.
Insurance.

411
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,919
I mean, you guys got a camera...

412
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:23,959
and no one's accusing you
of anything, right?

413
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:44,030
So, Brett, you want to go
to the lake with me on Thursday?

414
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:47,543
Actually,
I got practice on Thursday.

415
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,044
Well, maybe Friday then.

416
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,453
A bunch of us
were going cow tipping.

417
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:54,040
Well...

418
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,966
I'm kind of busy on Friday.

419
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,141
Give her your tray, Brett.

420
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:12,346
You're holding up the line.

421
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:15,704
Give it to her.

422
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:17,597
Here, I'll take it.
It's my job.

423
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,770
No. It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

424
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:22,458
Well, you're supposed
to put it in the...

425
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:28,920
Aw, man.

426
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:32,025
You got some lutefisk
in your hair.

427
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,753
Then it must be Wednesday.

428
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:39,805
Lutefisk is codfish
that's been salted...

429
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:42,424
and soaked in lye
for a week or so.

430
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:47,100
It's best with lots of butter.

431
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:50,844
I'm not really busy on Friday.

432
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:53,246
I was just saying that,
you know?

433
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:54,391
I know.

434
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:55,925
Well...

435
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:58,388
if you wanted to do something...

436
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,430
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. You bet.

437
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,877
Oh, crap.

438
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,820
I probably gotta work
at the funeral home.

439
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,772
We're real busy
this time of year.

440
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:09,148
Hunting season.

441
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:11,801
Well, I'm cutting out of here
early today...

442
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:13,464
and doing
a little duck hunting...

443
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:15,226
but maybe I could
call you tonight?

444
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:16,375
Yeah, sure.

445
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:18,711
- All right.
- Fine.

446
00:25:33,342 --> 00:25:34,869
Oh, God.

447
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,528
You don't think Becky
saw you guys, do you?

448
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:39,322
Look, you shouldn't be in here.

449
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:40,667
Doreen gave us hair nets.

450
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:43,321
No, listen.
We shouldn't talk here.

451
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:46,325
Stop by my house tonight, OK?

452
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:48,918
Go.

453
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,404
They take out her butt?

454
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,901
Oh, Jesus H. Christ.

455
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,502
Oh, are we on "Cops" again?

456
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,233
OK, be quiet.

457
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:13,466
It's just the guys
that are, you know...

458
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:15,325
making the movie
about the pageant.

459
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,333
I told you all about 'em.
This here's Loretta.

460
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:19,829
I tell Annette, you talk to me
during my stories...

461
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,845
you might as well
be talking to the wall.

462
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,292
You guys want a beer?

463
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:25,300
No, thank you. Is Amber here?

464
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:26,683
Oh, no. You just missed her.

465
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,020
She got called down
to the bone gardens.

466
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,810
She's in a hell of a mood today.

467
00:26:30,846 --> 00:26:32,569
Say, you boys been
to the Leemans'?

468
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:33,783
Shut it, Loretta.

469
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,156
If so, you got all the pictures
of the winner you need.

470
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,270
- Shut it.
- It's true.

471
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:44,314
Let's just say who should win,
who deserves to win is Amber.

472
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,645
Why don't you just paint
a target on your ass?

473
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:49,466
Best damn tapper,
the most smartest.

474
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:50,581
Most smartest?

475
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:52,989
Oh, that's great.
You're real educated.

476
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:55,258
"Most smartest. "
Get a picture of that.

477
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:56,667
Most smartest.

478
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:57,978
I'm cutting you off
and sending you home.

479
00:26:58,014 --> 00:27:01,080
Excuse me, but I'm bragging up
your kid here.

480
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:02,394
I know. Come on, let's go.

481
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:04,153
Amber's gonna be the next
Diane Sawyer, you know.

482
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,498
They're making a movie here.

483
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,356
All right,
they're making a movie.

484
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,528
What makes you think
that Becky's going to win?

485
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:10,711
Why do I think Becky'll win?

486
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,277
You're talking... Don't pinch.

487
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:14,620
You're talking about the richest
family in a small town.

488
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:17,174
It's front-page news
when one of 'em takes a shit.

489
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:18,359
Oh, great.

490
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,814
Can one of you boys
give me a ride home?

491
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:23,031
Don't fall for it.

492
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,477
She lives two trailers down.

493
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,687
So? Be real easy.

494
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,132
Go on home, Loretta.

495
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,238
Go on. The party's over.

496
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:40,058
Oh, my God!

497
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,908
Jesus Christ on a cross!

498
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,690
Look, number one rule
in a funeral home...

499
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:47,864
Never sneak up on the living.

500
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,461
You never know who could
have an embalming needle...

501
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,324
or a skull saw in their hand.

502
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:53,626
Mr. Larson's son
learned the hard way.

503
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,701
He's buried next to my grandpa.

504
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,315
Are you upset about Brett?

505
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:05,178
Upset about Brett?

506
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:08,377
Nah. Hazard of the trade.

507
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:13,114
I don't really have time
for guys anyways.

508
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,360
It's weird, though.

509
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:17,114
He took it
right between the eyes.

510
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,859
Don't often see that.

511
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:24,503
So, you know,
Brett just got shot in the head.

512
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,719
He did?

513
00:28:25,757 --> 00:28:27,579
Well, hunting's dangerous.

514
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:31,156
So, anyways, my mom gave me
this thirty-aught...

515
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:32,658
for my sixteenth birthday.

516
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:39,092
I need Stella now.

517
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,042
The family's steaming
like a cow pie in July.

518
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:43,452
Said she doesn't look nothin'
like the picture they gave you.

519
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:45,459
Sorry. I just thought she might
not want to meet her maker...

520
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,027
looking like a cheap whore.

521
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:49,883
Well, this cheap whore
is that family's loving mother.

522
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:52,338
The Clemens
said to make him look...

523
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:54,071
like he just came in
from snowmobiling.

524
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,483
Pink cheeks and...

525
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,786
Red nose and ears.
I know, I know.

526
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:16,375
Sorry I couldn't talk to you
before in the cafeteria.

527
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:18,103
I was scared, OK?

528
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,588
I open my locker today
after first period...

529
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:25,906
and there's a picture
of Tammy Curry taped inside.

530
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:27,923
This was written on the back:

531
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:32,818
Oh, yeah,
hell of a way to go, there.

532
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:35,478
After some thorough
investigating...

533
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:38,844
we determined
that the Curry girl...

534
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:41,461
must have been smoking
and driving.

535
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,184
Well, yeah, Tammy liked
to drive her dad's thresher...

536
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,227
but, I mean...

537
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:48,374
She said the heavy vibration
helped her think.

538
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,795
But I know for a fact Tammy
only smoked after a good drive.

539
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:55,316
You ask me or anyone else who
isn't scared to talk about it...

540
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:57,244
Tammy was murdered.

541
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,915
I bet Diane Sawyer never had
to deal with crap like this.

542
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:04,980
If it's another stray bullet
to the head...

543
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:06,296
I'm gonna need more caps.

544
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:07,542
You have to go home.

545
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:09,554
There's some kind of emergency
at the trailer park.

546
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:10,740
Relax. That's my ma's code...

547
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:12,219
for bring home milk
and a carton of Lucky...

548
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:15,350
No. Loretta called.
There's been a fire.

549
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,041
Oh, my God.

550
00:30:40,732 --> 00:30:42,903
Hey, hey, hey! Family?

551
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,787
No, she's just screaming "Mom"
because she's got Turret's.

552
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:47,128
She's Annette's kid, dipshit.

553
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:49,946
She's alive, sweetie.
She's right over there.

554
00:30:55,164 --> 00:30:57,138
I'll be right behind you
in the hearse, OK?

555
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,187
Don't let that worry you,
Annette!

556
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,554
So, Doctor, is this sort
of an unusual injury?

557
00:31:14,588 --> 00:31:16,857
This was a doozie.

558
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:20,153
Right now our chief concern
is to stabilize Annette here...

559
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:22,741
and then in surgery...

560
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:24,186
remove this.

561
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,641
Oh, God.

562
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,276
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.

563
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:31,098
Ruined a brand-new pair
of Lee Press-Ons.

564
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:35,092
Well, I sat down to have a beer,
and kablooey.

565
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:36,538
Next thing I know...

566
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:38,905
something blows
through my kitchen window...

567
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,584
and I'm ass-up
in somebody's flower bed.

568
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,586
Hey, ass-wipe, quit dicking
around with the camera.

569
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,904
Just put another book under it.

570
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,084
Dude, don't say "ass-wipe. "

571
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:51,419
Mom's got the window open.
We gotta hurry up, though...

572
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:53,523
because we only got three
frickin' minutes on the battery.

573
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:54,773
All right, ready.

574
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:55,923
One, two...

575
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,043
One, two, three!

576
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:02,227
Shit!

577
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,511
Let's get out of here!

578
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:09,846
I shoved your tap shoes
in my panties...

579
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,955
before I was blown
out of the house.

580
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:14,231
You go find the guy
who cut 'em off.

581
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,347
He'll give 'em to you...

582
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,681
so you can practice
for the pageant.

583
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,551
About that...

584
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:27,506
I... Oh, my God!

585
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:33,014
Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

586
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,223
She's pregnant!

587
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,048
Oh, Amber, wait!

588
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,472
Come back here.
Mommy wants to talk to you.

589
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:41,141
And then kill you!

590
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:43,219
Why don't you see
if there's any more beer...

591
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,081
left in that can
and relax a bit?

592
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:49,620
- I'm quitting the pageant.
- You're what?

593
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,217
I'm quitting the pageant.

594
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,968
I was just trying to scare you
into changing your mind.

595
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:56,825
Christ, the woman clung
to your tap shoes...

596
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:59,247
while flying through the air
like a goddamn lawn dart.

597
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,468
I know, I know.

598
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:03,506
Hey, Little Miss Sad Pants
and her friend Serious Sally.

599
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:05,140
How about
some nice cool mints...

600
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,600
to turn those frowns
upside down?

601
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:10,842
Do you think a nice cool mint
would help...

602
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,362
if I shoved your head
up your ass?

603
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,623
So what do I say?

604
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,513
Simple, just say...

605
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,762
I know you sacrificed
everything...

606
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,835
relationships, dreams...

607
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:28,281
your tummy, ass, and thighs...

608
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:29,721
all to bring me
into this world...

609
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:32,536
all so I could have tap lessons
and be in the pageant...

610
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:34,992
the same one you were in,
but you know what?

611
00:33:35,035 --> 00:33:36,180
I'm quitting.

612
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:38,640
There. Easy as pie.

613
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,657
Oh, my God. I am so dead.

614
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:41,681
Yeah, you betcha.

615
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,927
Go on, get out!

616
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:47,061
Next one in here without a pack
of Luckys in her hand dies!

617
00:33:47,098 --> 00:33:50,164
Yeah, sure.
You have a super day, too.

618
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:51,761
Get out!

619
00:33:52,858 --> 00:33:55,160
Mom, look. Don't talk.

620
00:33:55,194 --> 00:33:58,675
First of all,
I'm not pregnant, OK?

621
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:01,780
I am not letting go
until you tell me what's up.

622
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:05,463
Amber, I am reaching a point
where I would kill someone...

623
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:07,025
for the nicotine
under their fingernails.

624
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:08,179
You hear me, Loretta?

625
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:10,422
OK, OK...

626
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,142
yesterday I got this picture...

627
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:16,473
so I'm thinking about...

628
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:17,913
you know...

629
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:19,637
I'm gonna quit the pageant.

630
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:21,081
What?

631
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,771
Oh, excuse us, guys.

632
00:34:22,842 --> 00:34:25,592
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

633
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,765
Loretta, get out of here!
Go on, get out.

634
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:28,914
What's your problem?

635
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:31,824
What's my problem?
Sit your skinny little ass down.

636
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:33,295
Nice, Ma. Real nice.

637
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,712
Nice mouth you got there...

638
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,601
but I'm not going
through this again.

639
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:38,773
You? You're not
going through it again?

640
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,658
You're not the one that knows
how Jiffy Pop feels, missy.

641
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,217
Oh, come on, Mom.

642
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:45,647
First the picture of Tammy, then
Brett Clemmens, and now this?

643
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,096
It's scary.

644
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,170
Scary?
Let me tell you scary.

645
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,152
Look here. Look at me.

646
00:34:51,194 --> 00:34:53,299
You want to look
like you've been rode hard...

647
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,257
and put away wet
when you're my age?

648
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:56,434
I'm a lifer here.

649
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:57,814
Best thing
I got to look forward to...

650
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,759
is to end up
in some decent raisin ranch...

651
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:02,201
where they change me
twice a day.

652
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:07,088
Honest to God, honey.

653
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,097
If I had it to do over...

654
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:12,342
I'd start walking
out of this town...

655
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,581
the minute I could take
my first step.

656
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:16,472
You know, practically...

657
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:19,855
the only thing I wouldn't do
different is have you.

658
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,783
God, I hope that's you
and not your concussion talking.

659
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,995
It's me.

660
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:31,605
I just don't want this to be
the thing that you do over.

661
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:34,871
Now, this pageant's
your ticket out of here...

662
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:37,458
and I know you can win.

663
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:39,570
Come here.

664
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,616
Oh, I love you much.

665
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:43,087
I love you much.

666
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,886
And you're gonna win.

667
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:46,645
She's gonna win.

668
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:47,794
Isn't she gonna win, Loretta?

669
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,011
You bet.

670
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,031
You'll see.

671
00:35:50,073 --> 00:35:52,113
Hell no, she ain't quitting.

672
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:53,528
No. Mom said if I did...

673
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:55,416
she'd look up my dad
and marry him.

674
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:58,035
So, has your mom
kept your dad's life a secret?

675
00:35:58,105 --> 00:35:59,632
No, she never hid the fact...

676
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:02,161
that my dad
picked his career over us.

677
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:03,608
What did she used to say?

678
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,202
Once a carny, always a carny.

679
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:07,663
Mom still cries
when she sees a tilt-a-whirl...

680
00:36:07,705 --> 00:36:09,712
or a fat lady in a tube top.

681
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,641
The Atkins fire.

682
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:14,390
Foul play? Shit, no.

683
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:16,247
After some extensive
investigating...

684
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:19,280
we determined that it must
have been bad wiring.

685
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:21,044
Bad wiring?

686
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:23,447
That's the biggest
crock of shit I ever heard.

687
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:27,478
What, they have a sale
on dull needles at K-Mart?

688
00:36:27,513 --> 00:36:29,902
I just need one more do-over.

689
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:51,219
Now, we need to remember the
three most important parts...

690
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:54,039
to give a really good
interview...

691
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:55,731
Listen up, number one.

692
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,557
Number one.

693
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:59,960
American Teen Princesses...

694
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:01,902
do not cross their legs
like streetwalkers.

695
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:03,952
Excuse me,
"Miss Penthouse '98... "

696
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:05,552
put your knees together.

697
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,967
I could drive
a boat show in there.

698
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,430
Ankles together.

699
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:11,090
Hands resting
lightly on your laps.

700
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,365
Good.
Sit up straight. Smile.

701
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:15,310
All right, number two.

702
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:18,386
The judges are just
as nervous as you are.

703
00:37:25,337 --> 00:37:26,678
So, are you about ready...

704
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:29,648
to start the judging,
start the interview there?

705
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:35,310
I guess I could answer that.

706
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:36,759
Yeah, we're ready.

707
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:39,924
So we should probably get
the young girls in here, then.

708
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,830
You know,
to start the interviews.

709
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,476
If you could be any tree
in the woods...

710
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:51,028
what kind of tree would you be?

711
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:54,256
Dogwood.

712
00:37:54,297 --> 00:37:55,573
Bonsai.

713
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:56,885
Green?

714
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:58,830
I can be any kind
of tree you want.

715
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:00,498
Just give me a minute
to warm up.

716
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:10,039
One with strong roots in
a community like Mount Rose...

717
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:13,039
a solid Christian trunk...

718
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:16,724
and long leafy branches
to provide shade...

719
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,149
for handicapped kids
on a hot summer day.

720
00:38:19,192 --> 00:38:22,226
You guys know
the retard's pants are open?

721
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:26,477
I don't want to see that.

722
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:30,166
Who would you pick to be
the president, dead or alive?

723
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,883
Emperor Hirohito.

724
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,130
Brett Favre.

725
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:45,365
My mother, 'cause she could
solve world hunger...

726
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,269
with one of her blue-ribbon
rhubarb pies...

727
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:51,411
create world peace
with one of her prayers...

728
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:53,869
and still find time
to look beautiful...

729
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:56,465
for my dad, Lester Leeman.

730
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:57,932
Do you like to swim?

731
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,910
Yeah, I love to swim.

732
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:02,839
When I was in New York,
I met Greg Louganis...

733
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:04,464
at one of my brother's shows.

734
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:20,271
The tard's pants
are completely off.

735
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:25,232
Close up shop.

736
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,876
Are you Amber Atkins?

737
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,984
Yes, yes, I am. Hello.

738
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,301
Name and spell
all the United States...

739
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:38,644
in alphabetical order.

740
00:39:40,696 --> 00:39:42,452
Seriously?

741
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,478
Well...

742
00:39:51,512 --> 00:39:54,479
Alabama.

743
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,170
A- I-a-b-a-m-a.

744
00:39:57,207 --> 00:39:58,549
Alaska.

745
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:02,413
A- I-a-s-k-a.

746
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:07,505
Arizona.

747
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:10,707
A- r-i-z-o-n-a.

748
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,336
West Virginia.

749
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:16,269
W- e-s-t V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a.

750
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:18,579
Wisconsin.

751
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:22,160
W- i-s-c-o-n-s-i-n.

752
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,279
Wyoming.

753
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:26,166
W- y-o-m-i-n-g.

754
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:32,560
Well, OK.

755
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:39,346
With two weeks until
the pageant...

756
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:46,573
I was practicing my talent,
finishing my costume...

757
00:40:46,646 --> 00:40:49,429
brushing up on current events...

758
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:55,409
and running eighteen miles a day
on about four hundred calories.

759
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:57,454
I was ready.

760
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,866
Girls, couple of things.

761
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,331
All right, very important.

762
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:15,723
Gladys wants us to all go
in show order today.

763
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,701
All right, so very important,
don't forget that.

764
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:23,470
Oh, yeah, really nervous.

765
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:26,326
It's been about two months.

766
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:30,036
I haven't told my boyfriend yet.

767
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,532
How did you know?

768
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:34,356
I meant nervous
about the pageant.

769
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,707
Oh, nervous about the pageant.

770
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:40,749
There are eight thousand
sequins...

771
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,605
and fifteen hundred beads
on the skirt alone.

772
00:41:43,638 --> 00:41:46,158
My mom had Mrs. Lopez make it.

773
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,232
She's one of my father's
many Mexican workers.

774
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:52,618
He lifts them from the poverty
they know in Mexico.

775
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:55,509
Yeah, all my mom's clothes
melted onto mine.

776
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:59,154
Forming, like, this big
polyester meteor in our closet.

777
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:01,744
But in some kind
of weird miracle...

778
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:03,189
our neighbor boy Kenny Hansen...

779
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:05,361
found my tap costume
on the roof of their trailer...

780
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,787
while he was setting
coon traps for his dad.

781
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:09,008
Here's the weird part.

782
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:11,414
It was still on the hanger.

783
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:14,511
This is my lucky bolt.

784
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:17,103
They think that it fell
from a DC-10.

785
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:20,590
The doctor said I was really
lucky the flat side hit me.

786
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:23,379
'Cause otherwise it could have
gone right through my head.

787
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:26,513
I know, I know.
Gives me the willies, too.

788
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:31,443
Can we switch numbers?

789
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:37,741
My cousin just had a deaf baby,
and I get to go see it.

790
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:39,124
I need to go first.

791
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:42,126
Yeah, sure.
It's my lucky number anyway.

792
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:45,013
Diane Sawyer has number eight
at her local.

793
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:48,014
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

794
00:42:49,494 --> 00:42:54,480
I can see what's mine now

795
00:42:55,574 --> 00:43:00,692
Finding out what's true

796
00:43:01,686 --> 00:43:07,185
Since I found you

797
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:11,695
Looking through the eyes

798
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:13,938
Of...

799
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:15,567
I'm gonna be honest.

800
00:43:15,605 --> 00:43:17,645
This is a hard time for me...

801
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:20,784
because this is the time
in the pageant...

802
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:23,091
when you realize
that tomorrow night...

803
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:26,092
all but one of these girls
is gonna walk away a loser.

804
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,409
To be

805
00:43:27,477 --> 00:43:28,371
It's just really hard...

806
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:31,187
for me to know
what that would feel like.

807
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:32,945
It can't feel good.

808
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,942
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

809
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,410
Don't touch her.

810
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:42,574
Don't move the body.
Don't touch the body.

811
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:44,043
She could be paralyzed
from the neck down...

812
00:43:44,086 --> 00:43:45,264
and you wouldn't know it.

813
00:43:45,302 --> 00:43:46,796
Someone call nine-one-one.

814
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,812
Don't say anything...

815
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:51,374
'cause it might be
a hypnotic suggestion.

816
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:54,322
Don't you get it?

817
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:55,437
I was supposed to go first.

818
00:43:55,477 --> 00:43:57,779
I was contestant number one.

819
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:00,496
That light was meant
for my head.

820
00:44:00,565 --> 00:44:03,412
If Jenelle hadn't
wanted to go first...

821
00:44:04,405 --> 00:44:06,826
I owe my life
to that deaf baby.

822
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,373
Hey, that was your mom.

823
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:13,323
She wanted you to have this.

824
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:17,835
Really, Loretta?

825
00:44:17,877 --> 00:44:19,022
You bet.

826
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:23,373
My mom wanted me to have this?

827
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:26,156
Oh, shut up.

828
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:28,106
I thought it might help you
get some sleep.

829
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,386
Loretta, never have kids.

830
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:34,923
Well, God love you
for thinking I still could.

831
00:44:34,997 --> 00:44:36,884
Your ma did want you
to have this, though...

832
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,323
since your other one
got toasted.

833
00:44:38,357 --> 00:44:40,746
It's just like Diane Sawyer's!

834
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:43,243
Of course, it's not a size ten.

835
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:44,692
Diane was a little hippy then.

836
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,219
- Not our girl.
- Oh, no.

837
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:58,739
Pain meds.

838
00:44:58,772 --> 00:45:00,528
Hope this thing ends
before they do.

839
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:05,103
We have excitement.

840
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:06,515
Big excitement.

841
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:07,694
Go, Molly!

842
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:09,391
Go.

843
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:11,698
Leslie Miller
kicks Teen Princess ass!

844
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:13,708
Whoo! Go, Muskies!

845
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:31,054
Oh, gotta go.

846
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:44,843
Thank you, thank you.

847
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:46,292
Oh, my.

848
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:49,172
Is that for me or my gown?

849
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:57,362
Welcome to the Mount Rose
American Teen Princess Pageant.

850
00:45:57,396 --> 00:45:59,785
While every contestant...

851
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:02,349
you'll meet here tonight
is special and unique...

852
00:46:02,388 --> 00:46:05,257
they all have
one thing in common.

853
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:10,188
They are all proud
to be an American.

854
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:50,667
I chose Mount Rushmore...

855
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,431
because to live in a country...

856
00:46:52,468 --> 00:46:54,191
where you can take
an ugly old mountain...

857
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,097
and put faces on it,
faces of great Americans...

858
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,010
who did so much to make
our country super great...

859
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:02,899
well, that makes me,
Rebecca Leeman...

860
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:04,874
proud to be an American.

861
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:09,324
I'm Lisa Swenson, and I am proud
to be an American...

862
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:11,218
because living in a country
where Lady Liberty...

863
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:14,034
always keeps her flame
burning bright...

864
00:47:15,443 --> 00:47:19,305
She always keeps her flame
burning bright.

865
00:47:19,348 --> 00:47:21,649
It makes me proud
to be an American.

866
00:47:21,684 --> 00:47:22,764
God.

867
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:24,626
The Washington Monument...

868
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,245
Oh, yeah, baby!

869
00:47:27,284 --> 00:47:28,232
Makes me...

870
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:31,341
Leslie Miller,
proud to be an American.

871
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:35,923
Living in a country
where no matter who you are...

872
00:47:35,955 --> 00:47:38,825
or where you come from,
you can grow up...

873
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:42,446
and become what you've always
dreamed of makes me...

874
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:45,483
Amber Atkins,
proud to be an American.

875
00:47:45,555 --> 00:47:48,938
Atomic power makes me,
Molly Howard...

876
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:51,313
proud to be an Asian-American.

877
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:54,861
My uncle Phil's world's-largest
ball of twine...

878
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,755
in Bundy, Minnesota...

879
00:47:56,787 --> 00:47:59,984
it makes me proud I'm American.

880
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:03,314
I kind of misunderstood
the assignment.

881
00:48:07,603 --> 00:48:10,832
A couple of notes from
yesterday's dress rehearsal.

882
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,177
Gladys says a couple of youse...

883
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:13,422
are getting sexy
with your hips...

884
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:15,564
during the physical
fitness routine.

885
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:18,002
Oh, my God,
my tap costume's gone.

886
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:21,297
Amber, we are not putting on
our talent costume.

887
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,535
You need to put on
your physical fitness outfit.

888
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:25,481
Let's shake a leg, ladies!

889
00:48:25,523 --> 00:48:27,890
It was here
before the opening number.

890
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:31,017
Wait.

891
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:33,296
What am I saying?

892
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:36,048
I should just ask you, Becky.

893
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,741
Where is it?

894
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:38,924
What?

895
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:41,352
You heard me. Where is it?

896
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:45,393
If you're getting at something,
you'd better just say it.

897
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,466
I just did.

898
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:49,263
Well, then you'd better be
willing to back it up...

899
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:50,673
because you're talking crazy.

900
00:48:50,707 --> 00:48:53,325
You bring me on some
of that snotty attitude.

901
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,442
Bring it on!

902
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:56,174
Well, as my mother says
at Sunday dinner...

903
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:57,258
come and get it!

904
00:48:57,299 --> 00:48:58,641
I'll get it!

905
00:48:58,675 --> 00:48:59,755
I might even take seconds!

906
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:02,446
If you want seconds,
I'll make sure you get them!

907
00:49:02,483 --> 00:49:03,825
Give me your stringy ass!

908
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,179
I think that you guys
should leave.

909
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,902
The girls are changing.
I think you should leave.

910
00:49:09,939 --> 00:49:11,345
All right, let's go.

911
00:49:11,379 --> 00:49:13,746
- I hate her!
- We all do. Let's go.

912
00:49:13,778 --> 00:49:15,688
Let's give a big round
of applause...

913
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:18,120
for last year's
American Teen Princess...

914
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:20,333
in her farewell performance.

915
00:49:20,403 --> 00:49:22,290
Who could ever forget
her lip-synching...

916
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:25,738
to "Don't Cry Out Loud"
by Melissa Manchester?

917
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:27,437
And here she is...

918
00:49:27,474 --> 00:49:29,133
Mary Johanson.

919
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:43,154
Don't cry out loud

920
00:49:43,186 --> 00:49:45,707
Just keep it inside

921
00:49:45,747 --> 00:49:50,155
And learn how to hide
your feelings

922
00:49:50,227 --> 00:49:55,529
Fly high and proud

923
00:49:55,603 --> 00:49:58,570
And if you should fall

924
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,032
Remember you almost

925
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:05,744
Had it all

926
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,411
All right, why don't we pick up
the stepladders...

927
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:11,531
for the physical fitness number?

928
00:50:11,571 --> 00:50:12,651
There we go.

929
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,032
They're wet.

930
00:50:14,066 --> 00:50:15,146
What?

931
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:16,615
My hands are stuck.

932
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,211
I'm kind of dizzy
from the fumes.

933
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:20,428
You know what, girls?

934
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:22,887
Keep them away from you so
they don't get on the outfits.

935
00:50:22,962 --> 00:50:24,009
There we go.

936
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,904
Let's form a line.

937
00:50:28,082 --> 00:50:29,708
What kind of a mental retard...

938
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:31,569
paints stepladders
right before a pageant?

939
00:50:31,602 --> 00:50:33,391
I'm the judge!

940
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:37,645
Back, you cuddly retard.

941
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:38,959
Go, Hank!

942
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,361
It's OK.

943
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:42,474
My dress is fine.

944
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,385
All right, so...

945
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,458
our other judges are...

946
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:49,993
Jean Kangas...

947
00:50:50,034 --> 00:50:51,375
and John Dough...

948
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,192
Opening number looked good...

949
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:57,554
solid, but now you're going
to have to actually dance.

950
00:50:57,618 --> 00:51:00,913
So, here, put a dab of this
on the old choppers, ladies.

951
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:02,604
It'll help you smile...

952
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,552
and when they're looking
at your teeth, God willing...

953
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,382
they won't be looking
at your feet.

954
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:25,799
Hurry up.

955
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:27,183
OK, I think we all got some.

956
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:28,778
Just take it off.

957
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,151
Here, I didn't...

958
00:52:31,185 --> 00:52:33,552
I think it went really well.

959
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:35,146
Don't go in the bathroom.

960
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,040
Tess blew chunks all over.

961
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,659
She ate a really large dinner.

962
00:52:39,697 --> 00:52:41,836
Maybe she should've
shoved that lucky bolt...

963
00:52:41,873 --> 00:52:43,302
down her throat for dessert.

964
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:47,335
And the winner
of the spirit award goes to...

965
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:50,758
I'd like to take you back
seventeen years...

966
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:54,063
when a peanut farmer
was in the White House...

967
00:52:54,097 --> 00:52:56,268
a group of boys
calling themselves Queen...

968
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:57,996
topped the record charts...

969
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,942
and Gladys Leeman
was Gladys Wood...

970
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,488
and she was Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

971
00:53:11,377 --> 00:53:13,711
Thank you very much.

972
00:53:13,745 --> 00:53:18,022
You know, seventeen years ago,
I won the talent contest...

973
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:19,210
by sewing...

974
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:21,387
these culottes...

975
00:53:21,425 --> 00:53:23,367
Butterick pattern
seven-four-three-two.

976
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,231
And can you believe it?

977
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:26,377
They still fit.

978
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:29,166
She had a big ass then,
she's got a big ass now.

979
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:31,568
Our next contestant is ready,
so let's welcome her...

980
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:32,975
Tess Weinhaus.

981
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,659
Yeah, it's just gone.

982
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:42,921
I mean...

983
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:45,961
I just wanna tap, you know?

984
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:50,441
I'm not saying I'm the best
or that I'd even win, but...

985
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:52,521
shouldn't I at least
get a chance to compete?

986
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:56,205
The beagle is known
for its howl.

987
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:02,569
I just wanted my mom
to see me dance.

988
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,227
Amber, Amber, come here.

989
00:54:05,297 --> 00:54:07,817
Please. I got so much Vaseline
on my teeth...

990
00:54:07,888 --> 00:54:09,830
I'm going to be smiling
for a year.

991
00:54:09,905 --> 00:54:11,399
No. Here.

992
00:54:11,472 --> 00:54:12,682
It's nothing special...

993
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:15,590
but talent like yours doesn't
need to hide behind sequins.

994
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:17,007
Oh, Miss K.

995
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,317
Oh, look.

996
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:23,502
But none can compare
to the greatest bark of all...

997
00:54:23,537 --> 00:54:25,708
the German shepherd.

998
00:54:28,145 --> 00:54:31,560
Aw, hell, go out there
and kick some Leeman ass.

999
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:34,923
Not so hard, sweetie.
I heard something snap.

1000
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:36,749
Roll him over!

1001
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:37,744
Lay him flat!

1002
00:54:38,736 --> 00:54:40,395
Pin his shoulders!

1003
00:54:40,465 --> 00:54:41,926
To the mat!

1004
00:54:42,928 --> 00:54:44,422
Roll him over! Lay him flat!

1005
00:54:44,496 --> 00:54:46,384
Pin their shoulders
to the mat!

1006
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:47,942
Go...

1007
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,293
Muskies! Yeah!

1008
00:54:58,992 --> 00:54:59,941
Fade in.

1009
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:04,365
The year... 2024.

1010
00:55:05,904 --> 00:55:07,562
Planet... Earth.

1011
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,607
The question
on everyone's mind?

1012
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:13,382
What is...

1013
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:14,950
Soylent Green?

1014
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,248
Mrs. Clark, why are you
doing this to me?

1015
00:55:22,288 --> 00:55:24,175
Why are you pretending
you don't know what's going on?

1016
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,150
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am.

1017
00:55:26,192 --> 00:55:27,599
But you know the rules.

1018
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,486
All talent costumes
have to be OK'd...

1019
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,829
by Gladys before the pageant.

1020
00:55:30,864 --> 00:55:32,358
But doesn't someone
taking your costume...

1021
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,767
so you can't compete
overrule that rule?

1022
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,774
Amber, I'm sorry.
I don't make up the rules.

1023
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,277
Oh, this...

1024
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,847
this is bullshit!

1025
00:55:39,888 --> 00:55:42,922
Amber Atkins, that is not
American Teen Princess language.

1026
00:55:42,992 --> 00:55:45,839
Good, because this isn't an
American Teen Princess Pageant.

1027
00:55:45,872 --> 00:55:47,781
This is... this is...

1028
00:55:47,856 --> 00:55:49,743
this is Nazi Germany!

1029
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,018
Where do they get this stuff?

1030
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:04,806
I'm wearing this tap costume.

1031
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:07,117
I'm going to do
my talent tonight.

1032
00:56:07,152 --> 00:56:08,329
Oh, really?

1033
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,797
I don't think so.

1034
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,307
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news...

1035
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,928
but you know the rules state
that a costume has to be OK'd...

1036
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,909
at least a week in advance.

1037
00:56:19,983 --> 00:56:23,366
I couldn't let you go out there
in that skimpy little thing.

1038
00:56:23,407 --> 00:56:24,901
We've got kids in the audience.

1039
00:56:24,944 --> 00:56:26,886
I hope you understand.

1040
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:28,422
But you... I mean...

1041
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:30,918
It's not my fault. Please.

1042
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,967
I didn't do anything wrong.

1043
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:35,396
I know the truth, that's why.

1044
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:36,716
I must say...

1045
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:38,824
Soylent Green...

1046
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,838
is people!

1047
00:56:44,399 --> 00:56:46,222
Now, that's my cue.

1048
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:27,370
I just wanted to compete.

1049
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:32,299
I can't believe
this is happening.

1050
00:57:32,335 --> 00:57:34,756
I can't believe she said...

1051
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,039
Here.

1052
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,508
Here? What?

1053
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,044
My jacket.

1054
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:49,388
Take it, because I got
my costume OK'd a month ago...

1055
00:57:49,454 --> 00:57:50,981
before the pageant.
You can wear it.

1056
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:52,462
Put it on.

1057
00:57:52,526 --> 00:57:53,574
Oh, wow.

1058
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:55,272
Lisa, I don't think
you should do this.

1059
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,001
They're never going to let you
perform naked. I asked.

1060
00:57:57,039 --> 00:57:59,111
Shut up, you guys.

1061
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,801
Listen, Amber...

1062
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:04,522
I'm not going to win.

1063
00:58:04,558 --> 00:58:07,013
And let's be honest, the family
only needs one Liza...

1064
00:58:07,055 --> 00:58:09,738
and Peter's got
much better legs than me, OK?

1065
00:58:09,774 --> 00:58:11,084
Your parents will kill you.

1066
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:13,704
Ah, come on.
I love them...

1067
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:17,191
but they only had me because
Peter needed that kidney.

1068
00:58:22,638 --> 00:58:23,718
Thank you.

1069
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,198
Now...

1070
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:29,733
it is with overwhelming pride...

1071
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:32,262
that I introduce to you
contestant number six...

1072
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:35,052
who is also the president of her
class two years running...

1073
00:58:35,086 --> 00:58:37,508
an honor roll student,
and the new president...

1074
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,689
of the Lutheran Sisterhood
Gun Club.

1075
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:40,904
Ladies and gentlemen...

1076
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:43,146
Rebecca Ann Leeman!

1077
00:58:50,638 --> 00:58:52,100
You know what?

1078
00:58:52,143 --> 00:58:53,572
The rumors are true.

1079
00:58:54,638 --> 00:58:57,954
I do have a special fella
in my life...

1080
00:58:59,022 --> 00:59:01,356
and if nobody minds...

1081
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:04,968
I'd like to sing a little song
just for him.

1082
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:11,565
You're just too good

1083
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:12,710
To be true

1084
00:59:13,902 --> 00:59:16,390
Can't take my eyes

1085
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:17,445
Off of you

1086
00:59:17,486 --> 00:59:18,566
Bullshit.

1087
00:59:18,606 --> 00:59:20,941
You'd be like heaven

1088
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,916
To touch

1089
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,616
I wanna hold you

1090
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,442
So much

1091
00:59:27,502 --> 00:59:28,996
At long last

1092
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:32,136
Love has arrived

1093
00:59:32,174 --> 00:59:34,563
And I thank God

1094
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:35,750
I'm alive

1095
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,467
You're just too good

1096
00:59:39,502 --> 00:59:41,411
To be true

1097
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:44,040
Can't take my eyes

1098
00:59:44,078 --> 00:59:45,485
Off of you

1099
00:59:46,574 --> 00:59:48,995
I love you, baby

1100
00:59:49,037 --> 00:59:50,630
And if it's quite all right

1101
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,644
I need you, baby

1102
00:59:52,685 --> 00:59:54,791
To warm the lonely night

1103
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,350
I love you, baby

1104
00:59:57,422 --> 00:59:59,364
Trust in me when I say

1105
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:01,860
Lisa, come on, you're next.

1106
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:03,428
Nah, I quit.

1107
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:06,087
And since my costume was OK'd
a month ago...

1108
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,238
I'm giving it to Amber.

1109
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:13,154
Let me love you, baby

1110
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:16,012
Let me love you

1111
01:00:30,606 --> 01:00:32,940
Oh, boy,
I'd hate to follow that act.

1112
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:35,559
The voice of an angel, that one.

1113
01:00:41,101 --> 01:00:44,135
I have just been notified
that contestant number seven...

1114
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:47,020
Lisa Swenson has dropped out
of the pageant.

1115
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:51,526
I know,
but these things happen...

1116
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,861
and we still have one more
contestant... number eight.

1117
01:00:54,893 --> 01:00:56,071
Amber Atkins.

1118
01:02:27,021 --> 01:02:28,908
Thank you.

1119
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,148
Well...

1120
01:02:44,524 --> 01:02:46,411
The time has finally come...

1121
01:02:48,012 --> 01:02:51,046
where we say good-bye
to the judges...

1122
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:54,946
so that they can go off and make
the toughest decision...

1123
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:56,133
of their lives.

1124
01:03:02,124 --> 01:03:03,466
So, who gets the crown?

1125
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,646
How are you going
to figure this all out?

1126
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:07,139
Well, you know, we'll...

1127
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,701
compare scores
and figure out a winner...

1128
01:03:09,773 --> 01:03:12,074
because, I mean, we don't know
who the winner is yet.

1129
01:03:12,108 --> 01:03:14,955
I mean, I have no idea
who Jean picked...

1130
01:03:14,988 --> 01:03:16,482
or Harold.

1131
01:03:16,556 --> 01:03:17,963
- No.
- No idea.

1132
01:03:19,692 --> 01:03:22,026
I know who the winner is.

1133
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,750
I know who the winner...
Harold.

1134
01:03:23,788 --> 01:03:25,446
I know who the winner is.

1135
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:26,826
That's it.

1136
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,689
You shut your goddamn mouth,
you goddamn retard!

1137
01:03:30,732 --> 01:03:33,602
I've had your shit
for two weeks now!

1138
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:34,626
Come on.

1139
01:03:36,204 --> 01:03:38,473
Back off, college boy!
Now listen!

1140
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:42,955
Hank can't help it if he's born
crazier than a shit-house rat!

1141
01:03:42,988 --> 01:03:46,566
For fuck's sake, why didn't you
leave him with a sitter?

1142
01:03:51,276 --> 01:03:52,520
Nice, John.

1143
01:03:52,556 --> 01:03:53,734
That's real nice.

1144
01:03:53,772 --> 01:03:56,489
You know the baby-sitter's dead.

1145
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:02,410
So...

1146
01:04:02,444 --> 01:04:04,298
Anyone talk to Jenelle lately?

1147
01:04:04,332 --> 01:04:06,918
Oh, yeah. I brought her
some flowers this morning.

1148
01:04:06,956 --> 01:04:09,258
Yeah. She's in the room
next to my mom.

1149
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:11,332
Oh, she's super happy.

1150
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,549
She's happy?

1151
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,759
Oh, the blow to her head
made her deaf.

1152
01:04:14,828 --> 01:04:15,940
Oh, God.

1153
01:04:16,012 --> 01:04:17,954
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, that's great.

1154
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:19,817
She's so happy.

1155
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:23,079
Jesus Christ!

1156
01:04:23,116 --> 01:04:25,930
What are they doing, letting
the retard count the votes?

1157
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:28,647
Ladies, it's time.

1158
01:04:47,211 --> 01:04:49,513
Welcome back, everybody...

1159
01:04:49,548 --> 01:04:50,595
and judges.

1160
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:52,610
Oh, gosh.

1161
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:55,433
We are so darn close
to that moment...

1162
01:04:55,468 --> 01:04:57,955
we have all been waiting for.

1163
01:04:57,996 --> 01:05:00,713
And now, our second runner-up...

1164
01:05:00,747 --> 01:05:02,951
and winner
of a fifty-dollar scholarship...

1165
01:05:02,987 --> 01:05:06,216
for the vo-tech
of her choice is...

1166
01:05:08,523 --> 01:05:09,635
Leslie Miller.

1167
01:05:14,572 --> 01:05:16,066
You rule, Leslie!

1168
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:30,343
Envelope, please.

1169
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:36,578
Our next prize, a seventy-five-
dollar scholarship...

1170
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:39,521
will be awarded
to the first runner-up.

1171
01:05:39,563 --> 01:05:41,570
The first runner-up is...

1172
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:47,463
Amber Atkins.

1173
01:06:12,811 --> 01:06:16,258
And now, finally the moment...

1174
01:06:16,299 --> 01:06:18,208
that I know
I've been waiting for.

1175
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,487
With a scholarship
of five hundred dollars...

1176
01:06:20,555 --> 01:06:23,850
courtesy Leeman Furniture,
and an all-expense-paid trip...

1177
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:26,949
next weekend, when she will be
competing for the title...

1178
01:06:26,986 --> 01:06:28,328
of Sarah Rose Cosmetics...

1179
01:06:28,362 --> 01:06:31,177
Minnesota
American Teen Princess...

1180
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:38,946
Our new...

1181
01:06:38,987 --> 01:06:42,500
Mount Rose
American Teen Princess is...

1182
01:06:43,978 --> 01:06:45,637
contestant number...

1183
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,260
You know what?
It's my daughter...

1184
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:50,688
Rebecca Ann Leeman!

1185
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:05,441
Oh, thank you so much.

1186
01:07:07,914 --> 01:07:09,736
Bitch.

1187
01:07:27,114 --> 01:07:29,186
Here she is

1188
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:30,632
Our Mount Rose

1189
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:33,033
American Teen Princess

1190
01:07:33,098 --> 01:07:35,105
Look at her

1191
01:07:35,146 --> 01:07:37,218
Doesn't she look fine?

1192
01:07:37,258 --> 01:07:40,390
Our heart swells big

1193
01:07:40,426 --> 01:07:42,728
As we look at her

1194
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:43,907
Our Mount Rose

1195
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:48,419
American Teen Princess

1196
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,985
One, two, three.

1197
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:52,873
- You got her there?
- Yeah, I got her.

1198
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:55,240
We was robbed. We was robbed.

1199
01:07:55,274 --> 01:07:57,510
It's OK. They're just
giving her a ride back.

1200
01:07:57,577 --> 01:08:00,065
She almost blew out of Loretta's
pickup on the way over.

1201
01:08:00,138 --> 01:08:01,545
Thank God for bungee cords.

1202
01:08:02,762 --> 01:08:04,704
I got second runner-up.

1203
01:08:04,778 --> 01:08:06,087
I got second place.

1204
01:08:06,122 --> 01:08:07,845
- Third.
- Huh?

1205
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:09,507
- Third.
- Bye.

1206
01:08:15,498 --> 01:08:18,727
Are you disappointed
about not winning?

1207
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,249
Yeah, well, no.

1208
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:26,276
At least I got to compete,
and my mom got to see me dance.

1209
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:28,703
I guess number eight
only worked for Diane Sawyer.

1210
01:08:28,778 --> 01:08:30,152
Oh, stop.

1211
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:31,233
Let's go home.

1212
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:32,735
I'll let you drive.

1213
01:08:34,634 --> 01:08:35,811
I hope it was worth it.

1214
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,759
No, Dad, it was worth it.

1215
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,110
Amber should've won.

1216
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:40,258
I tell you one thing...

1217
01:08:40,298 --> 01:08:41,759
Peter never would've pulled
a shenanigan like that.

1218
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:43,973
Well, you know what, Dad?

1219
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:45,919
You know what? Peter's gay.

1220
01:08:47,274 --> 01:08:48,386
Gay!

1221
01:08:49,962 --> 01:08:51,074
What?

1222
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,698
So, Becky, how does it feel?

1223
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:55,166
Oh, well...

1224
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,828
I mean,
it's all happening so fast.

1225
01:08:57,865 --> 01:08:59,872
I'm so excited.

1226
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:02,532
I mean, I won.

1227
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:06,213
I'm the winner,
and I'm going to state.

1228
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:09,315
She's the winner,
and we're going to state.

1229
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,597
What a surprise.

1230
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:12,291
Gladys Leeman's finally
going to go to state...

1231
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:13,736
and she'll probably
ride on Becky's ass...

1232
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:15,329
all the way to nationals, too.

1233
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:17,279
Wonder how she's going
to fix that one.

1234
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:19,525
Are you ladies going
to the parade?

1235
01:09:19,561 --> 01:09:22,311
Nah. I think I'm, like,
due or something.

1236
01:09:41,129 --> 01:09:44,163
Beautiful as a whore's ass
today, huh, boys?

1237
01:09:46,504 --> 01:09:48,741
Do you need help
with the cooler?

1238
01:10:08,297 --> 01:10:11,166
See, Gladys had me get that
special-made from Mexico...

1239
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:12,386
in case Becky won.

1240
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:14,279
You know, I do a lot
of business down there...

1241
01:10:14,313 --> 01:10:16,222
always offer
to pay them off in tacos.

1242
01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:19,039
Oh, they love that.

1243
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,325
Keep on moving through.

1244
01:10:23,337 --> 01:10:24,864
Let's get this straight
right now.

1245
01:10:24,904 --> 01:10:26,497
We wouldn't have been
late at all if not for you.

1246
01:10:26,536 --> 01:10:29,471
I want to have the big bag
of little doughnuts.

1247
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:30,592
You get nothing, Hank.

1248
01:10:30,632 --> 01:10:32,836
I want to eat a big bag
of little doughnuts.

1249
01:10:32,873 --> 01:10:34,815
There's your paint can.

1250
01:10:34,857 --> 01:10:36,319
The next time you drink
window cleaner...

1251
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:38,499
I'm just going to
leave it in you.

1252
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:44,294
My pants are...

1253
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:01,636
You rule!

1254
01:11:15,784 --> 01:11:16,798
Rebecca Ann Leeman.

1255
01:11:16,841 --> 01:11:19,459
You are the one
that wanted this.

1256
01:11:19,496 --> 01:11:20,641
Now get up there.

1257
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:23,648
I don't care if you have to ride
this thing sidesaddle.

1258
01:11:23,688 --> 01:11:24,768
Get up there.

1259
01:11:24,808 --> 01:11:27,230
It smells funny... like gasoline.

1260
01:11:27,272 --> 01:11:29,825
Everything smells
like that in Mexico.

1261
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:31,588
My dress will reek, Mother.

1262
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:32,933
You listen to me now, missy.

1263
01:11:32,968 --> 01:11:34,593
This thing cost your dad
a pretty penny...

1264
01:11:34,632 --> 01:11:36,158
so you get your ass up there.

1265
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,883
And show me some teeth.

1266
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,895
Love you, baby.

1267
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:52,835
You rule!

1268
01:11:54,952 --> 01:11:56,032
Stop it!

1269
01:11:56,072 --> 01:11:58,625
You are a bad kid!

1270
01:12:15,016 --> 01:12:16,477
You rule!

1271
01:12:20,328 --> 01:12:22,335
If I die from these fumes...

1272
01:12:22,376 --> 01:12:24,286
you'll make sure and cover up
the hickeys on my neck?

1273
01:12:26,696 --> 01:12:29,346
And the bite marks on my ears.

1274
01:12:29,384 --> 01:12:30,813
Yeah, sure.

1275
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,598
And I know it won't show,
but on my inner thighs...

1276
01:12:34,632 --> 01:12:36,006
Yes, Leslie, OK.

1277
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:37,566
Help!

1278
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,443
OK, I designed the float.

1279
01:12:49,479 --> 01:12:55,774
And what's going to happen here
is that this is going to look...

1280
01:12:55,816 --> 01:12:59,329
like a glistening lake
beneath the swan.

1281
01:13:00,456 --> 01:13:01,765
We need more bars.

1282
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:03,009
This is... What?

1283
01:13:03,048 --> 01:13:04,193
Enid ate a whole pan.

1284
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:05,540
She can't do anything
by herself.

1285
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:09,090
This is exactly
how I pictured it...

1286
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:10,883
Choking on swan gas.

1287
01:13:13,096 --> 01:13:15,038
Oh, great.

1288
01:13:23,047 --> 01:13:24,454
Oh, my God.

1289
01:13:27,463 --> 01:13:29,602
Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

1290
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:30,719
Oh, my God.

1291
01:13:30,759 --> 01:13:32,221
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

1292
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,294
Oh, my baby!

1293
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:50,050
Oh, my God!

1294
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:52,672
The swan ate my baby!

1295
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:57,950
Becky, baby, get up!

1296
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:00,227
We got to go to state!

1297
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:04,542
Gladys, let her go.

1298
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,696
No. She's not getting up.

1299
01:14:05,735 --> 01:14:08,223
We got to...
Get off of me, you cow!

1300
01:14:11,431 --> 01:14:14,180
What are you looking at, huh?

1301
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:16,800
A whole goddamned town
full of losers...

1302
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:18,365
that's what I'm looking at!

1303
01:14:20,518 --> 01:14:21,598
And you...

1304
01:14:23,142 --> 01:14:24,898
You piece of shit trailer trash!

1305
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:27,586
That should've been you
in there!

1306
01:14:27,623 --> 01:14:29,827
Damn it, I should've killed you
when I had a chance...

1307
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:31,804
just like your little friend!

1308
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:36,156
Tammy was one crispy critter
up on that thresher!

1309
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:38,719
Ding! Fries are up!

1310
01:14:39,814 --> 01:14:41,221
Stop it! Stop it!

1311
01:14:47,846 --> 01:14:48,926
Take it easy.

1312
01:14:48,966 --> 01:14:50,690
Let go of me!

1313
01:14:50,726 --> 01:14:52,068
Oh, my God, it's "Cops. "

1314
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:53,564
He sells reproductions!

1315
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,486
His furniture's as fake
as my orgasms.

1316
01:14:56,519 --> 01:14:57,926
Hey, how you doing?

1317
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,365
Hey. What's up, Scott?

1318
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:00,959
You remember Bruce, right?

1319
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:03,365
Bruce, that's Roy.
Roy, Bruce.

1320
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:08,351
And that's why, dear Lord,
it's with such great sorrow...

1321
01:15:08,391 --> 01:15:10,911
we turn over to you
this young woman...

1322
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:13,154
whose dream of riding
on a giant swan...

1323
01:15:13,191 --> 01:15:15,329
has brought about
her untimely death.

1324
01:15:15,367 --> 01:15:20,669
Maybe it's your way
of telling us to buy American.

1325
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:22,881
That's right.

1326
01:15:24,582 --> 01:15:26,404
As acting president...

1327
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,544
of the Mount Rose
Civil Servettes...

1328
01:15:28,615 --> 01:15:30,175
it is my duty...

1329
01:15:30,246 --> 01:15:35,614
to make you Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

1330
01:15:37,702 --> 01:15:39,590
Turn around for the picture.

1331
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:40,571
You look good.

1332
01:15:44,422 --> 01:15:46,146
What is wrong with you?

1333
01:15:46,182 --> 01:15:47,262
I don't know.

1334
01:15:47,302 --> 01:15:48,797
I didn't wanna win like this.

1335
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:50,626
You stop right there.

1336
01:15:50,662 --> 01:15:52,069
You are a good person.

1337
01:15:52,102 --> 01:15:54,469
Good things happen
to good people.

1338
01:15:54,502 --> 01:15:55,582
Really?

1339
01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:58,011
No, it's pure bullshit, sweetie.

1340
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,705
You're lucky as hell,
so you might as well enjoy it.

1341
01:16:00,774 --> 01:16:02,334
Let's get you a root-beer float.

1342
01:16:02,406 --> 01:16:04,479
You guys want some shots?
I'm buying.

1343
01:16:05,446 --> 01:16:08,763
I never liked her,
but she didn't deserve...

1344
01:16:08,806 --> 01:16:11,173
to die in the belly
of a swan like that.

1345
01:16:11,206 --> 01:16:15,843
The whole thing's just kinda
sad and lame at the same time.

1346
01:16:16,966 --> 01:16:18,854
This came for you, sweetie.

1347
01:16:18,886 --> 01:16:20,447
Hi, guys.

1348
01:16:20,486 --> 01:16:22,209
It's from the state!

1349
01:16:22,246 --> 01:16:23,675
Yeah. Open it up.

1350
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:27,013
It's all the stuff I get to do.

1351
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:29,282
OK, let's see.

1352
01:16:30,469 --> 01:16:33,765
We get a personal consultation
with a makeup artist.

1353
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:37,765
Oh, there'll be
a choreographer to the stars.

1354
01:16:37,797 --> 01:16:39,204
- Choreographer.
- The stars.

1355
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:41,605
Oh, my God.

1356
01:16:41,637 --> 01:16:43,361
No way. Oh, my God.

1357
01:16:43,397 --> 01:16:45,764
For Christ's sakes,
spit it out, Amber.

1358
01:16:45,798 --> 01:16:48,645
We'll be staying overnight at...

1359
01:16:48,678 --> 01:16:50,401
the Airport Howard Johnson!

1360
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:51,844
Right by the airport!

1361
01:16:51,878 --> 01:16:52,958
Oh, Amber!

1362
01:16:52,997 --> 01:16:54,884
God, that's so great!

1363
01:16:56,358 --> 01:16:58,724
Oh, crap. I only got
four weeks to practice.

1364
01:16:58,757 --> 01:17:00,164
Let's go, let's go!
Right now!

1365
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,277
I'm gonna call your mom.

1366
01:17:30,949 --> 01:17:32,989
All right, say, "airport hotel. "

1367
01:17:33,061 --> 01:17:33,988
Airport hotel!

1368
01:17:34,021 --> 01:17:35,908
Coffee and doughnuts.

1369
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,509
Yeah, why don't you
take a picture?

1370
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:42,469
It lasts longer.

1371
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:43,516
Loretta, don't do that.

1372
01:17:43,557 --> 01:17:44,866
All right. I'm sorry.
They're just staring.

1373
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:46,308
I gotta work with these girls.

1374
01:17:46,341 --> 01:17:47,454
OK, I'm sorry.

1375
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,532
And you are...

1376
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,932
Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

1377
01:18:16,965 --> 01:18:18,875
Funny, you don't look dead.

1378
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,452
- OK, ladies!
- Girls, come on.

1379
01:18:24,485 --> 01:18:27,005
Ladies, listen up.
I'm Colleen Douglas.

1380
01:18:27,045 --> 01:18:30,209
And this raven beauty
on my right is Terry Macy.

1381
01:18:30,245 --> 01:18:31,357
Hi there.

1382
01:18:31,397 --> 01:18:33,885
And we're your Minnesota
American Teen Princess...

1383
01:18:33,925 --> 01:18:35,135
state board.

1384
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:36,449
That's right.

1385
01:18:36,484 --> 01:18:39,168
We're also the cofounders of
the Minnesota Modeling Academy.

1386
01:18:39,237 --> 01:18:40,960
Yep. And you can get
your applications...

1387
01:18:40,997 --> 01:18:42,404
over here at the tiki bar...

1388
01:18:42,436 --> 01:18:44,324
and we will wave the
fifty-dollar application fee...

1389
01:18:44,356 --> 01:18:46,723
if you list a friend
and put down her address.

1390
01:18:48,037 --> 01:18:49,281
So...

1391
01:18:49,316 --> 01:18:50,429
you're cute.

1392
01:18:51,396 --> 01:18:52,706
Oh, I see you're married.

1393
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:56,002
If you catch this in your mouth,
I'll give you a present.

1394
01:18:56,036 --> 01:18:57,825
All right? Open wide.

1395
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,512
Oh, God, you got that
on the first try.

1396
01:19:00,549 --> 01:19:02,436
Come here.

1397
01:19:02,469 --> 01:19:04,225
Oh, you are cute.

1398
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,787
OK, due to budgetary
cutbacks...

1399
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:07,235
And the fact...

1400
01:19:07,268 --> 01:19:09,156
that the national didn't
cough up a goddamn nickel...

1401
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,943
You won't be staying overnight.

1402
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:12,507
So everybody pay attention.

1403
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,199
You've got about eight hours
till showtime.

1404
01:19:15,236 --> 01:19:16,894
Remember to count, ladies.

1405
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:19,747
Cross on the left
and arms up on eight.

1406
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,722
On the beat, on the beat,
on the beat!

1407
01:19:21,764 --> 01:19:24,153
Keep on. Keep moving it.

1408
01:19:24,196 --> 01:19:25,603
Come on, Miss Forest Lake...

1409
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:27,359
take that stick out of your ass
or I will!

1410
01:19:27,397 --> 01:19:28,990
All right. Very nice.

1411
01:19:29,028 --> 01:19:30,173
Now come on.

1412
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:31,707
Mom's out here in the front row.

1413
01:19:31,748 --> 01:19:32,828
Come on. Sell it!

1414
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,657
That's very nice.

1415
01:19:34,692 --> 01:19:35,936
Remember, figure eights, ladies.

1416
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:42,137
I can sum up our entire
philosophy with this glass.

1417
01:19:42,212 --> 01:19:44,219
I can look at it and see...

1418
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:45,819
it's half full.

1419
01:19:45,893 --> 01:19:48,446
Which in the beauty pageant biz
means...

1420
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:50,011
"Where the hell is my waiter?!"

1421
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:52,092
- Marco!
- Polo!

1422
01:19:52,132 --> 01:19:55,165
Stop with the friggin' Marco
Polo, or I'll come over there...

1423
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:56,698
and rip your
fat little heads off!

1424
01:20:05,604 --> 01:20:08,157
Miss Burnsville,
you're up next.

1425
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,843
I have a little
secret weapon of my own.

1426
01:20:16,836 --> 01:20:17,916
Don't tell anyone.

1427
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:32,099
Oh, I don't eat shellfish.

1428
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:33,757
Ma always says,
"Don't eat anything...

1429
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,202
"that can carry its house
around with it.

1430
01:20:35,236 --> 01:20:37,145
"Who knows the last time
it's been cleaned?"

1431
01:20:37,187 --> 01:20:39,075
I've done
about thirty-five pageants.

1432
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,758
I guess my most memorable one...

1433
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:44,162
would have to be
Miss Teen America 1995...

1434
01:20:44,228 --> 01:20:45,635
'cause it was in Vegas.

1435
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:48,188
And my roommate did Adam West.

1436
01:20:48,259 --> 01:20:51,391
She said he was so horny.

1437
01:21:03,236 --> 01:21:04,413
Oh, my God.

1438
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:23,393
I should just go home now.

1439
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:25,858
OK, real good.

1440
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:27,298
One suggestion, sweetie.

1441
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:29,852
Why don't you hike up your skirt
a little bit then, OK?

1442
01:21:30,851 --> 01:21:31,964
Next!

1443
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:35,939
Oh, my God.

1444
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:37,378
I gotta go!

1445
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:39,778
You better do something
about those nerves, sweetie.

1446
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,218
Thirty million people
aren't gonna wait for you...

1447
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:42,658
while you run to the john.

1448
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:44,098
That's true.

1449
01:21:46,211 --> 01:21:48,480
Will somebody
get a mop and a bucket?

1450
01:21:48,547 --> 01:21:51,514
Today, a beauty pageant
turned ugly.

1451
01:21:54,499 --> 01:21:55,808
Did I win?

1452
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,436
Honey, if I was a good lover...

1453
01:21:57,475 --> 01:21:59,417
Oh, for crap sake.

1454
01:21:59,459 --> 01:22:00,866
A salmonella dysentery
outbreak...

1455
01:22:00,899 --> 01:22:03,452
now traced to improperly
refrigerated shellfish...

1456
01:22:03,491 --> 01:22:05,946
was believed to be the cause.

1457
01:22:11,555 --> 01:22:14,141
Oh, my God.
Do you think they heard us?

1458
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,594
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Call an ambulance!

1459
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:18,715
An ambulance?

1460
01:22:18,755 --> 01:22:20,478
Call a priest,
for Christ's sake!

1461
01:22:21,827 --> 01:22:23,834
Joining us now
is David Richardson...

1462
01:22:23,907 --> 01:22:27,202
a member of a documentary crew
filming the pageant.

1463
01:22:27,267 --> 01:22:29,788
He was there
when tragedy struck.

1464
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:33,947
Fuckin' beauty queens
blowin' chunks everywhere.

1465
01:22:33,987 --> 01:22:37,631
I've never seen anything
like it before, and...

1466
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:38,911
I live in L.A.

1467
01:22:38,946 --> 01:22:40,223
Oh, hey, Ed.

1468
01:22:41,187 --> 01:22:42,593
That's our sound guy.

1469
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:44,514
Could you tell us anything
about the controversy?

1470
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:45,954
Is there a controversy here?

1471
01:22:45,987 --> 01:22:47,296
Has there been sabotage?

1472
01:22:47,331 --> 01:22:48,225
Wait a minute.

1473
01:22:48,259 --> 01:22:50,146
While we haven't
ruled out sabotage...

1474
01:22:50,178 --> 01:22:51,771
from neighboring
state pageants...

1475
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,404
Iowa, Wisconsin, South Dakota.

1476
01:22:53,475 --> 01:22:54,685
Yeah, that's right.

1477
01:22:54,755 --> 01:22:56,642
Ohio.

1478
01:22:56,675 --> 01:22:57,602
That bitch from Wisconsin.

1479
01:22:57,635 --> 01:22:58,583
All right then.

1480
01:22:58,658 --> 01:23:00,731
The important thing
is we have a winner!

1481
01:23:00,771 --> 01:23:01,883
- Yes, we do.
- OK.

1482
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:04,094
The Minnesota Modeling Academy
is proud to present...

1483
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:05,854
Along with Sarah Rose
Cosmetics...

1484
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:06,970
Amber Atkins...

1485
01:23:08,514 --> 01:23:11,296
The new Minnesota
American Teen Princess!

1486
01:23:11,331 --> 01:23:12,443
That's Amber Atkins.

1487
01:23:12,483 --> 01:23:14,370
That's right.
From Mount Rose.

1488
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:17,185
Amber, how do you feel?

1489
01:23:17,218 --> 01:23:18,625
Well, I...

1490
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:20,894
I feel like I need
to take a shower.

1491
01:23:22,018 --> 01:23:23,774
Honey, is this the best day
of your life?

1492
01:23:23,811 --> 01:23:26,680
Yeah. I wish
my mom was here, though.

1493
01:23:26,722 --> 01:23:28,129
Wave hi to her.

1494
01:23:28,162 --> 01:23:29,569
Hi, Mom.

1495
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:31,041
Hey, you hear that?

1496
01:23:31,075 --> 01:23:32,481
Hi, monkey.

1497
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:34,237
I got some.

1498
01:23:36,194 --> 01:23:38,561
Uh-huh. No, no. Gosh, no.

1499
01:23:38,594 --> 01:23:40,766
You know, I still don't
want to be on camera.

1500
01:23:40,802 --> 01:23:43,006
I just wanna say...

1501
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:45,279
that little bitch
better watch her back...

1502
01:23:45,314 --> 01:23:46,875
at the nationals...

1503
01:23:46,914 --> 01:23:49,281
'cause I am making friends
on the inside.

1504
01:23:49,314 --> 01:23:51,354
Yeah. Darn good friends.

1505
01:23:51,395 --> 01:23:53,434
Friends who have friends
on the outside.

1506
01:23:53,474 --> 01:23:55,546
Get your sweet ass
off the phone, Cinnamon.

1507
01:23:55,586 --> 01:23:56,699
Gotta go.

1508
01:23:57,954 --> 01:23:58,882
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:00,321
I just can't believe it.

1510
01:24:00,354 --> 01:24:02,110
I'm Minnesota's
American Teen Princess.

1511
01:24:02,146 --> 01:24:04,034
Our baby's going to nationals.

1512
01:24:04,066 --> 01:24:05,921
Lincoln, Alabama, look out!

1513
01:24:07,426 --> 01:24:09,564
I'm gonna be on TV
just like Diane Sawyer.

1514
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,073
Annette, just use your hand.

1515
01:24:15,106 --> 01:24:16,632
They told me to practice.

1516
01:24:29,378 --> 01:24:30,807
I did it.

1517
01:24:30,882 --> 01:24:32,343
OK. Ready?

1518
01:24:32,418 --> 01:24:35,266
Here's the signal I'm gonna give
Mom when I'm on TV.

1519
01:24:37,058 --> 01:24:39,392
My little Carol Burnett.

1520
01:24:39,426 --> 01:24:40,833
Here she is...

1521
01:24:40,865 --> 01:24:43,037
Minnesota's
American Teen Princess...

1522
01:24:43,074 --> 01:24:44,481
and soon to be...

1523
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:47,862
the next America's
American Teen Princess...

1524
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:49,662
our little Amber.

1525
01:25:10,881 --> 01:25:13,085
So after Frank
dusts the crops...

1526
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:15,969
he's taking her
to Lincoln, Alabama.

1527
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,974
Come on out...

1528
01:27:35,008 --> 01:27:38,391
you little blond piece
of trailer-park trash!

1529
01:27:43,584 --> 01:27:46,551
We're here in the sixth hour
of a shootout between...

1530
01:27:52,544 --> 01:27:53,951
This is Amber Atkins...

1531
01:27:53,984 --> 01:27:57,148
reporting live from
the Food Shack for KRLH News.

1532
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,072
One of our reporters
has just been shot.

1533
01:27:59,104 --> 01:28:01,974
Paramedics are working on her
right now...

1534
01:28:05,184 --> 01:28:06,711
I'm Peter Atchison.

1535
01:28:06,752 --> 01:28:08,159
And I'm Amber Atkins.

1536
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:10,264
For WAZB News, good night.
