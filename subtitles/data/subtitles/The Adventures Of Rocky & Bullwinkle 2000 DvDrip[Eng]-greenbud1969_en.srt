00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,670
1964, a crucial moment
in American history...

2
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,870
Lyndon Johnson is re-elected to
the presidency by a landslide,

3
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,440
The New York Worlïs Fair
introduces a bright new future.

4
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,950
And after five scintillating
years on the air...

5
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,550
Presto!

6
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,120
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show
is abruptly cancelled.

7
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,350
- Cancelled?!
- Cancelled?!

8
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,120
Uh, sorry about that, boys.

9
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,230
A lothas changed
in 35 years.

10
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,230
Velcro has replaced
the zipper.

11
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,530
Sneakers have
lights on them.

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,400
The Cold War is over.

13
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,240
And The Rocky and
Bullwinkle Show...

14
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,370
is still cancelled.

15
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,140
Frostbite Falls, Minnesota,

16
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,050
once the beloved home
of Rocky and Bullwinkle,

17
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,880
had been a thriving
cartoon town.

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,650
Nowit was crippled
by years of reruns.

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,390
The beautiful
Frostbite Falls Forest...

20
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,050
decimated.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,090
The once majestic falls
above Veronica Lake...

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,070
...devastated.

23
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,500
While the narrator...
thas me...

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,230
down on his luck
and out of a job,

25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,670
was forced to move in
with his mother

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,240
where he was reduced
to narrating

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,870
the events
of his own life.

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,340
"With the speed and dexterity

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,040
astonishing in a woman
of her advancing years,

30
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,080
Mother bastes the chicken,
tosses the salad,

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,280
and mashes the potatoes."

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,410
Oh, sonny,
shut up!

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,950
Ow!

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,620
And in a little house
at the top of a stump forest,

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,420
Rocky and Bullwinkle
themselves,

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,590
were forced to subsist
on ever-diminishing
residual checks

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,530
from reruns of their oldshow.

38
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,600
World famous television stars

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,070
whose adventures once
took them all over the globe,

40
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,600
now their exploits
were just a memory.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,100
Yes, it was a
melancholy time indeed.

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,070
Rocky the flying squirrel
hadn't flown in years.

43
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,770
Whas the point?

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,610
I guess the world just doesn't
need us anymore, Bullwinkle.

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,950
Say, where are
you going?

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,120
All this exposition
is wearing me out.

47
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm going for a walk
in the woods.

48
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,880
But, Bullwinkle,
there aren't any
woods anymore.

49
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,000
You don't have
to tell me.

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,300
I'm the chairman of
the Frostbite Falls Society
for Wildlife Conversation.

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,390
You mean
wildlife conservation.

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,560
What did I say?

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,940
You said,
"wildlife conversation."

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,600
Somebody's going to start
talking about these things.

55
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,010
Yes, even their wordplay
had become hackneyed and cheap.

56
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,110
No, it was always
like this.

57
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,080
But times were just as tough
half way across the drawing

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,480
in the former Soviet satellite
of Pottsylvania.

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,450
Where Rocky and Bullwinkle's
archrivals,

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,490
Boris and Natasha,

61
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,750
and their fearless leader...

62
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,950
Fearless Leader...

63
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,530
were cooking up
their latest scheme

64
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,990
for taking over the world,

65
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,330
when their plans
were crushed

66
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,190
by the fall
of the Iron Curtain.

67
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,000
Whas going on?

68
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,260
But, while the citizens
of Pottsylvania

69
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,500
rejoiced in their
new found freedom...

70
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,040
Yay!

71
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,300
...Fearless Leaderand
his cohorts went underground,

72
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,170
where upon they embarked
upona terrifying plan,

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
a plan that would take them
to a strange new land

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,380
where the line between cartoon
and reality is so thin,

75
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,650
thas is hard to tell
one from the other.

76
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,480
A place where with
the right special effects,

77
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,560
it might just be possible
to break through...

78
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,150
to the otherside!

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,570
It was a beautiful and smoggy
day at Phony Pictures Studio,

80
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,540
where an ambitious junior
executive named Minnie Mogul

81
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,510
was busy searching
for a hot new script.

82
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,200
Too intelligent.

83
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,840
Too intelligent.

84
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,140
Hello, Minnie.

85
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,880
Holy mackerel!
Who areyou?

86
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,050
Three ofthe most
terrifying villains

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,420
in the history of
children's television.

88
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,510
How do you do?

89
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,890
Nice to meetyou.

90
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,150
What do you want?

91
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,560
We were wondering,
how would you like

92
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,060
toproduce the Rocky
andBullwinkle movie?

93
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,070
I'd love to.
I love it.

94
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,500
What is it?

95
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,900
Is classic American cartoon
from early '60s.

96
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,940
Mm-hmm.

97
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,510
Listen, Minnie...

98
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,340
we're stuck in reruns.
You're looking for a project.

99
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,880
Maybe we can help
each other out.

100
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,210
This contractgives
youallrights

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,440
to The Rockyand
Bullwinkle Show.

102
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,210
All you have to do
is sign right here

103
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,350
andyour fiirst
producing endeavor
is as goodas gold.

104
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,790
Whas the matter?

105
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,520
I can't sign a contract

106
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,220
that will help three ruthless
villains take over the world.

107
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,090
I just can't.

108
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,690
Why not!?

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,270
My pen's out ofink.

110
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,100
Use mine.

111
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay.

112
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,370
And then through the miracle
of computer-generated

113
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,600
digital technology...

114
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,140
Minnie reached
into the televisionset

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,870
and signedthe contract.

116
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,110
But when she tried
to pull the contractout...

117
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,410
the expensive animated
characters

118
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,610
were instantly converted
into evenmore expensive

119
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,120
motionpicture stars.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,630
Hey...

121
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,330
how did that happen?

122
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,140
We're attached
to the project.

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,800
But even though thepun
was weak,

124
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,110
the contract was ironclad.

125
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,310
And the three villains
walked out of the studio

126
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,150
and into the real world,

127
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,690
while Minnie marched
straight into the offiice

128
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,590
of Phony Pictures' C.E.O.,
P. G. Biggershot.

129
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,480
But unfortunately for her,

130
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,460
when she pitched her project
to the powerful executive,

131
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,930
she ran into
an unexpected snag.

132
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,660
I don't like
moose pictures.

133
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,530
So while Minnie's motion
picture plans were stymied,

134
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,160
back in Frostbite Falls,

135
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,470
Bullwinkle got a rare flash
of inspiration.

136
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,170
It is kinda hot in here.

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,370
I've been inspiring
for hours.

138
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,880
- Hey, where areyou going?
- I'm going to the White House,

139
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,680
to talk to the president
about the trees.

140
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,480
So Rocky and Bullwinkle set off
on the road to Washington.

141
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,450
I don't know, Bullwinkle,
it looks a little jammed.

142
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,580
Horsefeathers!
How bad could it be?

143
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,630
Rocky:
Look at all the red tape!

144
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,990
Don't worry,
little buddy.

145
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,460
I'm sure the president
will send for us

146
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,530
after all the letters
I wrote him.

147
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,500
Why, I bet
any second now...

148
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,210
or two...
or three... or four...

149
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,640
or two...
or three... or four...

150
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,070
There the matter seemed
destined to rest...

151
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,010
until six months later,
in Washington, D. C.,

152
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,640
when idealistic,
warm hearted,

153
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,410
and beautiful FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy,

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,820
was summoned to the office
of hard-boiled FBI director,

155
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
"Cappy" Von Trappment.

156
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,380
Agent Sympathy,

157
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,320
given all your bungled
assignments in the past,

158
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,520
I suppose
you were wondering

159
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,990
why I picked you
for this mission.

160
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,430
Yes, sir.

161
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,500
Sympathy,
allow me to be frank.

162
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,230
Thisjob requires
the ideal FBI agent...

163
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,700
someone tough,

164
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,930
someone
hard-bitten,

165
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,270
someone
emotionless.

166
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,600
Do you understand?

167
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,070
Yes, sir. Tough!
Hard-boiled! Unemotional!

168
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,670
Good.

169
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,580
Are you familiar with
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show?

170
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,670
Oh-hh!

171
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,750
I mean... ahem...

172
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,760
I've heard of it.

173
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,590
171/2 short minutes later...

174
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,920
Cappy:
Mr. President,

175
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,160
this is a regular
networkTV station.

176
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,090
Announcer:
PresidentSignoff,

177
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,860
standing firm lyin
the middle of the road.

178
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,300
But lookwhat happens
when we switch to cable...

179
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,880
For the last six months,

180
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,280
a cartoon villain from the old
Rocky and Bullwinkle Show

181
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,040
named Fearless Leader
has been buying up

182
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,590
every single hour of cable
programming in this country,

183
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,780
forming asingle
gigantic network

184
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,150
called RBTV,

185
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,390
or "Really Bad Television."

186
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,790
According to our sources,
three days from now

187
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,730
Fearless Leader plans
to broadcast TV shows
so terrible,

188
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,500
they'll turn anyone
who watches them

189
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,330
into a mindless zombie,

190
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,240
incapable of independent
thought.

191
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,280
Totally different
than regular TV.

192
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,810
The RBTV broadcast
starts at noon on Saturday.

193
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,400
By 8:00 that night,

194
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,850
Fearless Leaderwill have
hypnotized enough viewers

195
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,440
that he can go on the air

196
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,820
and make the whole country
vote for him as president.

197
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,150
Well...

198
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,490
thas no good...

199
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,750
No.

200
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,490
No, I mean...

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,260
I want to be president again.

202
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,330
Yes.

203
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,600
We all know that, sir.

204
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
Can't the Pentagon
do something about this?

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,940
Any recommendations?

206
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,130
General Foods?

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,710
General Store?

208
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,370
General Admission?

209
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,000
We can't think ofanything,
Mr. President.

210
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,710
Can't the FBI
do anything, Cappy?

211
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,080
We've already sent three
crack agents to infii ltrate
RBTV...

212
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,210
They've disappeared.

213
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,090
Is almost as if there were
a mole in the White House.

214
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,690
Thas just ridiculous.

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,090
Yes, sir.

216
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,960
Mr. President,

217
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,370
our only chance is to call on
those two gallant heroes...

218
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,700
who successfully foiled
Fearless Leader's schemes
forworld conquest...

219
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,900
backwhen he posed
a threat in the 1960s.

220
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,840
If anyone can stop him,
they can.

221
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,470
Rocky and Bullwinkle!

222
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,050
Rocky and Bullwinkle, sir.

223
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,590
Sympathy, you've got
exactly 46 hours...

224
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,250
to get Rocky and Bullwinkle
to New York

225
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,490
and shut down
Fearless Leader's
broadcast.

226
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,090
Thank you, sir.
I won't fail.

227
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,500
Just be careful.

228
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,260
We've already lost three
ofour best agents.

229
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,930
So good luck.

230
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,870
Oh, sir,
just one thing...

231
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,600
How do I get Rocky and
Bullwinkle out ofreruns?

232
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,770
I don't know.

233
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,210
Fearless Leader
and those other two

234
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,340
got out somehow,
didn't they?

235
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,970
Figure it out!

236
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,780
And, Sympathy,
remember,

237
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,020
we only care
about results.

238
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,330
Within the hour, Karen
was enroute to LosAngeles.

239
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,300
She was determined to give
the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie

240
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,340
the green light.

241
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,100
Rocky:
Whas happening?

242
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,570
Cobs and shuckins, Rock!

243
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,070
The president must be
beaming us to Washington!

244
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,070
Thas not the president,
Bullwinkle.

245
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,330
Thas agreenlight
from Hollywood.

246
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,840
Those TV people
musve changed their minds.

247
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
Whoa!

248
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,080
Goodbye, sonny!

249
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,090
Narrator:
I'llbeback forhiatus, Ma!

250
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,850
Bullwinkle:
Hang on, Rocky!

251
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,620
Narrator:
Mama!

252
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,330
Oof!

253
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,770
Hokey smoke!
Areyou all right?

254
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,610
Yeah, but I think
we're on the wrong show.

255
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,120
Look how well
they drew that girl!

256
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,780
Is you.

257
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,310
Is really you!

258
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,350
Rocky...

259
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,960
and Bull...

260
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
Bull...

261
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,230
- Bull...
- I believe the word...

262
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,800
you're searching for
is "winkle."

263
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,300
Bullwinkle.

264
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,600
Hey, what network
areyou from?

265
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,500
I'm not from any network.

266
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,440
Agent Karen Sympathy, FBI.

267
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,710
Listen, you guys.
I've been sent here because...

268
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,980
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get out ofhere fast.

269
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,990
Quick!
Les go to a commercial!

270
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,920
What is this,
PBS?

271
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,320
Come on!

272
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,130
Les go!

273
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,990
- Hold it right there, lady!
- Just a second!

274
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,000
Er...
this way!

275
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,000
Hey, wait for me!

276
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,700
Ow!

277
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,240
Ow!

278
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,410
Bullwinkle, I don't think
we're on television anymore.

279
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,990
Bullwinkle, can you rappel?

280
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,290
Sure! I've been repelling
viewers foryears!

281
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,690
Never mind.
Get on my back.

282
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,960
I'll carry you down.

283
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,460
What about Rocky?

284
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,500
He's a flying squirrel.
He'll manage.

285
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,760
Er...

286
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,070
Bullwinkle:
Aah!

287
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,570
Ooh!

288
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,410
Hurry up, Rocky!
Fly down!

289
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,260
Just like old times.

290
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,950
Aaah!

291
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,230
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

292
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,030
Rocky! You okay?

293
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,570
Sure, just out ofpractice.

294
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,210
Moments later...

295
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,440
Agent Sympathy, can I ask you
something personal?

296
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,240
Didyou watch ourshow?

297
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,410
Did I watch your show?
I lovedyour show!

298
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,280
- You did?
- Sure!

299
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,510
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to have adventures
like you guys.

300
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,520
Thas why
I joined the Bureau.

301
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,060
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Really?

302
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,630
But that little girl
doesn't exist anymore, Rocky.

303
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,250
They don't want her kind
in the FBI.

304
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,230
I do exist! I do exist!
Let me out!

305
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,460
- There's something in your eye.
- No, there's not.

306
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,870
Ow!

307
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,960
All right, we need
to get to New York

308
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,100
and stop Fearless Leader's
broadcast within 40 hours.

309
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,340
Rocky:
Waitaminute!

310
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,310
Why don't we take an airplane?

311
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,380
Because then it wouldn't be
a road movie. Whee-ee!

312
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,980
Karen:
We don'tknow how, but Fearless
Leader, Boris and Natasha

313
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,750
escaped from the cartoon world
into the real world.

314
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,050
- So the president sent me to...
- Ofcourse!

315
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,150
The president got my letters
about the trees!

316
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,730
What trees?

317
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,660
The Frostbite Falls Forest.
I knew he would respond.

318
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,630
- Look, we don't have time...
- Bullwinkle,

319
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,960
this lady isn't here
about the trees.

320
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,730
- She's from the FBI.
- FBI?

321
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,640
Didn't they take
our show off the air?

322
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,680
- You mean the FCC.
- Didn't they like it either?

323
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,270
Look...

324
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,010
Can you believe we used
to get paid for this routine?

325
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,410
Would you listen
to me, please?

326
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,010
Finally, in a crisis
of conscience,

327
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,180
Karen decided
to tell...

328
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,690
an untruth.

329
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,280
Okay, you're right.

330
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,150
The president sent me
because he wants you to head...

331
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,490
the... er...

332
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,820
Committee for Animated
Wildlife Preservation.

333
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,420
Ooh!

334
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,690
Okay?

335
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,830
Thas not
whatyou said before!

336
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,370
I was building up to it.

337
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,270
Gee, what kind
ofmusic is that?

338
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,810
- Hip-hop.
- Okay...

339
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,840
but I'd still like to know
what kind ofmusic it is.

340
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,110
Thas funny,
the radio's off.

341
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,840
Oh, thas just Bullwinkle.

342
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,010
His antlers pick up everything.

343
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,610
Bullwinkle,
cover up your nose!

344
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,850
Okay. I was just
gettin' jiggy with it.

345
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,520
They sure don't have music
like that in Frostbite Falls.

346
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,990
Agent Sympathy,

347
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,890
have things changed a lot
in the last 35 years?

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,330
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.

349
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:52,960
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.

350
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,970
As dawn broke over
the City ofAngels,

351
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,330
our valiant protagonists
boldly rocketed

352
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,710
toward the beckoning horizon

353
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,240
toward the beckoning horizon

354
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,210
of a strange new
three-dimensional world,

355
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,210
and the unimaginable perils
that lay on the road ahead.

356
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,370
While on the otherside
of the country,

357
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,380
at Fearless Leader's
headquarters,

358
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,650
Really Bad Television...

359
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,190
Fearless Leader:
My fellow Pottsylvanians,

360
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,450
this is the quality control.

361
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,390
It will enhance
or degrade the quality

362
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,860
of what ever you run
through it.

363
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,760
If the input show
is bad enough,

364
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,930
the quality control will
exaggerate its mind-numbing
properties...

365
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,870
until the audience is
completely hypnotized.

366
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,070
So, Badenov,

367
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,540
these shows had better
be terrible!

368
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,010
Don't worry,
Fearless Leader.

369
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,040
We are ready
to test the machine.

370
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,450
Ready to test machine!

371
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,420
Put on your protective glasses!

372
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,920
Put on protective glasses!

373
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,920
Fearless Leader:
Badenov, proceed with the test!

374
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,420
Badenov, proceed
with test!

375
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,960
Sometimes, is not so easy
being Fearless Leader.

376
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,860
Announcer:
Coming toyour TV,

377
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,530
brand new exciting shows
of the highest fun!

378
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,610
So, if adventure is
your best ingredient,

379
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,440
try the action with...

380
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,380
Clever Spies Crush
the Enemy On Monday!

381
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,450
And the laughter never
gets away...

382
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,250
with Three Funny and Wacky
Spies & Their Horse,

383
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,690
Who Will Also Be a Spy.

384
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,020
It works!

385
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,350
Yeah!

386
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,790
Silence!

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,970
Is a message from my mole
at the White House!

388
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,370
Moose and squirrel!

389
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,200
Moose and squirrel.

390
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,240
How many times in the past
have they stood between me...

391
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,250
and my dreams ofglory?

392
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,310
How many times have they
foiled my plans...

393
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,580
with their bungling
interference?

394
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,060
Er... 28?

395
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,390
Quiet, idiot!

396
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,990
They must never reach
New York alive.

397
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,160
I want you to destroy them
personally.

398
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,770
After 30 years of waiting,

399
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,740
one more chance to crush
moose and squirrel!

400
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,010
Oh, Fearless Leader,
you are so good to us!

401
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,810
There has never been
a way to actually destroy
a cartoon character...

402
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,210
until now!

403
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,410
What about in that movie,
RogerRabbit?

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,150
Shut up!
This is totally different!

405
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,950
There has never been
a way to actually destroy
a cartoon character...

406
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,050
untilnow!

407
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,990
This is the computer
degenerating imagery.

408
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,100
Show them, Sydney.

409
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,760
The "computer
degenerating imagery"

410
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,930
or C.D.I.,
as I like to call it,

411
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,940
is totally user-friendly.

412
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,740
Just index
the binary codes

413
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,870
of the animated image
you're gonna degenerate

414
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,640
and the C.D.I. 'll dismantle
the digital image

415
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,270
on your film stock. 'Kay?

416
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,790
Bring in
the test subject!

417
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,280
No, no!

418
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,760
Oh, this is what
I was afraid of.

419
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,330
I've been tricked!
Please, don't send me there.

420
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,950
Please don'tsendme there!

421
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,220
Now I know what happened
to my friend Freddy the Ferret

422
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,660
and those cute
little bunnies...

423
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,890
Okay, now all you gotta do
is type in an address

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,660
and send him where all
worthless cyberjunk ends up...

425
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,570
the Internet!

426
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,570
Let go of my paw.
You broke my nail!

427
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,480
Aah!

428
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,320
So, thas all
there is to it.

429
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,820
Here's the manual

430
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,080
and she's all yours.

431
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,360
I assumeyou're both
computer literate?

432
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,490
We don't need computerweapon
to kill moose and squirrel!

433
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,830
We've been trying to kill
moose and squirrel for 35 years.

434
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,030
And we've never
even come close.

435
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,000
Exactly.

436
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,840
Andso, armed
with the C.D.I.,

437
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,980
and a truck load full of
really silly cartoon weaponry,

438
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,550
Boris and Natasha set off
to blast Rocky and Bullwinkle

439
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,320
from the face of the Earth,

440
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,720
and immediately
got stuck in traffic.

441
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,320
While back at RBTV...

442
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,950
Dear Diary,

443
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,190
soon the presidency
will be mine.

444
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,170
As for this FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy,

445
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,300
I will deal with her
the same way I dealt...

446
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,530
with the three agents
before her.

447
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,040
At the moment oftruth,

448
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,670
she'll be plugged directly

449
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,910
into the quality
control current

450
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,850
and turned into a helpless...

451
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,850
mindless...

452
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,550
vegetable.

453
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,420
Vegetable.

454
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,580
...A barrel ofmoney

455
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,560
Maybe we're ragged
and funny

456
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,560
Bullwinkle:
But we'll travel along

457
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,150
Rocky:
Singing a song...

458
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,970
Karen:
Youknow, lusedtobe
justlikeyouguys.

459
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,860
Cheerful, optimistic.

460
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,730
But if there's one thing
I learned in the FBI,

461
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,390
is that life
is not a cartoon.

462
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,910
Whoa!

463
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,250
Look out!

464
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,250
Whoa!

465
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,970
Aah!

466
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,040
Out ofthe car!

467
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,260
Whas the rush?

468
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,600
All right, I'm going,
I'm going!

469
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,580
Are you all right?

470
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,450
Ofcourse.

471
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,780
Guess I should have figured.

472
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,150
Boris:
Butnotforlong!

473
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,990
Hey, Rock.
They look kind offamiliar.

474
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,930
Yeah! Haven't we seen
those two somewheres before?

475
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,400
Whas with the cannon?

476
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,870
Is traditional!

477
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,360
Run!

478
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,340
Karen:
Boris Badenov!

479
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,100
I've seen you on TV.

480
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,080
You're a crooked, creepy,
no-good rotten worm.

481
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,310
Oh, thank you.

482
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,480
You're slimy,
sneaky, sleazy...

483
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,320
Please! You'll turn
my pretty head.

484
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,120
You're asadisticspy
anda...

485
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,820
and a...

486
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,130
really, really
bad person!

487
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,030
Stop!
You're embarrassing me.

488
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,000
Where is boom?

489
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,830
Boris, darling,

490
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,870
maybe is time
to update our technique.

491
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,900
Fearless Leader!

492
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,540
We're so happy you called!

493
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,980
Haveyou liquidated
moose and squirrel?

494
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,990
Did you use the C.D. I?

495
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,210
Yes?

496
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,020
Are you talking to me?

497
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,720
Are you talking to me?

498
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,990
Er...

499
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,890
Then who else
are you talking to?

500
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,390
Are you talking to me?

501
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,900
Well, I'm the only one here...

502
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,410
soyou must be
talking to me...

503
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
and you are lying!

504
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,740
Now catch moose and squirrel

505
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,840
and next time
use the C.D.I. On them!

506
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,750
Rocky:
ButKaren, we can'tride to
therescuein astolen truck.

507
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,290
Yeah!

508
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,420
Why couldn'tyou steal
something with bucket seats?

509
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,520
Bullwinkle!

510
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,600
Just kidding, Rock.

511
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,430
Isjust not right.

512
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,360
Is not right?
What are you talking about?

513
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,090
They wrecked our car!
They were trying to kill us!

514
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
But we're supposed
to be the heroes.

515
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,070
Rocky,
is not 1964 anymore.

516
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,140
You're in the real world now.

517
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,540
Rocky's right, Karen.

518
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,580
And two rights
don't make a wrong.

519
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,940
Bullwinkle, thas not
what you mean.

520
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,710
You mean two rights
do make a wrong?

521
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,050
No!

522
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,210
I always thought two rights
made a U-turn.

523
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,790
I don't know how much more
ofthis I can take.

524
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,980
Well, les fii nd out.

525
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,460
Two U-turns make a circle,

526
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,720
two circles make
a figure eight,

527
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,260
two figure eights
make a butterfly...

528
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,300
Look, all I want from
you guys are results. Okay?

529
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,560
It was their first fight.

530
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,140
Andso, racked with
internal conflicts,

531
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,400
they made their way
across the Great Divide

532
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,840
and onto the great plains.

533
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,600
Bullwinkle:
Hey, look at that, Rock!

534
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,270
What a strange looking town!

535
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,640
Andwhile Bullwinkle
ponderedthemodern world,

536
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,310
severalstates back,
Boris andNatasha...

537
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,480
were still tramping
along theroad.

538
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,850
Ifonlywe had
a helicopter.

539
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,790
Butsince they were
in themiddle ofthe desert,

540
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,950
there was obviously
no chance whatsoever

541
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,490
of finding
a helicopter.

542
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,690
Boris...

543
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,920
Look!

544
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,090
Oh, damn!
Nevermind.

545
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,830
Natasha, quick.

546
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,510
Natasha:
Whatluck!

547
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,150
Great googly moogly!

548
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,850
Holy cow!
What the?

549
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,320
Hey, listen,
gol-darn it!

550
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,060
Thas the third time
this month.

551
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sick and tired
of shopping for helicopters.

552
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,690
Boy, ifl had a missile,

553
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,430
I'd blow your buns
right out ofthe sky!

554
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,250
Yes, Boris and Natasha
were back in business,

555
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,070
but they had no way

556
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,380
of discovering the route
our heroes had taken...

557
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,750
Hey!
You can'tdo that!

558
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,340
Interstate 1,

559
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,720
just outside Red Bait,
Oklahoma, darling.

560
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,650
- Cheaters.
- Thankyou!

561
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,820
And high above
our unsuspecting heroes...

562
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,260
Natasha:
- Statepolice?
- Yes, ma'am?

563
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,390
This is FBI Agent
KarenSympathy...

564
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,940
All right,
I'm sorry I yelled.

565
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,770
Butyou don't
understand.

566
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,780
I can't mess up
this time.

567
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,610
"This time"?
Was there a last time?

568
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,740
Tell us about
yourself, Karen.

569
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,390
Lesjust say
I've made...

570
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,580
mistakes.

571
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,290
Look, I can't blow this one.

572
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,220
The whole world depends on it,

573
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,030
and I can't do it
withoutyour help.

574
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,200
Agent Sympathy,

575
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,430
you can count on
Bullwinkle and me.

576
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,200
- We won't letyou down.
- No.

577
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,100
Thanks, you guys.

578
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,700
You know,

579
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm glad Cappy picked me
for this mission.

580
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,570
I think we're gonna make
a great team.

581
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,380
- Huh?
- Oh, no.

582
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,110
And just as
this sentimental moment

583
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,950
had mercifully
come to a close,

584
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,460
our heroes were pulled over
by two state troopers

585
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,460
and a cameraman
from the hit TV show,

586
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,620
and a cameraman
from the hit TV show,

587
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,390
Made Up Stories From
the Real Highway Patrol.

588
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,800
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up, please!

589
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,130
Is okay, Officers,
I'm with the FBl...

590
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,970
Step out of the vehicle now!

591
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,800
Hey, Rock,
your face is all blurry.

592
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,140
So's yours.

593
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,800
This truck matches
the description...

594
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,350
ofa vehicle reported stolen
outside Red Bait, Oklahoma,

595
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,240
just a couple ofhours ago.

596
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,080
You are under arrest
for grand theft auto

597
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,310
and for impersonating
FBI agent, Karen Sympathy.

598
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,950
I am FBI Agent
Karen Sympathy!

599
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,320
Like fun you are.

600
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,820
We both know Agent
Karen Sympathy...

601
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,830
has a heavy
Pottsylvanian accent.

602
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,020
We heard her on the radio.

603
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,100
But she really is
with the FBI!

604
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,630
Yeah, and I'm really
john Goodman.

605
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,930
Les get in the car.

606
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,300
Just one minute, Officer!

607
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,500
Wherever she goes,
we go.

608
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,840
Yeah, thas right.
We're a team!

609
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,310
Well, she's going off
to the federal pen...

610
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,940
to break rocks for
the next fiiveyears.

611
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,680
Okay, well,
don't forget to write.

612
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,380
I guess we could always
appear atyour trial...

613
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,510
as animated character
witnesses!

614
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,680
No!
Rocky, Bullwinkle...

615
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,520
is your duty to get
to New York by 8:00 PM tomorrow.

616
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,790
Rocky:
Karen, we can't
leaveyounow.

617
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,620
Hey, I'm an FBI agent,
remember?

618
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,220
I'll straighten this out,
and catch up with you later.

619
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,390
But we've never been
in the real world before!

620
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,770
Oh, you'll do great.
I know it.

621
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,210
Hey!
What about our faces?

622
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,800
Oh...
sorry.

623
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,890
Wait, you can't just leave them
on the side ofthe road
like that.

624
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,590
They don't even know
where they are.

625
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,430
Don't worry, ma'am.
They're animals.

626
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,900
They'll forage.

627
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,230
Bullwinkle:
C'mon, Rock,
time's a-wastin'!

628
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,710
We owe it to Karen
to see the president
about the trees!

629
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,010
Trees?

630
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,210
Bullwinkle, we have
to go to New York.

631
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,720
We don't have time
to get to Washington!

632
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,410
This is no time to worry
about getting the washing done.

633
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,620
Not "washing done."
Washing-ton!

634
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,780
A ton?!

635
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,050
Well, that is
a lot oflaundry.

636
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,590
Bullwinkle, that joke
just won't wash!

637
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,460
Well, you can't
blame me for drying!

638
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,460
I think I'll fly ahead.

639
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,100
Butit was just no use.

640
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,300
Faced with
the utter hopelessness
of their predicament,

641
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,310
the razor-sharp mind
of Bullwinkle

642
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,570
quickly formulated
a daring plan.

643
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,150
Help! Help!

644
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,040
Somebody please help!

645
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,480
Help!

646
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,880
So on they walked,
two lone figures...

647
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,420
making their way
through a foreign and hostile
live-action landscape.

648
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,450
I thought you said
we were in Oklahoma.

649
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,790
Would you like to
narrate this movie?

650
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,120
No.

651
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,130
And so on they walked,
two lone figures...

652
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,960
making their way
through a foreign and hostile
live-action landscape.

653
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,630
They walked until
their thumbs ached,

654
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,960
but no one wanted
to take a chance...

655
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,770
ona 6'7"
talking moose

656
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,930
and a flying squirrel
who couldn't fly.

657
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,840
I could f-fly if I had to!

658
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,080
Whoa!

659
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,010
Ow!

660
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,320
Kinda makes you
feel discouraged.

661
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,480
Maybe we should be a little
more aggressive.

662
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,890
Stop!

663
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,130
This movie's gettin'
kind of...

664
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,130
Don't say it!

665
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,630
Two-dimensional.

666
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,860
Yes, things were beginning
to look mighty dark...

667
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,000
for our intrepid heroes...

668
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,670
It is gettin'
kinda hard to see.

669
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,640
Bullwinkle, he means
our situation.

670
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,270
Oh!

671
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,510
Wait a minute, boys,
there's a couple of headlights.

672
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,950
I think is...

673
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,650
Yes! Yes!

674
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,690
It was a couple of fresh-faced
college students...

675
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,220
named Martin and Lewis.

676
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,850
Come on, Rock!
Is a convertible!

677
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,350
All right,
buckle up now, fellas.

678
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,230
Yeah, safety fii rst!

679
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,000
So where doyou boys
go to school?

680
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,700
We're undergrads
at Wossamotta U.

681
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,710
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Wossamotta U!

682
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,400
My old alma mater!

683
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,810
Bullwinkle was a big football
star at Wossamotta U.

684
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,040
- Quarter-buck!
- I thoughtyou looked familiar.

685
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,810
Where are you fellows
coming from, anyway?

686
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,180
Thankyou!

687
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,650
We've been on the road,
looking for America.

688
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,880
Lewis:
We've been looking
forAmerica all day.

689
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,320
Martin:
We just can't find it.

690
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,120
Lewis:
Man, we're exhausted.

691
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,560
Bullwinkle:
Gee, fellas, perhaps
you've been looking too hard.

692
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,430
Maybe America is
all around you...

693
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,500
in a thousand different
beautiful manifestations.

694
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,400
Wouldn't you say so,
young people?

695
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,230
Yeah, right.

696
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,970
Rocky, haven't we passed
this town before?

697
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,520
Following ominously above them
in the Midwestern sky,

698
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,960
Boris conceived
a sinister plan.

699
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,560
Flying ahead
to Wossamotta U...

700
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,860
the two villains made
asizable donation
to the college...

701
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,200
in Bullwinkle's name...

702
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,040
prompting the college president
to bestow upon Bullwinkle...

703
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,940
an honorary moosters degree.

704
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,140
And when moose is at podium
for acceptance speech,

705
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,150
I'll be on water tower
with C.D.I.

706
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,620
There was only one problem...

707
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,920
Wossamotta U. Had
no watertower.

708
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,430
Can't even find
water fountain.

709
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,020
Their entire scheme seemed
to be on the verge ofcollapse,

710
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,970
until they hit upon an
incredibly ingenious plan...

711
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,970
Together:
What?!

712
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,350
Dawn brokeat 6... 00AM.

713
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,420
The day of Fearless Leader's
deadly broadcast...

714
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,990
had finally arrived.

715
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,250
And there was Karen,
toiling away

716
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,120
under the watchful eyes
ofa tall, blond,

717
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,530
incredibly handsome,
Swedish-American prison guard

718
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,160
named Ole.

719
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,860
Several states away,
our hitchhiking heroes

720
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,130
were doggedly making
their way to New York,

721
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,000
but little did theyknow
they were driving...

722
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,100
straight into Boris Badenov's
sinister snare.

723
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,280
Heavens to Betsy!

724
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,180
The car is sticking
its tongue out at me!

725
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,620
No, is not.
Isjust a fax.

726
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,280
- A what?
- A fax!

727
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,950
Don't you guys know
about faxes?

728
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,620
Yeah, don'tyou know
about E-mail?

729
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,660
Sure. A fax is
a little red critter...

730
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,230
that steals geese
and chickens.

731
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,960
Half of them are males and
the other half are e-males.

732
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,000
No, is a way of transmitting
computer-generated information

733
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,330
across great distances
in the blink of an eye.

734
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,910
Well, I was close.

735
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,340
Lewis:
Oh, hey! Is for you.

736
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,880
Hokeysmoke, Bullwinkle!

737
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,410
Wossamotta U. Wants to
give you an honorary degree.

738
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,410
And the ceremony is today!

739
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,380
Bullwinkle, we don't
have time to go.

740
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,350
We've gotta get
to New York!

741
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,480
Oh, woe is me!

742
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,920
I must have my degree!

743
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,820
I'll put it on the wall...

744
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,760
for everyone tosee.

745
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,020
I guess if is
in the name of education...

746
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,220
Oh, it was a happy day
at Wossamotta U.,

747
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,100
scene of Bullwinkle's
football triumphs years ago.

748
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,690
Gee, it looks so different.

749
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,360
Everything's in
the same place, but...

750
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,270
Well, Wossamotta U.'s been
a live-action university

751
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,400
since the show went
into reruns back in '64.

752
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,610
I thought the buildings
looked a lot more realistic.

753
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,580
Say, whereyou guys been
all this time, huh?

754
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,350
Reruns.

755
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,420
You know thas never gonna
happen to us, right?

756
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,280
Well, anyway,
there's still a lot...

757
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,290
ofanti-cartoon feeling
on campus these days.

758
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,920
Hokey smoke,
Bullwinkle!

759
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,090
Is some kind
of demonstration.

760
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,860
What are the kids
protesting these days?

761
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,730
Is it a civil rights march?

762
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,570
Not really...

763
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,540
Is it an anti-war rally?

764
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,970
No, not exactly.

765
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,200
Tell 'em, fellas.

766
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,810
Is a anti-moose march.

767
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,400
Yes, itseems that
araging controversy

768
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,610
had broken out among
the students that very morning

769
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,480
over the decision to give
Bullwinkle an honorary degree...

770
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,890
Gee, Bullwinkle,
I guess is true.

771
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,960
You can't
go home again.

772
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,990
Why, Rocky!
Whatever doyou mean?

773
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,290
Wossamotta U. Is home!

774
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,560
Rocky:
Oh, brother!

775
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,900
Look! There's
the animated freak now!

776
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,800
My fans!

777
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,140
Bullwinkle,
these aren't fans.

778
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,140
This is an angry mob.

779
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,480
Butin the face of danger,
our insipid hero...

780
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,980
bravely made his way
through the angry crowd.

781
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,680
You mean "intrepid hero,"
don'tyou?

782
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,750
No-oo...

783
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,120
Hundreds of miles away,
in RedBait, Oklahoma,

784
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,520
it was time for
the prisoners' daily helping
of disgusting slop.

785
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,330
ButKarenSympathy
hadsucceededin making Ole,

786
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,330
the simple-minded
but incredibly handsome
prison guard,

787
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,100
fall madly in love
with her.

788
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,800
Presently, Karen promisedto
let him take her to the movies

789
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,500
ifhe would help her
break out of jail.

790
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,100
Could we hold hands
in the movie theatre?

791
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,270
Of course we could, Ole.

792
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,790
But how would we
eat our popcorn?

793
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,350
Well, we could eat
our popcorn with one hand...

794
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,930
and hold hands
with the other.

795
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,590
But what ifl want a soda?

796
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,720
Look...

797
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm sure we can
work this out.

798
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,090
Good morning, students.

799
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,890
Today Wossamotta U.
Honors one of our own...

800
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,400
As the students vented
their collective spleen
at Bullwinkle,

801
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,230
RocketJ. Squirrel anxiously
surveyed the raging crowd

802
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,830
for signs of danger.

803
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,530
And suddenly,
his sharp little eyes

804
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,910
picked out the terrifying
figure of Boris Badenov

805
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,350
near the top
of the watertower.

806
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,420
Hey! That guy's not
a college student!

807
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,210
...that we present
this honorary degree...

808
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,080
to Bullwinkle J. Moose.

809
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,120
Good morning, children!

810
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,130
Today's lecture
is about trees.

811
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,100
Bullwinkle, look out!
Is a trap!

812
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,500
ButRocky's voice
couldn'tcarry

813
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,610
overthestridentshouts
ofthestudentbody.

814
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,200
With no alternative in sight,
Rocky tried one more time

815
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,780
to summon up those faded
aeronautical skills

816
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,470
that had once made him
a household name.

817
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,570
But just then, Boris managed
to turn on the C.D.I.

818
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,980
Aha!

819
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,140
Yes, it looked like
curtains for Bullwinkle...

820
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,380
Got to...

821
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,750
save...

822
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,550
Bullwinkle!

823
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,960
Rocky:
Whoa!

824
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,100
"Bad command or fii le name.

825
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,270
Press any key to continue."

826
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,640
Which one is "any" key?

827
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,480
Rocky:
Look out!

828
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,990
Oh, no!

829
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,080
With asingle blow,
Rockysent the C.D.I.

830
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,750
Hurtling through thesky...

831
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,320
where upon Boris
single-mindedly

832
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,530
reached out to catch
the catapulted computer,

833
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,470
forgetting as he did,

834
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,270
one vitally important
piece of information...

835
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,840
I ain't a cartoon no more.

836
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,000
Aahh!

837
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,010
Darling!

838
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,680
Ow!

839
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,030
Rocky:
Mayday!

840
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,200
You like me!

841
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,800
You really like me!

842
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,210
I guess I've
lost the knack.

843
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,250
I'll never fly again.

844
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,040
Yes, without trees,

845
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,910
where would
the birdies live?

846
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,650
Forced to migrate
to the cities,

847
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,240
they would take jobs away
from local pigeons.

848
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,920
Bullwinkle,
they're listening!

849
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,490
Yes, Bullwinkle's speech
was soinane...

850
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,230
that thestudents
couldn'tunderstand
a wordhe was saying,

851
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,100
andconsequently found
nothing to object to.

852
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,410
So RockyandBullwinkle
bade a fondfarewell

853
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,950
to thehallowedwalls
ofWossamotta U.

854
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,710
Don't forget to write,
oldbuddy.

855
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,220
Bullwinkle,
who are you talking to?

856
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,350
I don't know,

857
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,920
but is like
talking to a wall.

858
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,920
I want to thank you fellas
for bringing unity back

859
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,460
to this troubled campus
with your ludicrous remarks.

860
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,260
Martin and I would like
to wish you guys

861
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,960
luck against
Fearless Leader.

862
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,260
Yeah, and we would come
help you guys, but...

863
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,700
we don't wanna
get hurt.

864
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,900
Yeah, man, we're not
going near him.

865
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,200
Yeah, until we metyou guys,

866
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,710
we almost totally lost
faith in America.

867
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,470
Lewis:
Youknow, andwe
lostfaith in our car.

868
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,910
I used to think
our carwas really cool,

869
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,040
but now isjust
always dirty.

870
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,550
And running low on gas.

871
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,120
Yeah, but since we met you guys,
we love it again.

872
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,950
Yeah, the car is totally back.

873
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,720
So, as a gesture of our
appreciation,

874
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,880
we want you guys
to have it.

875
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,220
Yeah, so,
take the car.

876
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,230
Really?

877
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,660
Is yours.

878
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,890
Whoa!

879
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,800
Rocky:
Gee, fellas, thanks.

880
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,300
Yeah, thanks!

881
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,800
You do know how
to drive, right?

882
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,000
Please!

883
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,140
What moose can't
drive a automobile?

884
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,250
Rocky:
Oh, brother!

885
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,680
Never said I could
drive it well.

886
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,820
Andjustas Rockyand
Bullwinkle got back
on the road,

887
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,360
Boris and Natasha emerged
from the student infiirmary,

888
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,990
ready foraction.

889
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,770
Meanwhile, in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma...

890
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,270
Ole,

891
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,870
why don't you go
get the tickets,

892
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,170
and I'll park the truck?

893
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,670
Gosh, Karen!

894
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,510
I've never had
so much fun

895
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,850
in my whole life.

896
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,280
Is like...

897
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,360
Is like there was always
a little boy trapped...

898
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,190
somewhere inside me,

899
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,160
and now that I've met you,

900
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,630
I can finally
let him out.

901
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,700
Please, two for
the love movie.

902
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,100
There you go.

903
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,300
Tack.

904
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,580
Now, thas not verynice.

905
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:36,660
Shut up.

906
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,190
As for Rocky and Bullwinkle,

907
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,290
they were gently motoring along
an Illinois interstate...

908
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,470
Hey, Rock,

909
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:52,600
there's that same town again!

910
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,330
Areyou sure we're
going the right way?

911
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,870
Bullwinkle, look out!

912
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,280
Whoa!

913
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,010
Rocky:
Sorry!

914
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,450
Bullwinkle, we're not
going to Chicago!

915
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,090
We are now.

916
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:10,490
We are now.

917
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,390
As our heroes found themselves
racing toward Chicago,

918
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,830
little did they realize
that only a few miles behind...

919
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,600
And back in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma,

920
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,300
the only person in this movie
more clueless than Bullwinkle

921
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,300
faithfully waited for Karen
to get back

922
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,900
from parking his truck.

923
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,640
But our heroine was already
passing through Indiana...

924
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,080
where she was about tomake
an ominous discovery.

925
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,660
Announcer:
For watching miserable people
suffer in daytime,

926
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,030
is The Jenny Spy Show.

927
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,160
Are you sorry that
you called her fat?

928
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,530
Yes! Yes!

929
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,700
Oh, no!
Not already!

930
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,870
Yes, Fearless Leader's
hypnotic broadcast...

931
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,840
was already underway.

932
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,640
Announcer:
You are watching premiere
broadcast of RBTV.

933
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,610
Ah, I love my RBTV.

934
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,810
Fearless Leader!

935
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,120
The zombombidor shows

936
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,920
that 30% of despised,
decadent Americans

937
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,720
are already total zombies!

938
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,060
Good!

939
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,360
I'll address the nation
at exactly 8:00 PM

940
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,460
Eastern standard time.

941
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,500
Back at the RedBait
Prison Farm,

942
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,080
Karen's daring escape
had not gone unnoticed.

943
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,380
Meanwhile on the bustling
boulevards ofChicago,
Illinois,

944
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,480
Rocky and Bullwinkle
were about to discover

945
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,420
they had considerable
troubles of their own.

946
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,960
There they are!

947
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,720
Motorist #1:
Hello!

948
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:56,890
Motorist #2:
Look out!

949
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,560
Smush them!

950
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:05,800
Duck!

951
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,580
Well, mercy me!

952
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,820
Excuse us!

953
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,880
Bullwinkle!

954
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,720
Mamma mia!

955
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,600
Is Rocky and Bullwinkle!

956
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,580
And you thought
I couldn't drive.

957
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,120
Bullwinkle!
Look out!

958
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,360
Hold her steady, poopsie.

959
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,660
Is time to say goodbye...

960
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,500
to moose and squirrel.

961
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,400
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!

962
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,840
Hasta la vista, baby!

963
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,480
Boris:
Hey, poopsie...
whas happening?

964
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:30,350
I think you degenerated
wrong special effect.

965
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,660
And while Rocky and Bullwinkle
were making their getaway,

966
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,130
Boris and Natasha were still
high above the Chicago streets,

967
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,500
but with one small difference.

968
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,300
Boris and Natasha:
No helicopter.

969
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,000
And as luck would have it,
a travelling mattress salesman

970
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,510
just happened to be
passing bybelow.

971
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,300
Matresses for sale!

972
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,170
How do I do it?
Volume!

973
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,180
Ouch. Oy.

974
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,050
Now thas a soft mattress.

975
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:03,950
Temporarily outofdanger,

976
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,690
Rocky and Bullwinkle
breathed a sigh of relief.

977
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,460
At the same time,

978
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,160
Boris and Natasha
were forced to rent...

979
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,030
an econoclass Chevy Metro from
the Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company

980
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,760
in order to resume the chase.

981
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,300
This slight delay gave
our heroes the opportunity

982
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,740
to effect a not her beautiful,

983
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,810
if implausibly coincidental,
reunion.

984
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,590
Whoa!

985
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,560
Whoops.

986
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,840
Hey, you lunatic!

987
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,130
Why don'tyou watch
whereyou're...

988
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,400
Rocky!

989
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,070
Bullwinkle!

990
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,240
Karen!

991
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,900
Guys, I missed you so much.

992
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,570
I was so worried about you...

993
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,270
I didn't mean to...

994
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,910
I mean...

995
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,010
Good work,

996
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,350
Agents Rocky, Bullwinkle.

997
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,290
Lookit, we have six hours
to get to New York.

998
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,620
- The Big Apple!
- Bullwinkle, please!

999
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:18,560
RBTV is already turning
people into zombies.

1000
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,530
But Karen,
why aren't you injail?

1001
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,790
Oh...

1002
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,100
er...
I was pardoned.

1003
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,180
Freeze! Freeze!

1004
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,790
Must be some kind
of clerical error.

1005
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,120
Officer:
You're under arrest.

1006
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:50,390
Keep your hands
high above your head!

1007
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,400
Andjust to think...

1008
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,270
Is the opening
of moose season.

1009
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:54,730
Is the opening
of moose season.

1010
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,800

Judge Cameo presiding.

1017
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,010
Who speaks for the defense?

1018
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,420
BullwinkleJ. Moose,
attorney at law.

1019
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,160
Hey, hey, hey!

1020
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,820
Hey!

1021
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,760

1022

1024
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,800
Impugning the character
of a prison guard...

1025
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,030
- Ooh!
- One count...

1026
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,700
reckless driving:
Four counts;

1027
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,870

1033
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,530
Hey! Hey!

1034
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,430
Counselor,

1035
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,090
call your first witness.

1036
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,430
Yes, Your Honor.

1037
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,090
As our first witness,
the defense calls...

1038
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,670
Karen Sympathy!

1039
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,400
Oh, please, no.

1040
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,910
Doyou, Karen Sympathy,
swear to tell the truth,

1041
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,170
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth,

1042
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,970
so helpyou God?

1043
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,270
I do.

1044
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,680
Ha!

1045
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,150
A little late!

1046
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,480
Oh!

1047
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,320
Ms. Sympathy,

1048
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,120
isn't it true that when our
convertible

1049
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,420
was destroyed
in Monument Valley...

1050
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,020
the first thing you did
was to steal...

1051
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,100
somebody else's truck?

1052
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,690
Um...

1053
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,200
That depends on how you
legally defii ne the word "steal,"

1054
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,630
because I believe...

1055
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,970
And didn't you escape
from prison...

1056
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,170
by telling that poor
trusting prison guard

1057
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,000
that you would let him
takeyou to the movies?

1058
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,870
Well, I thought we might have
time ifwe went to a matinee...

1059
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,420
Isn't it true you never
meant to see a film at all?!

1060
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,020
Yes...

1061
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,210
is true.

1062
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,350
And didn't you tell
Rocky and me...

1063
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:05,050
that you got out of prison
because you got a pardon?

1064
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,960
Yes...

1065
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,290
Yes...
I did do that!

1066
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,200
Isn't it true you have
no respect for the law

1067
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,030
or anything else?

1068
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,830
No!

1069
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,230
I was just trying to
complete my mission!

1070
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,360
I was only supposed
to care about results!

1071
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,500
And how come Rocky and me
are still cartoons...

1072
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,010
and Boris and
Natasha aren't?

1073
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,980
I don't know!
I didn't write the movie!

1074
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,210
I'm only one
ofthe characters!

1075
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,810
Your witness, Counselor.

1076
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,980
What are
the teams again?

1077
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:38,080
Bullwinkle, you're supposed
to be the defense attorney.

1078
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,250
You just proved
we're guilty.

1079
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,830
Yes, but now our
consciences are clean,

1080
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,490
and the healing
can begin.

1081
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,030
Your Honor,

1082
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,330
is time the court
showed the world

1083
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,900
that no quarterwill be given

1084
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,870
to celebrity defendants.

1085
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,200
- Celebrity?
- Mm-hmm.

1086
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,000
Did you say celebrity?

1087
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,100
Where are myglasses?

1088
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,740
Oh, my Gawd!

1089
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,410
Oh, my Gawd!

1090
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,610
Is Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Oh, my God!

1091
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,090
I love, I loveyour show!

1092
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,380
Your Honor!

1093
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,790
And you,
Mr. District Attorney,

1094
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,890
I'd like to point something
out to you in the penal code,

1095
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,460
section C, paragraph22.

1096
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,260
"Celebrities
are above the law."

1097
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,300
This case is dismissed.

1098
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,480
Moments later, our heroes
were back on the road,

1099
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,810
with a mere three hours

1100
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,880
to get from Rabid Froth, Ohio
to New York.

1101
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,280
Three hours!

1102
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,280
If only we had
an airplane.

1103
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,780
Hokey smoke!
Look!

1104
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,150
Gosh!
Another wild coincidence.

1105
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,740
Afternoon, folks.

1106
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,670
Together:
Hi!

1107
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,440
You got any planes left?

1108
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,140
Well, lesjust kinda
give a look-see...

1109
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,180
I thinkwe have one left.

1110
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,590
They've got tobehere
somewhere, Boris, darling!

1111
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,360
Keep the change!

1112
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,200
Oh! This is gonna get
my stepson a new trial.

1113
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,300
Boris:
Bingo!

1114
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,380
Natasha:
Goody! Goody!

1115
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:47,720
Hey! Hey!

1116
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,290
Y'all can't get in there.

1117
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,550
She won't hold the weight!

1118
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,030
You'll never reach
the end ofthe runway.

1119
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,330
The wings will come off.

1120
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:59,960
Oh, God!

1121
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,630
Oh, crap!

1122
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:08,170
Boris pushed the little Metro
for all it was worth...

1123
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,970
We've got them, Boris,
we've got them!

1124
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,480
They've got us, Rocky,
they've got us!

1125
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,420
But at that very moment,

1126
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,640
Boris and Natasha's rental
agreement suddenly expired

1127
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,380
and they were immediately
blockaded...

1128
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,580
by the dedicated agents ofthe
Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company.

1129
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,860
Come on! Come on!

1130
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,260
Come on, you can do it!
You old bird!

1131
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,060
Come on!

1132
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,030
Come on!

1133
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,370
Although Boris and Natasha
tried feverishly to complete

1134
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,700
the necessary paperwork...

1135
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:38,570
Look!

1136
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,280
It was too late.

1137
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,610
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

1138
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,770
Stop!

1139
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,260
That certainly
was a close one.

1140
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,340
Les just hope this thing
makes it all the way
to New York.

1141
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,450
Where did we go wrong, Boris?

1142
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,720
We tried
to blow them up.

1143
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,790
We tried
to have them arrested.

1144
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,830
We tried
to degenerate them.

1145
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,620
We tried to smush them.

1146
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,460
Yes, and we never
even came close.

1147
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,470
Oh, Boris,

1148
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,660
what are we
doing, darling?

1149
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,670
We been trying to catch
moose and squirrel...

1150
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,900
ever since
we first got drawn.

1151
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:49,500
We tried to stab them,
shoot them, smash them,

1152
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:53,170
smush them, crush them,
bash them, mash them

1153
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,340
and they don't even
know our names.

1154
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,110
I'm tired
ofall this, Boris.

1155
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,090
I don't want to be
spy no more.

1156
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:03,060
Les faceit, darling,
we suck.

1157
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:07,230
We can never catch
moose and squirrel.

1158
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,360
Boris...

1159
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,870
don't you want to have
little Boris? Hmmm?

1160
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,670
Little Natasha?

1161
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,540
Wouldn't it be
wonderful?

1162
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,210
We could rent cottage
by sea of Pottsylvania

1163
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,650
and teach them how to lie,
and cheat and be rotten.

1164
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,950
They would be worst
children in world!

1165
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,220
They'd be monsters.

1166
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,820
It would be awful!

1167
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,760
We could be so happy.

1168
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,030
Telephone.

1169
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,210
Hoboy.

1170
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,400
Saved by bell!

1171
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,450
Well, Badenov,
did the C.D.I. Work?

1172
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:06,080
Oh, it...
it works all right!

1173
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,490
So moose and squirrel
are dead, then?

1174
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,250
Well, is funny
you should ask...

1175
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,490
Yes, Fearless Leader!

1176
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,590
We killed moose
and squirrel!

1177
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,530
Excellent!

1178
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,700
Wait there for
my private jet.

1179
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,000
I want you both beside
my side for the big broadcast.

1180
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,780
- Natasha...
- Yes, darling?

1181
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,250
Why did you
tell him that?!

1182
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,080
Because, Boris!

1183
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,050
Moose and squirrel
can't reach New York...

1184
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,780
by 8:00 PM in
that little plane.

1185
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,380
And what ifthey did?
So what?

1186
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,460
How could they
stop us now?

1187
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,430
Practicallywhole country
is zombifiied!

1188
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:52,300
We've won, Boris!
We've won!

1189
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,800
Just the way
I planned it!

1190
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,370
On their way to New York,

1191
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,200
our heroes were soon
to discover...

1192
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,170
that old Jeb was right.

1193
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:07,680
She won't pull up,
we're too heavy!

1194
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,950
Rocky,
can you fly Bullwinkle down?

1195
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,530
I don't think so,
Karen.

1196
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,220
He's a huge moose!

1197
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:23,130
I beg your pardon!
I'm as trim as a young fawn!

1198
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,830
You weigh 400
imaginary pounds!

1199
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:28,200
Yeah, but
is all "mooscle."

1200
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,290
Bullwinkle, can you fly
an airplane?

1201
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,810
What moose can't
fly a aeroplane?

1202
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,170
Rocky, you'll have
to fly me down.

1203
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:35,470
I can't do that, Karen.

1204
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,640
I can't fly again!
I've lost the knack.

1205
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,740
Bullwinkle,
take the controls.

1206
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,780
Okay.

1207
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:43,880
Listen to me, Rocky.

1208
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,420
- You can do this.
- I can't!

1209
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,080
- I knowyou can do this.
- I just can't!

1210
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,320
This is everything you taught me
since I was a little kid.

1211
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,760
All you have to do
is believe in...

1212
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,130
Rocky:
Karen!

1213
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,790
Look out for the sign!

1214
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,000
Aaah!

1215
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,370
Here goes n-nothing!

1216
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:13,850
Gotyou!

1217
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,010
Rocky!

1218
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,150
Uh-oh!

1219
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,350
Together:
Bullwinkle!

1220
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,870
Never said
I could fly it well.

1221
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,000
See you in New York!

1222
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,970
Hang on, Karen!
Hang on!

1223
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,610
If I couldjust...

1224
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,890
Rocky!

1225
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,120
You're flying!

1226
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,560
- You're flying!
- Yes, I am!

1227
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,220
I certainly am.

1228
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:04,390
Look at me!
I'm flying!

1229
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,020
New York City,
here we come!

1230
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,630
Yahoo!

1231
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,000
Yeah!

1232
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:13,230
What a day, a year,
a life it is!

1233
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,240
You know

1234
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,910
Well, you know
you had it coming toyou

1235
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:23,180
Now there's not
a lot I can do

1236
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:25,480
Dreamer

1237
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,720
A stupid little dreamer

1238
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:32,560
So now you putyour head
in your hands, oh, no!

1239
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,750
Whoo!

1240
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,600
Boris, darling,

1241
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,100
how can you be
so rotten?

1242
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,370
When I stop
moose and squirrel
from saving country,

1243
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,640
I don't kid around!

1244
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,630
Karen looked upon
the brave little squirrel

1245
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:17,140
with a new admiration.

1246
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,400
However, she couldn't
help but wonder,

1247
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,940
were they too late?

1248
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,080
Soaringprecipitously
overRockefellerCenter,

1249
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,750
Karen and Rocky found
the entire city of New York

1250
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,650
completely zombifiied.

1251
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,650
Rocky,
whatever you do,

1252
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,660
don't look at the screen!

1253
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,920
Touching down
outside RBTV,

1254
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:48,060
the daring duo was soon
to discover

1255
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,230
that something else
was terribly wrong.

1256
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,770
Where's Bullwinkle?
The speech starts any minute!

1257
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,500
I knew we shouldn't
have lefthim.

1258
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,840
Bullwinkle and I have never
been apart in 35 years!

1259
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,350
Quick, Rock, follow me.

1260
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,960
Come, Natasha.

1261
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,590
Follow me
to Fearless Leader.

1262
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,370
Go! Go!

1263
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,910
Oh, Fearless Leader!

1264
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,390
We're back!

1265
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:45,390
You are so-oo
happy to see us!

1266
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,960
Well, Fearless Leader,
he did it!

1267
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,060
Boris Badenov is now
offiicial number one killer...

1268
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:53,160
ofmoose and squirrel.

1269
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,530
Excellent, my faithful minions!

1270
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,230
Excellent!

1271
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,400
Hail, Pottsylvania!

1272
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,810
Hail to the black
and the blue!

1273
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:07,140
Hail, Pottsylvania!

1274
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,580
Sneaky and crooked,

1275
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,740
Through and through...

1276
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,250
Down with the good guys,

1277
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:13,980
Up with the boss,

1278
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:17,420
Under the sign of
the triple cross! Hey!

1279
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,930
Hail, Pottsylvania!

1280
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:27,130
Hail, hail, hail!

1281
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,180
Thankyou, Fearless Leader!

1282
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,910
Well, no one can stop
my broadcast now!

1283
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,280
FBI! Freeze!

1284
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,950
No one but these
chocolate-chewing idiots!

1285
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:53,190
All right, I want anyone
in this room...

1286
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:55,960
who's a Pottsylvanian spy
to putyour hands up now!

1287
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:00,430
That means you, too,
Fearless Leader!

1288
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,760
Let me see your hands!

1289
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,460
All right,
Agent Sympathy.

1290
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:07,770
We don't want anybody
to be hurt, now do we?

1291
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,810
And whatever you're holding,
drop it!

1292
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:12,340
Gladly.

1293
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,580
Don't look, Rocky,
is a trick.

1294
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,150
Ill turn you into a...

1295
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,450
Rocky!

1296
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,210
Rocky?

1297
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,380
Oh-hh!

1298
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:24,320
Peek-a-boopsie!

1299
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,920
Fearless Leader:
Well, Agent Sympathy,

1300
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:29,000
I have waited manyyears

1301
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,790
to face an enemy
I could respect...

1302
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,330
and I'm still waiting!

1303
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,570
No, that was just
a little joke.

1304
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:41,160
But I'm afraid that you
and this flying rodent

1305
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,740
have reached the end
of the road.

1306
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,510
Now get ready for a taste of
Pottsylvanian hospitability.

1307
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:51,780
Thas ability to put you
in hospital, darling.

1308
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,580
Andso, Rocky and Karen's
onlyhope

1309
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:58,350
in the whole wide world
was BullwinkleJ. Moose.

1310
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,260
In other words,
they didn'thave aprayer.

1311
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,350
For Bullwinkle hadmanaged
to miss New York altogether

1312
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:06,530
and had flown instead
to Washington, D. C.

1313
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:10,090
Gee, New York sure has
changed a lot since my day.

1314
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,500
They even moved
the White House here.

1315
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:20,880
Couldn't fii nd the brakes.

1316
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,350
Well, as long as I'm here,

1317
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:28,790
I might as well talk to
the president about the trees!

1318
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,380
Anybody home?

1319
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,030
With onlymoments left
before thebroadcast,

1320
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:35,430
Fearless Leader
hadreleasedRocky...

1321
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,500
from thegrip ofzombifiication
sohe could...

1322
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,830
share.

1323
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:42,630
As foryou, my friends,
we have planned...

1324
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,730
something quite special.

1325
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,910
We are hooking you directly
into the quality control.

1326
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,240
As soon as we g olive,

1327
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:58,150
the current will pass
throughyourbrain

1328
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,920
and you will be turned
intoahelpless,

1329
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,390
mindless vegetable.

1330
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,320
But don't worry...
it won'thurt.

1331
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,690
At least, I never
heard a complaint

1332
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,420
from the other vegetables.

1333
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:16,230
I think your ecognize

1334
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,640
your three missing colleagues
from the FBI?

1335
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,600
Help us! Help!

1336
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,110
I'm sorry, Rocky,
I've really done it this time.

1337
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,280
Don't worry, Karen,
you need the most faith

1338
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,110
when things look
the most hopeless.

1339
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,120
Thanks, Rocky.

1340
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,780
And, Karen...

1341
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,290
this is pretty hopeless.

1342
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,020
Look,

1343
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:43,260
we don't care
what you do to us...

1344
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,390
just leave America alone!

1345
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,300
Ah, America...

1346
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,530
I'm proud of you, Karen.

1347
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,240
Listen,
Fearless Leader:

1348
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,070
If there's one thing
this plucky squirrel
has shown me,

1349
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,270
is that you have
to be who you are,

1350
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,150
no matter how much pressure
there is to change!

1351
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,310
Yay!

1352
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,380
Anddespite
this inspiring vindication

1353
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:09,750
ofKaren's innerchild,

1354
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,950
Fearless Leader
was unimpressed.

1355
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,420
So Karen, Rocky,
andthe entire nation...

1356
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:19,000
werepoisedon thebrink
ofunimaginableperil.

1357
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,500
And there is no one...

1358
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,590
I said no one...

1359
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:25,500
who can stop me now!

1360
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:31,670
Or, in fact,
was there?

1361
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,110
Soyou see,
Mr. President,

1362
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,680
all the trees in
Frostbite Falls are gone.

1363
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:38,010
The birds have no place
to put their things.

1364
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,610
The children have no place
to build their tree house.

1365
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,850
I built them a stump house,

1366
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,250
but they say is just
not the same.

1367
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,720
Please help
when you have time.

1368
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,820
But Gorka,

1369
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,160
the horse has swallowed
the transmitter!

1370
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,320
Not again!

1371
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,530
They certainly enjoy theirTV
at the White House.

1372
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,610
Bullwinkle!

1373
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,370
Don't watch!

1374
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,570
Bullwinkle!

1375
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,080
Oh, no!
Notyou, too!

1376
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:15,320
Not a bad show,
eh, Mr. President?

1377
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,690
Yes, cheap as itmayseem...

1378
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:18,220
anditcertainly
does seem cheap...

1379
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,990
Bullwinkle's head
was so thick

1380
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,890
that Fearless Leader's
mind-numbing programming

1381
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,490
had absolutely no effect
on him whatsoever.

1382
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,460
Come here!

1383
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,470
At least one thing
hasn't changed!

1384
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,230
TV's as good as ever!

1385
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:32,700
Bullwinkle,
allow me to be frank.

1386
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,710
Okay, Frank,

1387
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,780
allow me to be
Bullwinkle.

1388
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,880
I'm Cappy
Von Trappment, FBI.

1389
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,340
I thoughtyou said
your name was Frank.

1390
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,040
- Shut up, Bullwinkle!
- Okay, Frank.

1391
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,740
As we speak,

1392
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:45,410
99% ofthe country is slobbering
in front ofthe television.

1393
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,750
- Whas so strange about that?
- Listen to me!

1394
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,910
We haven't heard from Karen,
I think she and Rocky...

1395
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,580
are in terrible danger.

1396
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:53,020
You've got to get
to New York!

1397
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,420
I thought this was New York.

1398
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:55,890
No, Bullwinkle,

1399
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,930
thas Washington out there!
Thas Washington!

1400
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:00,500
Really?

1401
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,500
Where's that
little white wig
he always wears?

1402
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,500
Is no use.

1403
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,770
Fearless Leader's speech starts
in less than two minutes.

1404
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,510
There's no way anyone
could get there in time now.

1405
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:15,080
Oh, butterballs!

1406
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:16,950
If only there were
some way of transmitting

1407
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:18,950
computer-generated
animated characters

1408
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:21,990
across great distances
in the blink of an eye.

1409
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,080
Bullwinkle!
Thas it!

1410
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:26,350
It is?

1411
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,950
Yes, is our
only chance!

1412
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,930
We're gonna E-mail you
to Karen in New York.

1413
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:32,120
Well, okay,
but don'tyou think...

1414
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:33,630
she'd rather get flowers?

1415
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,790
Just shut up
and hold on!

1416
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,800
- Okay!
- One... two...

1417
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,270
three!

1418
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,980
And squeezing into
the scanner drive...

1419
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,380
Bullwinkle found himself inside
the presidential computer.

1420
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,990
Butback atRBTV,

1421
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,610
Fearless Leader's deadly
countdown hadjustbegun.

1422
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,250
15, 14...

1423
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:01,800
12...

1424
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:02,230
12...

1425
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:05,460
And thas when Bullwinkle
snapped into action.

1426
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:07,900
Look, Frank,
solitaire.

1427
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,260
I'm sorry, Bullwinkle,

1428
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:10,840
we don't have time
for that!

1429
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,580
With the coolagility
ofajungle cat,

1430
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,740
our heroic moose grabbed the
corners of the E-mail envelope

1431
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,900
and hung on for
the ride ofhis life.

1432
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:22,640
Eight, seven,

1433
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,150
si-i...

1434
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,240
While time stood virtually
still at RBTV,

1435
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,120
Bullwinkle surfed
the information super highway

1436
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,350
onhis way tosave the day.

1437
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,660
Look, I'm hangin' four!

1438
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,080
S-S-Surf's up, dude!

1439
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:00,680
Hang on, Rocky!

1440
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,550
I'm coming!

1441
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:08,630
Bullwinkle found himself
inside the RBTV computer...

1442
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:09,700
Five...

1443
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,530
Computer:
You've gotmail!

1444
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,530
...with only seconds left
to spare and no idea
how to get out.

1445
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:14,860
Four!

1446
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,900
Bullwinkle, hurry up!
Click on something!

1447
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,530
- "Mine sweeper"?
- Three...

1448
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,570
Print! Print!

1449
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,580
Andusing his brain,

1450
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,080
Bullwinkle activated
the 'print"icon...

1451
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,170
but was hein time?

1452
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,750
One...

1453
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,880
Fearless Leader!

1454
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:32,920
My fellow Americans.

1455
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,820
Say hello
to Fearless Leader!

1456
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,620
Hello-oo!

1457
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:43,020
You are tired, America.
You are getting verysleepy.

1458
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:45,660
Your mind is mush.
You need help.

1459
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,860
Yes, America,

1460
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,770
you need me
to run your country.

1461
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:53,000
Youreallyneedme!

1462
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:55,410
So vote forme
asyourleader!

1463
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,000
Vote for Fearless Leader!

1464
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:01,340
We will vote
for Fearless Leader.

1465
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,710
I will vote
for Fearless Leader.

1466
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:07,690
Yes, America, I will bring
order to the government.

1467
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:10,780
This country will finally have
a president you can respect.

1468
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,380
Look, is moose!

1469
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:13,790
And no sooner had Bullwinkle
emerged from the printer

1470
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,620
than his might yantlers
momentarily jammed

1471
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,720
the quality control signal,

1472
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,360
reversing the vegetation
process

1473
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:22,440
and bringing Karen and Rocky
miraculously back to life.

1474
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,940
Fearless Leader:
Yes, eversince I was
a little sketch

1475
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,630
growing up in Pottsylvania,

1476
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,940
I dreamed of
ruling the world.

1477
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,040
Fearless Leader,

1478
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:34,810
moose is loose!

1479
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,040
Get them!

1480
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:41,180
Go! Go!

1481
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,290
Now, where were we?

1482
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:47,760
Yes. I always knew
I would rule the world someday.

1483
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,390
Thas exactly
whatl'm going to do.

1484
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,930
Ouch!

1485
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,300
So vote for Fearless Leader

1486
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,310
and make a little boy's
dream come true.

1487
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:07,980
We will vote
for Fearless Leader.

1488
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,850
Once I am elected,
there will be an end to chaos.

1489
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,320
There will be discipline.

1490
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,410
Because I'm going to run
this country...

1491
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,180
like a well-oiled machine...

1492
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:18,120
I guess you could
call me a neat freak,

1493
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:19,990
but we all have
our little foibles...

1494
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:23,650
That tingles!

1495
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:28,860
...l'll be the president.

1496
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:32,370
And with a single voice,
America will say...

1497
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,700
Aaah!

1498
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,770
Come on, Rock!
Wrap it all up!

1499
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,000
Okay, Karen!

1500
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,900
Bullwinkle,
finish the speech!

1501
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,840
Ahem...
Good evening, America.

1502
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,570
Bullwinkle Moose here,
saying...

1503
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,230
Forgot my line.

1504
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,140
Just tell 'em
to turn off the TV

1505
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:14,410
and vote for
whoever they want.

1506
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,580
Turn off yourTV and vote
for whoever you want!

1507
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,310
And whoever wins
the election,

1508
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,250
replant the forest
in Frostbite Falls!

1509
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,260
And sure enough,
all across America,

1510
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,490
RBTV viewers
turned off their sets

1511
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:28,060
and faced
the diffiicult question

1512
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,820
of who they actually
wanted to vote for.

1513
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,430
And the moment the machine
had been destroyed,

1514
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,600
the three vegetables
from the FBI

1515
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:45,410
immediately resumed
their human form.

1516
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,610
Thanks, Agent Sympathy.

1517
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,420
Freed at last from
Fearless Leader's evil grasp,

1518
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:01,930
even the Pottsylvanian
spies rejoiced.

1519
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:06,770
Well, we won't be
needing this anymore.

1520
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,230
Yeah!

1521
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,800
Oh, that reminds me!

1522
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,460
I should E-mail
that nice Frank

1523
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:12,870
an dthank him for his help.

1524
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:14,630
Bullwinkle, no!

1525
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,080
Ooh!

1526
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,440
Aaah!

1527
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,490
Aaah!

1528
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,750
Andso the three villains
were launchedup into
the Internet,

1529
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,380
where they wouldbe
heardfrom nomore.

1530
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:35,620
Aaaaaugh!

1531
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,930
And so it came to pass
that the election

1532
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,400
took place as planned.

1533
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,300
Yes, Rocky and Bullwinkle
were stars once again.

1534
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,270
RBTV changed its name
from "Really Bad Television"

1535
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,570
to "Rocky and Bullwinkle
Television."

1536
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:52,510
Whas the difference?

1537
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:54,480
Sir, there's one thing
I still don't understand.

1538
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,680
Why did you pick me
for this mission?

1539
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:00,520
I mean, I'm clearly
not FBI material.

1540
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:04,350
FBI material is what gets
thejob done, Ms. Sympathy.

1541
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,820
If you needed an agent
to work with a cartoon

1542
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,520
moose and squirrel,
who would you send?

1543
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:12,360
Someone tough,
hard-boiled and cynical?

1544
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:14,800
Or one ofthose
soft, squishy,

1545
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,270
lovey-dovey,
idealistic types?

1546
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,200
Yes, sir.

1547
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:21,770
Thank you, sir...

1548
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,100
I think.

1549
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,040
Affirmative.

1550
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,520
Oh, by the way,

1551
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,380
good work.

1552
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,910
Well, I really want
to thank you guys
for everything.

1553
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:55,170
And I really...

1554
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,900
Well, I really...

1555
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,170
I'd really like to say

1556
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,810
that I thinkwe made
a great team.

1557
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,180
I'd really like to say...

1558
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,550
that I think we made
a great team.

1559
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:06,920
And if it hadn't been fo ryou,

1560
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,180
I never would have learned...

1561
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,720
And if it hadn't been for you,

1562
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,660
I never would have learned...

1563
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,660
That what you believe in
when you're young,

1564
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,430
can still be true
when you grow up.

1565
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:20,860
Please don't
make me say that.

1566
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,770
You gotta say it!

1567
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:24,460
Who is she talking to?

1568
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:26,440
You got me, Rock.

1569
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,770
That whatyou believe in
when you'reyoung,

1570
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,430
can still be true
when you grow up.

1571
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,410
Anyway...

1572
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,080
thanks for the adventure.

1573
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:54,970
So long.

1574
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:56,540
Where areyou going?

1575
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:00,370
Um... the movies.

1576
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,980
Ofcourse!

1577
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,510
The movies!

1578
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,350
Hi. Um...

1579
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,420
sorry I'm late.

1580
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,180
Oh...
thas okay.

1581
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,150
And as Karen and Ole finally
went to the movies,

1582
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,810
back in Frostbite Falls
the president carried out

1583
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,450
the post-hypnotic suggestion
to replant the animated trees.

1584
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,100
Mama!

1585
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,870
Sonny boy!

1586
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:49,880
Meanwhile, all was well
with our heroes.

1587
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,750
Rocky was his oldself again...

1588
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:53,840
Aw, I'll never forget
our trip to New York

1589
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:56,220
to visit
President Washington!

1590
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,880
Andso was Bullwinkle.

1591
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,650
Yes, glad to be homein their
revitalized little town,

1592
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,530
Rocky the flying squirrel
took a well-deserved joyride

1593
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:08,290
through the sunny skies
of Frostbite Falls!

1594
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,020
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

1595
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:29,510
When you're feeling
like you're...

1596
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:31,410
Out of touch

1597
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,910
All alone and lost

1598
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:37,250
And drifting
through the night

1599
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:42,380
Just think back
toyounger times

1600
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:46,360
And you'll fii nd
the light

1601
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:51,420
See the world
for a while

1602
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:56,700
Through the eyes
ofa child

1603
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,240
You will see
so much wonder

1604
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:06,710
In your days

1605
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,440
All thatyou believed

1606
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:12,080
When you were small

1607
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:13,780
Are still the dreams

1608
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:16,860
That guide us all

1609
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:20,290
The mirror shows
you've grown

1610
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:24,190
But reflects
the child in you

1611
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,860
If you're lookin' out

1612
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:33,600
On stormy skies

1613
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:36,470
And empty fiields

1614
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:39,810
Afraid to give it
one more try

1615
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:44,870
See yourself
above the clouds

1616
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:48,820
Spread your wings and fly

1617
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:54,220
See the world
for a while

1618
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:59,230
Through the eyes
of a child

1619
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:04,740
You will see
so much wonder

1620
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:09,000
In your days

1621
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:11,010
All that you believed

1622
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:14,670
When you were small

1623
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:19,410
Are still the dreams
you carry on

1624
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,780
lmagine what could be

1625
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:26,920
If you just believed in you

1626
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:35,170
When you were young

1627
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:42,700
Who did you wanna be?

1628
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:46,040
What is stopping you

1629
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:50,850
From that dream?

1630
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:53,650
This is whoyou are

1631
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,380
Don't be afraid

1632
01:28:56,490 --> 01:29:00,950
The child in you
will never fail

1633
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:06,330
The power to believe
is yours alone

1634
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:11,430
No one can ever take
that child away

1635
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:38,530
See the world
for a while

1636
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:43,830
Through the eyes
ofa child

1637
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:49,240
You will see
so much wonder

1638
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:53,610
In your days

1639
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:55,340
All that you believed

1640
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,180
When you were small

1641
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:00,840
Are still the dreams

1642
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:04,450
That guide us all

1643
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,390
The mirror shows
you've grown

1644
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:12,120
But reflects
the child in you

1645
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:19,200
lfthere's
one thing I could

1646
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:21,100
Say toyou

1647
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:24,700
It would be to try

1648
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:27,110
To makeyour dream
come true

1649
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:32,280
You can do
almost anything

1650
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:37,480
If youjust believe...

1651
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:41,930
