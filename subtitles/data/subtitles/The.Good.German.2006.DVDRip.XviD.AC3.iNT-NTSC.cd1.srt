It's gonna get harder,
not easier. Watch.

153
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:02,627
They put your name on a list,
and then that's it.

154
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:16,908
I forget sometimes
what a boy you are.

155
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,177
Such a boy.

156
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,847
- A sweet little boy.
- No, cut it out.

157
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,852
Does that bother you?

158
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,957
Why should it?

159
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,252
My husband was a boy too.

160
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:37,355
A little boy
who saw numbers in his head.

161
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,139
I'm your fellow, okay?

162
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,938
I'll get you out of here.

163
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,812
You watch.

164
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:01,285
My gill,
she's not just a pretty face, no, sir.

165
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,484
She won first prize last year with her
rhubarb pie, and second with her gourds.

166
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:08,994
- That's terrific, Tully.
- Oh, she's pretty terrific, sir.

167
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,428
Any luck, I'll be home
for the harvest dance.

168
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:14,263
Well, at this rate
we'll still be driving to Potsdam.

169
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,571
Somebody got up
on the wrong side of the bed.

170
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,937
- Some son of a bitch stole my wallet.
- No kidding.

171
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,568
It must have been
in that crowd at the airport.

172
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,577
I can loan you money if you need it.

173
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,781
Thanks, Tully.

174
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:33,149
Don't want you to miss
all the great things Berlin has to offer.

175
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,586
I used to live here before the war.

176
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,090
- Really?
- Ran the AP bureau.

177
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:42,361
They're not really gonna put
the country on trial, are they?

178
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,260
Do you think they shouldn't?

179
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,492
Doesn't seem American
to lock a person up...

180
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,536
...for something they didn't
have anything to do with.

181
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,005
Somebody you know, Tully?

182
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,834
I'm just saying.

183
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,641
Well, there's a piece that would sell:
"Fallen Women of the Third Reich. "

184
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,178
That's pretty raw, sir.

185
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,809
Millions of people didn't disappear
because the elves came out at night.

186
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:09,685
<i>Your Fräulein knew exactly
what Hitler was doing. They all knew.</i>

187
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,794
- Did she lift a finger?
- You don't know a thing about her.

188
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,452
And you do?

189
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,858
Just because you're a German
doesn't make you a Nazi.

190
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:27,738
You heard Breimer.
It's on to the Russians.

191
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,810
The next war.

192
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:33,847
They'll leave your girlfriend alone unless
there's some special reason not to.

193
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,382
It's gonna cost me
to get her out of Germany...

194
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,816
...I can tell you that right now.

195
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,286
I wish I could help you out, kid.

196
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,654
You want an hour with her?

197
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,452
Beautiful day, huh?

198
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,599
Are you looking for an argument?

199
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:06,435
I'm sorry I broke your tooth.
It was an honest disagreement.

200
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,940
What do you need?

201
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,079
Papers.
To get someone out of Germany.

202
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:14,580
- A Nazi?
- Not a Nazi. A friend of mine.

203
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,186
With what I've been through, you'd
ask me to help a Nazi escape Germany?

204
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,355
Hey, cry me a river.

205
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:25,153
Fuck, everyone in this town's
got a hard-luck story.

206
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,260
You gonna help me or not?

207
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,261
I'll see what I can do.

208
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,033
Great. Just don't Jew me on the price.

209
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,377
Lena?

210
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,703
- Where's Emil Brandt?
- Who?

211
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:48,334
- Emil Brandt.
- Who the fuck is Emil Brandt?

212
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,879
- Where's Emil Brandt?
- Fuck you!

213
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,114
Fuck!

214
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,916
Who's Emil Brandt?

215
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,112
- Emil?
- Who is he?

216
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,282
They were looking for him
in your place, Lena. Where is he?

217
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,257
- He's dead.
- Don't lie to me!

218
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,260
He died.

219
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,830
He died in the war.

220
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,968
Like you fucking know! Who is he?

221
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,400
He was my husband.

222
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,904
Lena?

223
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,546
- Emil Brandt. That's your husband?
- Yes.

224
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,551
I'm Lena Brandt.

225
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,251
- A last name. What a cozy feeling.
- Tully...

226
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:11,325
He must have done something
if they're hopped up to find him.

227
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,489
I'm gonna find out sooner or later!

228
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,460
He was a mathematician.

229
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:20,124
He saw numbers in his head?
It's bullshit! They broke my fucking arm!

230
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:21,667
He was a nobody.

231
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,998
- Somebody's secretary.
- Whose secretary?

232
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,038
What does it matter who?

233
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,540
My husband brought him his coffee
and took steno.

234
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,474
When's the last time you saw him?

235
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,443
Three... Three years ago.

236
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,344
I'm with you now, Tully.

237
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,280
How am I supposed to help you, Lena,
if you won't help me?

238
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,889
I would never hurt you, Tully.

239
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,653
Never.

240
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,465
You can get anything
on the black market.

241
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,661
I talked to someone.
A little lop-cock, no legs...

242
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,532
...but he can run down anything.

243
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,799
He can get you on a train out.
That's what you want, right?

244
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:03,537
They told me he was dead.

245
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:08,113
One more dead, or not dead.

246
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,983
Who would know?

247
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:17,686
Poor, fucking stupid Lena.

248
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:22,126
You don't know fucking nothing,
do you?

249
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,871
Hey, Sikorsky.

250
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,476
What happened to your arm?

251
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,409
Scotch from Scotland. Forty cases.

252
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,974
Good?

253
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:18,915
They flew it in for Churchill.

254
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,980
Can't afford it.

255
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:26,389
Hey, who's your comrade?
Don't worry, I'll give you a price.

256
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,443
I got something else for you.

257
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,670
Really? What's that?

258
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,212
Emil Brandt.

259
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,284
Remind me who that is.

260
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,083
You should know.
You've been looking for him.

261
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,517
Have I?

262
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,950
Names, names, so many names.

263
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:02,757
Maybe I should just turn him over
to the Americans.

264
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,193
Why don't you?

265
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,857
Because when everyone else
pulls up their tents...

266
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:10,129
...you Ivans will be the only game
in Berlin, and the fact is...

267
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:13,103
- ... I like it here.
- That's it?

268
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,675
A favor?

269
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,510
Two hundred thousand marks.

270
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:28,122
It's not like I'm asking for real money.
Have the printing press work overtime.

271
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,887
Plus papers, so I can get my girlfriend
on a train out of here.

272
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,122
The trouble is, Tully...

273
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:38,255
...I have seen Emil Brandt's
death certificate with my own eyes.

274
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:42,498
I thought you weren't looking for him.

275
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,714
Now, let me do you a favor.

276
00:18:54,883 --> 00:19:00,014
You remind me of my son, a little bit
of a buffoon, but good-natured.

277
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,989
Get out. Now. Before you get hurt.

278
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,000
Suit yourself.

279
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:22,701
I just gotta figure out
how to get my girlfriend on that train.

280
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,336
What's your girlfriend's name?

281
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:30,182
Mrs. Emil Brandt.

282
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:34,118
Imagine her surprise
when he turned up like that.

283
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,553
And mine too.

284
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,695
Hey, Tully.

285
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:52,802
I'll take your offer.

286
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:55,375
Two hundred thousand marks.

287
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,276
A lot to arrange, getting him out
of the American zone. You follow?

288
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,554
Come back in two hours.
I'll advance you half.

289
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,849
And bring Mrs. Brandt.

290
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,014
I'm not going with you
to the Russian zone.

291
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,656
Lena, half up front,
100,000 marks.

292
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,849
Have you checked
the exchange rate lately?

293
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:47,518
What happens when they find out
you don't have Emil?

294
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,859
What happens is, we're in London
with 10,000 fucking dollars.

295
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,194
You're out, I'm out.
It's a perfect plan.

296
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,302
I won't go to the Russian zone.
I won't.

297
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:59,669
He just wants to see you. What's the
big deal? He wants to know I have him.

298
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,902
- But you don't have him.
- You're out selling love you don't have.

299
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:08,641
Hey, fish.

300
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,513
I had to hitch a ride
from the conference. What happened?

301
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,949
Blow.

302
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,522
I hate to pull rank on you,
but you are my fucking driver.

303
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,850
I'm off the clock, sir.

304
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:28,866
Lena?

305
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,638
I'm off the clock too.

306
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:43,642
I'll pick you up in the morning.
I'm in the middle of something.

307
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,344
- We know each other.
- I'm in the middle of something.

308
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:49,183
- What happened to you?
- I need a minute to think, Tully.

309
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,826
You can think on the way.

310
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:54,827
- Hey, don't push her around like that.
- Fuck you!

311
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:58,096
Move!

312
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:07,066
Get in.

313
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,369
Hey!

314
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,841
- Tully, stop.
- Shut up!

315
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,281
Stupid fuck!

316
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:34,729
<i>They gave me a choice:
London or Berlin.</i>

317
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,768
<i>For me there was no choice.</i>

318
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,533
<i>The minute it came over the wire
that the war in Europe was finally over...</i>

319
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,234
<i>...all I thought of was Lena.</i>

320
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,478
<i>I didn't expect to run into her.
Not that way.</i>

321
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:48,946
<i>Not my first week in town.</i>

322
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,744
<i>But that was just like Lena.</i>

323
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,820
<i>She always kept me off balance.</i>

324
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:57,423
<i>Tully wouldn't be a problem,
or not anything I couldn't figure out.</i>

325
00:22:57,592 --> 00:23:00,459
<i>I just had to find her again.</i>

326
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,260
<i>I knew the bartender would help.</i>

327
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:06,799
<i>Tell a bartender you're looking for
a friend, and you have two friends:</i>

328
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,597
<i>Him, and the girl he steers you to.</i>

329
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:12,967
- What the hell is she doing with him?
- Who?

330
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,574
- Lena.
- Tully?

331
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,303
He's not a bad sort.
Just a bit of a cunt.

332
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,174
Yesterday he tried
to pimp her to me.

333
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:23,415
Well, she and her friend Hannelore
come around and cheer up the Gls.

334
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:24,916
We're all trying to get by.

335
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:29,751
This whole goddamn country,
she winds up fucking my fucking driver.

336
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,153
Oh, you knew her?

337
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,157
I hired her as a stringer.

338
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,626
Her husband was never home.
There were no kids.

339
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:38,823
She got tired of rattling around
the house all day.

340
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,332
She was good at it too.

341
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,337
She could get people to do things,
and they didn't know how she did it.

342
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,634
- You were screwing your secretary.
- Stringer.

343
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:49,140
Sorry.

344
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:51,836
What the hell does it mean
she's with him, anyway?

345
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,681
She seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

346
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:02,720
I just didn't expect
I'd find her like this.

347
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,592
I didn't expect I'd find her.

348
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:09,727
When you say to yourself, "That's
the worst thing I've ever heard"...

349
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:14,995
...stick around.
That's Berlin. Now it is.

350
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,503
There's always something worse.

351
00:24:55,343 --> 00:25:00,371
- Geismer. G-E-I-S-M-E-R. Geismer.
- Yes, yes, I understand.

352
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,882
<i>I'm sorry, The New Republic
is not credentialed for today's schedule.</i>

353
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:07,749
- We can't have you without a press card.
- I told you my wallet was stolen.

354
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,618
I have a line of people behind you.

355
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,919
You should speak to General Sikorsky.
He's in charge of security.

356
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,292
Where's Charlie Ross?

357
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:24,769
I played poker with him in St. Louis.
If I could just talk to Charlie Ross.

358
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,065
Oh, fuck a duck.

359
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,537
General, over here, please.

360
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,272
Welcome.

361
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:38,409
Wonderful, wonderful.

362
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,311
Congratulations.

363
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,284
General.

364
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,095
General, I'm with the office
of the military governor.

365
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:37,601
I'll be escorting the captain
back to the American zone.

366
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:27,212
Were you with Corporal Tully
last night?

367
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,415
I was in a club up till dawn
drinking with the bartender...

368
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,356
...if your girl Friday
had bothered to check.

369
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:37,592
Checkpoint recorded Jacob Geismer
crossing into the Russian zone...

370
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,791
...just after midnight.

371
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,799
- Fucking Tully.
- What's that?

372
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,999
My wallet was stolen at the airport.

373
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,770
- Did you report it?
- It's not exactly a war crime.

374
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:52,606
Where did you get those bruises?

375
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:54,510
I got in a fight with Tully.

376
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:57,173
- Over...?
- He rode the brake.

377
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,380
Wasn't over a girl, was it?

378
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:06,818
He was supposed to pick me up.
He didn't show. I got pissy about it.

379
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:11,096
The Russians want this to go away.

380
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,666
An American serviceman turns up dead
in Potsdam...

381
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,167
...on the eve of the peace conference?

382
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,595
It's pretty damn embarrassing.

383
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,536
Good news for you, frankly.

384
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,610
We want it to go away too.

385
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,042
Well, maybe I should talk directly
to the MG.

386
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:27,943
He won't wanna bother with this.

387
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:31,051
He doesn't wanna know
what Tully was doing in Potsdam?

388
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:33,686
We're doing a hell of a job in Berlin.

389
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,789
Is there a black market? Sure there is.

390
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:38,653
Are some of our boys involved in it?
Yes, they are.

391
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:42,228
- If the Russians killed Tully...
- Then he deserved whatever he got.

392
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,126
And his poor family
doesn't need to know anything more...

393
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,531
...than that he crashed his jeep
trying to avoid a bunny rabbit.

394
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,536
We're not gonna start World War lll
over some dumb Gl...

395
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:54,299
...who got his dick stuck
in a pitchpot.

396
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:58,404
You stay out of the Russian sector
for the rest of your time here.

397
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,980
Now, we can't protect you over there.

398
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,088
Thanks.

399
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,255
And if you find that girl...

400
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,226
...we'd like to talk to her.

401
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:53,529
Kids. Two months ago,
they were shooting at us.

402
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:26,734
If it isn't Jake Geismer.
Who did you insult this time?

403
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:30,098
- You got a second? I'll tell you.
- Yeah, why don't we catch up?

404
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:33,069
- How's 1946?
- You mean you're not interested?

405
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:35,732
I know you, Jake. We're a long way
from South Street.

406
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,971
That's funny. I haven't met a DA yet
that could resist a murder.

407
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:48,911
Nothing better for a prosecutor
than a criminal with a sense of history.

408
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,116
Everything got written down.
Who they killed and what it cost.

409
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:54,955
Meticulous record keepers.

410
00:31:55,697 --> 00:32:02,000
<i>...forces from the west are poised
to strike the final blows upon Japan.</i>

411
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,766
<i>This military power is sustained
and inspired by the determination...</i>

412
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:11,105
<i>...of all the Allied nations
to prosecute the war against Japan...</i>

413
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,373
<i>- ... until she ceases to exist.
- It looks like you're putting...</i>

414
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:17,779
- ... the whole country on trial.
- These are just the active cases.

415
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:20,614
The rest are kept under
lock and key at Kransberg.

416
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:23,621
They want me to decide
who the ardent Nazis were.

417
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:27,659
Truth is, it was the whole country.
Nobody's hands are clean.

418
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:30,627
Twenty-hour days
just to get my arms around it.

419
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,392
So, what's the murder
you wanted to tell me about?

420
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:41,170
What, Gunther?
He used to be a cop here in Berlin.

421
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:44,140
Don't worry, he doesn't
speak a word of English.

422
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,814
My driver, a kid named Tully,
turned up dead in Potsdam.

423
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,075
Potsdam? Potsdam's closed
for the conference.

424
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:52,811
Whoever wanted him dead
had access to the delegations.

425
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:55,649
- That's somebody high up.
- Why haven't I heard about it?

426
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:58,724
Muller didn't want you to.
He ordered me to leave it alone.

427
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:01,417
Nobody around here's
acting like the war is over.

428
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,121
Not the Russians. Not the MG.

429
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,664
- What's your angle?
- Why should I have an angle?

430
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:09,325
It just doesn't sound like you.

431
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:13,167
You came home, all you talked about
was what a great lay your secretary was.

432
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:15,605
- Stringer.
- Stringer. Sorry.

433
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:19,235
A bullet through the chest, in the river.
It's like it never happened.

434
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,747
Isn't that what we fought a war about?
Even a louse like Tully?

435
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,448
Okay.

436
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,446
Okay.

437
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:31,552
What?

438
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:35,719
The Russians will have to do
a police report. Can you get me a copy?

439
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:42,698
This guy drove one of the gas vans.

440
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,567
They would load the Jews in back,
run the exhaust inside.

441
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:50,973
By the time they got where they were
going, they were dead. Very efficient.

442
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,478
Driving to work he killed more people
than Al Capone in all his years.

443
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:58,743
But if you asked him,
he isn't a murderer, he's a truck driver.

444
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,184
And he still thinks that.

445
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,286
Thanks, Bernie. I owe you one.

446
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,347
Thank you, Danny.

447
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:21,833
I can't be out after curfew.
Would you walk with me?

448
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:53,193
You live here with someone?

449
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:56,229
Big man.

450
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,736
You want two girls?

451
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,935
You know a girl named Lena?

452
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:07,704
Who told you about Lena?

453
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:10,510
I'm not trying to get something
for nothing.

454
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:15,618
Aren't you going to offer me
a cigarette?

455
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:22,860
I didn't see her at the club.

456
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:25,594
Skinny Lena.

457
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,634
A big Yank in the saddle,
you'd break her in two.

458
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:33,404
Can I look in your bedroom?

459
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:59,429
Come. Fuck me, Dutch.

460
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,904
The princess,
who knows where she is?

461
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,776
Lena was raped by the Russians.

462
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:22,650
You'll get yourself a good dose.

463
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:27,456
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.

464
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,691
She's not so special.

465
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,337
They raped everyone:
cripples, children.

466
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:59,484
How did you find this place?

467
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:07,498
Five hundred just to talk.

468
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:11,164
That's what I call a real pervert.

469
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:16,368
Take a couple hours off, would you?

470
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,577
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

471
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,552
- I didn't say you did.
- The war, it's convenient.

472
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:05,021
We can all blame everything
on the war.

473
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:07,557
Isn't that why you left?

474
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,124
The war?

475
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,867
I found that blue dress I bought you.

476
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:18,527
All the old things. All the old times.

477
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:20,867
This is my life now.

478
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:23,033
Tully at least understood that.

479
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,305
What was Tully doing
in Potsdam last night?

480
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:29,141
- I don't know.
- You weren't with him?

481
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:32,444
Potsdam is in the Russian zone.
I don't go to the Russian zone.

482
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:37,586
Lena, if I can find you, so can they.

483
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:41,554
As if I'm the only one
who needed help.

484
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:45,165
- Look at you.
- What is it you're not telling me?

485
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,735
It couldn't be that I loved him?

486
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,898
You don't need
to be afraid of him anymore.

487
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:53,973
You don't need
to protect him anymore.

488
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:59,268
I think if you hadn't left, Jacob...

489
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:02,314
...nothing would be any different.

490
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:04,307
Nothing.

491
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:10,483
If.

492
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:17,355
If you want to stay, it's 500 marks.

493
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,826
Make up your mind.

494
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:24,133
I'm going to sleep.

495
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:01,304
Did you get the report?

496
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:04,967
I had to get it from a friend of mine.
Even Muller hasn't seen that yet.

497
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:08,809
- Interesting reading?
- They found 50,000 marks on him.

498
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,679
So figuring they stole half, 100?

499
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:15,379
They found a slug lodged
in his backpack,.32 caliber.

500
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,148
Our guns are. 45.

501
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,720
Thanks.

502
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,503
Now, listen,
I'm the first to recognize...

503
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,667
...there were excesses
in the Nazi leadership.

504
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:41,508
But if we besmirch an entire people
because of a few bad apples...

505
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,343
...we're no better than Hitler.

506
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:47,248
Then it's not about war crimes at all.

507
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:50,216
It's about revenge.

508
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:57,686
Revenge. Right. Got it.

509
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:01,100
Exactly. Revenge.

510
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:18,006
I found that in the dirt
where Tully's body washed up.

511
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:23,844
The little dash that you'll sometimes find
near the serial number? It's not there.

512
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,812
- That's meaningful?
- It means Tully had something to sell.

513
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,821
Something that our side
badly wanted...

514
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:34,517
...and you very badly
didn't want us to have.

515
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,856
You solved it
the way Russians know how to:

516
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,797
You put a bullet in him. In Potsdam.
Where he thought he'd be safe.

517
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,129
All that from a mark of punctuation.

518
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:47,534
No dash means that it's American.

519
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,973
You could check it against the money
you stole from him...

520
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:53,204
...if you felt like it.

521
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:30,875
I was expecting Tully that night.

522
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:33,916
Here. Not in Potsdam.

523
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,851
He never showed up.

524
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:39,890
Instead of the usual Scotch
and cameras, he was selling...

525
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,258
<i>...for the price of 200,000 marks,
a man:::</i>

526
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,826
...named Emil Brandt.

527
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:53,897
What's so interesting
about Emil Brandt?

528
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,072
The Americans were looking for him.

529
00:44:59,246 --> 00:45:00,645
That made me curious.

530
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:06,113
We pack up entire factories
and ship them back to Moscow.

531
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,413
Now the peace conference...

532
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:12,889
...Poland, Romania,
half of Europe, a windfall.

533
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,052
Something for the sacrifice
and suffering.

534
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,425
Now ask yourself:

535
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:20,631
What do the Americans get?

536
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,135
Sounds to me
like we're getting a good fleecing.

537
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:32,605
You may not be as safe
on the American side as you think.

538
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:53,995
Hannelore, Lena.

539
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,484
Even radar couldn't find you here.

540
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:28,150
Of course, you won't be earning...

541
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,758
...but Jacob here volunteered
to carry you girls on the cuff...

542
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:33,984
...till things have settled down.

543
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,652
I'll check in on you when I can.

544
00:48:38,365 --> 00:48:41,266
As long as it's on the cuff
and not on my back.

545
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:43,665
He gives me the creeps.

546
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,999
Fixing your mouth,
with where it's going, sweetheart?

547
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,472
Let's give them a minute.

548
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,656
I don't want you to go out anymore.

549
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:06,554
It's a good thing I wasn't there,
don't you think?

550
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:10,219
- I went for a loaf of bread.
- I can bring you anything you need.

551
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:15,397
Stare at the same four walls.

552
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:17,297
I'd go mad.

553
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:23,339
You wanna tell me why Emil would be
worth 100,000 marks to someone?

554
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,011
There'd be no reason.

555
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:29,171
That's how much money
they found on Tully's body.

556
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:32,214
That doesn't make any sense.

557
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,479
Might have been nice to know,
Mrs. Brandt...

558
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:37,213
...that Tully was auctioning off
your husband.

559
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,224
We never talked
about Emil, remember?

560
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,658
One of our rules.

561
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:44,888
An affair has more rules
than marriage.

562
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,432
The Americans are looking for him,
and the Russians. Why?

563
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:50,899
- I don't know.
- Where is he, Lena? Where's Emil?

564
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,370
Emil's dead. He died six months ago
in the bombing.

565
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:57,066
Tully found out the Americans
were looking for Emil...

566
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:01,681
...so he offered him to the Russians.
One of his schemes. Stupid.

567
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:05,511
A way to get money to get me
out of Germany. Sell them a dead man.

568
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:09,053
Now he's dead too. Maybe you next,
if you don't watch yourself.

569
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:11,383
This isn't gonna go away
because Tully's dead.

570
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:13,583
- That's all I know.
- Emil was with the SS?

571
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,455
Two years ago they all got uniforms.

572
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:17,220
- Who knows why?
- Stop lying to me.

573
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:20,662
I'm a Nazi myself, did you know that?
It's true.

574
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:23,233
- You're not a Nazi.
- No, not a Nazi. None of us.

575
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:25,598
Just something to join,
like a sport club.

576
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,900
How could you fuck someone
for all those years and not know them?

577
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:31,237
- Stop it.
- Did you ever fuck a Nazi?

578
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,810
- Cut it out.
- How about a Jew?

579
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:36,312
- Why won't you let me help you?
- A Nazi and a Jew both, better yet.

580
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:40,042
- You did nothing wrong!
- I survived.

581
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:51,042
