What are you waiting for?
Get an ambulance.

Please leave
the room, darling.

Okay?
Okay.

Take it easy!
What are you trying to do,
break my head?

8
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,014
Say it.

Yes, darling, completely.

10

You're wasting your time
and my time

11
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,212

It's important.

Oh, yes, Charles.
Thank you. I, uh,

Tuesday night game, you know?

Mr. Lawrence is having
quite a run with the dice.

Simply amazing.
I've never...

to resign at $1,600.

Hi, Mark.

The Army may have
taught you bravery, Mark,

but I'm not so sure
about your judgment.

42

You see, Byron,
sometimes a little boldness

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,959
is exactly what's called for.

47
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,522
Uh, Mark, excuse me.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,624
Huh?

Could I talk to you
for a second?

I just... I'd just like to
see you for a second.

Don't go away, huh.
What's the matter?

54
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,273
Nothing. I just want to talk
to you for a minute.

Yes, sir, Mr. Halperin.
Right away.

59
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,492
Are you sure
she's dead?

60
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,662
Yeah.

We were... we were fighting.

64
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,441
We were screaming
at each other.

65
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,709
I was sure she was gonna
see somebody tonight.

66
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,784
She came at me,

67
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,891
and I must have grabbed her
by the throat.

68
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,189
All right. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

69
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,123
I didn't know
what I was doing.

70
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,529
I just saw her face

71
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,304
looking up at me

72
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,839
and then when I realized
what I was doing,

73
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,241
I let her go.

74
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,404
And she just fell.

00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,948
Calm down. Calm down.

76
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,246
Mark, you gotta tell me
what to do.

00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,850
All right.

78
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,857
Now, was there
anyone else in the house

79
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,620
when this happened?
Was the maid there?

80
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,024
No, she, uh,

81
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,029
she left about 8:15,
when I got home.

82
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,086
Right. Right.

83
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,089
Did you call anyone?

84
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,326
Just your place.

85
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,663
Margaret told me
you were here.

86
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,226
But you didn't say
anything to her?

87
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,293
No.

88
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,004
Or maybe I should call Fred.

89
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,473
He doesn't
handle criminal cases,

90
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,567
but he must know somebody...
No. No.

91
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,204
Or maybe I should go
to the police.

92
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,742
Mark, I didn't mean
to kill her.

Hugh, you can't afford
to do that.

you and Janice were having.

there are more people
in there.

99

At exactly 10:30,
I want you to call your house.

100

I'll answer the phone.

and anyone else in the bar

don't you?

She's gone to bed early,

for you. Do you understand?

Yes, yes, darling. Of course,
you must be exhausted.

00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,682
into your assorted charities,
Margaret,

166
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,381
but it's a lot more
than any $10 trophy

167
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,017
they're going to hand you.

168

Not tonight, please.

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,360
Darling, if you're embarrassed
by all your millions,

170
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,196

sign them over to me?

They wouldn't embarrass me
in the least.

173
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,906
Money is a weapon, Mark,

174
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:06,277
a tool to be used for good,
if it's used properly.

175

Hmm. Properly? I see.

176
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,106
That means
handing it out

177
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,447
like Halloween candy
to a bunch of grifters

a day's work in their lives?

Come on, Margaret.

to be an ex-convict

What is it?

188
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,441
A man. I just saw a man

189
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,506
running from
the Caldwell house.

Yeah.

All the lights are on
over there.

I don't like
the looks of that.

194

I don't see anyone.

195
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,688
Uh, do you think the man
could have been Hugh?

196
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,926
No, no, I left Hugh
at the club.

197

Uh, I just saw a man,

running from a house

Positive.
Look again.

Just her jewelry.

He never went
near the paintings

nor the silverware.

231
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,432
There's a vase
out there worth
a couple of thousand dollars.

232
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,626
He never touched that.

233
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,328

Thank you very much

on what's happened.

around her neck.

Certainly is.

What do you figure happened?

256
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,717
Looks like she was getting
ready to hit the sack.

257
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,191
Probably heard the guy
down here,

258
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,727

what was goin' on.

like a hero, right?

Not too long.

263
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,728

324
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,069
I got the stuff at my joint
from the other night.

325
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,766
(Sharkey)
Are you kiddin'?

326
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,206
I wouldn't touch
any of it.

327
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,209
Not after
what happened last night.

328
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,539
Killin' that woman?

329
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,807
Are you crazy?
That wasn't me.

330
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,345
Come on, you've been hittin'
that neighborhood pretty good.

331
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,552
The other joints, sure.

332
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,454
But the one last night,
that wasn't me.

333
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,550
[Laughs]

334
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,118
Okay, have it your way.

335
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,731
But I can't
handle your goods.

336
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,696
Not with the kind of heat
I'll be getting.

337
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,667
I should've known better

338
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,438
than to deal with a punk
like you.

339
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:02,379
Johnny Romano, Carlos Vera,
they were men.

340
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,076
Yeah, but they're dead.

341
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,881
Times change.

342
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,412
It's tougher
on the outside now.

343
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,817
[Laughs]

344
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,786
You know, you spent so much
time up in that prison,

345
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,192
you don't know
how it is any more.

346
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,638
You all through? Come on,
let's get those tickets.

347
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,340
I wanna sit real close.

348
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,377
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Come on.

Come on. Come on. Let's go.

350
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,222
Come on. You can walk faster.

351
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,612
Come on.

352
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,680
Will you shut up?

353
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,555
Commissioner, specifically
what steps are you taking

354
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,462
to offset this rash of crime
in the Bel Air area?

355
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,193
Well, I've ordered
a double shift

356
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,996
on all squad cars,

357
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,469
sunset-to-sunrise
helicopter patrol.

358
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,766
As a matter of fact,
I plan

359
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,364
to be in that chopper
myself tonight

360
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,966
to get a firsthand look
at this operation.

361
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:08,177
We're going to get this man,
and we're gonna get him soon.

362
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,181
Whoever he is,
wherever he is,

363
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,116
he's not going to be able
to escape detection
indefinitely.

364
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,610
Now, last night
he made his first mistake.

365
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,384
My wife and I
were in our bedroom

366
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,015
when he ran
from the Caldwell house.

367
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,151
Well, he's gonna make
other mistakes.

368
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,423
When he does,
we'll get him,

369
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,889
and we'll hit him with
a first-degree-murder charge

370
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,331
that will stick.

371
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:30,866
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

372
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,028
Now, If you'll excuse me...

373
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,095
Does that mean your wife
can identify this man

374
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,435
as well as yourself?

375
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,204
Sir, sir, can your wife
identify this man?

Oh, I'm sorry.

What happened?

00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:23,849
I tore my...

On the cactus, I...

Oh, I'm sorry.

It was very clumsy
of me.

No, no,
it was my fault, ma'am.
I frightened you.

388
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,393
I'm sorry about that.

389
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,824
L... I know you, don't I?

Yes, ma'am, you do.

391

L... I was afraid
you'd remember.

392
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,333
It was at the
chief inspector's dinner

393
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,396
last year at the hotel.

394
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,635
I was a little drunk.

Oh, isn't it perfectly awful?

396
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,814
Janice Caldwell
had so much to give.

397
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,215
I'm sure she'd have
found her way.

398
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:54,784
Yes, ma'am.

399
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,481
That's what I wanted
to ask you about.

400
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,217
You being close friends
and all.

401
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,859
Several people
have told me

402
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,122
that she
and her husband were, um...

403
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,625
Well, that is,
that she...

404
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,594
Well, they were
having problems.

405
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,066
Was she seeing
other men?

406
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,466
Is that what
you wanted to know?

407
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:12,595
Uh, yes, ma'am.

408
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,502
Surely that can't
make any difference now.

409
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,541
Probably not,
but I'd appreciate it

410
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,042
if you could
give me a few names.

411
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,602
I'm sorry. I never pried into
Janice's personal affairs.

412
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:27,414
Once, last year,
I, I did try talking to her.

413
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,787
She became very defensive,
almost violent.

414
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,717
Then she was
seeing other men?

415
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:34,918
Yes.

416
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,419
Young men, I believe.

Thank you, ma'am.
You've been very helpful.

Uh, Mrs. Halperin,
one other thing.

419
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,805
Last night, the burglar...

420
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,772
Your husband gave us
a description.

421
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,743
He saw him running
from the Caldwell house.

422
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,802
Yes, from our bedroom window.

423
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,041
Now, I understand
you were also in the bedroom.

424
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,584
So, I would like to check
your description with his.

425
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,653
Oh, l... I didn't see him.

426
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,219
By the time I got
to the terrace, he had gone.

427
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,381
You weren't at the window?

428
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,556
No.

429
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,853
Where were you?

430
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,054
Well, I was in bed,
and then I went to the window.

431

Oh.

a couple of drinks. I left.

483
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,693
Now, she didn't get ready
for bed

484
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,492
until I called her
around 10:30.

485
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,965
At the club?

486
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,627
They found you
at the bar

487
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,432
when the police
finally located you.

488
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,165
That's right, Lieutenant.

489
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,333
Look, Janice apparently
went upstairs to change.

490
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,308
She put on her nightgown,
heard a noise,

491
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,743
came down,
and surprised this burglar.

492
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,104
I mean,

493
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,583
I should think the facts
would speak for themselves.

494
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,051
It's very strange.

495
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,152
See, there's one thing

496
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,587
that's very strange.

497
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,293
And what's that, Lieutenant?

498
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,959
Mrs. Fernandez
dusted the whole house.

499
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,898
Wax, polish, everything.

500
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,406
Including the bedroom.

501
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:18,101
Now, the fingerprint people,
they checked the handle

502
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,700
on the closet door.

503
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,677
Your wife's prints
weren't on it.

504
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,909
What I can't figure out
is how did she open the door

505
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,782
and take out the nightgown

506
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,754
without leaving any prints?

507
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,452
That's very simple,
Lieutenant.

508
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,758
You see, my wife was in the
habit of folding her nightgown

509
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,387
every morning when she got up

510
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,489
and putting it
under her pillow.

511
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,936
Don't you see? She had
no reason to go to the closet.

512
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,502
Yes. Yes. I see. Yes.

513
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,569
That would explain it.
Yes, it certainly would.

514
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,880
Well, thank you.

515
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,882
No, not at all, Lieutenant.

Excuse me, sir? Sir?

520
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,198
Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am!

521
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,392
You got some jumpers
for a battery?

522
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,158
No.

523
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,597
Listen, there's
a gas station up ahead.

524
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,161
Would you drive me
over there?

525
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,570
Thank you.

526
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,252
Columbo?

527
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,697
Excuse me, sir.
I didn't mean to barge in.

528
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,994
I looked for your secretary.

529
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,764
I guess she's powdering
her nose or something.

530
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,334
May I, uh...

531
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,371
I would've been here earlier,
but my car broke down again.

532
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,007
I had some more trouble.
They're telling me
it's the generator...

533
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,779
If you don't mind, Lieutenant,
I'm in something of a hurry.

534
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,683
I'm making real progress.
So, I thought...

535
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,483
Finish your report?

536
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,713
No, I haven't.

537
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,350
Well, finish the report
and I'll read it.

538
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:32,190
Right now, I've gotta get home
and get something to eat.

539
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,027
I'm on that
chopper patrol tonight.

540
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,396
I understand, sir.

541
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,334
Just take a minute.
I know you're in a hurry.

542
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,668
Before I actually
fill out the report,

543
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,138
if I could

544
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,402
just double-check that
description that you had...

545
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,807
It was hardly a description.

546
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,811
I barely got a glimpse of him.

547
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,241
Right.

548
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,276
You did say, uh,

549
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,478
dark sweater.

550
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:54,678
(Mark)
That's right.

551
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,050
Dark pants.

552
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,081
And some kind of cap.

553
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,783
And a dark cap.

554
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,193
Dark cap.

555
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,717
Dark...

556
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,956
That's it, then. Just dark?

557
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,929
It was night, Lieutenant.

558
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,935
And I was a long way away.

559
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,364
Uh, that's too bad.

560
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,767
That's what your wife said.

561
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,481
You spoke to my wife,
did you?

562
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,041
I thought you left.

563
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,719
What was that you said?

564
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,346
I say, you spoke
to my wife.

565
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,084
Yes, there's nothing wrong?

566
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,648
No. Certainly not.

567
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,926
No, you know, you see,

568
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,121
it was just that

569
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,221
on the basis of the
news conference this morning,

570
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,630
I thought that
she also saw the burglar.

571
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,602
That's ridiculous.
He was gone

572
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,160
by the time
she got to the terrace.

573
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,366
Yes, sir.
That's what she said.

574
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,774
But you certainly
gave that impression,
so I thought...

575
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,402
Look, Lieutenant,
if you don't mind,

576
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,413
I've got to go now,
my limousine is waiting.

577
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,039
There are a couple
of other things...

578
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,845
Give my secretary a call
in the morning,

579
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,977
I'll try to find
some time for you.

580

Oh, Mark,
you frightened me.

What are you
doing home so early?

582
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,945
Oh, I thought I'd get
an early supper.

583
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,513
Please leave the room,
darling.

to bathe in private.

I'll only be a minute.

590
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,726
that our marriage has been
a constant joy to me?

No, you haven't.

Well, it has.

that appealed to me

595
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,608
about you, Margaret,

596
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,554
was your... your generosity,

the notorious Bel Air Burglar

Now, I left some clothes
in a pile by the front door.

645
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,201
Here's what I want you to do.

646
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,266
[Helicopter whirring]

647
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,988
This is Chopper One.
This is Chopper One.

648
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,546
Baker Seven, do you read me?
Over.

649
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,394
(patrolman)
This is Baker Seven.

650
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:41,894
We see you, Chopper One.

651
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,992
Okay, we're heading east.

652
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,932
10-4.

653
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,891
A little early in the evening
for this burglar, isn't it,
Commissioner?

654
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,729
You never know, Pete.

655
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,201
Clocks don't mean a thing
in an empty house, you know.

656
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,206
Yeah, except last night
the house wasn't empty.

657
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,950
That's funny.

658
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,427
What is it?

659
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,861
That's my house down there.

660
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,228
And I saw someone
lurking near my wife's car.

661
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:55,896
He' s disappeared.

662
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:57,441
Circle around here, Pete,
will you?

663
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,532
Yes, sir.

664
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,780
My God, Margaret.
Hover over the pool.

665
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,412
I'm gonna try to get out.

666
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,514
Yes, sir.

667
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:03,772
Help me! Quick!
Please, for God's sake!

668
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,285
What are you waiting for?

669
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,191
Get an ambulance
for God's sake.

670
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,820
Margaret. Margaret.

671
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,592
My God, Margaret.

672
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,894
She's gone, sir.

673
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:33,301
What do you mean?
You're crazy.

674
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,535
She's gonna be all right.
Get an ambulance!

675
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,665
Margaret.

676
00:44:57,729 --> 00:45:01,688
Lieutenant, I just heard.
Terrible.

677
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,233
The Commissioner,
how's he holding up?

678
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,633
They got him
in the kitchen.

679
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,500
They're putting some
dry clothes on him now.

680
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,472
It's not too bad,
I tell you.

681
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,198
The burglar, huh?

682
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,300
Yeah. It's funny, though.
Very funny.

683
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,571
What?

684
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,613
There's no sign
that he forced his way

685
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,978
into the house.

686
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:19,947
As near as
we can figure it,

687
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,076
he was laying for her,
out in the back by the car.

688
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,211
(Randall)
Lieutenant!

689
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,311
Excuse me, Columbo.

690
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,117
Lt. Duffy, sir.
Yes, sir.

691
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:32,996
(Doyle)
Just keep circling around.

692
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,191
He's got to be
around here somewhere.

693
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,062
Yeah, well, keep looking.
That's right.

694
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,407
(Columbo)
What happened, Doc?

695
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,036
See for yourself, Columbo.
She drowned.

696
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,411
In a pool?

697
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,982
Guy tossed her
in a pool?

698
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:54,277
That's it.

699
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,782
Wonder why
she didn't swim?

700
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,481
Probably couldn't swim.

701
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,186
Well, maybe
she passed out, Lieutenant.

702
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,749
What are we gonna do?

703
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,187
He didn't hit her first?
No marks? No struggle?

704
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,754
There might've been
a struggle.
She gotta tear on her sleeve.

705
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:08,856
(officer)
Hey, Doyle?

706
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,025
Yeah. Yeah.

707
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,059
No, that happened
this afternoon.

708
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,536
She tore it on a cactus bush.
I was there when it happened.

709
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,470
(officer)
This guy just pulled up
out front.

710
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,008
(Al)
I've come to see Ms. Halperin.

711
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,099
(officer)
What about?

712
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:21,509
Well, she was supposed to come
to our meeting tonight

713
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:23,342
and get an award,
that's all.

714
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:24,881
The way things
look around here,

715
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,211
I'd like to get out of here.

716
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,911
What did you say?
A meeting?

717
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,714
She was supposed
to get an award?

718
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,220
Yeah, Holcombe House.

719
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,586
Gonna have dinner
at 8:00.

720
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:34,318
And she was gonna
make a little speech

721
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:35,882
and pick up her trophy.

722
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,019
I called her house
when she didn't show.

723
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,495
Line was always busy,
so I came over.

724
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,123
She was supposed to have
dinner with you at 8:00

725
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,566
and make a speech?

726
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,695
That's where she was going
when the guy jumped her.

727
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,672
Where were you
at 7:30?

728
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,833
I was at the place,
settin' up.

729
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:54,977
Relax, huh.
You're making me nervous.

730
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:57,007
You can prove it,
right?

731
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,273
Prove it?
Yeah. I can prove it.

732
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,942
I'll bet you can.

733
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,412
All right, Doyle.

734
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,613
Take this gentleman's name
and let him go.

735
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,352
Don't talk to me
about manpower allocations!

736
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:13,124
Now, this man killed my wife
and I want him!

737
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,189
Now, you get three units
over here

738
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:17,166
and get them over fast.

739
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:19,829
You're gonna answer to me
in the morning.

740
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,429
Excuse me, Commissioner,

741
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,302
I just want to tell you
how badly I feel.

742
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,069
And if there's anything
that I can do...

743
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,439
No, no, thank you.

744
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,070
Mark, I want you
to take those pills...

745
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,078
What?

746
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,172
I want you to take
the pills that I gave you...

747
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,343
All right,
I'll take the pills.

748
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,382
I'm shocked.

749
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,984
Terribly shocking.

750
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,785
The man is obviously insane.

751
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:47,253
I mean, to come back here
and do this...

752
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,993
Particularly after
the news broadcast

753
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,058
when you told them
about the increased patrols...

754
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:54,730
Don't you see?
It was the news broadcast
that killed her.

755
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,136
It was my fault.

756
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:57,805
I don't follow, sir.

757
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,002
You mentioned it
this afternoon,

758
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:04,777
that stupid slip of the tongue
that I made when I said

759
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,210
that Margaret and I
were in our bedroom

760
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,617
when the man ran
from the Caldwell house.

761
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:12,315
He must have thought
she could identify him.

762
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,781
That's the reason
he came back.

763
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,350
Not to steal anything
but to silence her.

764
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,892
[Mark crying]

765
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,863
Yes, that is a possibility.

766
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,699
The tragedy is,
she never saw him.

767
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,404
She couldn't identify him.

768
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,101
You mustn't
blame yourself, sir.

769
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,612
He threw her
in the pool.

770
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:42,250
She drowned
before I could reach her.

771
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,015
He threw her in the pool?

772
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:46,722
Are you sure of that, sir?

773
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,825
Of course, I'm sure of it.
I was a witness.

774
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,691
Pete Hayley and I were
in the helicopter

775
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,059
and we saw
the whole thing.

776
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,927
Then you had
the light on?

777
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,306
L... I thought
I saw something.

778
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,703
It was kind of a gut feeling,
I suppose.

779
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:10,404
I told him to go back

780
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,442
and to hover
over the patio area.

781
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,350
I switched on the lights,
and there he was.

782
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:19,420
The same man
holding Margaret in his arms.

783
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,515
Are you sure
it was the same man?

784
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,350
Well, assumedly...

785
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,927
Yes, he was
wearing the same clothes.

786
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:29,125
I see.

787
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,736
You must have a lot of those.

788
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,998
What?

789
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:36,938
Gut feelings.

790
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:38,702
What are you talking about?

791
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:40,676
Well, you had a gut feeling
last night.

792
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,845
I don't know
what you're talking about.
What do you mean?

793
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,211
When you asked for me
to report

794
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,306
to the Caldwell house.

795
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:47,316
Yes.

796
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:49,979
I found out you asked for me
when you first called in.

797
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,021
I did.

798
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,453
What I mean, sir, is that

799
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,255
the burglar had never harmed
anybody before,

800
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,460
yet from your bedroom window

801
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,096
when you called in,
you asked for me.

802
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,533
I was just trying
to figure out how you knew

803
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,432
that the woman
was already dead.

804
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,301
I didn't.
Didn't know, obviously.

805
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,971
Well, l... I did have
some kind of a feeling.

806
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:15,012
I sensed something was wrong.

807
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,109
Well, the lights were on,
for one thing.

808
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,546
The man running
from the house,

809
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,641
the fact that Janice
was there alone, I...

810
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,516
You're a policeman,
I don't have to explain
these things.

811
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,612
Yes, I know exactly
what you feel.

812
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,088
I've had that feeling
many times.

813
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,092
You know something is wrong,

814
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,094
you just can't
get a handle on it.

815
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,151
All right, sir.

816
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,857
I'm going to look
around the house

817
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:38,095
if it's all right with you.
Maybe the man got careless.

818
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,164
Columbo.

819
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:45,369
[Sniffling]

820
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,871
Yeah, go ahead.

821
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,231
What's the matter, Columbo?

822
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:17,171
You think he's hiding
in the tub there?

823
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,640
(Columbo)
Just checkin'.

824
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,506
Yeah? What did you find?

825
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,437
(Columbo)
Clean and dry.

826
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,905
Clean and dry.

827
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:28,947
Let me ask you somethin'.

828
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,788
How do you
figure this guy?

829
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,320
I mean, to me,

830
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,689
a burglar is like
a hungry alley cat.

831
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,254
He sneaks around
after dark,

832
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,490
but if he hears somethin',
he runs.

833
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,700
Haven't you ever heard
of future shock?

834
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,429
The world's going
to hell with itself.

835
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:48,972
Believe me, Columbo.
Times have changed.

836
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,429
Yeah.

837
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,097
Maybe.

838
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,470
But still.

839
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,611
But still,
you know what bothers me

840
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:01,480
about the murder last night?

841
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,452
You mean
the Caldwell woman?

842
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:05,548
Yeah.

843
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:14,322
I, uh, I looked
at her body.

844
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,493
Right away I saw
on her finger

845
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:20,196
the biggest diamond ring
I ever saw in my life.

846
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:22,603
Now, I gotta ask
myself this question.

847
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:24,664
What kind of a burglar
robs a house

848
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:27,302
and leaves a ring like that
on the victim's finger?

849
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,276
So that's what's
been buggin' you?

850
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:32,440
You're something else.

851
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,179
Don't you think
we thought of that?

852
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,651
It's a phony.

853
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,989
The ring was phony?

854
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,723
Solid glass.
A piece of garbage.

855
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:45,455
A pro would have
spotted it a mile away,

856
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,292
and this guy's a pro.

857
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,827
Excuse me, one moment,
will you?

858
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,918
Yeah, I guess
that explains it.

859
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,783
See, here I am,

860
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,158
I've been
batting my brains out

861
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,755
trying to figure out
about that ring

862
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,959
and you guys had it
all the time.

863
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,160
Glass.

864
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,594
How do you like that?

865
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:50,824
Listen, Doc, do me a favor.
Would you?

866
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,122
When you perform
the autopsy,

867
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,323
would you check
something for me?

868
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:58,792
This woman apparently drowned
in the swimming pool,

869
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,738
so when you
check her lungs,

870
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,939
see if there's any evidence
of chlorine.

871
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:06,271
There won't be.

872
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:09,405
Chorine dissipates
almost immediately
in the human body.

873
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,038
Anyway, the fluids
would be masked

874
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:13,276
by the effects
of pulmonary edema.

875
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:19,718
So, uh, does that mean
that you couldn't tell
if this woman drowned, say,

876
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,580
in a bathtub...

877
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,960
Sure, if the bathtub
were full of gin.

878
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:29,557
Well, check it anyway,
would you?

879
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,360
It's part of the job.

880
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,294
[Engine starting]

881
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,282
[Buzzing]

882
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,648
Yes?

883
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,826
<i>(woman)
Lt. Columbo, sir.</i>

884
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,722
All right, send him in.

885
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,900
I hope I'm not
disturbing you, sir.

886
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,970
No, it's all right.
Come in.

887
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,343
This is none of my business.
Stop me if I'm out of line,

888
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,550
but nobody expected you to be
at your desk today.

889
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:26,889
I want to be here,
Lieutenant.

890
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:31,654
I want to keep working,
keep my mind off...

891
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:37,723
All right, let's see.

892
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,428
Uh, here's, ahem,

893
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:42,332
here's
Lieutenant Duffy's report.

894
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:44,296
There's no question,

895
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,639
it's the Bel Air Burglar,
all right.

896
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:49,806
It's too bad he got away
last night without a trace.

897
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,512
Oh, and speaking of reports...

898
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,483
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

899
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,451
I'm making terrific progress,

900
00:55:58,722 --> 00:55:59,882
but, you see, I don't think

901
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,424
we should be
looking for a burglar.

902
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:02,424
What?

903
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:03,551
No, sir.

904
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:05,492
I think we should be
looking for someone

905
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,587
who made it seem
like a burglary.

906
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,622
What are you
talking about, Columbo?

907
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,463
Here, read Duffy's report.

908
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:12,593
It shows very clearly

909
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,432
it's the same man
we've been looking for.

910
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,871
I'm sure this is
a very good report, sir,

911
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,675
but there are a couple
of things that don't add up.

912
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,005
Like what?

913
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:23,137
Oh, for one thing,
the fingerprints.

914
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,239
Come on, come on, Columbo,
there were no fingerprints.

915
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,045
That's what I mean, sir.

916
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:32,517
You see, Mr. Caldwell
left the house around 9:00.

917
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,486
He called his wife at 10:30
from the bar at the club.

918
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:40,160
This is what bothers me, sir.

919
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:45,268
If Mrs. Caldwell spoke
to her husband on the phone,

920
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,599
why didn't she leave
any fingerprints on the phone?

921
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:50,503
Now that's strange,
isn't it?

922
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,737
The maid spent
the whole day cleaning,

923
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:56,211
she dusted everything.

924
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,872
Including the phones.

925
00:56:58,215 --> 00:56:59,705
The phone
in the upstairs bedroom,

926
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,512
that's absolutely clean.

927
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:04,786
The one downstairs has
Mr. Caldwell's prints on it,

928
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,951
but it doesn't have
Mrs. Caldwell's prints.

929
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,050
All right,
what are you implying?

930
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,961
That Caldwell never actually
talked to his wife?

931
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:15,691
Did it ever occur to you

932
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,791
that maybe the burglar
used the phone after she did

933
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,630
and then wiped it clean?

934
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,939
Occur to me that the burglar
used the phone after
and wiped it clean?

935
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,297
Yeah.

936
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,306
No, sir.

937
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,433
Why not?

938
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,842
Well, because the burglar
had to wear gloves.

939
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:29,901
You see, sir,

940
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,108
There were no prints of his
anywhere in the house.

941
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,777
Now there's another thing
that's very strange.

942
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,621
Is this bothering you?

943
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:39,781
No.

944
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:41,780
Um...

945
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,422
Excuse me.

946
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:48,888
There's something else.

947
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,435
The way this woman's body
was dressed in that nightgown.

948
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:54,027
She didn't do that.

949
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:57,200
Somebody else dressed her
in that nightgown.

950
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,205
Is that a fact, Lieutenant?

951
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,942
Or just some more
of your fancy guesswork?

952
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:04,373
Well, you see, sir,

953
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,712
she was wearing
a pale blue nightgown

954
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,876
which she got
from her closet.

955
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,613
And you know something?

956
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:12,822
There were no prints
on the handle

957
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,790
of the closet door either.

958
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,961
I don't see what
you're getting at.

959
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:20,326
Unless you're trying
to tell me

960
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:23,025
that Caldwell killed his wife
and then faked
the whole thing?

961
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,001
Oh, no, sir. No. I don't mean
that at all. No, no.

962
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,032
No. You see,

963
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:32,200
Mrs. Caldwell, she had a habit

964
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,737
whereby she would
put her nightgown

965
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,711
under the pillow
every morning.

966
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:39,815
I saw a pink nightgown
under the pillow.

967
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,978
So, of course,
we know that Mrs. Caldwell

968
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:45,578
would not have put on
the blue nightgown.

969
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,624
Now,
here's what's interesting.

970
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:50,760
Mr. Caldwell,

971
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,591
he knew about the nightgown
under the pillow.

972
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:56,058
So if he had dressed
his wife's body,

973
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,000
that would be the first place
that he would have looked.

974
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,663
No, sir,

975
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,396
we're looking
for somebody else.

976
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,709
We're looking for somebody...

977
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,815
somebody who tried to make
a murder look like a burglary.

978
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,813
Like who, for instance?

979
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:21,154
Well, sir,

980
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:25,227
I don't like to speak badly
of the dead,

981
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,123
but,

982
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,089
yesterday,
your wife confirmed to me

983
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,727
that Mrs. Caldwell
was seeing other men.

984
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:36,371
And you think
it was one of them?

985
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,005
Yes, sir.
I think that's a possibility.

986
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:43,142
All right,
now listen to me, Lieutenant,

987
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:45,681
you're wasting your time
and my time

988
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:48,718
and the department's time
and it's gonna stop. Now,

989
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,889
look, Columbo,

990
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,555
you must understand
that no one,

991
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:04,499
no one wants this man caught
any more than I do.

992
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:06,931
Especially now.

993
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,834
But we are looking
for a burglar,

994
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,805
a man who killed
one woman out of fear,

995
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,809
who killed another
to silence her.

996
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,435
You go on that basis

997
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:17,878
and we're going to solve
this case. Is that clear?

998
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,472
You don't think that

999
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,607
I have anything here?

1000
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:26,179
Lieutenant, nobody can
be right all the time.

1001
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:29,885
Look for your burglar.
There's the killer.

1002

1004
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,482
Excuse me, uh,

1005
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,325
Mr. Wexler?

1006
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,323
He's inside with a customer
for the moment.

1007
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,297
Oh, thank you.

1008
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:45,625
We can smoke here?

1009
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,726
Yes.

1010
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,852
May I help you, sir?

1011
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,619
No, thank you very much.

1012
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:10,717
No, I am waiting
for Mr. Wexler.

1013
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,822
Mr. Wexler is servicing
a client at the moment.

1014
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,626
If there's anything
I can do...

1015
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:16,927
No, thank you.

1016
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:23,599
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.
Do you happen to...

1017
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,334
Do you sell watchbands?

1018
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,739
Of course.

1019
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,202
I broke this
a couple of weeks ago.

1020
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,542
I've been
carrying it with me.

1021
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:33,981
This is a very good watch,
only five years old.

1022
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,813
Waterproof and shockproof.

1023
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:37,683
Do you have something
for that?

1024
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,743
Oh.

1025
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,422
Seven jewels.

1026
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,421
We have a large selection,
sir, starting at $25.

1027
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,823
No, I don't want a watch,
just the band.

1028
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,833
That is for just the band.

1029
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:53,898
No kidding.

1030
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,295
I think I'll do it
some other time,

1031
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,806
thanks a lot.

1032
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,743
Oh, uh,
Mr. Wexler is free now,

1033
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:02,369
if you'd care to see him.

1034
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,673
Thank you.

1035
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:12,480
Mr. Wexler?

1036
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:14,217
(Wexler)
I'm Bruno Wexler, yes.

1037
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,657
Lieutenant Columbo.
If you can spare a moment,

1038
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:17,988
it's about Mrs. Caldwell.

1039
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,824
I believe she shopped here
in your store.

1040
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,989
Mrs. Caldwell was
a valued client, yes.

1041
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:24,431
Yes. That's what
I understood, sir,

1042
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:26,401
from going
through her papers.

1043
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:30,036
Mostly receipts for jewelry
that she bought here.

1044
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,968
Of course,
that was some time ago.

1045
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:35,645
The most recent receipt
that I found

1046
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:37,509
was dated six months ago,
September.

1047
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,606
Well, I would have
to check back.

1048
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,178
Um, of course, she came
in here quite a few times

1049
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:46,813
since then, didn't she?

1050
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,722
I mean, even though
she didn't buy anything.

1051
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,658
I've talked to a few people,

1052
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:54,188
friends, the maid...

1053
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,459
Lieutenant, could you
get to the point?

1054
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,792
May I sit down?

1055
01:03:57,868 --> 01:03:59,165
Of course.

1056
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,403
This is the point, sir.

1057
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,046
Yes?

1058
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,047
It's glass.

1059
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,549
I can see that it's glass.

1060
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,010
But this appraisal
for $8,000

1061
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,815
for a 3.6- Carat,
pear-shaped diamond ring

1062
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:25,987
with tapered baguettes
in a four-prong setting.

1063
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,189
This appraisal
is for that ring, isn't it?

1064
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:30,756
Well, I never would have
charged Mrs. Caldwell $8,000

1065
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:32,233
for a piece of glass.

1066
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:33,901
But that is your work,
isn't it?

1067
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,267
Yes, Lieutenant.

1068
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,234
I arranged with a friend
to have this copied

1069
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,332
for Mrs. Caldwell

1070
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:40,933
so that her husband
wouldn't realize

1071
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:43,138
that she had sold
the original back to me.

1072
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:46,182
As a matter of fact, she sold
a lot of jewelry back to you.

1073
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,307
The woman needed money.

1074
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,215
Her husband had
cut off her funds.

1075
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,618
Then all the jewelry
in her house was phony.

1076
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:53,451
Almost all of it. Yes.

1077
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,949
Why did she need the money?

1078
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:59,085
Really, Lieutenant...

1079
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:02,094
I understood she had
a lot of boyfriends.

1080
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:05,498
Well, Mrs. Caldwell
was beautiful and charming

1081
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,092
for a woman of 36.

1082
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:10,640
But she fancied that she was
growing old very slowly.

1083
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,334
In fact, hardly at all

1084
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,906
to judge by the young men

1085
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:17,071
from whom
she found companionship.

1086
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:40,427
Yes, indeed.

1087
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,500
That's a real honey.

1088
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:47,034
You know, we don't get to see
many of these around anymore.

1089
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,634
Especially in this condition.

1090
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:50,407
Well, I try to take
good care of it.

1091
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,277
I'm looking
for a Mr. Shoup.

1092
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:53,880
I'm Mr. Shoup.

1093
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,208
Charlie Shoup.

1094
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,752
My name is Columbo.

1095
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,912
How many miles
you got on it, Mr. Columbo?

1096
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,754
20,000? 30,000 tops.

1097
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:04,817
Oh, I got over 100,000 miles
on this car.

1098
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:06,225
100,000?

1099
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,359
That's pretty hard
to believe.

1100
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,763
Well, look, I don't care
what the speedometer says,

1101
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,734
I'm gonna make you an offer
on a trade-in

1102
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,963
that you just won't be able
to turn down.

1103
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:18,702
Police?
Look, I just work here.

1104
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,966
The stuff they pull up
in the business office

1105
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,033
is none of my doing.

1106
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:24,342
You got a beef?
Go see the boss.

1107
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:28,983
Good-lookin' watch.

1108
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:30,212
Thanks.

1109
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,151
I'm here to talk about
a Janice Caldwell.

1110
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,793
Did she give you
that watch?

1111
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:41,157
Janice Caldwell was a friend
of mine, Lieutenant.

1112
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:43,062
Where were you
Tuesday evening, Mr. Shoup,

1113
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,260
between 9:00 and midnight?

1114
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,030
That was the night
Janice was killed?

1115
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,536
Tuesday evening.

1116
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:51,437
I was right here until 9:30,
that's when we close up.

1117
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,271
As a matter of fact,
Janice was supposed

1118
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,810
to pick me up.

1119
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,277
When she didn't show up,

1120
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,679
I gave her a call
at her place,
but there was no answer.

1121
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,512
Figured I'd been stood up.
So l...

1122
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,611
There was no answer?

1123
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,620
No, sir.

1124
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,883
What time?

1125
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,423
Around 9:30.

1126
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,550
Go on.

1127
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:13,289
Well, like I said, I figured
I'd been stood up.

1128
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,627
So I went out with a little
bookkeeper we got here,

1129
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,495
had a couple of drinks
across the street,

1130
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:18,591
went back to my place.

1131
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:20,260
You can substantiate that?

1132
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,270
She's right inside,
Lieutenant.

1133
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,072
Ask for Shirley.

1134
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,566
That won't be necessary.
Thank you very much.

1135
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:28,440
You've been very helpful.

1136
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,546
Lieutenant?

1137
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,420
I'll give you $80
for it in a trade.

1138
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,284
[Doorbell ringing]

1139
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:51,557
Excuse me, Commissioner.
I'm sorry to bother you
at home...

1140
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,158
It's all right.
Come in, Lieutenant.

1141
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,601
Thank you, sir.

1142
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:57,770
I know I was supposed
to have the report at 6:00.

1143
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,331
Let me tell you
what happened.

1144
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,138
My car
let me down again.

1145
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:03,076
They let me
use another one.

1146
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:06,113
Well?

1147
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,171
Well, what?

1148
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,479
Where is it,
the report?

1149
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:10,948
That's the problem.

1150
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,783
I sat down in front
of the typewriter

1151
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:14,619
and nothing happened.
Absolutely nothing.

1152
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:16,352
Look, Columbo,
I'm a little bit tired.

1153
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,087
If you've come in here
to bombard me

1154
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,685
with more
of your screwball ideas...

1155
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,059
May I explain the problem,
sir?

1156
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:22,530
Just give me a moment.

1157
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,089
You've had
a lot of experience.

1158
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:25,691
You happen
to know this woman

1159
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,360
Mrs. Caldwell.
She was your neighbor.

1160
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,667
I thought maybe you could
help me out with this thing.

1161
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:31,070
I'm trying
to figure it out.

1162
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:32,699
If you could just
give me a moment.

1163
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:33,764
All right. Come on.

1164
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,140
Thank you, sir.

1165
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,144
You want a cognac?

1166
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:46,351
No, thank you very much, sir.
I want to keep my head clear.

1167
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:48,418
This is complicated.

1168
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,557
See whether or not
you can help me with this.

1169
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,620
Janice Caldwell died
between 10:30 and 11:00.

1170
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,194
Sometime after her husband
spoke to her at 10:30

1171
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:01,933
and sometime before you saw
the burglar run out at 11:00.

1172
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:03,629
Right?

1173
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,134
That's correct.

1174
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,501
That's why
I can't start the report.

1175
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:09,545
Why?

1176
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,046
I get stuck in the beginning,
the time of death.

1177
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:13,946
What are you
talking about, Columbo?

1178
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:16,042
Janice Caldwell
had a boyfriend.

1179
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:17,950
She was supposed
to meet him at 9:30.

1180
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:20,489
That's an hour before
she was supposed to have died.

1181
01:09:20,557 --> 01:09:22,115
She never showed up.

1182
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,854
So she stood him up.
So what?

1183
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:27,556
Yeah, but the guy called her
around 9:30, too,

1184
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,393
and there was no answer
on the telephone.

1185
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,023
I have to ask myself
the question,

1186
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,261
why couldn't
she answer the phone?

1187
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:35,766
You know what I wrote down?

1188
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,447
"Maybe she was dead already."

1189
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,743
You follow my thinking?

1190
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:48,875
Maybe she just didn't
want to talk to the man.

1191
01:09:48,952 --> 01:09:50,044
Did that occur to you?

1192
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,552
But she answered
the phone later,

1193
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,179
when her husband called.

1194
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:54,553
You see the contradiction.

1195
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:57,422
If she didn't want to speak
to her boyfriend at 9:30,

1196
01:09:57,594 --> 01:10:00,085
why did she pick up
the phone at 10:30?

1197
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,923
But did she pick up
the phone at 10:30?

1198
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,799
Because her fingerprints
were not on the telephone.

1199
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,666
You see how confusing it gets.

1200
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,077
That's why I keep
going back to this.

1201
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,869
"Maybe she was dead already."

1202
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:21,644
'Cause if she's dead already,
that explains everything.

1203
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:25,778
That explains why she doesn't
pick up her boyfriend.

1204
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,619
That explains why
she doesn't answer the phone.

1205
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,591
And it explains
why her fingerprints

1206
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,389
aren't on the phone.

1207
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,292
Because if she was dead,

1208
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:36,956
her husband
never spoke to her.

1209
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,625
It was a fake call.

1210
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,029
I specifically asked you
this afternoon

1211
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:44,096
if you thought Caldwell
had killed his wife.

1212
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,663
And you said no,
for what I thought

1213
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,141
was a very good reason.

1214
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:49,041
Because he knew
about the folded nightgown

1215
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:50,306
under the pillow.

1216
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,438
I did say that, sir.

1217
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:53,414
But in the light of these
new developments,

1218
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:55,075
it occurred to me

1219
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:57,979
maybe he had an accomplice.

1220
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:02,814
Listen, why couldn't he go out
and hire somebody to run out

1221
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:05,690
of the house at 11:00,
pretend to be a burglar.

1222
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,730
Provide him with an alibi.

1223
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:10,732
[Snickering]
I see. I get it.

1224
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,290
The next thing, I suppose,

1225
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,165
that you're gonna
ask me to believe

1226
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:15,499
is this phantom accomplice,

1227
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,131
who never killed anybody
in the first place, of course,

1228
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,072
comes back the next night
to kill my wife.

1229
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:22,338
Is that right?
Is that the next step?

1230
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:25,440
You know, Columbo, I really...

1231
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,875
I really do admire
your enthusiasm.

1232
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,781
The force could use
a 100 like you.

1233
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,786
But this theory is a crock.

1234
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:34,913
(Columbo)
You think so, sir?

1235
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:37,084
We are looking for a murderer

1236
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,684
who was a burglar,

1237
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,922
who panicked
and killed two women.

1238
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,760
Now, that's the theory
we're gonna go on.

1239
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,823
Is that clear?
That's an order.

1240
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,096
Yes, sir.

1241
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,262
All right.

1242
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:50,135
Tomorrow morning,
I want you

1243
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:52,401
to report to Lt. Duffy
in the Robbery Division.

1244
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,340
I want you to concentrate
on his leads.

1245

A little legwork and
we'll have this man in a week,

I promise you.

Lieutenant Duffy.

1276
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,803
Oh, Columbo.

1277
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,402
I'm having some problems.

1278
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,970
Thought you would.

1279
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,414
I spoke to the Commissioner
last night.

1280
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,315
He suggested
that I report to you

1281
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:45,547
and maybe
we could work together.

1282
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,011
Well, it's nice to hear

1283
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,750
you have a little faith
in us.

1284
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:50,759
Come on inside, Columbo.

1285
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,823
[Typewriters clacking]

1286
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:57,328
I thought maybe
you could give me a line

1287
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,231
on some of the guys
that you spoke to.

1288
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:01,566
You know,
the most likely suspects.

1289
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,304
Take your pick.

1290
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:08,308
But I'll tell you something,
you won't find him in there.

1291
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:09,837
You sure?

1292
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,205
Columbo, these guys
are like old friends.

1293
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:15,778
Very placid
and predictable types.

1294
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,608
Now,

1295
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,386
what we're looking for
is a younger guy,

1296
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,424
a guy with a violent temper.

1297
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,024
Let me ask you something.

1298
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:28,120
Leave out
the last two murders.

1299
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,631
Just concentrate
on the first three robberies.

1300
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,928
If you had your choice,

1301
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,060
which of these guys
would you pick?

1302
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:37,969
That's easy.
The guy on top. Artie Jessup.

1303
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,969
Artie's always
my first choice

1304
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,840
when he's out
on the streets,

1305
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,641
which isn't too often.

1306
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:46,906
Take a look for yourself.

1307
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,747
In and out of the joint
since he was 20 years old.

1308
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:52,652
That's almost 30 years
of state hospitality,

1309
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:55,452
give or take a few vacations
on the outside.

1310
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:58,789
You know, I think
old Artie prefers prison life.

1311
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,090
He's very nervous out here
with us civilians.

1312
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,562
What about the M. O?

1313
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:05,665
Fits a lot of guys,
including Artie.

1314
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,036
We've already talked to him.
We can't hold him.

1315
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:10,231
Why not?

1316
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:13,104
Columbo, you said forget
about the murders, right?

1317
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:16,904
Artie has an alibi
for both nights.

1318
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:38,130
Mr. Jessup?

1319
01:15:41,604 --> 01:15:42,866
Do I know you?

1320
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:44,534
I stopped by your place.

1321
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,541
Your wife told me
you were here.

1322
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:47,837
My what?

1323
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:49,877
My wife.

1324
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:50,935
You got Scotch?

1325
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,275
Yes, sir.

1326
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:53,541
You like Scotch?

1327
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:54,605
She wishes.

1328
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,813
Give him some Scotch.

1329
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,787
Thought maybe
you could help me.

1330
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:18,337
Suppose I wanted
a few dollars for that.

1331
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:35,321
Where did you find it,
in a box of Cracker Jacks?

1332
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:36,380
[Clearing throat]

1333
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:37,790
It's not real.

1334
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,893
Come on, pal, what is this,
some kind of hustle?

1335
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,800
A cop.

1336
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,438
I must be getting old.

1337
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:00,242
I'm not from Robbery.

1338
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:02,048
I'm from Homicide.

1339
01:17:02,652 --> 01:17:05,917
I'm investigating the killing
of those two women in Bel Air.

1340
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:08,687
Oh, no.

1341
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,122
Oh, no.

1342
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,820
You're not going to hang
that one on me.

1343
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,160
No way! No way!

1344
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,861
Where's my jacket?

1345
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:21,828
You wanna book me,
go ahead, book me!

1346
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,371
Where's my jacket?

1347
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,397
You had nothin'
to do with it.

1348
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,203
Then what are you here for?

1349
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,439
I had nothing
to do with it.

1350
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:31,377
You wanna know
what I am here for?
Yeah.

1351
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:32,471
Gimme this.

1352
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:33,515
Sit down.

1353
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:34,606
I don't
wanna sit down.

1354
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:35,673
May I sit down?

1355
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:36,911
Go ahead.

1356
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:41,781
You had nothing
to do with it.

1357
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:49,061
Now, the guys down
at the Robbery detail

1358
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,360
they can't
identify the burglar

1359
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:53,368
that committed
those two murders.

1360
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,267
That's what
I'm here for.

1361
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,401
I can't help you.

1362
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,107
You haven't heard anything?

1363
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:06,841
Nothing.

1364
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,449
You're sure?

1365
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:15,480
Do you know I'm afraid
of Siamese cats?

1366
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,521
One meow
and I'm out of the door

1367
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:20,152
with my pockets empty.

1368
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,820
Oh, look, Lieutenant,

1369
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,296
that guy who killed
those women,

1370
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,332
he scares me.

1371
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,368
I mean,
he really scares me.

1372
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,297
Look, I'm a professional,

1373
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,169
we both know that, right?

1374
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,435
Otherwise you wouldn't
be down here.

1375
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,202
That guy
what killed those women,

1376
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,270
he gives guys like me
a bad name.

1377
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:40,406
Right.

1378
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,679
Look, Lieutenant,
if I knew who that guy was,

1379
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:46,278
you think I wouldn't have
called you guys
a long time ago?

1380
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:47,549
Right.

1381
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:53,654
Would you rob a thing
like this?

1382
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:55,789
Are you kidding?

1383
01:18:55,865 --> 01:18:57,833
They'd laugh me
off the cellblock.

1384
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,663
All right,
listen to me, Artie.

1385
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,762
I got a problem.
You can help me.

1386
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:03,964
Me?

1387
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:07,542
I think I know
who killed those two women.

1388
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:09,305
But I can't prove it.

1389
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:11,243
(man)
Hey, Artie,
it's your old lady.

1390
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,804
She says, get your tail home,
you're taking her shoppin'.

1391
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:15,544
Tell that bag to go...

1392
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:22,722
Tell her I'll be home
in a little while.

1393
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,321
You know
who killed those women?

1394
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:31,164
Come on, Hugh, make sense.
Who wants money?

1395
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,962
The man. The burglar.

1396
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,396
The one who's been robbing
all the houses around here.

1397
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:36,733
That's ridiculous.

1398
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:37,966
Mark, he's dead serious.

1399
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,372
He's ready to go to the police
if I don't pay him.

1400
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,137
But how does he know
you killed Janice?

1401
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,372
(Hugh)
I don't know. I don't know.

1402
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:46,745
The point is that he knows.

1403
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:51,111
I should've called the police
the moment it happened.

1404
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:53,348
You did call the police,
my friend.

1405
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:56,522
How much does he want?

1406
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,457
I don't know. I don't know.

1407
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:02,054
Said he'd tell me later today.

1408
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,293
When are you
supposed to meet him?

1409
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:07,999
Uh, 4:30.

1410
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,833
A bar at Fifth and Wall.

1411
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:26,247
All right, meet him.

1412
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,551
I'll be waiting nearby.

1413
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:31,087
Find out what he wants,

1414
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:35,256
and we'll decide how to...

1415
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,728
how to deal with him.

1416
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:48,073
All right, no violence.

1417
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,377
Why, Hugh,

1418
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,046
I'm no more violent
than you are.

1419
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,968
The cops are trying
to pin those robberies on me.

1420
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:52,139
But, you see, I didn't pull
that job in your joint.

1421
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,334
But I figure you know
that already, don't you?

1422
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,105
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1423
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:57,543
Don't hand me that.

1424
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,080
I figure you killed
your old lady

1425
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:00,547
and tried to pin it on me.

1426
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:02,243
Well, I got news
for you, pal,

1427
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:04,912
nobody makes Artie Jessup
a patsy, you got it?

1428
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:06,113
It's gonna cost you.

1429
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:07,621
You still haven't
given me proof.

1430
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,816
I don't need any proof.

1431
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:10,859
All I gotta do is go
to cops and confess

1432
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,450
to those first three robberies

1433
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:14,189
and, you know what,
all of a sudden,

1434
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,696
they look into the other two

1435
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,664
where the women were killed.

1436
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,962
Now, what do you think?

1437
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,764
I think they got you.

1438
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:26,198
Hey, I don't mind
one way or the other.

1439
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,675
Bein' on the outside
isn't all that great.

1440
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:30,845
All my buddies
are back there,

1441
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:32,744
so going back
on a burglary rap,

1442
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:35,306
I won't mind that a bit.
Now, come on.

1443
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,046
What's it going to be, pal?

1444
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,953
Do I go to the cops,
or do we work something out?

1445
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,491
All right.

1446
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:48,992
How much?

1447
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,189
Good.

1448
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:15,981
Well?

1449
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:19,186
He wants $5,000
in small bills. Old money.

1450
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,758
Nothing larger than a $50.

1451
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,389
$5,000, is that all?

1452
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,992
The man has no imagination.

1453
01:23:27,403 --> 01:23:28,927
When do you meet him?

1454
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,437
Tomorrow afternoon, here.

1455
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:31,495
Same time?

1456
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,667
Right. Now, Mark,
he's dead serious.

1457
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,208
He says he knows
your department

1458
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:38,269
has him under suspicion
for those other robberies,

1459
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,144
but that they can't
prove anything.

1460
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:42,012
He's not a stupid man.

1461
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:44,644
All right, now, I want you to
get the money from the bank.

1462
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:48,385
I want you to be here tomorrow
at the same time.

1463
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,152
Mark, we can't start
paying him.

1464
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,624
He's just gonna want more.

1465
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,285
Just leave him to me.

1466
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:55,822
You keep your mouth shut
and don't admit to anything.

1467
01:23:55,898 --> 01:23:57,729
We're gonna be just fine.

1468
01:23:58,467 --> 01:23:59,661
Both of us.

1469
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:37,262
Oh, Columbo.
What are you doing here?

1470
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:38,397
Oh, good morning, sir.

1471
01:24:38,474 --> 01:24:39,463
Good morning.

1472
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,305
Lt. Duffy is out on call.
I'm using his office.

1473
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,470
What's the matter
with your office?

1474
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,742
Well, I was going
through these file folders.

1475
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,943
These are the prime suspects
in the robberies

1476
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,384
and Duffy didn't want
the folders out of his office.

1477
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,012
I wanna tell you something.

1478
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,284
I'm doing it just exactly
the way you suggested.

1479
01:24:56,358 --> 01:24:58,849
I'm concentrating my efforts
on the robbery aspects

1480
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,986
of this crime,
and you're right.

1481
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:04,057
I think the answer lies
right in here somewhere.

1482
01:25:04,133 --> 01:25:05,259
Good.

1483
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:08,802
Good. Okay, well,
maybe I'll

1484
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:12,071
take a glance
at these myself again.

1485
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,638
I didn't get a very
good look at that man

1486
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,701
the night he ran
from the Caldwell house.

1487
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,245
Still you never know,
do you?

1488
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,507
That's a good thought.

1489
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:22,209
Sometimes something
just clicks into place.

1490
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:37,055
[Mark clicking tongue]

1491
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,156
Well, on the other hand,

1492
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,860
I've been through these
a dozen times.

1493
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:41,903
I don't think
they can help me any.

1494
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,403
That's a good thought,
too, sir.

1495
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,530
No sense wasting your time
on a dead end.

1496
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:47,074
(Mark)
You keep at it, though, huh?

1497
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,076
If you come up with anything,
let me know.

1498
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,153
[Billiard balls striking]

1499
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:09,399
Do you, uh...

1500
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,403
Do you mind?

1501
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,742
Be my guest.

1502
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:18,785
Easy. Easy.
Under the table.

1503
01:29:26,928 --> 01:29:28,225
Gonna count it?

1504
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,597
I trust you.

1505
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,330
If it's short,
you can always make it up

1506
01:29:34,403 --> 01:29:35,836
in the next payment.

1507
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,537
The next payment?

1508
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:39,374
You said...

1509
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:41,409
I said a lot of things,
Mr. Caldwell.

1510
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:44,538
One thing I forgot
to tell you was that...

1511
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:46,979
I'm a chronic liar.

1512
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,281
(Duffy)
Sure they're in there, sir?

1513
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:57,848
Positive.
Caldwell is meeting him

1514
01:29:57,926 --> 01:29:58,950
on my instructions.

1515
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:01,689
Catch this man Jessup
with the money,
we'll have our killer.

1516
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,098
(Duffy)
Okay?

1517
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:05,190
(policeman)
Okay.

1518
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,298
All right. Move.

1519
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:14,706
(Artie)
Take it easy.

1520
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,243
(officer)
You want it the hard way?

1521
01:30:16,311 --> 01:30:17,437
(Artie)
Take it easy!

1522
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:20,413
What are you trying to do,
break my head? What is this?

1523
01:30:20,482 --> 01:30:22,177
(Mark)
It's called blackmail, Jessup.

1524
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,615
First you rob
this man's house,

1525
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:25,118
you kill two women,

1526
01:30:25,187 --> 01:30:27,052
then you've got the gall
to try blackmail.

1527
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:28,589
Get out!
You don't have any proof.

1528
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:30,887
We'll have it. As soon as
we search your apartment.

1529
01:30:30,959 --> 01:30:32,426
Which we'll do right now.

1530
01:30:32,494 --> 01:30:35,054
Columbo, Duffy, come with me.
We'll need one squad car.

1531
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,495
Commissioner,
we need a warrant

1532
01:30:36,565 --> 01:30:38,123
before we can
search that apartment.

1533
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,725
We already got one.
You want to check it?

1534
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,868
Yes, sir, that's fine.

1535
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,500
I think
you're making a mistake.

1536
01:30:48,577 --> 01:30:49,805
I'll prove to you,
I'm not.

1537
01:30:49,878 --> 01:30:51,869
All right, take this man down
and book him.

1538
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,472
Mr. Caldwell will give you
his statement.

1539
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,344
Let's go.

1540
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,397
Commissioner, I believe

1541
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,025
you are making
a mistake here, sir. Sir.

1542
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:14,830
I don't believe
Jessup killed either

1543
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:16,632
of these women,
particularly your wife.

1544
01:31:16,705 --> 01:31:17,797
(Mark)
Don't be ridiculous.

1545
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:19,465
I saw it,
he threw her in the pool.

1546
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:21,372
There were other witnesses.

1547
01:31:21,443 --> 01:31:23,308
(Duffy)
Could you bring
the keys up, please?

1548
01:31:23,378 --> 01:31:24,743
Right away, huh?

1549
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,212
Sir.

1550
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,010
(Duffy)
He's on his way up,
Commissioner.

1551
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:29,107
Thank you.

1552
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:30,344
Sir, I realize
that your wife

1553
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,181
appeared to die
in the pool.

1554
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:34,347
Actually she died
in the bathtub.

1555
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:37,054
What are you
talking about?

1556
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,888
Right this way, please.
Right this way.

1557
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,154
Room 13.

1558
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,269
It was the water
in her lungs.

1559
01:31:53,775 --> 01:31:54,969
Commissioner.

1560
01:32:00,148 --> 01:32:03,208
The water in her lungs.
There were traces of soap.

1561
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,085
Duffy, check that bathroom.
You, get the kitchen.

1562
01:32:07,155 --> 01:32:09,123
You see, sir, as soon
as I saw the body,

1563
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,919
I knew right away
something was wrong.

1564
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:12,016
You did, huh?

1565
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:14,084
Check behind that stove,
get under the sink there.

1566
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:16,494
I knew something was wrong
because of her outfit.

1567
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:19,329
What she was wearing,
the tear in her dress.

1568
01:32:19,401 --> 01:32:21,426
You see, I had asked
myself the question.

1569
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:24,165
Why does a woman go to an
important testimonial dinner

1570
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,672
knowing that her sleeve
is torn?

1571
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,867
Got a whole closet
full of nice clothes.

1572
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,772
The one thing that I knew,

1573
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:32,176
she was not on her way
to the dinner

1574
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:33,874
when she was drowned.

1575
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:36,813
So, now it follows, she must
have been drowned earlier.

1576
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:39,012
Now I find out
about the soap.

1577
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:41,282
That places it
in the bathtub.

1578
01:32:42,157 --> 01:32:44,421
You see, a couple of hours
before her body

1579
01:32:44,526 --> 01:32:46,494
was dropped into the pool,

1580
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:50,053
somebody drowned her
and somebody dressed her.

1581
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:53,796
The Medical Examiner's report
set the time of death at 7:30,
Columbo.

1582
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:54,960
Yes, sir.

1583
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:57,869
But that was based
on your eyewitness testimony.

1584
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:59,463
Now, I spoke to him.

1585
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:01,665
He said it could
just as easily have happened

1586
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:03,176
a couple of hours earlier.

1587
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:05,644
All right. Suppose she did die
in the bathtub.

1588
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:07,181
Jessup surprised
and killed her.

1589
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,274
He dressed the body
and threw it in the pool
to make it look accidental.

1590
01:33:10,352 --> 01:33:12,320
No, sir,
that's not possible.

1591
01:33:12,387 --> 01:33:13,820
You know why?

1592
01:33:16,124 --> 01:33:18,354
You see, the bathroom,
the bathtub,

1593
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:21,190
the faucet itself,
everything was bone dry.

1594
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,129
Including the towels,
not even slightly moist.

1595
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,394
That was the first thing
I checked, sir.

1596
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:29,699
Now, she had to have drowned
before 6:00

1597
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:31,466
maybe even before 5:00,

1598
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:33,973
otherwise it wouldn't
have been that dry.

1599
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:36,135
Long before Jessup got there.

1600
01:33:36,878 --> 01:33:38,436
As a matter of fact,

1601
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:41,311
just about the time
that you came home for supper.

1602
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:51,189
Commissioner.

1603
01:33:52,327 --> 01:33:54,318
I believe
you killed your wife.

1604
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,488
And I believe you either
killed Janice Caldwell

1605
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,465
or you're covering up for it.

1606
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:08,573
You just lost your badge,
my friend.

1607
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:12,770
Come on, come on,
keep digging.

1608
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:14,144
(Duffy)
Yes, sir.

1609
01:34:14,749 --> 01:34:17,650
At first, I thought
Mr. Caldwell was responsible,

1610
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:19,210
but that didn't work out

1611
01:34:19,287 --> 01:34:21,585
because of
the nightgown business.

1612
01:34:22,457 --> 01:34:24,516
And then the next night
when your wife was killed,

1613
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:26,150
and you had
that terrific alibi,

1614
01:34:26,227 --> 01:34:27,990
it suddenly hit me.

1615
01:34:28,063 --> 01:34:29,121
You were in it together

1616
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:31,392
and you tried
to blame Artie Jessup.

1617
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,301
And the truth is
that Jessup was nowhere

1618
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:39,931
near either house
either night.

1619
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,737
(Duffy)
Commissioner.

1620
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,143
He wasn't, huh?

1621
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,543
All right, how do you
explain these?

1622
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:51,209
Janice Caldwell's jewels.

1623
01:34:51,286 --> 01:34:52,651
I can explain it.

1624
01:34:52,954 --> 01:34:54,581
You took them
from the Caldwell house,

1625
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:55,816
you hid 'em,

1626
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,152
and today
you planted 'em here

1627
01:34:57,225 --> 01:34:59,022
to incriminate Mr. Jessup.

1628
01:34:59,094 --> 01:35:01,858
You're crazy, you can't prove
anything like that.

1629
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:03,824
Sgt. Randall?

1630
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,297
(Randall)
Here, sir.

1631
01:35:10,405 --> 01:35:11,497
You.

1632
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:19,840
Commissioner Halperin says

1633
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:22,075
he found these jewels
under your mattress.

1634
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,344
[Snickers]

1635
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:24,442
That's crazy.

1636
01:35:24,519 --> 01:35:25,679
You're a liar.

1637
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:27,688
Hey, I don't even live here.

1638
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:31,447
What?

1639
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:33,390
I can verify that, sir.

1640
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:46,233
He doesn't live here.
I live here.

1641
01:35:49,277 --> 01:35:52,440
These are my shirts.
That's my underwear.

1642
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:56,182
My brother-in-law.

1643
01:35:57,619 --> 01:35:59,587
That's my nephew, my niece.

1644
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:02,455
I haven't lived here long.
Just moved in.

1645
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:05,019
You see, the apartment
was vacant for three weeks.

1646
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:06,583
I just signed the lease.

1647
01:36:06,661 --> 01:36:08,458
You looked in the closet.

1648
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:10,794
Those were my pajamas
and my bathrobe.

1649
01:36:11,733 --> 01:36:14,031
The file folder,
the... the report on the desk.

1650
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:17,037
Yes, sir, I'll have to
take responsibility for that.

1651
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:20,799
You see, I persuaded
Mr. Jessup to telephone
Mr. Caldwell,

1652
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:23,070
knowing that Caldwell
would contact you.

1653
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,169
I was sure that once
you knew the true identity

1654
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,577
of the burglar,

1655
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:28,972
you'd try
and incriminate him.

1656
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:32,818
So this morning, very early,
just after I signed the lease,

1657
01:36:33,822 --> 01:36:36,416
I made up a new file folder
on Mr. Jessup.

1658
01:36:37,192 --> 01:36:38,887
Everything was the same

1659
01:36:39,661 --> 01:36:41,128
except this address.

1660
01:36:42,864 --> 01:36:44,832
Only one person,
beside myself,

1661
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:46,457
knew this address.

1662
01:36:46,935 --> 01:36:48,300
That was you, sir.

1663
01:36:55,877 --> 01:36:57,208
That's all.

1664
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:06,782
I think once your friend,
Mr. Caldwell,

1665
01:37:06,855 --> 01:37:07,913
understands the situation,

1666
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:10,355
he'll fill in
some missing pieces.

1667
