1
00:00:56,204 --> 00:00:59,204

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,140
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

3
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:30,243
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

4
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:34,147
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

5
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:38,857
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

6
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,048
Good Morning Gil.

7
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:59,055
I said ... Good Morning Gil.

8
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:03,963
I gotta go to work

9
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,366

10
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:26,998
Wish Me Luck Gil !

11
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,989
Doctor, It's your wife on the phone

12
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,640
Thank you Claire.

13
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:25,363
Fay, Are you sitting down ?

14
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,967
My Publisher thinks it's gonna happen

15
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,679
Ya, he thinks Good Morning America is coming to lake 

16
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:34,889
Pinasetoki next week to interview me.

17
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:38,595
It's a tremendous shock in the arm for my book.

18
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,592
Ye.. No! It's very unsual..

19
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,187
Well I think they did visit doctor Rooth once but, other than that ...

20
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,390
Hold on a second honey.

21
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:47,388
Yes.

22
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:50,597
Excuse me doctor, but there is doctor Godswell on the phone.

23
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,398
Thank You.

24
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,703
Fay, I have to go, just another collegue on the phone.

25
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:59,905
Wow, it's rude to come out to the real work when you're famous

26
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,609
Good bye there.

27
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:02,819
Godswell !

28
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:06,113
Leo ! Long time no see huh !

29
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,213
You've got a big book out !

30
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:10,921
Things are really clikin' huh ?

31
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:13,127
That's the way I planned it !

32
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:18,226
Listen Leo, I'm quitting my practice for a while, I'm leaving town.

33
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,800
And I have one patient I'd like to refer to you.

34
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:27,641
Exactly what kind of case is it Godswell ? He's not psycothic is he ?

35
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:30,547
No ! No ...nothing like that ! 

36
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,646
Listen, his name is Bob Willey

37
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:35,831
He pays early, he comes on time.

38
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,934
He just  needs someone brilliant.

39
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,345
I know you don't like flatery but, 

40
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,759
If there's anyone I know who could win a Nobel Prize, it's you.

41
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:51,052
Well...I suppose I could find an hour for him sometime after labour day

42
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:53,964
Okay ! I'll work him in for an interview

43
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:57,268
Hey Godswell , huh , how come you're leaving town ?

44
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,700
We're a dying breed Leo, Good Luck !

45
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:04,876
Free !

46
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,587
Claire, If a Bob Willey calls, schedule him for a short interview

47
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:12,194
right after I get back from my vacation

48
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,992
He's already called Dr Marvin, twice, he's your next apointment.

49
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,017
Hmm , That's persistence.

50
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:24,903
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

51
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:28,685
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

52
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,794
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

53
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,498
I feel good.

54
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:49,037

00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,441

61
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:19,073

62
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:23,383
Thank You.

63
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,377
Thank you for working me Doctor.

64
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,579
Should I call you Dr Marvin or Leo ?

65
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,979
Which ever you like.

66
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,087
Call me Bob.

67
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,089
Is that your family ?

68
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,790
Yes.

69
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:40,295
Oh wait, let me guess, I'm very good at this!

70
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:41,998
Err, That's Harriet...

And Rita.

74
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:49,914
Eh wait, wait a second,

75
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,111

00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:02,946
And my wife Fay

81
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:04,258
And my daughter Anna

And that's my sister Lily

83
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,562
Lily ? I was close.

84
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,167
It's a beautiful family.

85
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,680
Thank You.

86
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,083
Have a seat.

87
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:33,704
Why don't I start ?

88
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:37,012
The simplest way to put it,

89
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:40,418
I have problems.

90
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,620
I worry about diseases,so,

91
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:48,123
I have trouble touching things,

92
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:52,631
In public places it's almost impossible.

93
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:56,786
I have a real big problem moving.

94
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
Talk about moving.

95
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:05,153
As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm ok.

96
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:11,572
But when I go out, I get WEIRED !

97
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,761
Talk about weired.

98
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:15,063
Talk about weired.

99
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,667
Well, I get desease spams, ellosia,

100
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,279
Cold sweats, 

101
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:26,782
Hot Sweats,

102
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:28,582
fiber blestures,

103
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,485

104
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,491
Bird Vision,involntary tremble

105
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:37,996
Dead ends, nom lips,

106
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,907
Finger nails sensitivity,

107
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,113
Pelvis discomfort,

108
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:47,914
So the real question is, what is the crisis ?

109
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,916
What is that you're trully affraid of ..

110
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:55,223
What if my heart stops beating ?

111
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:59,036
What if ... I'm looking for a bathroom , I can't find it...

112
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:03,042
and my bladder exploses...

113
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:07,452
Do you ever heard of thread syndrom ?

114
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,753
Involontary shouting profanity..

115
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,153
It's exceptionnaly rare ...

116
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,658
SHUT IT SON OF A BITCH ! 

117
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,465
BASTARD ! 

118
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,874
Why exactly are you doing this ?

119
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,202
If I fake it, then I don't have it !

120
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,889
You know it's the same with the cardiac arrest.

121
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,498
Are you married ?

122
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,211
I'm divorced.

123
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,612
Would you like to talk about that ?

124
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:56,217
There are two types of people in this world.

125
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,119
Those who like Neil Daemon

126
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,519
and those who don't.

127
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,431
My ex-wife loves him.

128
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:04,927
I see,

129
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:06,937
So, what you're saying is 

130
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:10,235
that even you are an almost paralyzed, 

131
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:14,347
multi-phobic personality that he's in a constant state of panic,

132
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,357
your wife did not leave you, you left her,

133
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:18,256
because she liked Neil Daemon

134
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,966
No, you're saying that maybe,

135
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:27,267
maybe I didn't leave her because she likes Neil Daemon,

136
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,967
but maybe, she left me ?

137
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:32,173
Yes.

138
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:37,874
Oh Oh Oh Oh ....

139
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:45,342
Dr Marvin, 

140
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:49,644
You can help me, for the first time in my life,

141
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,443
I feel like there's hope !

142
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:57,249
I feel like I can be somebody.

143
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,561
Bob, there's an old saying, 

144
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:06,462
that's the best psychiatric in the world,

145
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,868
is the one right inside of you.

146
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:10,174
Yeah...

147
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:11,677
I can help you, yes.

148
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,982
Thank you.

149
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:19,381
Bob, there is a ground-breaking new book, that has just come out, 

150
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:26,897
Now, I have writed this book, of course it applies to you, but,

151
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:30,401
I'm sure that you can see

152
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
when you see the title, 

153
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:35,912
exactly how it could help.

154
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,422
Baby Steps ?

155
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,726
It means setting small reasonnable goals for yourself

156
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,300
one day at a time.

157
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,059
On tiny step at a time

158
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:46,663
Baby steps

159
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:51,172
For Instance, hum...

160
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,271
When you leave this office,

161
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,066
don't think about everything you have to do 

162
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,979
in order to get out of the building,

163
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,975
just think to what you must do to 

164
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:01,377
get out of this room,

165
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,501
and when you get to the hall,

166
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:05,403
deal with that hall,

167
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,719
and so ...

168
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,214

00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:49,162
Yes this is Bob Willey, I'm a patient of Dr Marvin,

216
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,967
I have to speak with him right away, it's urgent...

217
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,077
I'm sorry Mr Willey, But Dr Marvin's out...

218
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,384
It's Bob and you are ?

Betty

00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,087
Betty, Hi !

221
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:01,471
Bob, Dr Marvin's out of town, and Dr Armand is taking his cause, 

222
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:05,904
I know that Betty, 

223
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,007
It's just the expense of confusion, 

224
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,716
I was supposed to call Dr Marvin, 

225
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,992
but I've lost his phone number.

226
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:14,198
Bob, I can't give out that number.

227
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
I know that Betty, 

228
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:19,205
But you could call him on the other line, 

229
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,625
and tell him that I'm on hold on the other line, could you please ?

230
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Thanks Betty please ...

235
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,134
Dr Marvin, this is Betty at your exchange,

236
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:53,236
I'm sorry to disturb you but,

Betty you know better than that ...

240
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:00,847
Dr Armand is covering for me

241
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:01,857
I told him that Doctor,

242
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:05,258
but he lost your number and then it was urgent.

243
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:07,249
All right, put him through

244
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,248

245
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:12,084

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
Bob ...

251
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,112
I thought I made it clearly, 

252
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:25,816
I'm on vacation, 

253
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:27,623
Well I know,

254
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,428
but I'm just worst as usual this time, really bad.

255
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,413
Bob, if this is really an emergency, 

256
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:32,814
go to the ER.

257
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,621
And if it isn't call Dr Armand, 

258
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,119
I'm sure he can help you.

259
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,122
Well I'd just feel so much so much better

260
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,825

But, can't we just talk ?

264
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,045
Yes we can,

265
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:46,649
In my office after labour day !

266
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,255
After your bathroom fire all huh ?

267
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:50,857
Good Bye Bob.

268
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,959
You want to keep me not to yourself ?

269
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:55,257
Good Bye Bob !

270
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:58,863
Is this a fake hang up ?

271
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:02,374
It's a fake hang up !

272
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400

273
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,719
Allo ?

274
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:16,813
Doctor, It's Betty again,

275
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,037
I have an urgent call from your sister

276
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:21,134
My sister ? 

277
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Put her through

278
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Go ahead.

279
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,104
It's not you, it's me.

280
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,011
Lily ? What's wrong ?

281
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:38,413
Dr Marvin, please don't be hangry, this is Bob.

282
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,119
I know that I shouldn't be calling..

283
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,025
Bob, the doctor patient relationship is based 

284
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,124
on trust, and when you call me pretenting to be my sister,

285
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,833
I can't trust you anymore.

286
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:48,835
Go to the ER, please, do not call me here again!

287
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:53,871
No no no no...

288
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:54,871
That was not smart !

289
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:57,376
That was not smart !

290
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,587
Who is it ?

291
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,887
Detective Robertson, from homicide, I have some questions about a Bob Willey.

292
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:11,694
What ?

293
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:14,302
That was the Bob who kept calling Dr Marvin.

294
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:19,909
That was that Bob who kept calling.

295
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:24,616
Unfortunately, Bob comitted suicide about 15 minutes ago.

296
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,831
Oh my God!

297
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:29,155
That's terrible !

298
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,056
Very sad, It should never happend

299
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,754
A very sweet guy, 

300
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,060
but he did leave a note however

301
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,566
mentionning a Betty

302
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:37,472
She's Betty.

303
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:38,268
I'm Betty.

304
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:39,764
Oh.

305
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:42,069
So you're Betty.

306
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,169
Oh, Bob called here trying to reach his psychiatric

307
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,784
Oh, well where is he ?

308
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:49,888
 I may ask him some questions too.

309
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:52,786
Dr Marvin is on vacation in New Hampshire.

310
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:54,995
New Hampshire!

311
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:57,312
I can get it on the phone for you.

312
00:19:58,117 --> 00:19:59,117
Good.

313
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:00,422
No! don't !

314
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:04,118
If I really need to, I'll send some NHPD to drop by.

315
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:06,728
Err, but, 

316
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:12,036
what if I wanted to write him a letter... would you have a mailing adress or some kind up there ?

317
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:13,926
Oh, sure !

318
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,843

Thank you for calling Betty.

329
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:11,131
It was the service.

330
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,817
That patient who called before,

331
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:17,622

339
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,315
Baby Steps get on the bus..

340
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:53,717

00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:56,435
You think you can do it today Bob ?

342
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:58,443
What a busy schedule ...

343
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:08,854
Baby Steps in the bus ...

344
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:12,757
Baby Steps in the halley...

345
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:14,564
Baby Steps in the halley...

346
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:16,068
Baby Steps...

347
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:17,765
And seat.

348
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:21,374
Hello !

349
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,084
I'm Bob, 

350
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,884
Would you knock me out please ? Just a hit in the face...

351
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:38,067
Do we have enough to feed the entire film creature ?

352
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,963
Honey, we have enough to feed the entire network !

353
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:43,865
Oh Great! Another vacation that is not a vacation...

354
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,870
Why do I have to dress up for this stupid show ?

355
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,074
You mean, you already tryied on everything you own !

356
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:50,176
I have not !

357
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,529
All right ! All right ! Oh My Gosh !

358
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,007
It will probably be a short interview anyway,

359
00:22:58,508 --> 00:23:00,008
just me and the family 

360
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:00,898
my book.

361
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:08,996
Easy fellows, we're almost there !

362
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:19,115
False alarm.

363
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,767
Dr Marvin !

364
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,770
Dr Leo Marvin !

365
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:56,273
Doctor 

366
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:57,794
Marvin !

367
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:01,007
Thank You !

368
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
- Bye Doctor !
- Thanks Again

369
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:07,592
Isn't someone calling you ?

370
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:10,498
Right over there !

371
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,001
Oh My God !

372
00:24:14,006 --> 00:24:16,006
Doctor 

373
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:18,011
Leo

374
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:19,318
Leo, do you know that man ?

375
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:20,423
Get in the car !

376
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:21,518
Come on ! Hurry !

377
00:24:21,517 --> 00:24:22,517
Hurry , Hurry !

378
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:24,322
Doctor Marvin !

379
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,524
Ohhhhh I really appreciate this !

380
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,431
Everyone in the car ! Come on !

381
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,935
Doctor Marvin...

382
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,539
This is a bad time ?

383
00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:43,657
The fam' !

384
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:57,076
- Who's that ?
- I don't know ...

385
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,575
What are you doing here ?

386
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,285
I thought you were dead !

387
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,580
Oh well, 

388
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:05,891
I felt a little bit,

389
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:07,288
but don't be mad at me...

390
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:11,696
Bob, your behaviour is completely inapropriate,

391
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:12,698
You're hangry...

392
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:13,806
No, No, I don't get hangry...

393
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
So you're upset...

394
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,805
I don't get upset!

395
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,310
Well let's have a little talk...

396
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,308
Bob, I do not see patients on vacation, ever !

397
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:23,913
How many ways can I make that clear ?

398
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Now, what I would like you to do 

399
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,818
is to get on this bus, 

400
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,550
and go back to New York.

401
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,050
I can't ! I'm totally paralized !

402
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:30,931
I'm all locked up !

403
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:31,934
You got yourself here !

404
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,331
Barrely...

405
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,137
Well getting back to the therapeutic !

406
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:36,942
Could we just have a little talk ?

407
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,037
Bob ! You are testing my patience !

408
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,045
Come on ! I come so far !

409
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,071
- Bob !
- Baby Steps...
- I'm doing the work !

410
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,676
Baby Steps! And I'm not a slacker !

411
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,779
Check it out ! I'm in a really bad shape !

412
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:48,176
Come on please !

413
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:51,884
Gimme,Gimme,Gimme, I need, I need, I need !

414
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:57,472
Ok ok ok ! All right ! All right !

415
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
All right, it's 2 o'clock 

416
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:01,903
go to the bus station, buy yourself a ticket home

417
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
and then wait for me at that coffee shop.

418
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:05,782
You'll meet me ?

419
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,292
I'll call you !

420
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:08,791
In 2 hours...

421
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,393
Oh my God! You're the greatest !

422
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,701
No no no... just you have to promess me that

423
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,700
you will buy your ticket and go home !

424
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Absolutely !

425
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:20,107
I'll do it right now!

426
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,814
All right, I'll call you at 4 o'clock..

427
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,931
You could possibly make it 3:30 could you ?

428
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,830
Bob !

429
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,721
4 ! 4 okay ! 

430
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,525
Exactly 4 o'clock ! It's better. Okay 

431
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,429
Thank you Dr M. !

432
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:43,761
Baby Steps to 4 o'clock...

433
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,973
Baby Steps to 4 o'clock...

434
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:50,894
Baby Steps to 4 o'clock...

435
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:57,488
Oh my Gosh !

436
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:58,891
I need a bowl !

437
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,690
- What ?
- I need a bow, he's been locked in for abour 8 hours !

438
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:03,195
he's about to scream.

439
00:27:03,495 --> 00:27:04,495
he's furious.

440
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:09,211
Sorry Gil. Little Negligence on my part,

441
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:12,007
here you go, come on tight fellow

442
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:15,215
Ohhh, it was a long ride wasn't it ? I know, I need a scratch...

443
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:19,021
Hey No ! No ! No !

444
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,921
I'm expecting a phone call !

445
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,930
Thank You.

446
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:26,032
Thanks a lot! Thanks everybody, I really appreciate it!

447
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:27,636
Also, 

448
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:28,938
If I ...

449
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,343
loose consciousness or black out or 

450
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:33,044
something explodes, 

451
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,944
whould you tell Dr Marvin when he calls 

452
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:36,952
Doctor Leo Marvin ?

453
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:38,953
Do you know him ?

454
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:40,472
Yeah !

455
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,380
He bought our dream house !

456
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:44,873
It's a lifetime to save for downpaiment 

457
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:47,275
He sew down with a bag full of money,

458
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:49,981
and grab the tab for unders.

459
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,984
Son of a bitch !

460
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:54,189
She never says that.

461
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:56,403
Stay as far away from him as possible!

462
00:27:57,313 --> 00:27:58,313
Well that will be easy !

463
00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:01,413
He don't see me, that's why I'm expecting a phone call.

464
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,214
He won't see you...

465
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,417
Well, 

466
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,621
We'll show you where he lives !

467
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:10,218
You will ?

468
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,019
The son of a bitch !

469
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:14,029
She never says that !

470
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,220
Siggy, I have the whole house to fix,

471
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,025
all the art to hang, 

472
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:19,331
I have no idea whenever I will be on the TV show,

473
00:28:19,935 --> 00:28:22,435
but I've stopped everything in order to teach you how to dive.

474
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,742
This is as important for me to see you dive

475
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:26,941
as it is for me to appear on Good Morning America.

476
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:28,647
Oh man ! This is really pressure.

477
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:30,445
Come on take off your rode

478
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:34,155
Why are you always wearing black ?

479
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:37,252
What is it with you and the death mecanization ?

480
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:38,963
Maybe I'm morring from my lost childhood

481
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:43,067
All right, come on turn around !

482
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:46,172
Close to the edge, that's it!
Remember what we did last year.

483
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:47,374
One, Two Three Spread.

484
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,479
Now bend up the knees, bend your waist, hands out, step on the board.

485
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:50,985
One, Two , Three..

486
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,083
Spread !

487
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:54,889
One

488
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:55,886
Two

489
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
Three

490
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:01,302
Spread

491
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:05,401
Spread

492
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,511
Summerfall, time to go dad!

493
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:09,909
I don't understand...

494
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,115
why won't you dive ?

495
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:14,736
From all the horror in this world, what difference does it make ?

496
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,250
Hi Lily !
I'm just calling to remind you about Leo surprise party.

497
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,945
Thursday night 7 o'clock.
ok ?

498
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:29,956
Well, it will be after his interview so he should be relaxed,

499
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:32,554
oh, wait a minute.

500
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:38,758
Oh Yes! Of course I'm thrilled Lily, 

501
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,059
the last person interviwed on vacation
was Dcotor Rooth.

502
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:46,467
Here he comes, Thursday night 7 o'clock, don't forget ok ? Bye bye

503
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:57,101
He didn't dive ?

504
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
No ...

505
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:00,702
Oh come on sweetie, he's just a little bit affraid of it!

506
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:02,495
The patience...

507
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,094
No, it's not like I wanted him to jump from an airplane...

508
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,598
When i was growing up, I thought diving was fun !

509
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,906
I thought you were born grown up daddy !

510
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Yes, I'd like the number to the godlam's coffee...

511
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:27,234
What are you doing here ?

512
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,335
I'm sorry, don't be mad,

513
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:30,044
the goldams brought me

514
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:31,445
Thank you Mr and Mrs G. !

515
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,248
You're welcome Bobby !

516
00:30:33,242 --> 00:30:35,242
Hello Doctor Marvin !

517
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:37,148
The house looks good !

518
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:38,854
Burn in hell Dr Marvin !

519
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Bob, we agreed I would call you !

520
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:49,164
Coming here is unbelievably inapropriate !

521
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:51,569
Dad, can I ...

522
00:30:51,873 --> 00:30:52,873
Oh, I'm sorry 

523
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,677

524
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,590

525
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:58,503
Hi bob !

526
00:30:58,999 --> 00:30:59,999
Nice to meet you Bob !

527
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,199
Hi ! I'm Bob !

528
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:02,899
I'm Fay.

529
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:05,504
Oh Mrs M. you are even

530
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:08,593
prettier than your picture !

531
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:10,597
and younger !

532
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,003
Thank you !

533
00:31:12,808 --> 00:31:14,308
Fay, Anna, Would you please excuse us ?

534
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,107
I think Bob and I have something to talk about.

535
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:18,813
Really ?

536
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,319
You think so too ?

537
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:21,925
Let's take a walk !

538
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,424
-Oh Bob, could I get your fish ?
- Oh yes, thank you!

539
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,034
he's already been in a bowl otherwise.

540
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:33,543
This is a great place !

541
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:35,943
No wonder why the goldam want it !

542
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:39,969
I'm sorry about bargging you like this !

543
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,379
That's all right !
I understand.

544
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,488
The problems don't go away just because I go.

545
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Bob, I'd like you to ... take a long look around you 

546
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:55,178
what is everything you see here have in common ?

547
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:04,493
Vacation Bob !

548
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:06,997
Vacation.

549
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,199
Now, 

550
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:11,607
I can't Bob, at this time, give you the kind of therapy

551
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:12,715
to contension you need to solve all your problems

552
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:13,907
and you know why...

553
00:32:15,906 --> 00:32:16,906
you're on vacation !

554
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:17,914
Exactly !

555
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:19,113
What I can do, 

556
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,033
is, this.

557
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,440
Don't give me pills ! I already have plenty !

558
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:27,021
This is not pills !

559
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:31,433
Read It !

560
00:32:32,537 --> 00:32:34,037
It says, 

561
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:35,938
Take a vacation

562
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,850
from my problems.

563
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:41,348
Give you a persmission to take a vacation
from your problems !

564
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:43,556
Not a vacation from your work, 

565
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:45,057
not a vacation from daily life,

566
00:32:44,955 --> 00:32:46,455
but a vacation 

567
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:48,061
from my problems.

568
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,159
Exactly !

569
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:50,869
And now I want you to get on that bus

570
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:52,164
and go back to New York.

571
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,469
But ! 

572
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,572
Every single time a problem arises, 

573
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:57,878
I want you to take that prescription out

574
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,576
and follow it to the letter, Doctor's orders.

575
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:03,389
I see you in New York, in my office

576
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,690
in one month !

577
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:08,394
This is incredible !

578
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:10,797
This is a step on me !

579
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:14,104
For the first time since ever, I feel free !

580
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,309
You gave me a great gift Doctor !

581
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,711
The gift of life !

582
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,713
You're a great man !

583
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,428
I knew coming right here was the right thing to do...

584
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:31,045
It feels right because you are here

585
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:33,263
and it feels right because you're leaving.

586
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:39,255
- Have a great vacation !
- You too Bob !

587
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:43,459
The vacation from my problems !

588
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,367
You bet I will !

589
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:51,577
Here you go !

590
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:52,883
Baby Steps.

591
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:06,195
Is everything all right honey ?

592
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:08,396
- Yes, everything is perfectly fine.
- he seemed pleasant enough

593
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:10,803
When he's controlled

594
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:16,806
I got so excited I forgot to bring you with me !

595
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,600
Gil...

596
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:21,608
Oh! The Fish !

597
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,225
Wow, that's a very nice likes of you.

598
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:30,629

599
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:31,628

601
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,832
Bye bye Bob!

602
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:35,335
Bye bye !

603
00:34:37,444 --> 00:34:38,444
You've got to be Sigmund ?

604
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:39,348
Yes, this is Sigmund and

605
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:40,346
and this is Bob 

606
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:41,149
and Bob was just leaving.

607
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,247
Hi !

608
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,350
Oh, this is Gil my fish Sigmund.

609
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:47,157
Did you get him on the lake ?

610
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:48,567
No, he's a sitty fish.

611
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:49,968
Cool.

612
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:51,468
Be he love uppon here!

613
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:56,484
You father is the most incredible psychiatrist,

614
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:58,286
I sincerely hope you appreciate him.

615
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,097
Have a great vacation family !

616
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:02,494

617
00:35:04,594 --> 00:35:05,594
Good Bye Bob !

618
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:06,997

619
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:07,993
Bye!

620
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:12,104
Well, he's different.

621
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,149
Or ...

622
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,960
This.

623
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,359
I told you, I like the riffle, I think it's a symbol
of virility.

624
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,073
Now can I eat breakfast, I'm supposed to go sailing
on George's boat.

625
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,571
Wait , Wait !

626
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:02,383
Fay, I need your opinion, riffle or us ? 

627
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:04,979
I think both are wonderful sweetie !

628
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:08,788
hmm Fay !

629
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,293
You know I can't live with that kind of answers !

630
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,504
I need feedback !

631
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,117
Good morning Doctor Marvin !

632
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,227
No ! These aren't for you !
They're for Fay !

633
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:30,225
For yesterday, 

634
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:31,526
for your hospitality

635
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,633
to Gil and me.
I didn't say thank you.

636
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,730
I thought about what you said !

637
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:37,734
Take a vacation from my problems, 

638
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,940
and I did ! 

639
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,039
But you're back !

640
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:42,342
No I'm not !

641
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:43,547
You're not ?

642
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:44,448
No I'm not !

643
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:46,449
I'm on vacation !

644
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:50,354
This isn't an apointment, I'm dropping by !

645
00:36:50,558 --> 00:36:52,558
This is my first time over the lake !

646
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:53,967
This is my first time...

647
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:55,467
anywhere !

648
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:58,765
Well I'm anxious cause I'm not able to get food yet,

649
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:00,992
but I'm staying at the goldman's and I told them what you said,
They insisted.

650
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:04,077
No no no no no! 

651
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:07,379
I know it can't work.
But let's get the friendship going.

652
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,489
See you later !

653
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:11,088
It seems thats he's staying, doesn't it ?

654
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,696
Hey, Paper Boy, this was on the couch.

655
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:17,097
Thank you.

656
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:28,314
Family conference!

657
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Family conference!

658
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:32,923
All right, now, I don't want any of you 

659
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:35,124
letting Bob into this house.

660
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:36,431
Why ?

661
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:39,737
- Why ??
- Sweet heart, aren't you over-reacting just a little bit ?

662
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:40,838
Good we found an agreeement, 

663
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:42,443
Family conference is over.

664
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,067
The vacation from my problems

665
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:53,064
There is nobody here.

666
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:54,569
There's nothing to fear.

667
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,473
There is nobody here.

668
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,279
I will be alone

669
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:00,603
I'm all by myself.

670
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:05,412
There is nobody here.

671
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,009
Hi Bob !

672
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,514
- Hi!
- Where are you going ?

673
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:28,738
Just going to town.

674
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:32,342
- Buy some kleenex.
- Well you want a ride ?

675
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:34,824
I'd love one.

676
00:38:39,937 --> 00:38:41,437
Do a lot of people use this car ?

677
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:43,164
Just us.

678
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:01,067
So, how's it like to be the daughter of a brilliant analyst ?

679
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
When he's in the next bedroom at night when you need him, is it great ?

680
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
Hmm No ... It's not great.

681
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,393
I have problems, the same as anyone else.

682
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:15,391
The same as you.

683
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:17,096
You're affraid your bladder explode ?

684
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:20,902
What other ones are the same ?
Like what ? Like what ?

685
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,510
Well like analyzing everything !

686
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:24,711
to death, to see what I'm feeling is normal.

687
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:26,013
Yes, I have it !

688
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:32,309
Do you freeze up and, turn into wood when you're around a good looking guy

689
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
you don't even know if he likes you or not!

690
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:35,926
Well, not a guy, but yes I freeze.

691
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:39,326
You know, I treat people, 
as if they were telephones,

692
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,300
If I meet somebody I think doesn't likes me I say I'm Bob,
this one is temporarely out of order.

693
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,039
you know, don't break the connection,
just hang up and try again!

694
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,151
Does it work ?

695
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:51,847
It seems to be !

696
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,349
I'm on vacation at lake winnipesaukee !

697
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,476
All right ?

698
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:59,484
Do you want to come sailing on  
my friend George's boat ?

699
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:02,786
ohhh no...

700
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,276
That's ok, you don't have to.

701
00:40:04,374 --> 00:40:06,374
No, I'd love to ! 

702
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:09,081
It sounds great !

703
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:12,683
I've never been on a boat, and I don't know how to handle it!

704
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
It just make my lips hard to think about it.

705
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:18,697
But if you find a good sailor, and the craft to see 

706
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:21,892
Yes, I would go sailing !
Yeah Let's go sailing !

707
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,604
I know the plans !

708
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,706
I'm sailing !

709
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,013
I'm sailing !

710
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:33,716
I'm sailing !

711
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:38,224
I'm sailing !

712
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:45,229
I'm sailing !

713
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:48,536
This is child abuse !

714
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,340
If you drop me I'll prosecute !

715
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,450
I'm not gonna let go until you're ready ok ?

716
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:55,548
Trust me!

717
00:40:55,696 --> 00:40:57,196
Put your hans up like I showed you.

718
00:41:01,663 --> 00:41:04,663
I'm not ready.
You hear me ? I'm not ready ! Don't drop me !
I'm not ready !

719
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:06,304
Dr Marvin ! I'm sailing !

720
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,779
Oh, Siggy....

721
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:15,694
Murderer !

722
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Killer !

723
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:23,906
- Hi dad !
- I sail !

724
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:35,427
Anna !

725
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:37,323
Anna ! Come here please !

726
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:40,427
- Dad !
- Anna, I'd like to speak to you please.

727
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:42,436
Dr Marvin, Dr Marvin, guess what ! 

728
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:44,635
I sail !

729
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,039
I'm a sailor ! I sail !

730
00:41:46,365 --> 00:41:48,865
- I'd like to talk to my daughter alone !
- What is this ? a break through ?

731
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:51,274
Do you think that I'm a sailor ?

732
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,178
I sail ?

733
00:41:53,985 --> 00:41:55,485
I sail now ?

734
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,079
Keep sailing Bob !

735
00:41:57,085 --> 00:42:00,085
On a boat on the lake.
Very far away from the dock.

736
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:03,091
Into the wind, with the sky and everything.

737
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,679
I thought I told you to stay away from Bob Willey !

738
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:09,977
Dady, I was with my friends !

739
00:42:09,978 --> 00:42:11,978
- Where are we going ?
- Home !

740
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,589
- What about the car ?
- Leave it, it's been a long time since I've got a talk with my daughter !

741
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Oh daddy ! Not here !

742
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:23,399
Anna, Anna, Anna !

743
00:42:25,403 --> 00:42:26,903
Anna ...

744
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,917
- I know you won't listen to your father,
  but you will always listen to me.

745
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:31,613
- So I'm asking not to see Bob Willey.

746
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
- Daddy, I am just...
- I can't hear you !

747
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:36,846
- Where are you Anna ?

748
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:42,655
- I'm just having fun with my friends !
- And Bob Willey.

749
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,740
- Yes and Bob Willey !

750
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:46,252
- Bob Willey is your father's patient

751
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,050
- Bob Willey is a very sensitive person !
- Your father's sensitive ?

752
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,466
- Bob listens to people !
- You father listens to people !

753
00:42:52,878 --> 00:42:54,878
- Except when he's up here on lake Winnipesaukee.

754
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:00,559
He is FUN !

755
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:04,262
You father is ... kinda fun.

756
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:08,798
I'm Fay Marvin.

757
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:10,302
Doctor Marvin's wife.

758
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:12,606
And I'm very happy to be on your program.

759
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:15,709
And these are our childrens, Anna and Siggy.

760
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:35,444
I'm a failure.

761
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:36,747
What ?

762
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,051
Going on national television tomorrow as an expert on human behaviour,

763
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,350
and in the space of the last hour, both of my childrens

764
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,460
told me that they hate me.

765
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Come on, you know they don't mean it.

766
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:52,469
Anna accused me of being insensitive.

767
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:58,574
No, what she actually said was, 

768
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,337
I was insensitive,

769
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
and I didn't listen,

770
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:05,247
and I wasn't any fun,

771
00:44:07,254 --> 00:44:09,254
and that Bob Willey was...

772
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,200
Give me...

773
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,273
Some time...

774
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:15,281
To blow the man down...

775
00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:28,419
You see something different about me ?

776
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:33,309
- No.
- Do you sail ?
- No.

777
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,320
Well I just picked that up

778
00:44:36,127 --> 00:44:38,627
What am I going to pick up next ?

779
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,300
- Try diving !
- All right ! Diving !

780
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:44,434
I know a great teacher.

781
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,433
My dad, he just dropped me into the water, without warning me first.

782
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,840
I mean, I nearly drunked.
My whole life flashed before my eyes.

783
00:44:55,245 --> 00:44:56,745
Well you're lucky you're only 12!

784
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,450
That still grim.
I mean what is it with him and diving ?

785
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:02,162
What's the big deal ?

786
00:45:02,557 --> 00:45:04,057
Well .. he ... 

787
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,067
Wow...

788
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,275
He probably just want you to beat it, that's all.

789
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,275
You know he probably just want you to dive, because you're affraid of diving.

790
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:19,684
Didn't I tell you I sailed on my first try ?

791
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,490
I just let the boat do the work,  that was my secret.

792
00:45:25,296 --> 00:45:27,296
But, with diving, what's the thing ?

793
00:45:28,922 --> 00:45:30,922
- What's the trick ?
- I don't know

794
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:33,122
It's supposed to be easy.

795
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:35,325
Can you give me a handle on it ?

796
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:39,845
Thanks.

797
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,237
- Careful, oh careful !
- Let's go to the edge.

798
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:45,647
Go to the Edge!

799
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:48,045
Come on toes off, close to the edge.

800
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:49,635
Don't worry.

801
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,540
- Come on!
- Let's call this the edge, right here, this is the edge.

802
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:54,941
Ok, step out this edge.

803
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:56,374
Now walk up to our edge.

804
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:58,881
Okay

805
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,090
Got you.
Bend your knees.

806
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:02,894
Bend your knees.
Very good.

807
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:06,899
Bend your knees.

808
00:46:07,295 --> 00:46:08,795
- Stick to the board.
- I am sticked to the board.

809
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:13,007
Just a second, no rush.

810
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,210
Just a second, it's my first dive.

811
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:23,024
Well I can't see what you're doing,
why don't you get first ?

812
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:29,345
Hey careful, hold it hold it!

813
00:46:29,636 --> 00:46:31,136
- Come up, come up
- Hold it , hold it!

814
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:32,547
- Hold my shirt, I'll show you.
- I got it.

815
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,460
- Okay, bend my knees.

816
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:39,659
Bend your knees.

817
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:40,167
Hands forward.

818
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:42,949
Stick to the board.

819
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:44,352
Honey, 

820
00:46:44,757 --> 00:46:46,257
Come here, look.

821
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,357
Come here, come here.

822
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,870
I don't want to see this !
No please !

823
00:46:57,673 --> 00:46:59,173
- One
- Please No !

824
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:00,782
- Two
- Don't do it ! Please !

825
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:02,881

00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:49,325
I HAD THE RIGHT TO BUY THIS HOUSE !!

843
00:47:58,415 --> 00:47:59,915
Am I gonna die ?

844
00:48:08,737 --> 00:48:10,237
- Am I gonna die ?
- No !

845
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,041
Fay ...

846
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:26,761
Look everybody, I'm not wrong often

847
00:48:27,356 --> 00:48:28,856
but when I am, I admit it.

848
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:30,358
I mean it.

849
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,160
I would like you all to accept my apology.

850
00:48:33,566 --> 00:48:36,066
- But what about Bob ?
- What about Bob ?

851
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,871
Yeah, dad, don't you think you should apologies to Bob ?

852
00:48:39,871 --> 00:48:41,871
I will not apologies to Bob.

853
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:42,981
Why not?

854
00:48:44,585 --> 00:48:45,585
All right.

855
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:47,986
I'll apologies to Bob.

856
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:57,598
And now I'd like him to go.

857
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,600
Leo, why are you so hostile to him ?

858
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,206
Because he's a patient !

859
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:06,211
Fay, don't you get it, he's a patient !

860
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:09,221
A patient ! A patient !

861
00:49:09,618 --> 00:49:12,118
- Mum, can we have Bob over for dinner ?
- Dinner ?

862
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:13,031
Yeah !

863
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:15,523
I don't want Bob for dinner Fay.

864
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:16,917
Leo, it's for the kids.

865
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:17,240
I don't want Bob for dinner Fay.

866
00:49:20,246 --> 00:49:22,246
I want to think about my interview tomorrow !

867
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:25,635
I'm sorry Leo.

868
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:27,438
Right is right.

869
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:15,157
Fay, this is so crunchious.

870
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,059
- Is this hand chocked ?

871
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,300
Would you like some more chicken Bob ?

872
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:34,369
- Leo do you want the breast ?
- No no no, that's fine, eat up !

873
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:43,985
Hmm nice bicuits huh ?

874
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:48,292
Yeah, great biscuits, great corn, great potatoes.

875
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,795
You want some more salad Bob ?

876
00:50:52,003 --> 00:50:53,503
Ya, I think I do.

877
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:04,022
Can you get that tomatoe off there please ?

878
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,530
Sure.

879
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:07,633
Thank you.

880
00:51:24,241 --> 00:51:25,741
This is delicious !

881
00:51:27,644 --> 00:51:28,644
Will you stop that please !

882
00:51:40,385 --> 00:51:42,385
Leo, I see salt and pepper, is there a salt substitute ?

883
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,870
I'll get it!

884
00:51:51,382 --> 00:51:53,382
And dont call me Leo.

885
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:55,487
But you said in your office that I could call you Leo.

886
00:51:56,187 --> 00:51:57,687
That was in my office.

887
00:51:57,892 --> 00:51:59,892
In my home, I'd like you to call me Dr Marvin.

888
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:08,103
He's just a little bit nervous about his interview tomorrow.

889
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:12,610
Oh yeah ! I heard about your upcoming date view !

890
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,020
Congratulations Le... Dr Marvin!

891
00:52:18,938 --> 00:52:21,438
Your book is gonna do a lot of good to a lot of people !

892
00:52:22,928 --> 00:52:24,928
I'm a walking proof of that !

893
00:52:31,142 --> 00:52:33,142
- Is this butter or margarine ?
- Butter.

894
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,559
Dad ?

895
00:52:40,388 --> 00:52:41,388
Dad, are you okay ?

896
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,390
- Dad ?
- Honey ?

897
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,096
Don't panic, I know what to do !

898
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:53,103
Don't worry, hang on !

899
00:52:58,013 --> 00:52:59,013
He's dying !

900
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:02,718
I'm doing the right thing !

901
00:53:12,915 --> 00:53:14,915
Honey , I love you ! Breath !!

902
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,319
Maybe with your knee more !

903
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:17,317
Hit him harder ! 

904
00:53:19,725 --> 00:53:20,725
Spit it up !

905
00:53:20,723 --> 00:53:21,723
He doesn't blew !

906
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:24,231
Spit again !

907
00:53:28,842 --> 00:53:30,842
- Leo are you ok ?
- Get him off me !

908
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,346
Bob you saved him !

909
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:40,847
That was incredible !

910
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:43,534
I just never gave up hope !

911
00:54:03,413 --> 00:54:05,413
We're singing in the rain ...

912
00:54:06,715 --> 00:54:09,215
just singing in the rain ...

913
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,220
what a glorious day,

914
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:15,928
I'm happy again ...

915
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:19,533
I walk through the kitchen...

916
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:22,539
With the bowl for the chicken...

917
00:54:22,748 --> 00:54:26,748
And I put in Leo, I mean Dr Marvin's refrigerator...

918
00:54:27,249 --> 00:54:28,249
Thank you.

919
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:31,009
I'm singing in the rain ...

920
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:36,219
Well being a party cool, but tomorrow is really important

921
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,930
better calling  the night.

922
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:46,834
I don't want to be rude, but maybe it's time for Bob to sing his way home !

923
00:54:48,944 --> 00:54:49,944
Honey he can't walk under this !

924
00:54:50,563 --> 00:54:52,563
Did I say that ?
I'll drive him !

925
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,170
- Oh dad ! The car is still at the marina !
- What ? 

926
00:54:58,272 --> 00:55:00,272
You said to leave her, remember ?

927
00:55:03,963 --> 00:55:05,963
Well that gonna led up soon.
He's gonna go home then.

928
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:08,471
But what if it starts up again ?

929
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:10,676
He can borrow my slicker !

930
00:55:30,132 --> 00:55:31,632
- Leo ..
- Shhht

931
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:33,731
- Leo ...
- Shhht... I think it's ledding up !

932
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:38,636
Leo, honey, it's 1 o'clock in the morning...

933
00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:42,655
we can't make Bob sit here all night !

934
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:45,269
Let just him stay over...

935
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,376
STAY !!
Good Morning America will be here at 7 o'clock !

936
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,680
You don't want them to discover a sevirely disturbed patient sleeping on one of my coaches !

937
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:55,486
There's an extra bed in Siggy's room.

938
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:59,681
- Fay !!
- Leo, you were very upset over Anna and Siggy...

939
00:56:01,988 --> 00:56:03,988
It's your chance to show what kind of guy 

940
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:08,196
Leo Marvin really is...

941
00:56:11,503 --> 00:56:13,503
Come on sweetie.
Come on.

942
00:56:16,815 --> 00:56:19,315
Bob, We would love for you to spend the night.

943
00:56:20,634 --> 00:56:22,634
That's a great idea !

944
00:56:23,529 --> 00:56:25,029
Do you have a pillow ?

945
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:28,026
Sure, sure ! Anna would you get a pillow and some sheets for Bob ?

946
00:56:28,834 --> 00:56:30,334
Sure !

947
00:56:30,743 --> 00:56:32,743
Siggy, would you get one of you father's ropes for Bob ?

948
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,330
Yeah !

949
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:38,233
Are you sure I'm not imposing ?

950
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:40,331
Oh no ! Not at all !

951
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,140
okay ...

952
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:56,659
Do you care which bed ?

953
00:56:57,475 --> 00:56:58,975
Well I prefer facing south-east.

954
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,800
This one.

955
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,420
Did you find a tooth brush ?

956
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:07,718
Yes.

957
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:11,121
Fay, you know where my new tooth brush is ?

958
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:13,349
In the bathroom.

959
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:16,956
I know it should be in the bathroom but it is not in the bathroom !

960
00:57:17,439 --> 00:57:20,439
Leo, honey, juste because you're going on television tomorrow 

961
00:57:20,939 --> 00:57:23,939
this isn't giving you any right being so snippy !

962
00:57:24,249 --> 00:57:26,749
It is not that that is making me snippy!

963
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:29,552
- It's him !
- Him who ?

964
00:57:30,053 --> 00:57:30,753
Bob ?

965
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,460
Yes Bob !

966
00:57:32,564 --> 00:57:34,564
Who else am I talking about ?

967
00:57:35,776 --> 00:57:38,776
- Quiet, he would hear you !
- So what if he hears me ! It's my house ins't it ?

968
00:57:39,977 --> 00:57:42,977
Don't you get it ? He faked suicide ! 

969
00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:45,577
Wasn't that a cry for help ?

970
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,587
What is the matter with all of you ?

971
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,683
Don't you understand ?
This man is crazy !

972
00:57:51,691 --> 00:57:54,691
I mean, for all we know, he could be a... 

973
00:57:54,698 --> 00:57:56,698
Mass Murderer !

974
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:03,205
Oh Come on Leo ! 

975
00:58:03,217 --> 00:58:04,717
He's a sweet guy !

976
00:58:05,118 --> 00:58:07,618
He's perfectly harmless !
Maybe a little nevrotic, but

977
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,920
not crazy.

978
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,624
Don't you realize, that everything he's done, 

979
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:15,028
violates the doctor/patient relationship ?

980
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:17,528
And now he's in there, 

981
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:19,546
with our son !

982
00:58:21,343 --> 00:58:22,843
Bob ?

983
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:25,241
Yeah ?

984
00:58:27,973 --> 00:58:29,973
Are you affraid of death ?

985
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:36,081
Yeah ...

986
00:58:36,184 --> 00:58:37,684
Me too...

987
00:58:39,077 --> 00:58:41,077
Ther's no way out of it ...

988
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:44,377
You're going in to die..

989
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,280
I'm going to die...

990
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:49,204
It's going to happend

991
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:51,890
What difference does it make if it's tomorrow 

992
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:54,409
or in 80 years ...

993
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:57,812
Much sooner you get it...

994
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:01,315
Do you know how fast does time goes ?

995
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:04,419
I was 6 like yesterday ...

996
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:06,623
Me too...

997
00:59:06,725 --> 00:59:08,225
I'm going to die !

998
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:12,243
You ... are going to die.

999
00:59:14,826 --> 00:59:17,826
There's nothing to be affraid of !

1000
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:21,332
Well not diving anymore ...

1001
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:25,141
But ...

1002
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:27,848
Treat syndrom.

1003
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:30,344
What's treat syndrom ?

1004
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:35,659
What's treat syndrom ?

1005
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:38,659
Oh, I'm very proud of it Mr Obson, 

1006
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:40,668
very encourage by its success

1007
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:43,469
I think the greatest challenge to me is not for writing.

1008
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,080
Butt head !

1009
00:59:52,085 --> 00:59:53,085
Snup Face !

1010
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:54,689
Don't you ram it !

1011
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:56,389
Turkey tits !

1012
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Open this door ! 

1013
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:04,404
Sigmund ! 
Sigmund Open this door immediately !

1014
01:00:06,014 --> 01:00:07,514
I'm sorry dad.

1015
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:10,012
Sorry.

1016
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:15,823
What is going on around here ?

1017
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,030
Treats.

1018
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:20,728
Treats.

1019
01:00:21,437 --> 01:00:24,437
I'm sorry Da... Leo... Dr Marvin.

1020
01:00:25,743 --> 01:00:28,743
I don't want to ear another pipe out of this room !

1021
01:00:29,448 --> 01:00:31,448
People are trying to sleep around here !

1022
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:32,949
I think it's just kids being kids !

1023
01:00:33,054 --> 01:00:35,554
Well tomorrow is just the most important day of my carreer !

1024
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,960
We're sorry, we'll stop.

1025
01:00:38,663 --> 01:00:41,663
We just got carried away.
It will never happend again.

1026
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:44,969
I want you to be out of here by 6:30, do you understand me ?

1027
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:47,966
The camera crew is coming at 7, I want you out by 6:30 !

1028
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:52,284
Sure, Would you like something for sleep ?

1029
01:00:53,086 --> 01:00:54,086
What ?

1030
01:00:54,493 --> 01:00:55,993
I have valium if you need it.

1031
01:00:56,093 --> 01:00:58,093
No ! I don't need any valium !

1032
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,690
I want some peace and quiet !

1033
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,416
I'll be quiet.

1034
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,220
I'll be peace.

1035
01:01:18,302 --> 01:01:19,302
Come on Bob.

1036
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:21,008
Come on, here we go.

1037
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:24,316
Now, we've got to keep your father calm for Good Morning America tomorrow

1038
01:01:28,595 --> 01:01:30,595
Bob gave you great things to be affraid of instead of death.

1039
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,027
That's nice sweetie.

1040
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,710
That's very nice Bob.

1041
01:01:41,127 --> 01:01:43,127
- Good night fellows.

1042
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:46,631
- Mrs M., could you leave the door open just a creak ?
- Oki Doki.

1043
01:02:19,631 --> 01:02:21,631

1061
01:03:22,514 --> 01:03:24,014
Baby stepping down the stairs.

1062
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:25,931
Baby stepping down the stairs.

1063
01:03:26,437 --> 01:03:28,437
Success, this is a beautiful morning or what ?

1064
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:29,937
Get Out !

1065
01:03:30,145 --> 01:03:32,145
- I had the most incredible dream last night !
- Leave !

1066
01:03:34,255 --> 01:03:36,255
- Good Bye Mrs M. See you later !
- Bye bye Bob !

1067
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000

01:03:48,076 --> 01:03:49,576
Good Morning America's here !

1073
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:01,070
Hi ! I'm Mary Grady.

1074
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:03,175
That's an honor to get you in Good Morning America.

1075
01:04:04,683 --> 01:04:06,683
I watch your stuff all the time !

1076
01:04:06,984 --> 01:04:07,984
- Aren't we jumping out too early ?
- No ! Not at All !

1077
01:04:08,691 --> 01:04:10,691
- I'm Derek Catrell the director.
  And this is our producer Larry Binds.
- Nice to meet you.

1078
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,616
- Well, may we come in ?
- Ya ! Oh sure !

1079
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:22,902
This is our home, 

1080
01:04:24,915 --> 01:04:26,915
I was thinking of something by the fire ?

1081
01:04:29,117 --> 01:04:30,617
It's frieplace shot fellows !

1082
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:32,239
This is even nicer than the pictures.

1083
01:04:32,545 --> 01:04:33,545
Thank You.

1084
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:34,740
Is this your family ?

1085
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:38,042
Yes, yes it is.

1086
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,940
Oh ! Excuse me, I'm sorry,

1087
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,340
this is my wife Fay,
Oh, sorry, 

1088
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,054
And this is my daughter Anna,

1089
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,560
And my son ... hmm 

1090
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:01,681
- Siggy ?
- Siggy !

1091
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,273
Oh ! Hi ! I'm Mary.

1092
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:04,572
Hello Mary, I'm Bob.

1093
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:06,574
Yes, that was Bob, 

1094
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,700
He's a patient he lives down the road.

1095
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:09,979
Dr Marvin, what a great idea ! 

1096
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,990
A Baby Step real action !

1097
01:05:12,588 --> 01:05:14,088
- What ?
- Oh, Dr Marvin's gonna get a patient with him.

1098
01:05:14,588 --> 01:05:17,588
Fine, Lenny listen up how we should shot this fire place.
Let's set up over here and shoot.

1099
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,099
Oh ! Wait a minute !

1100
01:05:21,704 --> 01:05:23,204
No problem Dr Marvin ! We can still use the fire place.

1101
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
You on one side and bob on the other.

1102
01:05:29,277 --> 01:05:30,777
I don't think it's such a good idea to have a patient on with me.

1103
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:32,398
- It is !
- It is ?

1104
01:05:32,797 --> 01:05:34,297
Yeah ! It's a great idea !

1105
01:05:34,686 --> 01:05:36,686
The the better way to show the effectiveness of your book,

1106
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:37,788
is to have a patient on with you!

1107
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,390
I think it's a fireplace shot.

1108
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:41,498
Can I speak to you outside for just one second ?

1109
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:43,901
Thank you so much.

1110
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:46,508
I worked very hard to be where I am, you understand me ?

1111
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:50,213
- Screwing alone, yes.
- I don't want you on the show with me, do you understand ?

1112
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:53,913
- I think I do.
- I'll make up some excuse.

1113
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:55,718
Dr Marvin, Bob can we have you for a minute in please ?

1114
01:05:57,023 --> 01:06:00,023
- I can't Dr Marvin doesn't want ...
- Eh eh eh ! No ! Get in there !

1115
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:02,728
They're waiting for us !

1116
01:06:03,064 --> 01:06:04,564
Right this way.

1117
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,200
In ...

1118
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,100
Three

1119
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:11,700
Two

1120
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:11,773
One

1121
01:06:12,672 --> 01:06:14,672
We're back and we're now going to our live style reporter

1122
01:06:15,482 --> 01:06:17,482
Mary Grady and the Lake Winnipesaukee New Hampshire

1123
01:06:17,796 --> 01:06:20,796
And Mary what is so special about Lake Winnipesaukee ?

1124
01:06:21,201 --> 01:06:22,701
Well Jone, among other things,

1125
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:24,206
 it's the summer home of Dr Leo Marvin.

1126
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,510
Author of the newest sensational therapy in Baby Steps.

1127
01:06:29,117 --> 01:06:31,117
And with Dr Marvin is Bob Willey 

1128
01:06:31,517 --> 01:06:33,017
who is a patient and obviously a

1129
01:06:33,325 --> 01:06:35,325
big fan of Baby Steps Therapy.

1130
01:06:36,123 --> 01:06:38,123
Good Morning Dr Marvin, Bob.

1131
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:39,732
- Good Morning
- Good Morning

1132
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:42,925
Now clearly, to come on national television live 

1133
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:46,043
with a patient, shows a remarquable amount of confidence 

1134
01:06:46,651 --> 01:06:48,151
in your methods.

1135
01:06:59,678 --> 01:07:02,278
False Alarm.
Sorry.

1136
01:07:01,077 --> 01:07:02,077
Okay ?

1137
01:07:05,183 --> 01:07:05,983
Good.

1138
01:07:06,082 --> 01:07:07,082
Now, Dr Marvin.

1139
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:09,787
Exactly how does Baby Steps work on someone like Bob ?

1140
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:15,092
Well Jone, I'm very proud of Baby Steps, enormously gratified by its success,

1141
01:07:16,797 --> 01:07:18,797
I think the greatest challenge aside for the writing, 

1142
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,609
is finding ways to make the ideas accessible to everyone.

1143
01:07:28,325 --> 01:07:30,325
Hum, Bob, Tell us your impressions of Baby Steps.

1144
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:34,526
I couldn't be happier about Baby Steps 

1145
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:38,531
I was a total disaster 

1146
01:07:39,737 --> 01:07:41,737
and now, because of this man 

1147
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:44,047
this morning I'm on TV in front of

1148
01:07:44,244 --> 01:07:45,244
millions and millions of people

1149
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:47,751
I don't even think Dr Marvin know what is going on, 

1150
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:49,251
he can't believe what's going on.

1151
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:51,031
I'm very excited !

1152
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:54,133
You know it sounds like a very intriguing process.

1153
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,236
How long have you been a patient of Dr Marvin ?

1154
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,440
3 or 4 days.

1155
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:01,952
3/4 days ??

1156
01:08:02,862 --> 01:08:04,862
Book is not really ment to work that quickly ! 

1157
01:08:06,073 --> 01:08:07,573
It only worked that quickly with Boub.

1158
01:08:07,941 --> 01:08:09,541
Boub ?

1159
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:09,438
Bob.

1160
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,740
You can call me Boub.

1161
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:12,521
No, I don't want to call you Boub.

1162
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:13,976
Even if you did as an accident.

1163
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:15,182
No ! I really don't want to call him Boub,

1164
01:08:15,982 --> 01:08:18,982
the book isn't make to work that quick.

1165
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:22,024
But it did work that way ! 
That's the miracle !

1166
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:23,917
The Miracle of Baby Steps.

1167
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:26,732
It's not just this book.

1168
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,100
It's this man.

1169
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,260
It's the compation.

1170
01:08:29,754 --> 01:08:31,754
It's the dignity, the wisdom.

1171
01:08:31,956 --> 01:08:33,956
It's the horse sense,

1172
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,660
of the guy.

1173
01:08:37,049 --> 01:08:39,049
That gets you !

1174
01:08:39,653 --> 01:08:41,653
He actually had me stay here last night in his jammies.

1175
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:48,594
Using his tooth brush.

1176
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,699
In his house.

1177
01:08:51,108 --> 01:08:53,108
And, I spent the day swmming, 

1178
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:55,209
sailing with his family.

1179
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:57,110
Fay, Anna and Siggy, come here !

1180
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:04,225
Here is the fam' !
The Marvins.

1181
01:09:05,123 --> 01:09:05,923
This is Fay, Anna and Siggy.

1182
01:09:06,027 --> 01:09:08,027
I want diving with testerday.

1183
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:11,344
Doctor Marvin pushed me in, 

1184
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:12,847
You have a very nice family,

1185
01:09:13,053 --> 01:09:15,053
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1186
01:09:15,256 --> 01:09:17,256
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1187
01:09:22,669 --> 01:09:23,669
Mary, you are wise, 

1188
01:09:23,972 --> 01:09:25,472
what do I say to someone who has turned my whole life

1189
01:09:25,672 --> 01:09:28,672
forever and who is giving some much of time and vacation 

1190
01:09:28,993 --> 01:09:30,993
to make me better.

1191
01:09:31,082 --> 01:09:33,082
What I'd really like to do is put the greatness of this man in perspective.

1192
01:09:33,497 --> 01:09:36,497
I think there's really only 3 names 

1193
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,205
Dr Albert Schweitzer,

1194
01:09:39,016 --> 01:09:40,516
Mother Trice of Calcuta probably,

1195
01:09:41,419 --> 01:09:43,419
and Leo Marvin.

1196
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:49,203
The book is Baby Steps, the author is Dr Leo Marvin,

1197
01:09:49,307 --> 01:09:51,307
and we've been talking with Bob Willey 

1198
01:09:51,714 --> 01:09:53,214
Pretty impressive stuff Bob !

1199
01:09:53,515 --> 01:09:54,515
Dr Marvin.

1200
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,620
Back to you June.

1201
01:09:56,075 --> 01:09:59,075
Way to go Bobby !

1202
01:10:02,588 --> 01:10:03,788
That was wonderful Bob !

1203
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:05,087
Thank you very much Mary.

1204
01:10:05,386 --> 01:10:06,386
We can come out after a few month and talk about your problems ?

1205
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:09,090
Hum, as long as it is ok with my doctor ?

1206
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,198
What ?
Oh !

1207
01:10:13,406 --> 01:10:14,406
Absolutely !

1208
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:15,809
That's a very good idea !

1209
01:10:16,316 --> 01:10:17,016
Ok Great !

1210
01:10:17,148 --> 01:10:18,148
Come on dad ! We're taking a picture !

1211
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,270
- Come on !
- Come on Dr Marvin !

1212
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:22,870
- Come on !
- No...

1213
01:10:23,186 --> 01:10:24,686
You got that ...

1214
01:10:25,285 --> 01:10:26,785
All right.

1215
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:29,082
- How long do you stay ?
- Just till labour day and then we go back to New York City.

1216
01:10:29,587 --> 01:10:31,087
Ok.. Big smiles everybody !

1217
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:35,394

Ok, bye bye.

1219
01:10:38,599 --> 01:10:39,599
Good Bye Mary.

1220
01:10:40,701 --> 01:10:41,701
Bye bye.

1221
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:43,609
That was nice talking to you !

1222
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:50,214

1223

You wer great Bob !

You were incredible !

1225
01:11:00,653 --> 01:11:02,153
Here is the one who made me happy !

1226
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:05,758
- Oh Sweetie !
- Dr Leo Marvin !

1227
01:11:08,467 --> 01:11:09,967
Get Out...

1228
01:11:10,072 --> 01:11:12,072
No we won't get out ! You deserve it !

1229
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,180
I mean , GET OUT !

1230
01:11:18,861 --> 01:11:20,862
GET OUT !!

1231
01:11:20,462 --> 01:11:21,462
Is it something I said ?

1232
01:11:21,566 --> 01:11:23,066
You ruined my life !

1233
01:11:23,271 --> 01:11:24,771
You ruined my career !

1234
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,573
You ruined my book !

1235
01:11:26,774 --> 01:11:28,774
You put a perfectly peaceful house into an insame asylum !

1236
01:11:29,482 --> 01:11:30,982
Get out !!

1237
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,080
- Daddy !
- What's got into you ?

1238
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:34,788
It was a disaster Fay !

1239
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:37,003
No it wasn't you were wonderful sweetie !

1240
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:40,707
You were fine dad !

1241
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:42,910
Why do you need to keep Bob out of the house ?

1242
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:44,204
You think he's gone ?

1243
01:11:44,603 --> 01:11:46,603
He's not gone !
That's the all point !

1244
01:11:46,905 --> 01:11:48,405
He's never gone !!

1245
01:11:48,713 --> 01:11:50,213
Is this some radical new therapy ?

1246
01:11:50,314 --> 01:11:51,814
YOU SEE ??

1247
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:56,724
We can't be expected to understant,
he's so far above us !

1248
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,333
We're like ropes on a goodyear blim.

1249
01:12:05,938 --> 01:12:07,938
Are you all right ?

1250
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:11,344
I want to apologies to you for that terrible outverse,

1251
01:12:12,552 --> 01:12:14,552
I'm trully sorry.

1252
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,577
call it the show-business nerves.

1253
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:19,586
Oh, we can all certainly understand that !

1254
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:21,985
A lot of people freeze on TV dad !

1255
01:12:22,896 --> 01:12:23,896
Thank you.

1256
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:25,394
Bob...

1257
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:27,899
how do you feel about you and me having a little talk ?

1258
01:12:29,305 --> 01:12:31,305
Just me and you ?

1259
01:12:31,904 --> 01:12:33,904
I think I'dle like to spend a little time with you,

1260
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:36,212
pay you back, for all the time you spent with me.

1261
01:12:37,713 --> 01:12:39,713
What do you say ?
Do you feel like for a little ride ?

1262
01:12:40,331 --> 01:12:41,831
Do I ??

1263
01:12:45,341 --> 01:12:47,341
- This is so sweet !
- It's really nice dad !

1264
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:52,234
Look how happy he is !

1265
01:13:07,374 --> 01:13:09,370
Try to be home by 7.

1266
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:22,119
Where we're going ?

1267
01:13:22,624 --> 01:13:24,124
Intensive psychotherapy.

1268
01:13:24,622 --> 01:13:26,122
Waow !

1269
01:13:26,427 --> 01:13:27,927
Okay !

1270
01:13:28,031 --> 01:13:30,031
Some free association from my infancy...

1271
01:13:32,336 --> 01:13:32,736
A beach ball

1272
01:13:32,838 --> 01:13:33,838
A dog

1273
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:35,742
A frog

1274
01:13:36,543 --> 01:13:37,543
A lock

1275
01:13:37,843 --> 01:13:38,843
A puddle

1276
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:40,247
A nuddle

1277
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:41,655
A duddle

1278
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,670
Dr Marvin to see Dr Tobski.

1279
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:52,573
Dr Leo Marvin.

1280
01:13:53,073 --> 01:13:55,073

01:14:17,549 --> 01:14:19,049
Hello Leo ! Long time no see !

01:14:21,948 --> 01:14:23,948
Well this is the friend you called about !

1287
01:14:24,148 --> 01:14:26,148
Bob Willey ! I would like you to meet your new pal, Dr Tobski. 

1288
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:28,158
Hello Bob.

1289
01:14:28,646 --> 01:14:29,882
New Pal ?
What's wrong with my old pal ?

1290
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,758
Would you show Mr Willey to his room please ?

Really appreciating you're helping me on this Catherine.

1295
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:48,840
I can only hold him for 24 hours Leo, without staff corraboration.

1296
01:14:53,373 --> 01:14:55,373
Not to worry about that !
I'm sure your entire staff will corroborate !

1297
01:14:57,567 --> 01:14:59,067
Thank you, Thank you very much Catherine.

1298
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:01,554
- You're welcome !
- Thank you.

1299
01:15:15,561 --> 01:15:16,361
Ahh, you see Bob, 

1300
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,553
I will not be defeated !

1301
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,960
I won't negociate and I won't compromise the defeat !

1302
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:27,897

Oh ! Sorry !

01:16:05,736 --> 01:16:06,736
What ?

1309
01:16:07,139 --> 01:16:08,139
No !

1310
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:09,344
No !!

1311
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:12,440
- Son of a bitch !
- Where's Bob ?

1312
01:16:12,449 --> 01:16:13,449
- Son of a bitch !!
- Where's Bob ??

1313
01:16:15,574 --> 01:16:17,574
Honey ! Where's Bob ?

1314
01:16:20,461 --> 01:16:22,461
What about Bob ?

1315
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,778
What about Bob ?

1316
01:16:24,986 --> 01:16:26,986
WHAT ABOUT BOB ?

1317
01:16:28,701 --> 01:16:31,701
It's a female !
Do you think I'm wearing something ?

1318
01:16:35,706 --> 01:16:38,706
But, it reminds me my favorite poem,
which is ..

1319
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:40,117
Well this is a red,

1320
01:16:40,213 --> 01:16:41,613
fouled as a blue,

1321
01:16:41,622 --> 01:16:43,022
I'm a skit as franck

1322
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,240
and so am I.

1323
01:16:59,925 --> 01:17:00,925
So the psychiatrist says...

1324
01:17:06,634 --> 01:17:08,134
It's not the joke yet !
Wait a second ...

1325
01:17:08,344 --> 01:17:09,844
He draws a picture of a tree, what do you think of that one ?

1326
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,750
He answered sex, ok, he draws the picture of a car, sex, sex 

1327
01:17:14,854 --> 01:17:16,854
Then the doctor says, you're obssesed with sex !

1328
01:17:17,856 --> 01:17:19,856
And the patient says, oh ! you're the one drawing dirty pictures !

1329
01:17:20,962 --> 01:17:22,962
I'm giving you back your admitting form Leo,

1330
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:23,960
to save you an embarassment.

1331
01:17:24,091 --> 01:17:25,091
- EMBARASSMENT ?
- Yeah !

1332
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:29,401
Catherine ! You have been dubted, by a brilliant sociopath !

1333
01:17:33,352 --> 01:17:35,352
Brilliant enough to dubt my entire staff ?

1334
01:17:36,256 --> 01:17:37,256
I doubt that !

1335
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,153
Look, it's perfectly natural for a patient to bind with his analyst !

1336
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:44,657
If you want to be rid of him, just tell him you won't treat him anymore !

1337
01:17:46,068 --> 01:17:47,568
Catherine, that's easy for you to say !

1338
01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:49,778
The man is human crazy-glue !

1339
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:52,569
You should have never let him sleep in your pijamas Leo !

1340
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:54,873
I can't believe I'm hearing this !

1341
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:56,538
Relax Leo !

1342
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:57,539
I'm relaxed !!

1343
01:17:57,842 --> 01:17:58,842
Take a vacation !

1344
01:17:58,942 --> 01:17:59,942
I'm on vacation !!

1345
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,750
Maybe you should check in here for a few days...

1346
01:18:03,954 --> 01:18:05,954
We can handle on things.

1347
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:14,756
It was an interesting morning, fruitful,

1348
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:17,058
but it lacks the intensity that you and I generate together.

1349
01:18:18,262 --> 01:18:20,262
the sparks that we get one on one 

1350
01:18:20,975 --> 01:18:22,975
we should discut out a way to work around your schedule,

1351
01:18:24,782 --> 01:18:26,782
do we work afternoons ?

1352
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:27,980
2 to 4 ?

1353
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,990
3 to 5 ?

1354
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:31,090
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday ?

1355
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,625
You think we'd rather work on mornings ?

1356
01:18:44,028 --> 01:18:45,528
Get Out !!

1357
01:18:51,347 --> 01:18:53,347
It's a combustible relationship isn't it ?

1358
01:18:53,965 --> 01:18:55,965
Is it just you and me ? 
or it it you and everybody ?

1359
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:04,985
Hoy !

1360
01:19:22,831 --> 01:19:24,831
Excuse me Officer ?

1361
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,940
Can you please make sure he's home by 7 ?

1362
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:36,811
Hey ! Didn't I see that guy on TV ?

1363
01:20:18,697 --> 01:20:20,697
Oh Damn !
Son of a Bitch !

1364
01:20:27,412 --> 01:20:28,695
I'm Home !

1365
01:20:32,981 --> 01:20:33,931
Fay !

1366
01:20:37,311 --> 01:20:39,357
We're all here sweetie !

1367
01:20:48,628 --> 01:20:49,811
SURPRISE !

1368
01:20:51,608 --> 01:20:53,612
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !

1369
01:20:55,293 --> 01:20:57,297
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !

1370
01:20:57,697 --> 01:20:59,880
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MARVIN !

1371
01:21:01,451 --> 01:21:03,455
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !

1372
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,701
Dad, what happend ?

1373
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:42,825
Dad ?

1374
01:21:43,217 --> 01:21:45,183
Honey, you're a mess !
Are you all right ?

1375
01:21:46,432 --> 01:21:47,987
Oh yeah yeah !

1376
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,456
Just a little car trouble !

1377
01:21:51,665 --> 01:21:53,751
Ohhh on your birthday ...

1378
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:57,037
Happy birthday Leo !

1379
01:21:56,853 --> 01:21:58,651
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEO !

1380
01:22:00,842 --> 01:22:04,014
Sweetie, we have a great big surprise for you !

1381
01:22:06,286 --> 01:22:09,060
You sister Lily is here from Chicago !

1382
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:12,169
Happy birthday Leo !

1383
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,005
Lily !!

1384
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:17,752
We are all here for you Dr M. ! 
This is your night !

1385
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,858
DON'T TOUCH MY SISTER !

1386
01:22:40,776 --> 01:22:43,435
I've never seen him like this Phil...

1387
01:22:42,647 --> 01:22:45,369
He's been under a lot of stress Fay,

1388
01:22:44,784 --> 01:22:47,740
Bob, his interview which didn't go so well...

1389
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,114
- And his birthday...
- Exactly...

1390
01:23:06,894 --> 01:23:09,670
Phil, do you think Leo was surprised ?

1391
01:23:09,878 --> 01:23:11,575
Oh I think so !

1392
01:23:11,417 --> 01:23:13,026
- How is he ?
- I'm leaving a prescription for PROZAC.

1393
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:18,958
Excuse me Phil, but with these particular symptoms, is PROZAC the right choice ?

1394
01:23:20,284 --> 01:23:22,759
You think PROZAC is a mistake ?

1395
01:23:22,401 --> 01:23:26,750
For this kind of episode, I would says LIBERRINE is a more effective management tool.

1396
01:23:26,739 --> 01:23:29,818
You could be right, I'll rewrite the prescription.

1397
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:35,230
Bob, why do you think Leo act to you like that ?

1398
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:37,440
I don't know ! He's been tensed today, 

1399
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:41,392
But don't worry, no matter how long it takes, I'm gonna stay on and help the family to be the daddy !

1400
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,896
You are such a good friend !
Leo is lucky to have you !

1401
01:23:51,744 --> 01:23:53,503
Thank you sweetie !
Oh, no problem !

1402
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,168
It's been a real pleasure !

1403
01:24:00,538 --> 01:24:02,178
Keep me posted !

1404
01:24:02,473 --> 01:24:03,470
Okay !

1405
01:24:04,102 --> 01:24:05,569
- Bye Lily !
- Good Bye

1406
01:24:07,096 --> 01:24:08,379
Bye Lily !

1407
01:24:23,104 --> 01:24:25,354
This is so hard Bob, but...

1408
01:24:24,797 --> 01:24:27,876
We're not defending Leo's behaviour in anyway so...

1409
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:34,116
please don't take this personnaly !

1410
01:24:34,228 --> 01:24:35,319
Oh no...

1411
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:40,403
That how irrational the reasons, Leo is so upset at you,

1412
01:24:43,534 --> 01:24:47,535
We just think it would be best if you're not here when he wakes up.

1413
01:24:53,086 --> 01:24:55,942
Please, that's not the way I want it !

1414
01:24:55,782 --> 01:24:56,967
Me either.

1415
01:24:57,423 --> 01:24:58,420
Or me.

1416
01:25:03,124 --> 01:25:05,077
You want me to go ?

1417
01:25:05,628 --> 01:25:06,813
I'm sorry.

1418
01:25:13,686 --> 01:25:14,775
Really ?

1419
01:25:20,946 --> 01:25:22,084
Good Bye.

1420
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:25,062
Later !

1421
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,445
- Good bye Bob !
- Bye Anna !

1422
01:25:30,883 --> 01:25:32,893
- Take care of yourself !
- Okay , and you take care of Leo !

1423
01:25:34,365 --> 01:25:37,051
Just temporarly disconnected, that's all !

1424
01:25:40,456 --> 01:25:43,053
You know, I've got to tell you !

1425
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,721
I've got the greatest vacation with you all !

1426
01:26:13,617 --> 01:26:15,357
No ! Too messy !

1427
01:26:16,444 --> 01:26:18,663
No ! Not painfull enough !

1428
01:26:29,827 --> 01:26:30,777
Yes !

1429
01:26:38,978 --> 01:26:41,044
He's not at the dock !

1430
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:41,978
He's not downstairs !

1431
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:44,512
Let's get the car ! Come on !

1432
01:26:43,644 --> 01:26:45,951
Maybe he went for a walk !

1433
01:27:15,123 --> 01:27:16,214
Allo !!!

1434
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:20,470
Oh God !

1435
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,419
Doctor Marvin !

1436
01:27:24,188 --> 01:27:25,277
Doctor !

1437
01:27:26,165 --> 01:27:27,922
Doctor Leo Marvin !

1438
01:27:28,963 --> 01:27:30,290
Dr Marvin !

1439
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:34,040
Dr Marvin !!

1440
01:27:34,387 --> 01:27:35,712
Hello Bob !

1441
01:27:37,146 --> 01:27:39,807
What are you doing with a riffle ?

1442
01:27:38,693 --> 01:27:40,725
Get back ! Get back !

1443
01:27:41,349 --> 01:27:43,247
- What are you doing ?
- Quick ! quick !

1444
01:27:44,819 --> 01:27:46,230
Stand there !

1445
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:48,086
Dad !
Where are you ?

1446
01:27:54,126 --> 01:27:56,058
Where goes the fam' ?

1447
01:27:55,506 --> 01:27:57,476
You'll be very quiet !

1448
01:27:57,498 --> 01:27:59,772
And do exactly as I say !

1449
01:27:59,378 --> 01:28:00,791
Turn around !

1450
01:28:00,712 --> 01:28:01,803
and move

1451
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:03,897
- Where to ?
- Death therapy Bob !

1452
01:28:04,578 --> 01:28:07,337
- It's a gurantee cure.
- Wow ! 

1453
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:08,993
You should I put my hands up ?

1454
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:10,461
Yes that's good ! do that !

1455
01:28:10,115 --> 01:28:12,066
- Err, which way ? 
- To the left !

1456
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:13,926
To the left, yes !

1457
01:28:14,925 --> 01:28:18,972
It is so right that we have come together, isn't it right Dr Marvin ?

1458
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,124
I know it was ment to be !

1459
01:28:20,592 --> 01:28:22,408
- You think so Bob ?
- Yes !

1460
01:28:22,587 --> 01:28:24,344
Because It's time !

1461
01:28:24,398 --> 01:28:25,997
And I'm ready !

1462
01:28:25,629 --> 01:28:28,537
But Dr Godswell didn't think I was ready...

1463
01:28:27,966 --> 01:28:29,592
And Dr Rosingay and Tcheski.

1464
01:28:31,499 --> 01:28:34,493
I was certainly not ready for Malestine or Miller.

1465
01:28:36,885 --> 01:28:39,726
But with you ! Finnally , I'm ready !

1466
01:28:40,624 --> 01:28:44,713
What do you think is the difference between the others guys and me Bob ?

1467
01:28:43,621 --> 01:28:46,218
Is that now I'm gonna kill you !

1468
01:28:45,588 --> 01:28:48,856
But if you shoot me, our therapy will be over !

1469
01:28:50,897 --> 01:28:53,307
I'm not gonna shoot you Bob !
I don't think I can shoot anybody !

1470
01:28:53,801 --> 01:28:55,905
I'm gonna blow you up !

1471
01:28:57,734 --> 01:29:00,269
This is called black powder Bob !

1472
01:29:03,688 --> 01:29:05,155
Here you go !

1473
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:06,738
How much is this ?

1474
01:29:07,533 --> 01:29:09,212
20 pounds worth !

1475
01:29:11,324 --> 01:29:13,439
You understand don't you ?

1476
01:29:12,824 --> 01:29:15,361
That there is no other solution !

1477
01:29:14,342 --> 01:29:16,199
You won't go away !

1478
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:17,213
- I will !
- No you won't !

1479
01:29:17,902 --> 01:29:20,212
You're just saying you will, 

1480
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:23,856
But after, if I don't kill you, you show up again.

1481
01:29:23,026 --> 01:29:26,837
And you make everyone in my life think you are wonderful
and I'm a schmock

1482
01:29:27,247 --> 01:29:29,353
I'm not a schmock Bob !

1483
01:29:30,496 --> 01:29:34,559
And I won't let you take my family away, just beacause you're crazy engouh to be fun !

1484
01:29:46,938 --> 01:29:49,529
You'll take care of Gil for me ?

1485
01:29:48,796 --> 01:29:52,567
Yeah don't worry ! I'll feed him until is big jelly is fat !

1486
01:29:52,438 --> 01:29:54,778
And then I'll eat him Bob !

1487
01:29:55,758 --> 01:29:58,321
You sure aren't convincing Dr M. !

1488
01:30:03,786 --> 01:30:05,426
This is tricky !

1489
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:13,413
What ?? Oh ! It's terrible news Fay !

1490
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,888
Well he tryied to commit suicide once before
and we should have seen this coming.

1491
01:30:17,929 --> 01:30:18,929
More fish anyone ?

1492
01:30:20,347 --> 01:30:22,069
I'm all tied up...

1493
01:30:23,088 --> 01:30:24,547

1494

1496
01:30:34,522 --> 01:30:36,610
I'm all tied up inside...

1497
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:40,492
and those dirty bombs means that ...

1498
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:43,469
If I don't...

1499
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:46,922
Untie myself inside the emotional knots ...

1500
01:30:50,274 --> 01:30:52,035

1517
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,059

1518
01:32:16,396 --> 01:32:17,907

1519
01:32:20,142 --> 01:32:22,184

Bob, just please ...

1528
01:32:54,337 --> 01:32:56,333
Dr Leo is a genius !

1529
01:32:56,155 --> 01:32:59,216
Your death therapy cured me, you're a genius !

1530
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:02,859
What are you doing here ?

1531
01:33:02,978 --> 01:33:04,948
You killed me doctor !

1532
01:33:06,574 --> 01:33:09,298
The bags I put around your neck Bob,

1533
01:33:08,212 --> 01:33:09,850
Where are they ?

1534
01:33:09,406 --> 01:33:10,821
In the House.

1535
01:33:11,603 --> 01:33:12,553
Why ?

1536
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:29,194
Sweetie ... our house ?

1537
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,183
Oups...

Burn Burn Burn !

1539
01:34:02,146 --> 01:34:05,075
You think he can hear us talk to him ?

1540
01:34:04,456 --> 01:34:06,450
Can we talk to him ?

1541
01:34:05,888 --> 01:34:08,523
I don't know if it will help you. Try.

1542
01:34:08,359 --> 01:34:09,903

1543

1546
01:34:16,715 --> 01:34:18,490

01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:20,524
Daddy it's me Anna !

1548
01:34:20,648 --> 01:34:23,155
Leo, it's me Lily, your sister !

1549
01:34:23,894 --> 01:34:26,371
We don't care about the house !

1550
01:34:26,281 --> 01:34:28,056
Come back to us !

1551
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:30,192
The worst is over !

1552
01:34:30,257 --> 01:34:33,217

1553
01:34:37,112 --> 01:34:41,705
Do you Bob Willey take Lily Marvin, to be your loveful wife, loves honor and cherrish her

1555
01:34:46,428 --> 01:34:49,089

1557
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:59,426
If anyone here, knows any reason why these two 
should not be joined together in the holly matrimony

1558
01:35:02,737 --> 01:35:05,392
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

1559
01:35:17,231 --> 01:35:19,834
Then by the power invested in me...

1560
01:35:19,902 --> 01:35:23,501

1561
01:35:22,930 --> 01:35:24,554
