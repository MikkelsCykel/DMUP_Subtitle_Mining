00:00:06,317 --> 00:00:07,215
Thanks, Donna.

00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:09,719
MR. STEWART:
Come over here, Justin.

3
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:11,652
Okay. Who's next?

4
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:12,711
TED: Grandma!

5
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:16,887
- It's from me and Ted.
- What?

6
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,792
[Shouting]
She can't hear very well!

7
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:20,125
It's from Donna and me!

8
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:21,392
Thank you, dear.

9
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:26,130
What is it?

10
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:28,195
It's an all-in-one
remote control!

11
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:31,867
Now you don't have to fuss
with all those gadgets anymore!

12
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:35,310
Thank you, dear.
Oh, Merry Christmas, Ted.

13
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:37,979
Thank you, Donna.

14
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,949
Now it's your turn.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,950
You said we weren't
gonna do presents.

16
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:46,250
Just open it.

17
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:49,088
He said we weren't
gonna do presents.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,787
TED:
I said that.

19
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:52,989
- Oh, my God.
- What do you think?

20
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:54,793
- You like it?
- It's so beautiful.

21
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,458
It has two time zones.

22
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,399
If a passenger asks you
what time it is,

23
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,063
you can think about me.
[Laughs]

24
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:03,333
I love it.

25
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,238
MR. STEWART:
She's a great gal.

26
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:06,401
I think so.

27
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:09,605
Oh, you're not out
of the woods yet, Donna.

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,045
You got one more present.

29
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,447
- From all of us.
- [Laughter]

30
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:20,083
It's the annual
Stewart family uniform!

31
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:21,419
[Laughter]

32
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:22,789
I got you a medium.

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,294
- I hope you like it baggy.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:28,992
Time for the team photo!
Everybody get over by Grandma.

35
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:33,465
- Come on, Donna.
- Jensen, get in here.

36
00:01:33,537 --> 00:01:35,596
It's a family picture.

37
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:37,265
Oh, no, Donna.
Don't be shy.

38
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:38,501
Come on, Donna.

39
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,372
- It's flashing.
- Quick!

40
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:47,542
TED:
Quick. Smile.

41
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:49,142
ALL: Cheese.

42
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:55,018
Well, you survived your first
Stewart family Christmas.

43
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,458
It was good.

44
00:01:57,528 --> 00:02:00,190
I never knew a family
could be like that.

45
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:03,165
No fighting.
No yelling.

46
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:07,636
Normally, that "everyone
dressing the same" thing

47
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:09,969
would kind of freak me out.

48
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:14,774
But I even like
that dorky red sweater.

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,951
Is that all that's going on
in that head of yours?

50
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,691
I'm just not used to all that,
you know?

51
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:41,036
Dan.

52
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:43,073
Hi, Donna.
How's life treating you?

53
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,405
All right. I want to get
a confirmation for tomorrow.

54
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:47,466
Sure.

55
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:48,773
[Typing]

56
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:52,475
We got you going to Pittsburgh
on flight 285 at 0800.

57
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,950
Any chance of that Dallas route
opening up?

58
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,078
Let me have a look.

59
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,060
Sorry.
Nothing yet.

60
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,755
All right.
Well, thank you.

61
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,764
Have a good trip, Donna.

62
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,790
Oh, my God.
Christine?

63
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:13,531
Donna!

64
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:14,969
Oh, my God!

65
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:17,807
Oh, my God!

66
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,809
What are you doing
in Cleveland?

67
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,869
My New York-L.A. flight had
mechanical problems,

68
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:24,812
so they dumped us here
for the night.

69
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:26,315
Oh, right.

70
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:28,409
God.
Look at your hair.

71
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:30,454
Oh, yeah, I know.

72
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,455
I'm going for
a more classic look.

73
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:33,956
Goes better with Chanel.

74
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:36,255
Right.

75
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:40,593
I have the sweetest little
apartment on West 73rd Street.

76
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:42,962
Oh, you would be
so proud of me.

77
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,093
You know what, Ted?

78
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,466
If it wasn't for Donna,

79
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:49,506
I would've never made it
through basic training.

80
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,404
Oh, now,
that's not really true.

81
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:52,442
It is.

82
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,909
Actually, just last week,

83
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:56,344
I was thinking about
how well you trained me.

84
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:59,349
I was on the New York-to-Chicago
flight, right?

85
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:03,513
This guy gets on.
He has this huge musical case.

86
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:06,920
He's trying to stuff it
into the overhead compartment.

87
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:10,427
Clearly the thing is too big.
He refuses to check it.

88
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:14,760
So I thought, "What would
Donna do right now?"

89
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:17,562
So I politely said to him,

90
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:21,264
"Either you check it
or you deplane."

91
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:24,337
That's not what I would do.

92
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:25,500
What do you mean?

93
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:28,238
Well, you must,
as a flight attendant,

94
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:31,873
offer the option of buying
another seat at half price

95
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,314
for that oversized item.

96
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:35,852
It's section 23.4
of the manual.

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,787
Well, I can't remember
everything.

98
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,448
[Laughs]

99
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:42,924
But you should've
remembered that one.

100
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,018
It was the last question
on our exam.

101
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:49,524
Say, Christine, do you have
any of those little wings?

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,727
My nephew's been begging me
for some.

103
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:53,827
They don't have them
on express.

104
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:54,996
Let me look.

105
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,666
Let's see
what we've got in here.

106
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:00,175
Whoa.
[Clears throat]

107
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,508
Oh, I love these.

108
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,810
Love it, love it.

109
00:05:04,882 --> 00:05:06,907
I have so much garbage in here.

110
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:09,111
Ah. Here we go.

111
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,619
Future pilot.

112
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:11,950
Thank you.

113
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:13,649
Enjoy.

114
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:15,157
There.

115
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,217
We could do shots
if you want to.

116
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:18,852
Let's do shots.

117
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,988
Want to?

118
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,269
SALLY: Paris.
First-class international.

119
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:35,078
Paris.
First-class international.

120
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:40,239
[Airplane engines roaring]

121
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,846
I think I'm doing very well
at express.

122
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:48,983
But I just can't
stop thinking there was

123
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,584
some kind of mix-up
with my test.

124
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:53,562
Some kind
of computer malfunction.

125
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:55,098
Those things mess up.

126
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,658
They lose luggage or send bags
to the wrong city.

127
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,499
I'm afraid that's impossible.

128
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:02,698
The tests are hand-graded.

129
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,537
Oh, right.
I forgot about that.

130
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:06,598
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:09,043
I'm sure there's nothing
you can do anyway.

132
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:11,104
Who says
there is nothing I can do?

133
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:12,945
I am Sally Weston.

134
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:15,008
I invented this.

135
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:19,546
Before me, they just pointed.
True story.

136
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,789
Wow.

137
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:25,427
I did speak to John.

138
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,430
I asked him
if I could see my test.

139
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:28,988
I begged him.
He said no.

140
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:32,331
I asked him if you could see
the test, and he said no.

141
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:35,429
Don't you worry about John.
Did you see me on "Oprah"?

142
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:38,600
I scared the hell out of that
little wiener Dr. Phil.

143
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:40,507
It's test 1047.

144
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:43,945
Hello.
It's Sally Weston.

145
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:49,742
Oh, my God.

146
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,648
Oh, my God.

147
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:55,851
What is it, Donna?

148
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:58,292
This isn't my test.

149
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:02,357
It's my number.
It's number 1047.

150
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:05,732
But it isn't mine.
Look at those little hearts.

151
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,103
Time's up.
Pencils down. Books closed.

152
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:12,642
Remember to write
your identification number

153
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,009
on the front of the exam booklet
and pass it forward.

154
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,604
So, how'd you do?

155
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:21,149
New York, here I come.

156
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:24,620
I can't believe it.

157
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:27,623
I trusted her.
She was my best friend.

158
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:30,626
Oh, my God.
These answers.

159
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,787
No wonder we sent you
to express.

160
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,694
We were being nice.

161
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:37,063
I can't believe
she'd steal my test!

162
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,062
Wait a minute.

00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,730
That night I had you kids
over for dinner,

164
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:44,365
someone took my airplane soaps.

165

Oh, my God.

166
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,775
She is probably
stealing us blind.

167
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,974
Hell, I'll bet she's got
a whole closet full

168
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,311
of airline property.

169

Headsets. Booze.
Kosher meals.

170
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,647
There's two things
we've got to do.

171
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,519
We got to get you retested.
There's a group next week.

172
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:03,992
If you do as well as I think,
we can reassign you right away.

173
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,222
How soon can you leave
Cleveland?

174
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,992
I'd just have to talk to Ted.

Who's Ted?

This really great guy
that I'm seeing.

Oh.

178
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:18,004
Well, I'm afraid you've got
a decision to make.

179
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:20,733
Yeah.

180
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,543
Well, what would you do?

181
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:26,549
Well, I know what I did.

182
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:28,710
And so do you,
if you read my book.

183
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:31,550
But, honey, it's your life.
It's your decision.

Right.

Well, I'll call you later.

back to Cleveland at 4:00.

I'll take care of that.

I want that klepto picked up

hits pavement.

- Miss Montgomery?
- Yeah?

I have to ask you
to come with me.

You're kidding.

So they're gonna retest me.

We'll celebrate
when you get back.

The thing is,
if I do well on the test,

I might not be back.

I come home.
You're leaving?

Well, we've always said

that Cleveland is
just a big waiting room.

For me, the waiting room was
my life until I met you.

I'm in love with you.

Ted made me feel
like I'd finally found home.

that I was against

That's not procedure.

But apparently,
Miss Sally Weston doesn't have

246
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:04,267
the same respect for procedure
some of us have had to.

00:26:34,804 --> 00:26:37,364
Well, sort of.

489
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,305
In your book, you say,

490
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:43,141
"Don't ever let anything get
in the way of your destiny."

491
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:45,976
Darling, I don't think
you read carefully enough.

492
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:50,075
What I also said was that
every pilot needs a copilot.

493
00:26:50,153 --> 00:26:52,417
And it is awful nice
to have someone

494
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:53,750
sitting there beside you.

495
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:56,314
Especially when you hit
some bumpy air.

496
00:26:56,392 --> 00:26:59,054
Oh, I just really miss him.

497
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:04,430
I just wish
I could get him back.

498
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,127
The last time I checked,

499
00:27:06,202 --> 00:27:08,796
you were a girl
who could make things happen.

500
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:10,964
So stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

501
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,669
And stop worrying
about what he'll say.

502
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:18,241
You're right.

503
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,983
I'm gonna do it.

504
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:26,112
All right.
But we have to move fast.

505
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:29,249
There is a 9:00 p.m. direct
from Paris to Chicago.

506
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,623
If you got the last connection
out of O'Hare,

507
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:34,060
that would put you
into Cleveland in...

508
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,360
BOTH:
12 hours.

509
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:41,666
Who am I gonna get
to cover my shift?

510
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:42,829
Are you kidding?

511
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:45,772
I still give
the best oxygen-mask demo

512
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:46,570

513
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,405

Pierre, I need a uniform
tout de suite.

Welcome to New York, where
the local time is 7:13 a.m.

516

I'd like to personally thank you
for flying with us today
