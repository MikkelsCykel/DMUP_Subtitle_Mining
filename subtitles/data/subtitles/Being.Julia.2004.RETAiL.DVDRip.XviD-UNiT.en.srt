00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,100
I've lived in the
theatre since I was a kid.

2
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,900
What I don't know about acting

3
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,660
isn't worth knowing.

4
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,100
Now, you may be 20 years
old and just beginning,

5
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,740
but I think you're a genius.

6
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,460
You've got magnetism,
but no idea how to use it.

7
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,020
You have to grab the audience
by the throat and say:

8
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,660
"Now, you buggers, you
pay attention to me!"

9
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,180
and remember this,

10
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,540
when you're on the stage acting,

11
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,940
the theatre is the only reality.

12
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,580
Everything else, the world outside,

13
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,940
what civilians call the real world,

14
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,100
is nothing but fantasy.

15
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,460
And I bloody well
won't let you forget it.

16
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,420
The trouble is, darling,
I'm an incurable romantic.

17
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,020
I believe in love,

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,700
I believe in happiness,

19
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,260
I believe in us.

20
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,860
(Archie) No, you don't.
You're just saying that.

21
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
There's someone else, isn't there?

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,300
I love you, I do.

23
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,460
I do, I
love you--

24
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
and I used to believe

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,700
we'd live happily ever after.

26
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,180
Didn't you?

27
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,180
With every fiber of my being.

28
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,540

Good morning, miss Lambert.

Good morning, Margery,

is anyone with my lord and master?

(Margery) No.

Darling, what are you doing here?

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,100
I want an answer, Michael.

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,700
What's the question?

40
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,460
What did I say to you

41
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,620
before we went to sleep last night, hmm?

42
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,060
Uh, I give up. What did you say to me

43
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,860
before we went to sleep last night?

44
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,900
I said I was tired.

45
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,420
It seems a perfectly natural thing
to say before you go to sleep.

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,060
Christ, Michael, you can be
an irritating little shit!

I'm tired. I am utterly exhausted.

I need a holiday.

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,780
Just admit it, Michael.

54
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,940
you've never understood what it means

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,220
to carry a play,

to sweat it out night after night.

I'm the only one who takes it
seriously, Michael, you know that.

All you do is count the money and
think it's a bloody great lark.

about theatre and acting.

gasps when you come on.

Charles, you are sweet.

332
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,780
I thought you might like it.

333
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,300
It's by way of being a parting present.

334
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,660
You're going away?

335
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,980
No. But I shan't be seeing you anymore.

336
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,220
Oh, Charles, not again.

337
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,180
[Inhaling]

338
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,180
No. this is becoming a ritual. Why?

339
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
We have such a beautiful
friendship, Julia.

340
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,900
It's unique in my
experience, but people talk.

341
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,700
They don't understand.

342
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,740
And even though we know the truth,

343
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,660
if we go on seeing one another,

344
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,460
there will be a terrible scandal.

345
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,340
No, there won't.

346
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
Michael and I lead separate lives.

347
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,020
That's why we're so happily married.

348
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,100
More or less.

349
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Jumped-up little tart,
that's what she is.

350
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,300
Never stops acting, on-stage or off.

351
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,380
She's just one big pose.

352
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,780
Dashed pretty.

353
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,940
Shut up, Rupert, don't
show your ignorance.

354
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,500
I know all about her.

355
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,380
We were both born

356
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,540
in the channel islands, Jersey.

357
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Her father was our
doctor. A Jersey doctor!

358
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,660
You can't get more common than that.

359
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,100
It's only common sense, darling.

360
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,220
I don't want to lose you.

361
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,540
I-- I have few
friends. Real friends.

362
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,900
You're the only person in my life

363
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,220
with whom I can be entirely myself.

364
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,820
I'm terribly low at the moment.

365
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
I-- I
need you.

366
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,220
Let's go on seeing each other. Please.

367
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,460
Uh, please forgive us intruding
like this, miss Lambert.

368
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,740
My friend and I are
such very great admirers.

369
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,140
And I wonder... do you remember me?

370
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,940
Florence Coltraine, isn't it?

371
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,260
[Whispers] Correct.

372
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,500
Rupert and I want you
to settle an argument.

373
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,860
I think I used to know
your father in Jersey.

374
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,620
He was a doctor, wasn't he?

375
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,980
He used to come to
our house quite often.

376
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,260
Actually, he was a vet.

377
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,620
He used to go to your house

378
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,980
to deliver the bitches.

379
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,820

Did you like
the-- the flowers?

389

Oh, Mr. Thomas Fennel, Tavistock Square.

390
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,220
Yes, of course, thank you.

391
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Well, uh, I couldn't
decide between a single rose

392
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,180
and every flower in the store.

393
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,460
Is that why you're here
at this time of night?

394
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,740
To find out if I received the flowers?

395
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,980
No. You see, I don't have a phone yet.

with me one day, would you?

I don't see why not.

Well spotted. When's your birthday?

663
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,740
November 20.

Hmm.

665
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,500
Happy birthday.

Uh, but it's not November 20.

Don't be so pedantic. Open it.

I've wanted my whole life.

Good morning, Evie. where's my wife?

In your study.

- My study?
- Mmm-hmm.

Oh, yes, I had a thought.

699
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,020
We should take a country house

00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,260
for the summer.

(Michael) So do you think a house
for the summer's a good idea?

706
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,780
Yes.

707
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,540
Golf, swimming, tennis.

708
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,340
It'll be especially good
for Roger. He loves golf.

709
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,140
Then he'll have to decide
what's he gonna do with his life.

710
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,220
I think he should go to university.

711
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,460
He doesn't want to,
and we shouldn't insist.

712

It's his life.

713
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,540
Oh, yes, I had another idea.

You remember that young
chap I introduced you to?

That American good-looking fellow.

[Clearing throat] No.

Well, he's frightfully good at his job.

He's a wizard with money.

Lots of American ideas for avoiding tax.

for a couple of weeks to
spend his holiday with us.

Why would we want to do that?

As a matter of fact,

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,540
there is a play that interests me.

748
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,420
It's about an older woman

749
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,580
who has an affair with a younger man.

750

Oh, a farce.

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,660
Why do you say that?

752
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,980
Well, because everyone
laughs at the older woman.

753
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,540
No, not in this play. It's all serious.

It comes as a shock to her.

00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,380
What does?

757
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
That she's fallen in love with the boy.

758
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,140
And it happens just when everything

759
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,300
seemed to her so dull and unpromising,

760
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,300
as if her life was over.

761
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,460
She finds the affair exhilarating.

762
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,740
And everyone keeps telling her

763
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,620
she looks 10 years younger.

764
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,300
I trust she doesn't confess to the boy

765
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,740
that she loves him. That's always fatal.

766

Does it sound like something for me?

767
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,380
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Julia.

768

No, your public would
never stand for it.

I know what advice I'd give her.

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,580
- What?
- Break it off at once.

772

It will only end in tears.

But, Charles, she can't do that.

Why ever not?

775
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,260
Because she's fallen in love with him,

776
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,100
That's why. She's helpless.

777

What the devil do you mean?

793
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,700
Well, it's absurd that at her age,

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,860
she should make herself so conspicuous

I'm not a fool.

and they're always seen with the
same man, naturally people talk.

Tom Fennel is a very
good type of American.

He's clean, honest and by
way of being a gentleman.

802
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,940
He's boring, dull, common and a snob.

803

He's just using Julia.
He's a little gold digger.

I think it's frightfully bad form

but let me explain
something to you about Julia.

820
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,580
Sex doesn't mean a thing to her.

821
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,140
it was different in the beginning.

822
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,380
Then she could be somewhat
tiresome sometimes.

823

What about her?

00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,340
You're so good at being blind.

1310
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,420
Oh, thank you.

1311

1312
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,620
Miss Lambert,

1313
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,140
is it true

1314
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,300
you're putting on a new play soon?

1315
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:35,980
Yes.

1316
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,340
If there's a part for me in it,

1317
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,260
could I audition for you?

1318
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,060
I'll tell Mr. Gosselyn about you.

1319
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,260
If you were to put
in a good word for me,

1320
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,020
that would help so much.

1321
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,540
I take my husband's advice
more often than he does mine.

1322
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,180
Oh, and good night. Please, cheer up.

1323
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,300
You should go a long way.

You didn't think much of her, did you?

00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,340
On the contrary, I think
a great deal of her.

She's so energetic.

1334
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,900
have you been to bed
with Avice Crichton?

1335
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,900
Of course not.

1336
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,660
Why not? She's pretty.

1337
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:33,100
She's not that sort
of girl. I respect her.

1338
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,500
Hmm, do you know what I think?

1339
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,900
I think you're madly in love with her.

Are you?

1341
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,820
There's no need to
break up the happy home.

1342
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,700
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't
know why I did that.

1343
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,180
You did it

1344
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,060
because you haven't the
guts to tell me the truth.

1345

You're in love with
that girl, aren't you?

1346
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,500
Why not admit it?

1347
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,100
Is it because you think

1348
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,540
it would harm her
chances of playing Sybil

1349
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,820
in the new play?

1350
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,540
You ought to know me well enough by now

1351

that I would never let sentiment
interfere with business.

I think she's rather a find.

I'll tell Michael.

1355

I'll insist she plays the part.

in an atmosphere of make-believe.

1630
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,780
That's your world, not mine.

1631
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,140
And it stifles me.

1632
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,540
What do you mean?

1633
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:53,300
Once, when I was a kid,

1634
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,700
I was standing in the
wings watching you on-stage.

1635
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,940
It must've been a pretty moving scene

1636
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:00,980
because I couldn't stop blubbing.

1637
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,900
You moved to the side of the stage

1638
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,820
near where I was standing

1639
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,940
and you turned your back on
the audience, and you said,

1640
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,260
in your ordinary voice:

1641
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:11,180
"What the bloody hell the
electrician thought he was doing

1642
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:11,900
with the bright lights."

1643
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,900
And then in the same breath,
with a great cry of anguish

1644
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,540
you just went on with the scene.

1645
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,420
That was acting.

1646
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,860
If I-- if I truly felt

1647
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,100
all the emotions I was representing,

1648
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,020
I'd be a wreck.

1649
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,660
You have a performance for everyone.

1650
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,820
For the servants, for
daddy, for everybody.

1651
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,340
And I don't think you really exist.

1652
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:32,860
Roger!

1653
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:36,260
Once you told me something.
I don't remember exactly what,

1654
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,140
but the exact same night

1655
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,020
you said the same line on the stage.

1656
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:42,140
Even the things you say are second hand.

1657
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:45,900
All I want is for you to be happy.

1658
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,860
You should talk this
over with your father.

1659
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:51,020
Mmm, daddy's worse than you are.

1660
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:53,180
But he only acts one part, thank God,

1661
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,820
and that's the
handsomest man in England.

1662
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:58,100
Then talk it over with
someone of your own age, then.

1663
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,900
Tom, for instance.

1664
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:00,740
Tom?

1665
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,220
I thought you liked him.

1666
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,100
No, I didn't like him at all.

1667
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,540
You've dropped him, haven't you?

1668
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,980
I...

1669
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,780
I suppose I have, more or less.

1670
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,900
Good. He wasn't worthy of you.

1671
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,860
Roger, do you think I'm getting old?

1672
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:36,060
No, not you.

1673
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,700
Mmm, Tom's little tart's
in your play, I hear.

1674
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:49,180
By the way,

1675
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,300
she's having a fling with daddy.

1676
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:02,140
[Nasalized] "How's
your cousin Millicent?"

1677
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,940
and I said you were well.

1678
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,260
He wanted to
know-- Michael,

1679
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,300
I'm not happy

1680
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,780
sitting beside her on the bench.

1681
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,820
After all, it's miss Crichton's scene,

1682
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,580
I think I'm too dominant here.

1683
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,940
Well, move if you want to, but where?

1684
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:20,220
There, on the stool, with
my back to the audience.

1685
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,780
All I am is a feed in this scene

1686
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,820
and it-- it
feels wrong

1687
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,180
to be on equal footing
with miss Crichton.

1688
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,260
I don't mind, really, miss Lambert.

1689
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:28,860
No, no, no, no,

1690
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,540
I'm uncomfortable. It feels ungenerous.

1691
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:34,860
Michael, what if I'm discovered there

1692
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:35,980
when the scene starts?

1693
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:39,220
(Julia) I could sit facing the swing.

1694
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,660
Then I don't have to move.

1695
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,300
I can stay here

1696
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,620
right until miss Crichton's exit.

1697
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:46,060
(Julia) to thunderous
applause, I've no doubt. Hmm?

1698
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,980
Well, I'm-- I'm quite
happy to try it.

1699
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,420
Go from the top.

It was like a scene out of dickens.

1705

[Gasps] He had
the most dread--

1706
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:07,420
You see? It's much better
with me here, isn't it?

1707
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,060
Well, yes, it is,

1708
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,740
as long as you don't mind being
stuck down there for 10 minutes.

1709
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:14,100
Mind? Why should I mind? I suggested it.

1710
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,380
(Stagehand) Lower. Lower.

1711
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,900

[Gasps]

He had the most dreadful cold.

1717
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,340
(Avice) So I said,

1718
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,740
"Should I come back another time?

1719
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,220

01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:37,620

and then give me all
the light you've got.

1725

1728
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,540
Splendid. How was--
how was France?

1729
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,500
Splendid. How's Julia?

1730
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,940
Splendid. And the new girl?

1731
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,660
- We're ready, Mr. Gosselyn.
- Thank you, Mr. Turnbull.

1732
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:08,380
Dolly, have a seat.

1733
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,140
(Turnbull) Thank you, uh, miss Lambert,

1734
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:13,300
Mr. Dexter, miss Crichton on the stage.

1735
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,180
(Turnbull) Hold the banging.

1736
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,380
(Julia) Michael.

1737
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,420
I say, that's awfully plain, Julia.

1738
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,100
Precisely. But I want it for 2 reasons.

1739
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,780
Firstly, it's awfully
good for the quick change,

1740
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,580
just hooks up the back.

1741
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,660
Second, I simply don't want in any way

1742
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:31,900
to distract from miss Crichton.

1743
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,420
(Michael) All right. Happy, Archie?

1744
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,340
Trousers need shortening a bit,

1745
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,260
but that's all.

1746
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,700
And miss Crichton?

1747
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,500
I don't think it fits her properly.

1748
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,340
Especially at the waist.

1749
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:47,620
And she's got such a pretty figure,

1750
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,780
I think it needs to come
in at least half an inch.

1751
01:19:58,820 --> 01:19:59,500
I don't like it.

1752
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,700
Julia's being far too angelic.

you wrap each separately

01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,540
And you, you, you, you couldn't resist.

1951
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,540
It's rather difficult to get fresh

1952
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,860
when you have a cold.

1953
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,100
What did he say?

1954
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,540
[Quavering] "Please, please,

1955
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:59,420
make an old man happy."

1956
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,940
[All laughing]

1957
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:03,500
Naughty, Sybil, very naughty.

1958
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,100
Trying to have sir Philip on the side.

1959
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,940
And I've always found
it very uncomfortable

1960
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,900
on the side.

1961
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:13,500
(Julia) I think we should
punish him, don't you?

1962
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,100
Or you.

1963
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:15,740
[Sobbing]

1964
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:17,180
Perhaps we should punish you.

1965
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,380
But how? That's the question: how?

1966
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,340
Hmm?

1967
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,220
I know. We'll tell Ben.

1968
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,340
[Giggling]

1969
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,780
Oh, don't pretend you've
forgotten him. Ben.

1970
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:36,300
B-E-N.

1971
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:43,700
(Julia) Oh, dear, have I upset you?

1972
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:47,540
Never mind, Sybil.

1973
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:50,900
Just remember all's fair in war and...

1974
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,140
[Sobbing]

1975
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:57,020
War and...

1976
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:02,100
Ph, hell, the word escapes me.

1977
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,940
[Audience applauding]

1978
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,260
(Audience) Bravo! Bravo!

1979
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:21,500
(Man) Bravo!

1980
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,580
You're a monster.

1981
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,700
A wonderful, glorious monster.

1982
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,060
It was great! You were superb!

1983
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,380
Sweetheart.

1984
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:25,340
- A real tour de force.
- Yes.

1985
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,580
[Julia laughing]

1986
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,740
Don't change a word.
Keep it just like that.

1987
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:35,020
God, I hope-- I hope I
can remember what I said.

1988
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:36,700
[Julia laughing]

1989
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,260
[Michael exclaims]

1990
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:41,100
You're so naughty.

1991
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:42,780
That's why you love me.

1992
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,660
Yes.

1993
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,900
[Screaming]

1994
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,660
That cow!

1995
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:53,660
She is vile, disgusting, cruel.

1996
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,620
She is a double-dyed bitch!

1997
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:01,980
We have a hit, Tom. A
palpable hit, my boy.

1998
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:04,860
I want to leave.

1999
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,860
I never want to act again.

2000
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:09,460
Don't be so silly, you were wonderful.

2001
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:12,300
Absolutely superb.

2002
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,100
And now you're under contract.

2003
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,860
It's clear the play's
going to run and run.

2004
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:18,500
So you'll have the opportunity
to hone your performance.

2005
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,580
Just think, 8 shows a week for a year,

2006
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,860
playing opposite Julia Lambert.

2007
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:24,260
It'll be an experience
you'll never forget.

2008
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:27,420
Just have a great time, have fun.

2009
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:30,820
[Wheezing]

2010
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:33,340
[Shrieking] No! no!

2011
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,620
[All chattering]

2012
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:37,780
You're still the greatest
actress in England.

2013
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:40,380
I'm going now. See you at the party.

2014
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,140
And try not to be late.

2015
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:43,180
It's going to be simply heavenly.

2016
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:45,220
I'll be there.

2017
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,780
Splendid. Oh, darling.

2018
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,940
Magnificent. Absolutely wonderful.

2019
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,380
# They asked me how I knew

2020
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,780
# my true love was true... #

2021
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:09,100
(Antoine) Champagne,
mademoiselle Lambert?

2022
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:12,340
No. Beer. A pint.

2023
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:14,460
Everyone here is talking about

2024
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:17,340
how wonderful you were tonight.

2025
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:19,420
Ah, thank you.

2026
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,300
# ...cannot be denied

2027
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:31,740
# they said someday you'll find

2028
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,900
# all who love are blind #

2029
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,660
Your only reality is the theatre.

2030
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:42,500
Anything else, the outside world,

2031
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,460
what civilians call the real world,

2032
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,100
is nothing but fantasy.

2033
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,540
And I bloody well
won't let you forget it.

2034
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:54,460
Rubbish.

2035
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,580
Are you expecting a guest?

2036
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:01,340
Shall I place another plate?

2037
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,780
No, thank you, Antoine.

2038
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:06,020
I've decided not to go
to the first-night party.

2039
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,860
I want to dine alone tonight.

2040
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,780
Quite alone.

2041
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:17,020
# Yet today

2042
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:19,980
# my love has flown away

2043
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:24,220
# I am without

01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,180

# smoke gets in your eyes.

01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:04,860
# So I chaffed them

2051
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,940
# and I gaily laughed to think

2052
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:12,260
# they could doubt my love.

2053
