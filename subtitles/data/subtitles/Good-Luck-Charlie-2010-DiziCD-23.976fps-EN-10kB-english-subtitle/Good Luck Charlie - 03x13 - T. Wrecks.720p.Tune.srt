00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,725
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,425
Hey, Dad. How was your day?

3
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:14,025
Do you really want to know?

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:16,627
Actually, I was just being polite.

5
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:19,328
It was horrible!

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,575
Oh, good. So you're gonna tell me anyway.

7
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:26,875
Toby kept me awake all night,
so I was a zombie all day.

8
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:32,776
You know, I was so tired I used
termite spray on a nest full of rats.

9
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:35,697
Well.. You'll uh..

10
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:39,838
You'll kill them tomorrow, huh, Dad?

11
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,479
I never know what to say.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,894
Oh, no. You know what?

13
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:49,497
I think I'm just gonna lay down right here.

14
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:50,531
Oh yeah.

15
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:52,431
Toby, come on..

16
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:55,245
Work with me here. Please?

17
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:57,806
Help a mother out.

18
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,167
Guess who missed his nap?

19
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:07,105
And guess who took an extra long one?

20
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,790
Check it out.

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,759
I just joined the marching band.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,627
Gabe! Gabe!

23
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:20,695
Gabe!

24
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:22,664
- What?
- Take it outside.

25
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,701
No, Mrs. Dabney just told
me to take it inside.

26
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:29,527
Honey? Honey?
Here's some mail for PJ.

27
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:33,108
Maybe you could take it to
his apartment tomorrow?

28
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,309
- How about if I do it now?
- Okay.

29
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:49,834
This is so great. Hang on.
I'll get my baton.

30
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:54,830
<i>Today's all burnt toast
running late and Dad jokes.</i>

31
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,899
<i>"Has anybody seen my left shoe?"</i>

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,229
<i>I close my eyes, take a bite.
Grab a ride, laugh out loud.</i>

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,830
<i>There it is up on the roof.</i>

34
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,709
<i>I've been there, I survived.</i>

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,912
<i>So just take my advice.</i>

36
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:14,572
<i>Hang in there, baby
things are crazy.</i>

37
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,501
<i>But I know your future's bright.</i>

38
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:21,005
<i>Hang in there, baby
there's no maybe.</i>

39
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:23,825
<i>Everything turns out all right.</i>

40
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:26,137
<i>Sure life is up and down.</i>

41
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:29,931
<i>But trust me, it comes back around.</i>

42
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>You're gonna love who
you turn out to be.</i>

43
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:38,164
<i>Hang in there, baby.</i>

44
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:47,240
Hey, thanks for coming
to my volleyball game.

45
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:49,070
Oh yeah. My pleasure.

46
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:54,764
Getting to see all those cute guys running
around in tight shirts and shorts.

47
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:57,985
But mostly you. I focused on you.

48
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:59,369
Well, it was an awesome game.

49
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,503
I'm telling you, the team's
really coming together this year.

50
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,474
Yeah? Yeah, it must be really
fun to be a part of a team.

51
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:07,325
You know what's kind of sad?

52
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:10,928
This is my last year of high school
and I've never played a sport.

53
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,089
Oh well.

54
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:18,283
You know what?
I'll join the girls' volleyball team.

55
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:21,081
You're gonna play volleyball?
Look, it's not that easy.

56
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:25,088
Well, how hard could it be? You do it.

57
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:28,182
It's very difficult, all right?
I just make it look easy.

58
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:32,143
Kind of like being your boyfriend.

59
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:39,127
Oh oh oh!

60
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:42,308
Oh, yes! All day long!

61
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,992
I got it.

62
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:47,516
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

63
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:50,545
Welcome to Casa De PJ and Emmett.

64
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:53,948
What? Wait, I thought we were calling
it "Emmett and PJ's World O' Fun"?

65
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,579
So, what brings you to our
place to be named later?

66
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,440
I brought you some mail.
Hey! You got chairs.

67
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,921
Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:12,957
Quite the change from Casa
De Drums and Screaming Kids.

69
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:17,104
Oh, let's go with "World O' Fun,
they're already using "Casa De".

70
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:19,842
You know, it's not always
this quiet here, Mr. Duncan.

71
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,484
We're right next door to a fire
station, so we get a lot of sirens.

72
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:27,723
So, does a siren go off every hour
of the night because it's hungry?

73
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:32,404
Does a siren need to be burped and changed?

74
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:36,884
You don't know a lot about sirens, do you?

75
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:40,636
Well, Dad, um, thanks for stopping by.

76
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:42,668
It, uh..

77
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,529
Dad?

78
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,499
I think he's asleep.

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,350
And he's sitting on the remote.
How are we gonna change the channel?

80
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:56,036
- I got an idea.
- What's that?

81
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:57,897
Uh..

82
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:01,359
- It worked.
- Okay.

83
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:04,327
- Wait, wait, wait, go back.
- Oh um.

84
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:06,229
- Ah.
- Perfect.

85
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,150
Okay.

86
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:13,031
Now how are we gonna turn up the volume?

87
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:16,543
- Volume's fine.
- Yup.

88
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,642
Hey, Mom? I need some help
with my science project.

89
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:28,103
Where's Dad?

90
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:32,414
Uh, hello?

91
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:37,804
Why don't you want my help?

92
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,598
Come on, Gabe. I'm great at science.

93
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,112
And it sounds like fun.

94
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:45,070
Helping me with a science
project sounds fun?

95
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:49,811
I'm covered in spit-up. Work with me, here.

96
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,188
All right. I'll give you a shot.

97
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,356
Great.

98
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:56,225
And just so we're clear, I'm
not gonna let you trick me

99
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:59,554
into doing all the work
like you do with Dad.

100
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:04,383
For your information, Dad
enjoys being tricked.

101
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:08,138
It's part of the dance we do.

102
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,971
All right, what's the project?

103
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:14,148
Building a model rocket to
launch at the science fair.

104
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,098
Ooh. Fun.

105
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,263
- When's it due?
- Two days.

106
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:20,463
Two days?!

107
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,269
Why did you wait until the last minute?

108
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,354
Well, that's when Dad does his best work.

109
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:27,815
That's true.

110
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:35,420
Listen up, everybody.

111
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,640
I want you to meet the
newest member of our team.

112
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:41,781
- Hi, everybody. I'm Teddy.
- Wrong.

113
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,074
No, I'm pretty sure.

114
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:46,432
Teddy's too soft. It's too nice.

115
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,748
From now on, your volleyball name is uh..

116
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:51,751
T-Rex!

117
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:56,732
Keep stretching.
I'm gonna get a fresh whistle.

118
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:01,023
Coach likes to give us all
fierce dinosaur nicknames

119
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,640
that go with the first letter of our name.

120
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:06,157
I'm Vonnie, so I'm "Velociraptor,"

121
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,820
Stephanie's "stegosaurus,"

122
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:09,143
Taylor's "pterodactyl".

123
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:12,544
But pterodactyl begins with a "P".

124
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:17,585
Tell it to the coach.
He loves to be corrected.

125
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:22,028
All right, let's get to work.

126
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,570
I'm sorry, I thought you
were gonna get that.

127
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:40,831
Way to go. Nice shot. That was awesome.

128
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:50,257
Oh, are you okay?

129
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:56,103
That was mine, wasn't it?

130
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,175
That's it. Practice is over.

131
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,975
Except for you, T-Rex.

132
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:03,496
I want to talk to you in private.

133
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,777
You stink.

134
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:08,029
Coach, I don't think we're in private yet.

135
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,967
And do you know why you stink?

136
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:10,985
No.

137
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:16,166
When I ask a question, I don't want
an answer, do you understand me?

138
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,268
I don't know what to do.

139
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:19,662
You're too nice.

140
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:21,440
Nice people, they get pushed around.

141
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:24,537
And I'm not talking about
volleyball, I'm talking about life.

142
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,011
- It's just my first day.
- And possibly your last.

143
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:30,368
Now, if you want to stay on my team,

144
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,636
you need to come back tomorrow
and play with some fire.

145
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,955
- You got it?
- Got it.

146
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,423
Oh, and one more thing.

147
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:38,455
Pterodactyl actually starts with a "P".

148
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,428
I know that it's kind of
confusing, but it's..

149
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,189
Get out of here!

150
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:50,704
See? Isn't this nice?
Working on a project together.

151
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:54,321
Nice? It's great.
It doesn't even feel like homework.

152
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:59,242
It's more like..
Home play, or home joy, or..

153
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,426
Too much?

154
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,522
Okay.

155
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:09,032
Hey, Charlie. What do you want?

156
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,893
Oh..

157
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:17,043
I forgot, I totally promised
Charlie I was gonna play with her.

158
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:21,435
Charlie, I'm sorry I can't play with you.

159
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,208
Look, I know you've been feeling
neglected ever since Toby came along,

160
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:30,429
but I'm working on a big
school project with Mom.

161
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:35,910
Oh, you know, go play with
her for a few minutes.

162
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:38,013
I'll just get this started.

163
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,654
If you say so.

164
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:47,254
Where's my toy?

165
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,413
- Just like we talked about.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:55,098
All right, now, let's
head down to the basement

167
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,080
where you're gonna play "sit quietly,"

168
00:09:57,081 --> 00:10:00,381
while I play "watch TV".

169
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:10,575
And then he said that I
stink because I'm too nice.

170
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:14,409
- You know this is all your fault.
- How is it my fault?

171
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,839
You're the one who wanted to join a team.

172
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,648
Well, you could have mentioned
that the coach was a lunatic.

173
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,585
You know what? I don't need this.
I'm gonna quit.

174
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:24,933
Well, I thought you wanted to play a sport.

175
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,081
Yeah, well there's plenty
of other sports out there.

176
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:29,016
I'll do the one with the, um..

177
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:32,744
With the the ball and the
stick and the helmet.

178
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:38,645
Okay, so that would be either
Softball, Field Hockey, or Lacrosse.

179
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:42,211
- Which one's outdoors?
- All of them are.

180
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:45,481
- Which one has the cutest uniforms?
- None of them do.

181
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:48,362
Sports is so hard.

182
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:59,630
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Dad.

183
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:03,064
- What are you doing here?
- Again?

184
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:06,732
Oh, I, uh.. Brought you a
little housewarming gift.

185
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,133
Vacuum bags.

186
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:15,731
That will come in handy
once we get a vacuum.

187
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,592
Well, Dad, it was nice of you to..
Take off your coat and stay.

188
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,840
I also brought..

189
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:27,651
This awesome Japanese monster movie.

190
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:29,459
Your Mom hates it when
I watch these at home.

191
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,216
Put it in the thing.

192
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:35,164
Um.. You know, actually,
Dad, we're kind of busy.

193
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:41,065
That's all right. Don't worry about it.
You're not gonna bother me.

194
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:46,278
Just another peaceful day in Tokyo, huh?

195
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:50,642
Oh, that's gonna change.

196
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:11,886
Teddy? Why are you getting
home from work so late?

197
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:15,104
Well, I had a very stressful
day at the library.

198
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:18,174
One of the patrons was talking,
and I was gonna say something,

199
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,143
but I didn't want to be mean.

200
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:26,044
Then my boss got mad at me, so
I hid in the stacks and cried.

201
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:30,006
Teddy, you gotta stop letting
people walk all over you.

202
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:32,121
- Yeah.
- What are you standing there for?

203
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:35,324
- Get in the kitchen and make dinner.
- Yes, Sir.

204
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:38,265
Get the door first.

205
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:42,483
- Mr. Hammerstone?
- Look at you.

206
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:45,617
Because you quit the team, people walked
all over you the rest of your life.

207
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:48,455
I told you so. I told you so.
I told you so.

208
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:49,645
Can I use your bathroom?

209
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:53,006
- Sure.
- I told you so.

210
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,693
That's it. I am done being nice.

211
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:02,974
<i>Gumdrops and lollipops..</i>

212
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,775
Aw.

213
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,663
No!

214
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:17,262
Hey, honey. How'd you sleep?

215
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:22,663
Lousy. And if that doesn't
sound nice, then too bad.

216
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:26,995
Well, someone's in a mood.

217
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,429
Got a problem with that?

218
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,905
Um, Teddy? Sweetheart, um, are you okay?

219
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:38,018
Because you just seem, I don't
know, completely different?

220
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,859
What? Do you want some of this?

221
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:46,088
Come again?

222
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,458
Well, you know whether or not you want it..

223
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,479
I'm not going to give it to you.

224
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,459
That's what I thought.

225
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,672
Gabe, honey?

226
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:05,559
I'm gonna say something to you
I have never said before.

227
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,280
Right now, you're my favorite.

228
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:15,086
Feels good.

229
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,661
Don't get used to it.

230
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,666
- Hey.
- Dad.

231
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,027
How did you get in here?

232
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:33,239
Locksmith let me in.

233
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,669
He let you into our apartment
without our permission?

234
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,034
Locksmiths and exterminators are brothers.

235
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:42,223
Yeah, we're like cops and firefighters.

236
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:45,560
Just a little less heroic.

237
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:50,061
Hey, you know what? I got you a present.

238
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,133
And you're welcome.

239
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:55,486
A vacuum cleaner.

240
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,347
Yay.

241
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:02,157
Uh, so.. Dad, um, how much longer are you..

242
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,935
Oh. Wait. Pizza's ready.

243
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:10,621
- You've gotta get rid of him.
- Don't worry. He.. He won't stay long.

244
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:13,050
You know what? I was thinking about
getting you guys a sofa bed.

245
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:18,426
You know, so that when I'm here
late and you want me to stay over?

246
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,287
Now.

247
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:22,886
Got an idea.

248
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,597
So, he likes it here
because it's quiet, right?

249
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,236
- Right.
- Watch this.

250
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:27,659
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

251
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,795
Mind if I take the new vacuum
for a little test run?

252
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:30,933
Go ahead.

253
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,854
Okay.

254
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:39,346
Just my luck.. The "shush vac".

255
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:41,147
Um.

256
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:49,390
Um, PJ? What are you doing?

257
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:51,611
What? PJ?

258
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,550
P.. PJ.

259
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:55,351
PJ!

260
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:58,793
Yes, Dad?

261
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,683
What are you doing?

262
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:07,016
Well, I just don't feel like I'm
cleaning unless I hear that sound.

263
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:09,500
Is.. Is that bothering you?

264
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,041
No. Still quieter than home.

265
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:25,943
Ah.

266
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:28,924
Mom.

267
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:31,409
What did you do to my rocket?

268
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,668
Well, uh, first, I built it.

269
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:38,089
And then I made it purty.

270
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:40,727
Feathers? Why'd you have to add feathers?

271
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:43,344
Oh, that was Charlie's special touch.

272
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,767
We also named it. Say hello..

273
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:48,828
To "Rainbow Sunshine".

274
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,594
I can't take that to school.

275
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:56,066
Well, I guess you could always
redecorate it yourself.

276
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,517
You mean..

277
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,758
Work on my own project?

278
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:03,481
Has it really come to that?

279
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,199
I'm afraid so.

280
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,140
It was a good run.

281
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,365
Duncan. I didn't think you'd come back.

282
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:19,515
Did you sleep on what I said?

283
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:25,185
Oh, I slept on it, dreamt it,
chewed it up, and spit it out.

284
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:27,282
All right, Dinos, listen up.

285
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:28,955
We're gonna scrimmage the boys' team today.

286
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,057
Yeah!

287
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:34,018
Whatever scrimmage means, bring it!

288
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,159
Thought you were quitting.

289
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,953
What? You're trying to get in my head?

290
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:45,634
Or you afraid to lose to a bunch of girls?

291
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,675
You trash talk your boyfriend?

292
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:51,655
I'm so gonna do that as soon
as I learn how to trash talk..

293
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:55,616
- And get a boyfriend.
- Oh yeah.

294
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:01,242
Got lucky, punks.

295
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,892
Oh, sweetums! Oh.

296
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,070
I think you broke my nose.

297
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,650
T-Rex, let me get in there.

298
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:19,451
Oh!

299
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:22,964
Oh, my nose!

300
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:25,606
She broke my nose too.

301
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:28,215
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't..
It was an accident.

302
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:29,694
They were both accidents.

303
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:32,758
Sweet mother, I created a monster!

304
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,544
No. Guys, come on. I'm not a monster.

305
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:38,485
I'm not a monster.

306
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,610
Does anyone know when Field
Hockey try-outs are?

307
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:58,954
All right.

308
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:00,612
All right.

309
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,673
All right, I'm done!

310
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:06,444
Come on.

311
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,313
- Wow.
- What do you think?

312
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,894
You ruined it.

313
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,691
Rainbow Sunshine is now..

314
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:18,192
"Black Night Doom Missile Terror Fireball".

315
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:19,963
All right, let's do a test launch.

316
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:23,640
Okay, whoa. Before you do,
I've prepared a few words.

317
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,741
Oh boy.

318
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,221
"From the beginning of time, man
looked to the heavens and said..

319
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:37,465
'Stupid birds!
How come they get to fly and we don't?'"

320
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,810
- I'm pushing the button.
- No, no, no!

321
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,615
I haven't gotten to my favorite part.
Wait, wait, wait.

322
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:43,032
Three, two, one..

323
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,313
Blast off.

324
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,709
Yeah, that's some fireball.

325
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,542
- Hey.
- Hey.

326
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:56,699
What are you doing out here?

327
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,440
Uh, we need to talk.

328
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,107
Okay, but can we do it over at your place?

329
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,208
Because I'm way more
comfortable over there.

330
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,429
Actually..

331
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,314
Actually, let's do it here. Okay?

332
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,235
Okay.

333
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:15,357
Wow, this is really hard. I..

334
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:17,351
Don't really know how to do this.

335
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:22,377
Well, PJ, if it's hard to
say, just say it fast.

336
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,296
It's like.. Like tearing off a bandage.

337
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:27,234
All right.

338
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,515
Here goes.

339
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:33,959
Idon'twantyoutohangoutatmyplacesomuch.

340
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:39,379
You might want to tear
that a little slower.

341
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,453
I..

342
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:46,925
- Don't..
- Little little.. Little faster.

343
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:51,391
I don't want you to hang
out at my place so much.

344
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:56,985
Look, I'm sorry, Dad, but I moved out
of the house so I could be on my own.

345
00:20:56,986 --> 00:21:01,235
Kind of hard to do that
when you're always there.

346
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:02,979
I see.

347
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,830
You mad at me?

348
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,140
No.

349
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,892
- Okay.
- No.

350
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:11,112
No, come on, you're absolutely right.
It's your place.

351
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:14,354
You don't want your old man
hanging out there all the time.

352
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:16,392
No, I do not.

353
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:19,114
I mean.. I mean..

354
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:22,355
Thanks for understanding.

355
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,569
Oh, I'm gonna miss your place.

356
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:30,844
Because let me tell you something.

357
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:33,113
Around here?

358
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:36,632
It always feels like there's
something crazy going on.

359
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:37,829
Oh.

360
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,633
Mom, I think I found the problem.

361
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:41,076
Loose wires.

362
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:44,737
Well dude. Stick 'em together.

363
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:53,792
- Was that a rocket?
- Yup.

364
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,190
Come over any time, Dad.

365
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,851
- How about now?
- Let's go.

366
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:05,543
Hey, Charlie. So, big news.

367
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:10,464
Looks like I'm staying
on the volleyball team.

368
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:15,636
You know, after they make a
few minor repairs to the gym.

369
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:18,997
Speaking of minor repairs.

370
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:26,453
So this is what happens if you let
Mom help you with a school project.

371
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:29,732
Okay, it was not my fault.

372
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:32,489
Really? Because Gabe said
you uttered the words..

373
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,910
"Dude, stick 'em together".

374
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:40,400
I don't recall exactly what I uttered.

375
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,575
Okay. Well, consider yourself warned.

376
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:46,081
If you ever allow Mom to help
you with a science project..

377
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:48,962
Good luck, Charlie.

378
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:58,563
Fly, rocket.

379
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:00,951
Fly high.

380
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:04,180
Hey, hon.

381
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:06,041
Bob?

382
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:07,767
What are you doing here?

383
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:10,015
Oh, PJ and Emmett kicked me out.

384
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:13,535
So I'm just looking for a
little peace and quiet.

385
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:15,975
Well, you're crowding me. Get lost.

386
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:17,407
I'm crowding you?

387
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:19,729
In outer space?

388
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,621
Oh, would you just leave?

389
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:25,040
Honey, I'm floating.
It's not like I can steer the chair.

390
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,657
Oh, well let me help you out.

391
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,718
Hey.. Whoa whoa whoa!

392
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,870
Fly chair.

393
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,091
Fly high!

394
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:37,906
