1
00:00:00,394 --> 00:00:01,594
Am I responsible for this?

2
00:00:01,662 --> 00:00:03,129
<i>I'm afraid you are.</i>

3
00:00:03,146 --> 00:00:04,779
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

4
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:06,864
Our universe
is starting to break down.

5
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:09,066
What we've seen happening
on the other side

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,567
<i>is starting
to happen here.</i>

7
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:14,905
I destroyed their world
to save ours.

8
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,007
May God have mercy
on us.

9
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:18,742
<i>The machine came on
by itself.</i>

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,810
<i>Without Peter.</i>

11
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,178
You think that Walternate

12
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,346
turned the machine on
over there?

13
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:23,547
It's triggered

14
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:24,915
on a sympathetic response

15
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,483
<i>from the one over here;
Yes, it makes sense.</i>

16
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,851
How could he do that
without Peter?

17
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,753
We all thought

18
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,155
that I could turn
the machine on.

19
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:33,390
Maybe I can turn it off.

20
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,259
Dear God.

21
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:39,430
All civilians proceed

22
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,099
to evacuation route
immediately.

23
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,901
Agent Bishop,
take cover!

24
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:47,738
Where the hell
am I?

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,074

<i>Peter Bishop.
47 years old.</i>

27
00:00:58,216 --> 00:00:59,783
<i>Shrapnel wound
in the abdomen.</i>

28

<i>BP is 110 over 70.</i>

29
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,152
Start an IV.
Where am I?

30
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,188
Peter, you were injured
in a fringe event.

31
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,756
You're in good hands.
It's okay, I'm right here.

32
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,458
Lie back.
Just relax.

33
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,159
<i>He's bleeding
pretty bad here.</i>

34
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:10,561
Get me some units
of his reserve blood.

35
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:13,263
Start transfusion now.

36
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,732
Agent Bishop,
please just lie still.

37
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,335
<i>Get me the U.V. cauterizer.</i>

38
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,337
It's all right, Peter.
You're going to be fine.

39
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,817
I'd like to find out
how Peter Bishop is doing.

40
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,152
May I see your badge?

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,688
I don't have a badge...
Yet.

42
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:40,123
I was just promoted
last week.

43
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,526
I have a temporary barcode.
Can I show you that?

44
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:44,428
Sure.

45
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,633
Thank you, Agent Dunham.

46
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,935
Agent Bishop has been
in recovery for an hour now.

47
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:53,604
He should be out soon.

48
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,638
<i>Ella.</i>

49
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:56,974
Peter's fine,
Aunt Liv.

50
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,509
He's in recovery.

51
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,178
I mean, uh,
Agent Dunham, ma'am.

52
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,680
You can just call me boss
like everybody else.

53
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,649
Now, how are you?

54
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:06,650
I'm fine.

55
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:08,685
I remember
being in my SUV.

56
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,053
And the next thing I knew,
I was on the ground

57
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,122
and there was vortex
shrapnel everywhere.

58
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,891
People are saying that
it's the end-of-dayers.

59
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,692
That's what we think,
yeah.

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,561
We think it's Moreau.

61
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,662
<i>Hey.</i>

62
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,497
Peter.

63
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:23,467
How are you feeling?

64
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:25,669
Ah... Just like new.

65
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,173
- So what'd the doctor say?
- Doctor says I'm fine.

66
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:32,175
No. They said to stay
off his feet for a few days.

67
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,944
See? You're pushing
yourself.

68
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,612
Moreau's out there.

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,381
Peter, you got to
stay off your feet.

70
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,549
This is gonna be
one of those times

71
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,583
when you say,
"you were right. "

72
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,485
I'm not gonna say
that you were right

73
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:45,322
because I got state-of-the-art
science on my side.

74
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,891
I feel fine, hon.

75
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,661
Do you remember what
you were saying in the field

76
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:54,898
about the machine
and being from the past?

77
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,700
Well, I didn't say
I didn't get my bell rung,

78
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,035
but I'm doing better now.

79
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:00,203
Two eggs over-easy,

80
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:02,172
bacon, and grapefruit juice.

81
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,409
That's what I made you
for breakfast on Sunday.

82
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,744
<i>Hey, guys. Look.</i>

83
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,883
<i>There's a stage three tear.</i>

84
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,352
<i>We've initiated
Amber Protocol.</i>

85
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:54,958
Psst.

86
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:58,996
Okay.

87
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:19,676
<i>Hey.</i>

88
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:23,046
The security firm
just emailed this video.

89
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:28,819
We think they gained entrance
from the side fire door.

90
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:30,387
Okay, so how come they didn't
trigger the alarm?

91
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,723
It was disabled.
But that's not all.

92
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,959
We think we found
an electrilight.

93
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,832
It must have been a dud.

94
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,334
I believe so.

95
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:47,404
We finally get to see one.

96
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:52,175
<i>"The End of Days. "
Ha.</i>

97
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:54,144
That's one of my father's
favorite sermons.

98
00:05:54,212 --> 00:05:56,580
When the world dies
and a savior arrives

99
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,682
to end the suffering
and usher all the worthy

100
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,716
into heaven.

101
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,184
Pass me those
alligator clips?

102
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:03,253
Of course, if my father
ever met one of the kooks

103
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,188
who's actually attempting
to end the world,

104
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:06,890
he'd probably
kill them himself.

105
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,158
<i>Agent.</i>

106
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:10,894
Eyewitness
statements.

107
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:13,930
I'll let you know if
any of this is worthwhile.

108
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,268
- Anything?
- No.

109
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,571
Not only can I not
tell you how the thing works,

110
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,008
according to all the readings,
it shouldn't be working at all.

111
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,644
You know, there's probably
only one person on Earth

112
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:30,580
<i>who can tell us
how this thing functions.</i>

113
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,282
Walter.

114
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,484
Got any markers
you can call in?

115
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,553
You think now's the time?

116
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:39,956
I think it might be
past time.

117
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,603
Hello, Walter.

118
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:20,575
Must be bad if they're
letting you see me.

119
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,477
It is.

120
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:28,884
I heard a rumor
that the Sun was burning out.

121
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,219
They don't
tell me much in here.

122
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:35,023
The Sun is still shining.

123
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,524
I also hear

124
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:40,195
there's been a massive
increase in Kappa radiation.

125
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:43,031
That one's true.

126
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,734
A wormhole opened
in Central Park,

127
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,402
right in the center
of Sheep's Meadow.

128
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,571
Took us months but...

129
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,439
<i>We were finally able
to amber it over.</i>

130
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:57,112
A wormhole shouldn't emit
that type of radiation.

131
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,915
Not unless it's a wormhole
through time.

132
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:01,216
<i>Exactly right.</i>

133
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:03,385
The carbon levels
were consistent

134
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:05,120
with the late Paleozoic era.

135
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,555
250 million years ago.

136
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:09,758
Paleozoic.

137
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,193
Theropods!

138
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:18,867
My old self would have been
fascinated with that.

139
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,309
How's Olivia?

140
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,843
She's fine.
Thank you.

141
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:34,382
I need your help.

142
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,660
What is it?

143
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,629
We're not exactly sure.

144
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,497
Some kind of light bomb.

145
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,032
It's made by
a terrorist group.

146
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,134
They call themselves
the end-of-dayers.

147
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:54,402
They use them on soft spots,

148
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,905
trying to rip holes
in the fabric of the universe.

149
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:59,474
Trying to accelerate
the end of days.

150
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,843
I'm hoping if we can
figure out how it's made

151
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,645
and maybe trace the parts...

152
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:06,514
We can stop them
before it's too late.

153
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:14,622
Even if I could help you...

154
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,128
I can't do it from here.
I... would need my tools.

155
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:23,198
My special instruments.

156
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:28,870
We both know
that's not going to happen.

157
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,620
<i>Senator.
Hello, Peter.</i>

158
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:46,888
Thank you for your time.

159
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,656
No need for formality
in here.

160
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:50,091
It's good to see you.

161
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,027
Have a seat.

162
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,797
You said it was urgent.

163
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,232
It is.

164
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,500
I assume you've been
briefed

165
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,035
about the end of days
organization?

166
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:02,337
I'm well aware
of the situation, yes.

167
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:03,571
We recovered this device

168
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,741
from what's left of
the opera house.

169
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:09,711
Science Division's been
trying to crack the technology,

170
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,246
but without much luck.

171
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:12,814
What do you need?

172
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,218
I need Walter.

173
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,220
I want you to grant him
a temporary furlough

174
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,622
so he can help us
on the case.

175
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,390
That's out of the question.
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,691
If we can understand
this technology,

177
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,193
we might be able
to prevent future attacks.

178
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,228
Consult with him
in prison if you need to.

179
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:29,297
That's all I can offer.

180
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,733
Why? You worried about
your reelection prospects?

181
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:37,105
You know me better
than that.

182
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,007
I'm worried about that.

183
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:40,742
<i>The entire globe
is disintegrating.</i>

184
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,844
We're running around
putting on band-aids,

185
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:45,246
<i>and every day more people
are lost because of it,</i>

186
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:48,149
<i>and Walter is responsible.</i>

187
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:56,691
I know him.

188
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,794
And I know his intentions
weren't this.

189
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:01,729
But there's not
a single person out there

190
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,798
who hasn't lost someone
they love because of him.

191
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,834
You can't begrudge the anger
they feel towards him.

192
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,269
I don't.

193
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,271
I'm out there in the streets
with them every day.

194
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,706
And, yeah, maybe I am
running around

195
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:14,242
putting band-aids on it
until we can figure out

196
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,910
<i>how to reverse the damage
that's already been done.</i>

197
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:17,045
<i>But at least it's something.</i>

198
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:18,813
And if we can figure out
this technology,

199
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:22,617
I guarantee you we will
prevent future casualties.

200
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:27,989
Phillip.

201
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:36,030
If what we lost in Detroit
still means anything to you...

202
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:38,833
Just give me one chance.

203
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,635
That's all I'm asking.

204
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:55,283
Where are my things?

205
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,752
They're all still
in evidence, Walter.

206
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,721
Don't worry.
Olivia's on it.

207
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,723
Your equipment
will be here shortly.

208
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,291
Mm.

209
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,160
Will Astrid be here?

210
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:08,563
No. Astrid's
a Fringe Agent now.

211
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:10,732
- We need her out in the field.
- Oh.

212
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,101
I suppose since she's
no longer caring for me,

213
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:15,003
she's able to-

214
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,973
spread her wings.

215
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:27,448
May I take
a look out back?

216
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:29,083
My old office.

217
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,766
<i>Just leave him there for now.</i>

218
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,401
<i>I'm not sure
where he wants him.</i>

219
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:49,537
Walter.

220
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:53,775
I didn't realize how much
I've missed swivel chairs.

221
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,746
I've also missed swiveling.

222
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:02,116
There's someone here
to see you.

223
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,385
A visitor?

224
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,033
Walter.

225
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,338
Olivia!

226
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,351
Congratulations
are in order, my dear.

227
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:37,652
What for?

228
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,721
The wedding, of course.

229
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:40,989
Oh.

230
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:43,124
That was a while ago now.

231
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:45,126
This is the first
opportunity I've had

232
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,796
to give you an appropriate
welcome to our family.

233
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,799
I always did want
a daughter.

234
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,668
Thank you, Walter.

235
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,837
For goodness' sake!

236
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:58,406
Doesn't the word fragile
mean anything to you?

237
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,618
Was that you?

238
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:15,657
I learned to control it
a few years ago.

239
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,159
I'm impressed.

240
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,000
So... What's the next
target?

241
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,369
The wormhole
in Central Park.

242
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:32,373
Considering your world
was destroyed by a wormhole,

243
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:34,475
I suppose it's fitting.

244
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:35,677
<i>Is this it?</i>

245
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:39,347
Followed your specifications
to the letter.

246
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,182
More than twice the yield

247
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,018
of the device
we used last night.

248
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:53,995
It won't be long...

249
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:57,365
Till this world joins mine.

250
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:13,807
Boys.

251
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:22,783
Any luck?

252
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,284
<i>Afraid not.</i>

253
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:26,453
Can't make any sense
of this technology.

254
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:30,023
I'll continue to run
diagnostics on the canister,

255
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:33,693
but even if I am successful,
our world is still ending.

256
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:35,796
You may stop this group,

257
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:38,064
but you cannot
stop the inevitable.

258
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:43,570
Our destiny was set the day
we triggered the machine.

259
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:46,573
I didn't understand
until it was too late

260
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:50,710
that our... two worlds
were inextricably linked.

261
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:54,214
<i>Without one, the other
simply cannot exist.</i>

262
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:56,883
When their world
was destroyed,

263
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:00,220
that was the day
we sealed our fate.

264
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:03,223
For all intent
and purposes...

265
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,193
that was the day we died.

266
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:12,966
We don't know that
for sure.

267
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:17,170
Have you seen him?

268
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,407
Walternate?

269
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:25,679
No.

270
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:28,582
Nobody has.
He's become a recluse.

271
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:33,119
Imagine coming over here
to try to save the world...

272
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:37,123
Only to be stuck here
when your world was destroyed.

273
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,160
Not to mention
having the same face

274
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,196
as the most reviled man
in the universe.

275
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,768
I just wanted to say...

276
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:52,305
At the trial,
you spoke on my behalf-

277
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:55,308
Walter, I'm the one
who got in the machine.

278
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:59,145
I'm the one who destroyed
the other universe.

279
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:02,148
The courts perceived
that you did it...

280
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:03,617
to defend our universe.

281
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,986
And so do I.

282
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:09,723
This all began with me,
my... hubris.

283
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,157
Walter-

284
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:13,326
and I just wanted
to say thank you.

285
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,900
No matter who's at fault,
you are my dad.

286
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:55,268
That smells
insanely good.

287
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:56,670
After the day we had,

288
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:58,872
I figured we deserved
better than takeout.

289
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,843
Hey.
How you holding up?

290
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,979
Ha. I'm doing fine.
Why?

291
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:09,215
Well... you know Walter
would always cook

292
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:12,052
when he was worried
about you, so...

293
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,188
Well, of all the bad habits
I could pick up from him,

294
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:17,624
that's the least of them.

295
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:27,634
Amanda from across the street
gave it to us.

296
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:29,803
That's you and me

297
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,238
<i>and the little baby
that we're gonna have</i>

298
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,474
that she is planning on
babysitting.

299
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,010
Oh...

300
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,846
Well, I think we should
get started on that right away.

301
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:42,082
You're really gonna use
a drawing from a little girl

302
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:43,149
to get lucky?

303
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:46,920
It sounds so dirty
when you say it like that.

304
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:49,756
She's a sweet
little girl.

305
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:58,331
You know, hon, if you
wanted to reconsider...

306
00:19:01,102 --> 00:19:05,639
I can't say that I don't
think about it.

307
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:08,842
And that I don't wish
things were different.

308
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,981
Honey, people still
have families.

309
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,283
Look at Amanda.

310
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,886
She was born
into this world,

311
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:22,088
and she's still happy.

312
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:25,525
<i>And the world
could get better.</i>

313
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,002
So I still think
we're gonna have a kid.

314
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:28,369
I hope you're right.

315
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:30,237
In fact, I think
we're gonna have several.

316
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,766
Two, maybe three.
Little tribe of Bishops.

317
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:49,749
<i>Hello?
I understand now.</i>

318
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:52,819
They're splitting atoms...
not as an outcome goal

319
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,354
but as a means to an end.

320
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:55,689
Slow down, Walter.

321
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:57,123
The diagnostics
on the canister-

322
00:19:57,191 --> 00:20:00,093
they show residual traces
of strontium 90.

323
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,995
That's a radioactive
isotope.

324
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:03,897
<i>That's how they're making
the electrilights.</i>

325
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,465
Which means
it would leave a signature.

326
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:08,368
Yes! Like radioactive
breadcrumbs.

327
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:09,969
<i>They'll lead us
to whoever's doing this.</i>

328
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:11,304
We need Science Division

329
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:12,872
to monitor current
radiation tracking maps.

330
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,507
It'll be faster
if you exclude

331
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:16,976
readings inconsistent
with strontium 90.

332
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:19,946
Look for spikes
in the remaining data.

333
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:33,026
This is a campground.

334
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,195
Do you think it's even possible
to split atoms here?

335
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,197
I can see 'em making s'mores,
maybe,

336
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,733
but weapons
of mass destruction? No.

337
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,768
Is this the right
place?

338
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:43,236
The tracking system
is detecting

339
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:45,672
the same radioactive signature
that registered on the canister.

340
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,140
So then where's the lab?

341
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,375
Okay.
You keep searching.

342
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:50,643
I'm gonna call this in.

343
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,245
If you find anything
out of the ordinary,

344
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:54,080
I want to know.
Yes, ma'am.

345
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:58,384
Sir. We found this
sitting on top of a rock.

346
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:00,487
<i>I don't know
if it means anything.</i>

347
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:03,356
- Thank you, Agent.
- Sure.

348
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:12,565
<i>Peter.</i>

349
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,900
<i>Maybe Walter was wrong</i>

350
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,969
<i>about the radioactive signature.
Yeah.</i>

351
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:17,403
I'll go back
to Science Division,

352
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:18,805
see if maybe
something's wrong

353
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:20,373
with the radiation
detection sensors.

354
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,142
Okay, well, let me know
if you find anything.

355
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,943
Yeah. Will do.

356
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:16,312
How come no one
respects my desk?

357
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,917
You're too nice.

358
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,085
Team one, get ready to deploy.

359
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:24,153
Perimeter breach.

360
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:26,188
Sector eight.

361
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:29,959
This technology's 10,

362
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,494
maybe 15 years
ahead of its time.

363
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:32,862
I don't mind saying

364
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,198
it's something I would like
to have invented.

365
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,868
I mean for peaceful
purposes,

366
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,437
mining, maybe.

367
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:43,873
Walter. What about
the components?

368
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:46,008
Where were these parts
made?

369
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,710
I haven't the foggiest.

370
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:52,715
Dunham.

371
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:55,618
I'm on my way.
What's wrong?

372
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,219
There's been a security
breach at the wormhole.

373
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:59,555
Someone in the park
I.D.'d Moreau.

374
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:01,190
Come on.

375
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,117
Hello?

376
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:24,106
Hello, Peter.

377
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:40,489
Why'd you leave me
the key, Walter?

378
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:42,858
I knew you'd recognize it.

379
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:46,762
I couldn't just call you.

380
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,598
Yes, you could have.

381
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,734
No, no, no, no.

382
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:54,070
Not if I wanted
the proper reunion

383
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:56,839
that we both
so richly deserve.

384
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:59,842
So letting me know
that Moreau works for you-

385
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,011
that was your way
of getting my attention?

386
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,747
Among other things.

387
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:09,719
I should have known that
the electrilight came from you.

388
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:11,754
After all, Walter was
the only one brilliant enough

389
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:13,489
to figure out how it worked.

390
00:25:13,557 --> 00:25:16,092
Stands to reason
that you were the only one

391
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,894
brilliant enough
to invent it.

392
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:21,864
Yin and Yang.
That's interesting.

393
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:25,468
Interesting
that you should say that-

394
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:26,869
Yin and Yang.

395
00:25:26,937 --> 00:25:29,505
Why are you doing this?
Yin and Yang.

396
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:34,143
One man broke the universe.
The other man did nothing...

397
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:38,147
But have his son stolen,
his life stolen, ruined.

398
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:43,753
I came over here
at the end

399
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,555
on a mission of mercy

400
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:49,458
to ask for help
for my side.

401
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:53,696
The race was lost,
a race I didn't initiate.

402
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:55,631
But still, I came.

403
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:58,167
And you destroyed us,
Peter...

404
00:25:58,235 --> 00:25:59,969
My son.

405
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,704
You destroyed
your own-

406
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:04,607
you activated the machine
on your side.

407
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:08,677
You were going to use it
to destroy this universe.

408
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:11,313
I only acted
in self-defense.

409
00:26:14,184 --> 00:26:17,586
Do you know what
it's like...

410
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:21,657
to wake up and just
for a moment...

411
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:25,461
Think that everything
is as it was?

412
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:28,597
And then to realize
it's not...

413
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:32,201
That the nightmare you had
was real.

414
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:35,070
Soon everyone here
will experience loss

415
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:39,041
the way that all those
over there did.

416
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:42,178
Air, water...

417
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:44,980
Light, even.

418
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:47,783
But you...

419
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:50,853
You will experience loss
the way I did.

420
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:54,056
What does that mean?

421
00:26:54,124 --> 00:26:56,826
You destroyed
my universe, son,

422
00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:59,562
and I'm going to
destroy yours.

423
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:01,864
And not all at once.

424
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:14,043
Peter's still not
picking up.

425
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,511
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

426
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,181
We spotted a vehicle parked
near the perimeter breach.

427
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,083
- What kind of vehicle?
- A bus.

428
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:23,185
Okay. I want
all tactical teams

429
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:24,820
to enter
the restricted area-

430
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,015
I came here alone,
Walter.

431
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,551
To make a personal plea
to you.

432
00:27:57,988 --> 00:28:01,857
I'm sorry for the suffering
that I've caused you.

433
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:07,930
I'm sorry...

434
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:11,867
For destroying your people.

435
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:15,971
Our people.

436
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:21,377
I'm sorry
for destroying our world.

437
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:25,214
And if I could
take back that choice...

438
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:27,216
I would.

439
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:37,092
But it's no excuse
for what you're doing now.

440
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,995
And it has to stop.

441
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:48,103
I don't want to have
to use these.

442
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:55,644
But you're going to
come with me now, father.

443
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,482
You know, Peter,
if I was really there,

444
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,452
I might not be able
to resist killing you.

445
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,653
I think this is
the better way,

446
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:06,855
so you can learn
about loss.

447
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:09,425
Let's start by killing
someone you love.

448
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:22,871
We're gonna evacuate
the area,

449
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:24,773
try and contain
the wormhole.

450
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:27,276
So can you move everyone
back to sector three?

451
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:56,533
Olivia Dunham...

452
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:05,991
My wife...

453
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,227
was everything to me.

454
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:38,810
Why have we stopped?

455
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:41,613
What is this,
some kind of protest?

456
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:43,948
No. It's the wormhole.

457
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:46,584
They're still trying
to seal it up.

458
00:32:46,652 --> 00:32:48,420
Sergeant, when we start
moving again,

459
00:32:48,487 --> 00:32:50,689
can we cut over
and take Columbus, then we can-

460
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:51,690
<i>Wait. No.</i>

461
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:55,293
Turn the car around.

462
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:57,028
Please...

463
00:32:57,096 --> 00:33:00,231
I need to get back
to my lab.

464
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,158
Diagnostics
are almost complete.

465
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:08,032
You used to call me
"Uncle Walter"

466
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,301
do you remember?

467
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,004
I don't remember much
from before it got bad.

468
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:18,410
<i>I'm so sorry...</i>

469
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:21,880
Ella.

470
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:23,882
I understand...

471
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:27,619
Words can't come close
to mitigating your loss.

472
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:32,223
Truly, if I could go back
in time and change things,

473
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,092
I would.

474
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,227
I would give anything
to be able to go back

475
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:37,829
and make different choices.

476
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:40,265
But you can't.

477
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:43,701
There aren't any happy endings
nowadays, are there?

478
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:51,910
No. I suppose not.

479
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:08,927
I remember the cow
that stayed over there.

480
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:14,666
She had kind eyes.

481
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:18,536
She did, didn't she?

482
00:35:20,673 --> 00:35:22,974
My gene.

483
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:25,610
I do miss her.

484
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,715
Oh...

485
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:33,518
<i>That's it.</i>

486
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,434
Peter, I was wrong.

487
00:35:49,502 --> 00:35:51,436
It's not too late.

488
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:57,742
You can save both worlds.
We can do it all over again.

489
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,646
This time, you-you simply need
to make a different choice,

490
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:03,248
and should
something go wrong,

491
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:05,550
then Olivia will be
our fail-safe.

492
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:07,952
Walter, stop.

493
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,355
Olivia is dead.

494
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:13,024
But she won't be...

495
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:14,659
Not then.

496
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,602
The machine?

497
00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:28,339
I turned that on
15 years ago.

498
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:30,041
And all the time
I sat in prison,

499
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:33,378
I- I-I couldn't figure out
where it came from.

500
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:36,614
I knew the pieces were buried
millions of years ago,

501
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:38,616
but how did they get there,

502
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:41,219
so deep in the past?

503
00:36:41,287 --> 00:36:43,721
But now I understand.

504
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:46,424
I sent them there.

505
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:49,494
The wormhole
in Central Park-

506
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:52,597
I sent them back
through time.

507
00:36:52,665 --> 00:36:55,934
Peter, you can stop
the destruction

508
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,336
before it occurs!

509
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:01,072
If that's the case, just
don't send the machine back.

510
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,507
Then we'll never
discover it,

511
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:04,208
and I'll never destroy
the other universe.

512
00:37:04,276 --> 00:37:06,744
No, no, no.
It doesn't work that way.

513
00:37:06,812 --> 00:37:08,780
I have already done it.

514
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,015
Therefore, I have no choice
but to do it again.

515
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,451
Walter, that doesn't make
any sense.

516
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,953
It does.

517
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,088
It's a paradox.

518
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:20,692
I can't change
what happens

519
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:23,328
because
it's already happened.

520
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:26,698
But you can make
a different choice

521
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:29,267
within what happened.

522
00:37:29,335 --> 00:37:31,936
I simply need to find a way
to bring your consciousness

523
00:37:32,004 --> 00:37:33,204
forward to now

524
00:37:33,272 --> 00:37:35,840
so that you can witness
what will happen

525
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:38,810
if you make
the same choice.

526
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:41,679
Peter, for all I know,
it could be happening already.

527
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:45,350
Don't you see?
We can fix everything.

528
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:48,486
We can cheat
the rules of time.

529
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:55,026
Imagine the repercussions.

530
00:38:03,302 --> 00:38:06,704
There's no way of telling
what the cost might be.

531
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,411
But it can't be
worse than this.

532
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:18,116
It can't be
worse than this.

533
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,155
What would I need to do?

534
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:36,200
Walter?
What's happening to him?

535
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:37,769
His heart rate's
going up-

536
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:41,539
156 and climbing!

537
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:43,274
<i>What's it doing to him?
I don't know.</i>

538
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:44,676
It's been 60 seconds now.

539
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:46,678
How much longer are we gonna let
him stay inside that thing?

540
00:38:46,745 --> 00:38:48,546
Peter has interfaced
with the machine

541
00:38:48,614 --> 00:38:50,214
at a biological level.

542
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:52,417
If we take him out
prematurely,

543
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:55,486
I'm afraid we'll harm him.

544
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:01,756
<i>What is it?</i>

545
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:04,259
Sir, it just started
60 seconds ago.

546
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:05,439
What started exactly?

547
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,377
<i>The machine-
something is happening.</i>

548
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,946
The diagnostics
are through the roof.

549
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,715
Look at this-
the soft spots-

550
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,351
they're not closing.
They're getting worse.

551
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,590
Bring me
Olivia Dunham, now.

552
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,530
I don't understand
what you're asking me to do.

553
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:27,764
The drawing suggests

554
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,634
that you have a connection
with the machine...

555
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,402
That you can stop it,

556
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,971
that you can turn it off.

557
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,778
They outsmarted you,
didn't they?

558
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,882
They know you turned
the machine on.

559
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,818
So they put Peter
in theirs...

560
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,821
And now we're the ones
that are gonna get destroyed.

561
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,296
Something's wrong!
Help me, quick!

562
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,598
Come on,
let's move it!

563
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,780
Peter.

564
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:20,017
Olivia...
You're alive.

565
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,925
Are you doing that?

566
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,904
I understand now.

567
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,609
<i>Walter? Walter!</i>

568
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,144
<i>I understand now.</i>

569
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,447
I understand
what the machine does.

570
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,149
I know what it's capable of,
and I know where it came from.

571
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,484
The first people?

572
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,819
<i>Yes, the first people,
Walter,</i>

573
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,454
but the first people
are us-

574
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,688
you, most specifically

575
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:34,191
and maybe Ella and Astrid-
I don't know.

576
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,359
I don't know who it was

577
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,927
that took the machine
back through time.

578
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,695
But I know something else.

579
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,364
I've seen doomsday,

580
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,800
and it is worse than anything
you could possibly imagine.

581
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,871
This isn't a war
that can be won.

582
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,007
<i>Our two worlds
are inextricable.</i>

583
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:54,444
<i>If one side dies,
we all die.</i>

584
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,714
So I've torn holes
in both the universes

585
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:01,151
<i>and they lead here,
to this room.</i>

586
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:05,455
A bridge so that we can
begin to work together to fix-

587
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,670
you shattered my universe.

588
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,906
You have any idea
how many deaths you've caused?

589
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:25,776
That was an accident.

590
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,645
What you have tried to do
you've done on purpose!

591
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,113
<i>Whatever
you've both done,</i>

592
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,816
we're here now.

593
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,619
So maybe it's time
we start to fix it.

594
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,602
You were right.

595
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,272
They don't remember Peter.

596
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,743
How could they?
He never existed.

597
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:03,113
He served his purpose.

598
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,134
