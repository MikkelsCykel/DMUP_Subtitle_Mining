1
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:23,856
My whole life through

2
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,843
I will spend

3
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,881
My whole life through

4
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,852
Loving you

5
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,390
Just loving you

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,645
Winter, summer

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,898
Springtime, too

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,903
Loving you

9
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,406
Loving you

10
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:18,911
Makes no difference

11
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,913
Where I go

12
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:27,920
Or what I may do

13
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,926
You know that

14
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,430
I've always been

15
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:42,202
Loving you

16
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:46,904
Just you and

17
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:51,944
If I'm seen
with someone new

18
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,700
Don't be blue

19
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:00,453
Don't you be blue

20
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,458
I'll be faithful

21
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,461
I'll be true

22
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,467
Always true

23
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:18,436
True to you

24
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:24,977
There is only
one for me

25
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:31,484
And you know who

26
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:40,993
You know that
I'll always be

27
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:46,766
Loving

28
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:52,505
You

29
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,978
I love Elvis so much.

30
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,514
You love
everybody so much.

31
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,016
I do not.

32
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:05,517
You do, too.

33
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,019
No, I don't.

34
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,520
Ok, you don't.

35
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,522
Well, I don't.

36
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,025
Maureen, sometimes
you make me feel

37
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,526
like such a baby.

38
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,493
Ha ha ha.

39
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,030
You are a baby.

40
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,536
I wish I could be
just like you.

41
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,038
Don't talk silly.

42
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,540
It's not silly.

43
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:30,542
You're the smartest girl
in school.

44
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,811
You're so pretty
it hurts.

45
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,045
Boys fall
all over themselves

46
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,047
when you walk
down the street,

47
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,014
and I'm just a lump.

48
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,051
Come on,
you're not a lump.

49
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,018
You've never
been a lump.

50
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:45,057
You wouldn't know one
if you fell over it.

51
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,350
If I'm so
damned perfect,

52
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,561
why is my head
so mixed up?

53
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:51,563
Mixed up about what?

54
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:53,065
Well, I mean,

55
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,067
sometimes things just
don't make sense,

56
00:03:55,567 --> 00:04:00,572
and all of a sudden
I get scared.

57
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,190
Scared of what?

58
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,576
I don't know.

59
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:09,197
Are you all right,
Maureen?

60
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:14,086
I don't know.

61
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,589
See, I don't know
anything anymore.

62
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,056
One minute,

63
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,593
all I can think about
is packing my bags

64
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,362
and catching
the first bus.

65
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,062
And then
the next minute,

66
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:28,100
I'm afraid that once
I get out in the world,

67
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,102
it's going
to eat me alive.

68
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:31,568
That's dumb, Maureen.

69
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,605
You've got
a scholarship to duke,

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,607
and you're going
to live in the dorm.

71
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,109
Nothing's
going to eat you.

72
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,610
Sometimes I wonder

73
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,114
if I shouldn't just
stay here and get a job

74
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,616
or get married
like everybody else.

75
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,583
Marry who?

76
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:48,620
Somebody. I don't know.

77
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,622
Billy Sanders?

78
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:53,458
Good Lord, no!

79
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,130
Do you remember
when we were little

80
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,149
and mama
used to tell us,

81
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:02,134
when things
get all mixed up,

82
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,600
all you have to do

83
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,602
is tell the man
in the moon?

84
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:08,105
Yeah, you just
had to keep on talking

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,143
until you were sure
you told him everything

86
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,145
so that he
had all the pieces,

87
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,112
just like a puzzle.

88
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,149
And then he'd
work out the puzzle

89
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,650
while you
were asleep.

90
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:27,159
Yeah, but that was
kid's stuff, Maureen.

91
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,163
We're too old
for make-believe.

92
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,167
Yeah, I know.

93
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,684
Dani?

94
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,021
Dani!

95
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:01,358
Dani, are you up yet?

96
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:04,196
Maureen, get that child
out of bed!

97
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,533
Dani, come on, get up.

98
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,702
You're going to be
late for church.

99
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,169
I hate church!

100
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,171
All right. You know,

101
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,672
once your baby brother
gets here,

102
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:17,709
you women won't be
able to boss me around.

103
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,728
I won't be so outnumbered.

104
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:21,713
And I won't be
so pregnant.

105
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,215
How do you feel?

106
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,181
Not skinny.

107
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:26,183
Another 2, 3 weeks,

108
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,969
you'll be
back to normal.

109
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,686
Next time
you have a baby,

110
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,724
you let me know how normal
you feel afterward.

111
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,983
Can't you girls
get in there

112
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,236
and give
your mother a hand?

113
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,737
Maureen!

114
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,739
These eggs
are getting cold.

115
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,253
Daddy going
to his church again?

116
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,720
Does he ever
miss a Sunday?

117
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:07,208
Why does he call it church
when it's not?

118
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:10,227
When he asked my daddy
if he could marry me,

119
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:13,265
my daddy said only if he
agreed to find the Lord.

120
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:15,141
And he says
it's a lot easier

121
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:16,733
finding the Lord
out fishing

122
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,271
than in any church
he's ever been in.

123
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:20,272
I think he's right.

124
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,023
Don't think
you're going

125
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,275
to find
the Lord with him.

126
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,776
I want you upstairs.

127
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:26,278
Brush your teeth,
wash your face.

128
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:27,779
You're going
to Sunday school.

129
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,601
Morning, Maureen.

130
00:07:58,636 --> 00:07:59,776
Well, I declare,

131
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:02,314
you're just filling out
all over, aren't you?

132
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,317
Morning, Abby.
How's the Trant family?

133
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,336
Oh, just fine.

134
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,286
Oh, and, Danielle,

135
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,824
you're just shooting up
like a weed, aren't you?

136
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,827
Just like a weed,
that's me.

137
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,294
One of these days,

138
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,830
that woman's
going to cut herself

139
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,349
on her own tongue

140
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:21,833
and bleed to death.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,300
Hello, Mrs. Trant.

142
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,837
Let me get that
for you.

143
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,304
Hi, Maureen.

144
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,805
Hey there, little bit,

145
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,843
didn't recognize you
with a dress on.

146
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,310
You look great, Maureen.

147
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,847
Be by to pick you up
about 6:00?

148
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,314
That's right.

149
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,351
See you later,
Mrs. Trant.

150
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,319
That Billy Sanders

151
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,820
thinks he's
such a hotshot.

152
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:46,323
I don't see why
you go with him.

153
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:49,361
I don't go with him,
I go out with him.

154
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,363
Big difference.

155
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,873
Dani!

156
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,875
Dani, you come
back here!

157
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,349
She's doing it again.

158
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,886
Whenever it's time
to make lunch or do dishes,

159
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:15,852
she disappears.

160
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:16,888
The way she does dishes,

161
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,174
I just as soon
she be gone.

162
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:24,787
Do any good?

163
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,254
Oh, a little.

164
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,792
A little means
you did fine.

165
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:32,245
Let me see
what you got.

166
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:33,762
Where's Dani?

167
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:36,299
Off roaming around
somewhere.

168
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,444
She's supposed
to be here helping out.

169
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:42,305
She's getting too big
to be running around

170
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:44,272
wild as a jack rabbit.

171
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:46,309
Used to be
she was too little.

172
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,776
Now she's too big.

173
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:50,313
I guess she passed
up "just right"

174
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,315
when nobody
was looking.

175
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,341
Get out of here!

176
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:55,879
Who the hell do you
think you are?

177
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,345
You get out of here!

178
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,847
This is private property.

179
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:00,884
Yeah, you're
damn right it is,

180
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,403
and you're
trespassing.

181
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:03,852
This is the Foster place.

182
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:06,389
If your name isn't Foster,
you're trespassing.

183
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,391
It just so happens
that it is.

184
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:09,357
Prove it!

185
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:10,859
Prove your
name's Foster!

186
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:12,845
I don't have
to prove nothing.

187
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:14,397
Nobody's lived
on the Foster place

188
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:15,398
as long as
I can remember.

189
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:16,865
They do now!

190
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,351
So get your butt
out of here!

191
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:19,868
I'm not going.

192
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:22,405
If you're not out
by the count of 3,

193
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,406
I'll drag your ass out!

194
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,407
You're lying.

195
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,909
1...

196
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:27,410
2...

197
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:29,878
ok! Ok, I'm going!

198
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:32,865
Turn around and
close your eyes.

199
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,920
Do it, damn you!

200
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,861
What are you ducking
behind the bushes for?

201
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:04,948
You ain't got
nothing to hide.

202
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:26,970
Danielle!

203
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,473
I thought I made it clear

204
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:33,977
it's time you start taking some
responsibility around here.

205
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:35,944
Yes, sir.

206
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,982
I hope I don't have
to bring it up again.

207
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:40,448
Yes, sir.

208
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,986
Your mama saved you
some lunch.

209
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,488
Probably cold by now.

210
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:49,993
All right.

211
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,005
You making a cake?

212
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:04,007
Mm-hmm,
and ice cream.

213
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:05,508
Must be having company.

214
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,011
Just some old friends of
your daddy's and mine.

215
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:12,015
Go take a bath.
You smell like a pond.

216
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:36,539
I will spend

217
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,043
My whole life through

218
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:45,548
Loving you

219
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:49,052
Just loving you

220
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:53,306
Winter, summer

221
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:56,059
Springtime, too

222
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:02,065
Loving you

223
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,067
Loving you

224
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:06,986
Makes no difference

225
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,572
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

226
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:11,239
Where I go

227
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:12,075
I hope you're
finally done

228
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:14,077
hogging
the bathroom.

229
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,796
What time you say

230
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,583
that dance's
going to be over?

231
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,133
11:00, sir.

232
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,551
It's how many miles

233
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:25,088
from the country club
back here?

234
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,054
18.

235
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,591
You should have Maureen
home by 11:20 then.

236
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,093
Yes, sir, about.

237
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:31,559
Not about.

238
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,097
Yes, sir, 11:20.

239
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,102
Hello, Mrs. Trant.
Maureen.

240
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,103
I'm ready.

241
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,106
Not until you go get
a jacket, you're not.

242
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,608
I don't have one that
goes with this dress.

243
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:47,560
Then put on
a different dress.

244
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:53,616
You got
a full tank of gas?

245
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:54,617
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,620
No detours, no
back roads, no liquor.

247
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,622
What time you got?

248
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,589
6:13.

249
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:04,126
You're responsible
for my daughter

250
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,629
for the next 5 hours
and 7 minutes.

251
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,096
Yes, sir, Mr. Trant.

252
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:10,633
You don't have a thing
to worry about.

253
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,635
Then neither will you.

254
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:24,147
Abby: Have a nice time.

255
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:44,132
She'll be fine.

256
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,669
I remember his father
at his age.

257
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:47,635
What?

258
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,173
I said, I remember
his father at his age.

259
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,175
Mama, do I have
to wear a skirt?

260
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,641
Mm-hmm.

261
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:56,679
Who's so important that
I have to wear a skirt?

262
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,031
When your mama tells you
to do something,

263
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,184
you don't stand around
asking her reasons.

264
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:02,685
You smell good.

265
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,188
You mean I don't
stink anymore?

266
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,191
They're here.

267
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:14,662
You boys
come back here.

268
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:15,698
I warned you
what would happen

269
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,818
if you two
didn't behave.

270
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:24,707
Them two is
as mean as snakes.

271
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,709
You haven't
changed a bit.

272
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:30,678
Neither have you.

273
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,715
Come here to me,
girl.

274
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,683
Oh.

275
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:37,720
You was in
the same shape

276
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,222
last time I saw you.

277
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,188
I know.

278
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:41,689
Matt, don't you know
what keeps causing this?

279
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:44,727
Matt's after that boy
he's wanted all these years.

280
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,729
If you wanted a boy,
you never should have

281
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,196
throwed me over
for Abby.

282
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:51,234
Court, let Matt
and Abby look at you.

283
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:52,700
They haven't seen you

284
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:53,701
since you was
in diapers.

285
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:55,738
Those heathens
are my last efforts.

286
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,705
Rob, say hello.

287
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,242
Dennis, quit
scratching yourself

288
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:00,208
in front of people.

289
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:01,744
This is Danielle.
We call her Dani.

290
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,246
That little bundle
is Missy.

291
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:04,765
She rules the roost.

292
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,249
I'm sure she does.

293
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,416
Your kids turned out

294
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:08,917
prettier than you,
Matt.

295
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:11,920
You really that shy,
or you putting on?

296
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:13,922
Court, come here.
Quit moseying.

297
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:17,426
Hello, Court.

298
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,177
Mr. Trant.

299
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:20,429
Ma'am.

300
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:21,930
Those are some
fine-looking boys

301
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:22,931
you got, Marie.

302
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:24,398
I hope to tell you.

303
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:27,436
Court, tie those two
to a tree.

304
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,437
Ha ha ha.

305
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:29,938
Well,

306
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:31,405
look at that corn.

307
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,442
I haven't got
a thing in the ground.

308
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,560
It's corn,
but it's short.

309
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,395
Abby: No ears
on that corn.

310
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,912
This corn's good.
It's store-bought.

311
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:41,450
I'm hungry enough
to eat one of these kids.

312
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:43,452
Might be about ready.

313
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:44,453
Good.

314
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:47,956
Where's your Maureen?

315
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,423
Gone to a dance.

316
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,459
With Will Sanders' son.

317
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:51,460
Will Sanders?

318
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,462
What's old
Will Sanders up to?

319
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:54,963
Running his new
shirt factory.

320
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:57,466
And his big mouth,
as usual.

321
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,935
Billy!

322
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,473
Damn boy's deaf.

323
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:05,439
Billy!

324
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,476
Hey, Billy!

325
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,443
Hey, boy.

326
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:12,481
Billy, you got yourself one
pretty little woman tonight.

327
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:14,948
I hope he didn't
drive too fast.

328
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,486
Honey, we're certainly
glad you could join us,

329
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:18,952
aren't we, Ilene?

330
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:20,989
Maureen, it's
so nice to see you.

331
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:22,456
Thank you
for inviting me.

332
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:24,993
You're a sight
for this old boy's eyes.

333
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:27,461
I can't see how Billy
got so lucky.

334
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:29,748
Let's find ourselves
something to drink.

335
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:32,000
Let's grab some food,
jump in the car,

336
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:33,467
and get off
by ourselves.

337
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:35,504
I got dressed up
to go dancing.

338
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,471
That's what
I'm going to do.

339
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:40,509
You want to go off,
you can go by yourself.

340
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:51,485
Don't hit me!

341
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,022
Boys, I want you
to stay in the yard

342
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,023
where I can see you.

343
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:56,525
And no tree climbing!

344
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,027
What goes up
must come down.

345
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:02,030
I remember that much
from school.

346
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,032
14 years?

347
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:08,537
Has it really
been that long?

348
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:10,038
Mm-hmm.

349
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:11,540
I had Dani

350
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,042
about a month after
y'all moved off.

351
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:21,550
We were really sorry
to hear about Beau.

352
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,556
I always knew the damn
pipeline would kill him.

353
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:31,560
Only I thought it would
be a little at a time.

354
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,065
Anyway, it seemed

355
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:40,068
like the best thing
for the boys and me

356
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,070
was to come back
to the farm.

357
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,573
Yeah. You can always
get some sort of living

358
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,074
out of good land.

359
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:49,077
Matt: That's it.

360
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,582
Have you ever wondered
what would have happened

361
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:56,585
if Matt and Beau hadn't
switched partners

362
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,587
at that dance
20 years ago?

363
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,088
I wondered.

364
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,591
But, hell, honey,
you had a crush on Matt

365
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,593
from the time
you was 12.

366
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,596
13!

367
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,598
He was 17 years old.

368
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:11,565
He didn't know
I was alive.

369
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,602
I thought I was going
to have to get naked,

370
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:15,068
paint myself red,

371
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:18,607
and set off dynamite
to get his attention.

372
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:20,073
Well...

373
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:22,110
you got him.

374
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,613
Yeah, I did.

375
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,114
Mama,

376
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:27,616
this thing
ain't working.

377
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:29,618
Well, what's
wrong with it?

378
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,084
I don't know.

379
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,121
It needs
some more salt.

380
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:35,123
Well, we're
out of salt.

381
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:36,124
Matt,

382
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,126
we're going to need
some more rock salt.

383
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,593
Daddy, I'll go with you.

384
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,630
Court, could you run
into town for me?

385
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:43,131
Sure.

386
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:45,634
Dani will
show you where.

387
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,136
Dani!

388
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:49,638
Come on.

389
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,315
You don't
have to come along.

390
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,150
I can find the store
by myself.

391
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:03,617
It's an awful big town.

392
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:06,655
You always go where
you're not wanted?

393
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:08,698
You always act ugly
to people you meet,

394
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,659
or you practicing
to be a horse's butt?

395
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:12,160
Little girls
shouldn't talk nasty.

396
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:15,664
I'm not a little girl.
I'm 14.

397
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:17,130
My goodness.

398
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:19,668
You're not
much older. 16?

399
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,635
I'm 17.

400
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,172
My goodness.

401
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:40,749
You never
give an inch, do you?

402
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,215
No.

403
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,252
Good. I like that.

404
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,254
Well, you coming?

405
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:56,765
Hey, wait!

406
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,233
Hey, thanks.

407
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:02,270
Hey, what is that?

408
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:12,780
O- only you

409
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:16,249
Can make

410
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:21,289
All this world
seem right

411
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:26,760
Only you

412
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:31,299
Can make
the darkness bright...

413
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,266
Billy tells me

414
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:34,803
you're fixing to
leave for duke

415
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:36,304
in a couple
of weeks.

416
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:37,305
That's right.

417
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:39,773
I get up
to Raleigh Durham

418
00:24:39,808 --> 00:24:40,809
once or twice
myself on business.

419
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,275
That's nice.

420
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,312
I'll look you up,
take you out.

421
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,815
I imagine they'll keep me
pretty busy studying.

422
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,817
I understand
freshmen really have

423
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:50,784
to hit the books at duke.

424
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,786
You can't study
all the time.

425
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:55,323
Everybody has
to have a little fun.

426
00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:57,290
I just want you
to understand

427
00:24:57,325 --> 00:25:00,328
that I know that college
can be a real drain

428
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:01,795
on the family's
finances.

429
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,332
There's no need for
a pretty girl like you

430
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,101
to go without anything.

431
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,836
Things get
a little tight,

432
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:09,302
I'll be there.

433
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:12,340
I just want you
to know that.

434
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,807
Thank you.

435
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:15,844
I'll manage just fine.

436
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:22,350
You won't mind if I borrow
my date for a while,

437
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:23,316
will you?

438
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:25,353
Not at all.
Not at all.

439
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:26,855
It's a pleasure.

440
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,856
Pleasure.

441
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:38,366
Sorry about my old man.

442
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:41,870
Let's just get
out of here now.

443
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,341
Billy...

444
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:49,878
Billy, stop it!

445
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:51,379
I mean it!

446
00:25:57,886 --> 00:25:59,888
What is it with you,
Maureen?

447
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:01,890
You wanted
to leave the dance,

448
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:03,356
we left the dance.

449
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:05,894
I thought you wanted us
to be alone.

450
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:07,360
I wanted to get away.

451
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:08,862
I was tired
of being manhandled.

452
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:11,399
Can't you just hold
me a little, Billy?

453
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:12,866
I don't think so,
Maureen.

454
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:15,403
Nobody can just
hold you a little.

455
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:17,405
What do you want
from me?

456
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,371
I don't know.

457
00:26:18,406 --> 00:26:20,909
I don't know, either.
It's bothering me.

458
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:22,428
It's bothering me,
too.

459
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:23,912
I can't take it
anymore.

460
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:25,681
I can't either.

461
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:27,380
Do you ever feel

462
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:28,917
like there's
something missing?

463
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:30,383
Like there's something

464
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:32,385
you've been waiting for
all your life

465
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,923
and you wonder whether
you'll ever have it?

466
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:37,943
I'm feeling like that
right now.

467
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:40,929
I think love should
be so beautiful.

468
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:42,896
And powerful.

469
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:46,935
I want to be
swept away by love.

470
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:47,936
Oh, Billy.

471
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:49,938
Billy, what are
you doing?

472
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:50,939
Maureen, please.

473
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,941
I have to go
home now.

474
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:55,443
No, you don't.
We have a whole hour.

475
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:57,445
No, I have
to go now!

476
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:58,947
There are
plenty of girls

477
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,950
who'd be dying
to be in your spot.

478
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,452
Billy, I want
to go home!

479
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:09,457
If I take you home now,
I won't be back.

480
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,461
All right.

481
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:16,464
It's probably
for the best.

482
00:27:41,855 --> 00:27:45,359
Good night, mama.
Good night, daddy.

483
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:49,363
Good night.

484
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,880
Well, that's
all right, mama

485
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:08,899
That's all right
for you

486
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:10,910
That's all right, mama

487
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:12,886
Just any way
you do

488
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:17,856
That's all right

489
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:21,395
That's all right,
my mama

490
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,364
Any way you do

491
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,901
Well, mama,
she done told me

492
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:30,369
Papa done told me, too

493
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:32,406
Son, that gal
you foolin' with

494
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:33,907
She ain't no good
for you

495
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,660
But that's all right

496
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:38,877
That's all right

497
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:42,416
That's all right,
my mama

498
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:46,420
Any way you do

499
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,398
Rob! Dennis!

500
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:00,934
Cut that
jackassing around

501
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:04,237
and get that stuff
over here.

502
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:09,943
Aah!

503
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:20,954
Anything for me?

504
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,957
Not much here
but flyers and bills.

505
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,463
Your friends will get
around to writing.

506
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:31,430
Yeah, sure,
when they have time.

507
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:34,468
Now, you're not going
to be lonely forever.

508
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:35,469
Once school starts,

509
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:36,970
you'll be making
new friends,

510
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,437
playing football.

511
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:39,973
Then you'll be the one

512
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:41,975
who doesn't have time
to write.

513
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,976
I don't think
I'm going

514
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:44,443
to play
much football.

515
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:46,480
You'll get this place
under control.

516
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,947
We do what we
have to do, son.

517
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:51,484
You got too much
of your daddy in you

518
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,254
to let this job
be bigger than you are.

519
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,990
We have to find a way
to get a tractor.

520
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:58,457
Maybe we can find

521
00:29:58,492 --> 00:29:59,993
a secondhand one
that'll run.

522
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:01,495
Can we afford it?

523
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:02,496
Nope.

524
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,999
But we can't afford
not to, either.

525
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:37,030
Cut some beans
for mama.

526
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:44,037
That's all right

527
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:45,539
That's all right

528
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,544
I'm going
to the library.

529
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:52,546
That would be
my guess.

530
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:53,512
Here.

531
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:56,516
What has
come over her?

532
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,327
I don't know.

533
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:02,055
That's all right

534
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:29,583
Yaaa!

535
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,099
Hey!

536
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:48,602
Hey yourself.

537
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:50,068
Come on in.

538
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:52,405
You just going to
stand there all day,

539
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,607
or what?

540
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,609
Come up and
jump with me.

541
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:57,611
All right.

542
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:10,624
So you do own
a bathing suit.

543
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:18,632
You ready?

544
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,598
Sure.

545
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,134
Just hold on, ok?

546
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,636
Ok.

547
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:24,137
1...

548
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:25,138
2...

549
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:26,873
3...

550
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:28,133
go!

551
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,359
Aah!

552
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,123
Maureen?

553
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:48,161
What's it like
to kiss a boy?

554
00:32:48,196 --> 00:32:50,163
It depends
on the boy.

555
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:51,630
Are you talking

556
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:54,167
about anybody
in particular?

557
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:56,670
I was just asking
a question.

558
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,673
Can't anybody ask
a question around here?

559
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,677
For starters, you
let him kiss you

560
00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:05,143
if you like him.

561
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:07,180
If you don't
like him,

562
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:08,647
just tell him

563
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,684
you're not that
kind of a girl.

564
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,651
What if you
like him a lot?

565
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,188
Then you won't have
to think about it.

566
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:16,655
It'll all come
to you.

567
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,191
You're not
telling me anything.

568
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:20,694
I need to know
what to do.

569
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:23,662
Ok.

570
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:25,448
Come here.

571
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:27,200
Come on.

572
00:33:29,202 --> 00:33:30,703
First, you'll have
to kind of

573
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:32,205
tilt your head
to one side.

574
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:34,708
That's so you
won't bump noses.

575
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,209
Ok.

576
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,711
Would you loosen up?

577
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:39,713
He'll think you're
scared of him.

578
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,214
Not that much.

579
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:42,681
Ok. Then kind of

580
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:44,718
open your mouth
just a little...

581
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:46,184
uh-uh.

582
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:50,223
You wanted to know how.
I am telling you how.

583
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,226
Look, practice
on your hand, ok?

584
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:12,746
That's it. Just
keep practicing.

585
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:17,250
Well, what if I
forget what to do?

586
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:20,003
Just do
what you feel.

587
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:22,220
If I do what I feel,

588
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,257
I'll burst into
a million pieces

589
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:26,259
and go flying out
into space.

590
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:27,726
That sounds to me

591
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:30,729
like a good way not
to get kissed twice.

592
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:34,768
Maureen, have you ever
liked somebody so much,

593
00:34:34,803 --> 00:34:37,037
it almost made you sick?

594
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:39,173
Billy Sanders
makes me sick

595
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,274
every time
I look at him.

596
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,276
You know what I mean.

597
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:46,279
It's like my stomach
ties up in knots

598
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,748
and I can't breathe

599
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,786
and sometimes I think
I'm going to throw up.

600
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,290
Well, don't
throw up, Dani.

601
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:00,176
Whatever you do,
don't throw up.

602
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:36,629
Hey.

603
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:41,599
Thank you.

604
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:44,136
It's nice of you.

605
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:45,638
I figured
you'd be out here.

606
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:50,142
I figure I'll be out here
for a long time.

607
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,647
It sure is hot.

608
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,649
Sure is.

609
00:35:56,899 --> 00:35:59,526
Yeah. It's going
to get hotter, too.

610
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:02,154
It'd sure be nice
to go for a swim.

611
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:03,621
I can't take off

612
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:05,157
and go swimming
with you, Dani.

613
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,660
I got to make the most
of the daylight.

614
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:09,161
I can go swimming
after dark.

615
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:11,664
What are your folks
going to say?

616
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:13,666
They won't say anything.

617
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:17,836
Ok.

618
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:35,688
How are things going
at the Murphy house?

619
00:36:35,723 --> 00:36:37,154
We finished
framing up.

620
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:40,192
Now if we could
get it blacked in

621
00:36:40,227 --> 00:36:41,659
before
we get a rain,

622
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:44,697
the rest of it ought
to go pretty smooth.

623
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:47,665
You'll do fine.
The way it looks now,

624
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,202
you'll pray for rain
by the end of summer.

625
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:51,971
Matt: Come on, honey.

626
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:53,706
Join us
at the table.

627
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:55,708
Missy: Ok.

628
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:01,714
Matt: Dani, put
your napkin in your lap.

629
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:17,790
Court!

630
00:38:24,797 --> 00:38:25,798
Court!

631
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:39,812
Aah!

632
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:42,780
Hey, kid.

633
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,316
I'm not a kid.

634
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:45,783
Sure you are.

635
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:48,821
You're my favorite kid
in the whole world, though.

636
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:55,327
Come on!

637
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:12,344
Hello.

638
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:15,380
Come on.

639
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:22,221
Come on.

640
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,380
Court, what's wrong?

641
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:49,882
Nothing's wrong.

642
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:51,383
What did I do?

643
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:52,349
Nothing.

644
00:39:52,384 --> 00:39:54,887
Just tell me
what I did wrong.

645
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:56,889
I said you
didn't do anything.

646
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:01,810
Have you ever been
kissed before?

647
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:03,896
Sure.

648
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:05,898
Lots of times.

649
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:06,864
I'll bet.

650
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:08,901
You almost got more than
kissed, little girl.

651
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:10,402
I'm not a little girl.

652
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:11,869
You are, too, Dani!

653
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:13,906
You don't know
what you're doing.

654
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:15,372
One day,

655
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:16,909
somebody's going
to get your cherry,

656
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:18,818
but it's not
going to be me.

657
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,612
I wouldn't like
myself for it.

658
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:57,950
Dani.

659
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,481
Dani!

660
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:34,987
Dani!

661
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,490
Dani!

662
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:46,999
Dani!

663
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:52,170
Dani!

664
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:56,508
Dani!

665
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:00,512
Dani!

666
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:02,214
Mama!

667
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:04,516
Mama!

668
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:10,389
Dani!

669
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:12,691
Mama!

670
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,027
Abigail?

671
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:16,395
Mama?

672
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:24,036
My god!

673
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:26,538
Abigail?

674
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:28,540
Oh.

675
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:33,545
Ow!

676
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:36,513
Dani.

677
00:42:36,548 --> 00:42:38,049
Where's Dani?

678
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:39,551
Get my keys.

679
00:42:55,016 --> 00:42:56,518
Where were you?

680
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:58,570
What were you doing?

681
00:42:58,854 --> 00:43:00,037
Call the hospital.

682
00:43:00,072 --> 00:43:02,074
Tell them
I'm on my way.

683
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:03,575
Get in the house!

684
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,579
Get inside
the house now!

685
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:33,304
How is she?

686
00:43:33,805 --> 00:43:35,807
I told you
to go home.

687
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:37,308
Are they set up
in i. c.?

688
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:38,810
Somebody tell me
something.

689
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,529
Go home, Matt. Please.

690
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:43,314
God damn it, doc.
Tell me.

691
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:44,816
Abigail has
a concussion.

692
00:43:44,851 --> 00:43:46,282
She's got toxemia.

693
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:48,820
Her body's not throwing off
poisons. It's collecting it.

694
00:43:48,855 --> 00:43:50,321
There's nothing
you can do

695
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:52,323
except get in the way.

696
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:53,289
Go home.

697
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:55,827
I want you
out of here now.

698
00:44:59,891 --> 00:45:01,392
Daddy, don't!

699
00:45:02,894 --> 00:45:06,397
Daddy!

700
00:45:59,951 --> 00:46:01,285
Ma?

701
00:46:03,955 --> 00:46:05,456
Just stay here.

702
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:16,467
Mom asked me
to bring this stuff by.

703
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:18,486
Some homemade soup
and, uh...

704
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:20,471
yeast bread,
and chocolate pie.

705
00:46:20,805 --> 00:46:23,975
Mom's got the world beat
making chocolate pie.

706
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:29,480
Where's everybody at?

707
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:30,982
Hospital.

708
00:46:35,486 --> 00:46:37,989
I'm real sorry
about your mama.

709
00:46:38,024 --> 00:46:40,008
I'm sorry
about the way

710
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:41,993
I acted
last night, too,

711
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:44,495
about the way
I said everything.

712
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,497
You don't
have to be sorry.

713
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:50,418
I thought we could still
talk sometime, you know.

714
00:46:51,752 --> 00:46:53,504
I figure if we can talk
and be friends,

715
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:55,006
I can get you
to understand.

716
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:57,008
I already understand.

717
00:47:01,012 --> 00:47:04,015
Thanks for bringing
the food over, Court.

718
00:47:25,536 --> 00:47:29,040
That was a good supper
Marie sent over.

719
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:32,543
Marie's boy
bring it over?

720
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,047
Court?

721
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:39,050
Yes, sir.

722
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:43,054
He your swimming
partner last night?

723
00:47:44,055 --> 00:47:45,056
Yes, sir.

724
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:54,565
Did anything happen?

725
00:47:57,068 --> 00:47:57,568
No.

726
00:47:58,069 --> 00:48:00,071
Don't you mean
"no, sir"?

727
00:48:00,237 --> 00:48:01,037
No, sir.

728
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,539
Nothing happened, sir.

729
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:06,577
I saw the way
you looked last night.

730
00:48:07,078 --> 00:48:09,580
Did that boy
try anything with you?

731
00:48:09,615 --> 00:48:11,082
No, sir.

732
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:13,549
No, siree.

733
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:15,586
Not Court Foster.

734
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:29,100
Abby?

735
00:48:31,102 --> 00:48:32,603
I...

736
00:48:33,604 --> 00:48:35,571
I know.

737
00:48:35,606 --> 00:48:38,242
I love you, too.

738
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:40,611
This...

739
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:45,081
all of this
is my fault.

740
00:48:45,116 --> 00:48:48,119
If I hadn't been
so set on getting a son...

741
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:49,085
oh, honey.

742
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,587
You're not trying
to take credit

743
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:54,625
for all of this
by yourself, are you?

744
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,895
Because I seem
to remember

745
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,130
helping out
a little bit.

746
00:49:01,132 --> 00:49:04,135
If I would have
lost you, Abby...

747
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:51,647
mama says I can
come in tomorrow

748
00:49:51,682 --> 00:49:54,685
and let Maureen
stay home with missy.

749
00:49:56,687 --> 00:49:57,688
That's good.

750
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:06,197
Daddy...

751
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:10,666
I know you feel bad

752
00:50:10,701 --> 00:50:13,203
about taking
the strap to me,

753
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:15,706
but I'm not mad
or anything.

754
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:20,176
You were scared,

755
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:23,714
worried about
mama and the baby.

756
00:50:27,218 --> 00:50:28,719
I know that.

757
00:50:32,723 --> 00:50:36,227
And I'm just awfully
sorry for what I did.

758
00:50:37,728 --> 00:50:39,730
And for everything.

759
00:51:25,074 --> 00:51:26,576
Hey, Court!

760
00:51:28,578 --> 00:51:29,544
Hey!

761
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:31,080
Hey yourself.

762
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:34,083
Still want
to be friends?

763
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:36,085
I'd still consider it.

764
00:51:36,452 --> 00:51:38,553
Well, I was
just wondering

765
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:40,089
where you do
your best considering.

766
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:03,613
Aah!

767
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:07,116
I don't have a suit.

768
00:52:07,151 --> 00:52:09,118
Ha! I won't look.

769
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:20,630
Yee-haw!

770
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,141
Friends, ok?

771
00:52:34,644 --> 00:52:35,645
Friends.

772
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,146
Ok.

773
00:52:48,157 --> 00:52:50,124
You can look now.

774
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,162
And what makes you think
I'd want to do that?

775
00:52:53,197 --> 00:52:55,164
You did
in the water.

776
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,131
I did not.

777
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,168
You could've
fooled me.

778
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:00,169
Ow.

779
00:53:09,178 --> 00:53:10,179
Court...

780
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:13,599
I want to know you.

781
00:53:13,634 --> 00:53:15,184
You do know me.

782
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:19,188
I want to know you more.

783
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,693
I want to know you
all I can.

784
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:27,196
What do you
want to know?

785
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:30,199
I want to know...

786
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:33,703
your hopes.

787
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:36,205
My hopes.

788
00:53:37,206 --> 00:53:38,172
Well...

789
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:40,209
I hope your boobs
get bigger

790
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:42,211
and your butt
fills out.

791
00:53:42,411 --> 00:53:43,212
Court!

792
00:54:00,229 --> 00:54:02,231
Seems like it always
comes to this,

793
00:54:02,266 --> 00:54:04,100
doesn't it?

794
00:54:07,737 --> 00:54:10,740
Have you kissed
a lot of girls?

795
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:14,243
Not a whole lot.

796
00:54:15,745 --> 00:54:18,247
I want you
to be the first boy

797
00:54:18,282 --> 00:54:20,416
to ever kiss me.

798
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:23,252
I thought
you'd been kissed

799
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:24,754
so many times.

800
00:54:45,775 --> 00:54:47,777
How was that?

801
00:54:47,812 --> 00:54:49,278
Perfect.

802
00:55:18,307 --> 00:55:19,308
Dani?

803
00:55:35,324 --> 00:55:38,277
You like that boy
of Marie's a lot,

804
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,246
don't you?

805
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:44,333
But you know you're
not old enough to date.

806
00:55:44,368 --> 00:55:45,800
Yes, sir.

807
00:55:45,835 --> 00:55:48,337
You want to see Court,
do it right.

808
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:50,805
Invite him over here
to the house.

809
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,843
I'm not saying you can't
go to the pond anymore

810
00:55:53,878 --> 00:55:56,112
or that you can't
go there with Court.

811
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:58,498
Just bring him around
once in a while

812
00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:00,850
where I can get a good
look in his eyes.

813
00:56:00,885 --> 00:56:02,351
Yes, sir.

814
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:04,854
All right.

815
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,385
Good to see you, Court.

816
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:39,388
Good to see you,
too, Mr. Trant.

817
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:40,890
How's your mama?

818
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:41,891
She's fine.

819
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:44,393
She got a job at
the shirt factory.

820
00:56:44,894 --> 00:56:46,896
That's good. She always
was a good worker.

821
00:56:47,396 --> 00:56:48,647
Yes, sir.

822
00:56:48,682 --> 00:56:49,864
Dani tells me

823
00:56:49,899 --> 00:56:51,650
that your wife's
doing better.

824
00:56:51,685 --> 00:56:53,402
That's right.
Better every day.

825
00:56:55,905 --> 00:56:57,371
Well...

826
00:56:57,406 --> 00:56:59,909
you kids
have a nice time.

827
00:56:59,944 --> 00:57:01,911
I'm going to see Abby.

828
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:09,418
Your sister will
be here shortly.

829
00:57:31,941 --> 00:57:34,944
You can sit down
if you like.

830
00:57:37,947 --> 00:57:38,948
Sure.

831
00:58:08,477 --> 00:58:09,979
What's the matter
with you?

832
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,982
Nothing's the matter.

833
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:14,984
I'm letting you kiss me.

834
00:58:19,488 --> 00:58:21,991
Weren't you supposed
to let me try first?

835
00:58:36,505 --> 00:58:38,007
Hi there.

836
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:40,592
Hi.

837
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:52,021
Let me help you
with those things.

838
00:58:53,522 --> 00:58:56,025
Thank you.
I'd appreciate that.

839
00:59:00,529 --> 00:59:02,031
You must be Court.

840
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:06,535
I've been
meaning to come by

841
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:09,788
to visit with your mother
and say hi.

842
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:12,541
I've been busy
getting ready for school

843
00:59:12,576 --> 00:59:15,044
that I didn't
get around to it.

844
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:16,563
I promise I'll do it.

845
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,047
Tell your mother that?

846
00:59:18,547 --> 00:59:21,050
Sure. She'll be
glad to see you.

847
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:22,051
Thanks.

848
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,552
Any time.

849
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:28,891
You can
set these things down,

850
00:59:28,926 --> 00:59:31,060
and I can put them up.

851
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,561
You must be Maureen.

852
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:34,930
I forgot to say that,
didn't I?

853
00:59:37,432 --> 00:59:40,936
You two can go back to
whatever you were doing.

854
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:42,402
I can handle this.

855
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:44,371
Court, you want
to go walking?

856
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:47,409
Why don't you two
do that, and, uh...

857
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:49,195
I'll have
dinner ready

858
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,911
by the time
you get back.

859
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:51,947
You're welcome
to stay for supper

860
00:59:51,982 --> 00:59:52,948
if you'd like.

861
00:59:53,448 --> 00:59:54,449
Isn't he, Dani?

862
00:59:54,484 --> 00:59:55,467
Sure.

863
00:59:55,502 --> 00:59:56,416
Great.

864
00:59:56,451 --> 00:59:58,453
That's fine.
I'll set the table.

865
00:59:58,488 --> 01:00:00,455
Show me where
the things are.

866
01:00:00,622 --> 01:00:02,958
I think we ought
to have supper

867
01:00:02,993 --> 01:00:04,226
in the dining room,

868
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:05,460
don't you, Dani?

869
01:00:05,495 --> 01:00:06,461
Whatever.

870
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,223
Court, the last time
we saw each other,

871
01:00:18,258 --> 01:00:20,976
we were both running around
in our diapers.

872
01:00:21,011 --> 01:00:23,410
I'll bet that
was a sight.

873
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:26,481
Mama says I used
to beat you up regularly

874
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:27,948
with my sand pail.

875
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:29,985
I wouldn't
try that these days.

876
01:00:32,988 --> 01:00:35,956
Everybody dig in.

877
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:39,494
I, uh, imagine that you
work up quite an appetite

878
01:00:39,529 --> 01:00:42,497
handling the farm
all by yourself like that.

879
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:44,464
It's a lot of work.

880
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:47,002
I can't imagine
having the guts

881
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:49,469
to tackle a job
that big.

882
01:00:49,504 --> 01:00:50,971
Yeah, well,
sometimes I wonder

883
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:54,009
if I've bitten off
more than I can chew.

884
01:00:54,044 --> 01:00:56,511
I bet you'll
do just fine.

885
01:01:00,515 --> 01:01:02,017
Are you ok?

886
01:01:02,052 --> 01:01:02,983
Sure.

887
01:01:03,018 --> 01:01:04,519
I'm just fine.

888
01:01:09,524 --> 01:01:11,026
Well, thanks for dinner.

889
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:11,992
You're welcome.

890
01:01:12,027 --> 01:01:14,529
It was nice meeting you.

891
01:01:14,564 --> 01:01:16,031
Good night.

892
01:01:21,036 --> 01:01:22,037
Oh, good night, kid.

893
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:58,073
Court seems real nice.

894
01:01:59,574 --> 01:02:01,326
He kiss you yet?

895
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:03,078
All the time.

896
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:07,582
Is he a good kisser?

897
01:02:07,617 --> 01:02:09,084
He's all right.

898
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,101
Shit.

899
01:02:39,114 --> 01:02:40,115
Hey.

900
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,623
I was just going
down to the pond.

901
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:52,092
You want to go?

902
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:53,628
I've got work
up to my eyeballs

903
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:55,130
and no end in sight.

904
01:02:55,296 --> 01:02:57,132
There's nobody
to tell me how to do it.

905
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,633
It all depends on me.

906
01:02:59,134 --> 01:03:01,386
I can't play
whenever you want to.

907
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:03,638
You don't have
to sound so hateful.

908
01:03:03,673 --> 01:03:04,639
I don't have time!

909
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,641
Sorry I took your time.

910
01:03:07,142 --> 01:03:08,643
Maybe if you were
a little bit older,

911
01:03:08,678 --> 01:03:10,110
you'd understand.

912
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:12,647
If I were older,
I could do everything,

913
01:03:12,682 --> 01:03:14,482
couldn't I, Court?

914
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:18,653
I love you, Court.

915
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:19,619
Don't.

916
01:03:19,654 --> 01:03:21,121
Don't love me now

917
01:03:21,156 --> 01:03:23,658
when things
are so mixed up.

918
01:03:23,693 --> 01:03:25,125
I've got more

919
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,879
than I can say grace
over right now.

920
01:03:48,183 --> 01:03:49,482
You look real nice.

921
01:03:49,517 --> 01:03:52,687
I think I'll go out
for a little while.

922
01:03:52,722 --> 01:03:55,690
You going over
to the Trants' again?

923
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:56,691
I might.

924
01:03:57,192 --> 01:03:59,694
I saw Maureen
at the hospital today.

925
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:02,697
That girl
sure is turning out.

926
01:04:03,198 --> 01:04:04,199
You see Matt,

927
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:06,701
you tell him
to holler at me

928
01:04:06,736 --> 01:04:07,702
if he needs anything.

929
01:04:08,203 --> 01:04:08,703
Yes, ma'am.

930
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:10,288
Ok, guys, let's go!

931
01:04:10,705 --> 01:04:11,706
Get out. Come on.

932
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:14,209
I'll see
you later, ok?

933
01:04:28,223 --> 01:04:30,225
My, my, my.

934
01:04:33,228 --> 01:04:34,194
Night-night.

935
01:04:34,229 --> 01:04:37,232
Ok, we're going
to go night-night.

936
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:39,234
Oh, there we go.

937
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:41,736
There we go.

938
01:04:43,238 --> 01:04:44,739
Here's your doll.

939
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:05,760
Court.

940
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:09,514
Hello.

941
01:05:09,549 --> 01:05:10,765
Hi.

942
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:14,269
Dani is
at the hospital

943
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:18,773
if you want to run on down
and visit with her.

944
01:05:19,274 --> 01:05:20,775
I don't think so.

945
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:26,781
It, uh, sure was
a nice day.

946
01:05:26,816 --> 01:05:28,748
Yeah.

947
01:05:28,783 --> 01:05:30,785
Looks like
it's going to be

948
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,252
a nice night, too.

949
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:34,289
Looks like.
Yeah, looks like.

950
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:40,295
I'll sure be glad when
I can leave this place

951
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:42,064
and take you with me.

952
01:05:42,099 --> 01:05:43,763
Why don't you go home

953
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:46,300
and get some sleep
for a change?

954
01:05:46,335 --> 01:05:48,803
I'll see you
in the morning.

955
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:55,810
Call me
if anything happens.

956
01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:56,828
Yes, sir.

957
01:05:56,863 --> 01:05:57,812
I will.

958
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:16,831
Thanks.

959
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,835
So, do you like Elvis?

960
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:21,801
Sure.

961
01:06:21,836 --> 01:06:23,303
Who doesn't?

962
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:25,805
Dani absolutely
adores him.

963
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,843
Well, she did
until you came along.

964
01:06:28,878 --> 01:06:29,809
You...

965
01:06:29,844 --> 01:06:31,846
pretty well shot Elvis
out of the saddle.

966
01:06:37,352 --> 01:06:38,818
I can't believe

967
01:06:38,853 --> 01:06:40,855
my little sister
is grown-up enough

968
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:42,357
to have a boyfriend.

969
01:06:42,857 --> 01:06:45,860
It's not quite
exactly like that.

970
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:46,826
I mean...

971
01:06:46,861 --> 01:06:49,864
it's more like
we're sort of buddies.

972
01:06:49,899 --> 01:06:52,867
Just...
real close buddies.

973
01:06:53,868 --> 01:06:56,120
Does Dani know that?

974
01:06:56,155 --> 01:06:58,373
I tried to tell her.

975
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:02,377
You like her a lot?

976
01:07:02,412 --> 01:07:04,379
Of course I like her.

977
01:07:04,879 --> 01:07:06,381
I mean, she's...

978
01:07:07,382 --> 01:07:08,883
special.

979
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:09,884
Oh.

980
01:07:10,885 --> 01:07:12,887
Yeah, she, um...

981
01:07:13,888 --> 01:07:15,390
she is that.

982
01:07:23,563 --> 01:07:26,566
But what if
I met someone else...

983
01:07:26,733 --> 01:07:29,569
someone special
in a different sort of way?

984
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,537
Someone...

985
01:07:32,572 --> 01:07:34,574
she's my sister.

986
01:07:46,586 --> 01:07:50,089
If you...
need a friend,

987
01:07:50,124 --> 01:07:53,593
I make
a pretty good one.

988
01:07:55,095 --> 01:07:58,098
A friend's not what
I need right now.

989
01:08:16,116 --> 01:08:18,118
You better go.

990
01:09:11,171 --> 01:09:12,672
Daddy!
The hospital called.

991
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:14,924
Mama's having the baby.

992
01:09:16,676 --> 01:09:19,679
All right.
I'm on my way.

993
01:09:19,714 --> 01:09:20,680
Ok.

994
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:32,192
I'm glad you're the one
here with me.

995
01:09:32,692 --> 01:09:33,693
Me, too, mama.

996
01:09:34,194 --> 01:09:35,662
You're not frightened?

997
01:09:35,697 --> 01:09:36,947
No, mama.

998
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:38,163
Good.

999
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:39,664
Are you scared?

1000
01:09:39,699 --> 01:09:42,702
Not a bit.
I've done this before,

1001
01:09:43,036 --> 01:09:44,704
remember?

1002
01:09:44,739 --> 01:09:46,706
Aah.

1003
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:47,267
Lord, Court.

1004
01:10:55,858 --> 01:10:58,243
Hope you ordered
a girl, Abigail.

1005
01:10:58,278 --> 01:11:01,781
I know someone who's going
to be mighty disappointed.

1006
01:11:01,816 --> 01:11:04,784
Matt had his heart
set on a boy.

1007
01:11:04,819 --> 01:11:07,287
Want me
to put it back?

1008
01:11:07,322 --> 01:11:08,288
God, no.

1009
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:12,292
Court!

1010
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:15,795
Hey, Court!
Where are you?

1011
01:11:18,798 --> 01:11:20,265
Court!

1012
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,766
We've got a girl!

1013
01:11:21,801 --> 01:11:23,803
She's just
the tiniest thing

1014
01:11:23,838 --> 01:11:25,322
and perfect all over,

1015
01:11:25,357 --> 01:11:26,771
except she's baldheaded.

1016
01:11:26,806 --> 01:11:29,559
And I was there
for the whole thing.

1017
01:11:29,594 --> 01:11:32,312
They didn't actually
let me go in,

1018
01:11:32,347 --> 01:11:33,831
but I was there.

1019
01:11:33,866 --> 01:11:35,315
It was beautiful.

1020
01:11:38,318 --> 01:11:39,284
Anyway...

1021
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:42,822
I couldn't wait to tell you
about the baby.

1022
01:11:48,328 --> 01:11:49,829
And I wanted
to apologize

1023
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:52,832
for the last time
I saw you.

1024
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,835
I was being unreasonable.

1025
01:11:57,837 --> 01:11:59,304
But when two people

1026
01:11:59,339 --> 01:12:00,840
really care about
each other...

1027
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:08,348
well, when two people
really care...

1028
01:12:08,848 --> 01:12:10,350
they try
to understand things,

1029
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,852
even when it's hard.

1030
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:16,356
Don't you think so?

1031
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,361
Yeah.

1032
01:12:22,362 --> 01:12:23,863
Sure.

1033
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:40,880
Well, I'll
see you, ok?

1034
01:12:45,385 --> 01:12:46,386
Yeah.

1035
01:13:18,918 --> 01:13:22,422
I never thought
I could feel this way.

1036
01:13:23,923 --> 01:13:25,390
It's like,

1037
01:13:25,425 --> 01:13:26,891
I've been waiting

1038
01:13:26,926 --> 01:13:30,930
for you to come back
and find me, and...

1039
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:33,933
now I'm afraid
it'll all go away.

1040
01:13:38,438 --> 01:13:40,440
I'm not going
anywhere.

1041
01:14:18,109 --> 01:14:19,611
Come on, Dani.

1042
01:14:21,112 --> 01:14:24,115
Unlock...
door.

1043
01:14:26,117 --> 01:14:27,584
He's unlocking it.

1044
01:14:27,619 --> 01:14:29,621
Daddy's going
to open it.

1045
01:14:30,622 --> 01:14:32,088
Come on, missy.

1046
01:14:32,123 --> 01:14:35,126
Let's put the baby to bed.

1047
01:14:36,127 --> 01:14:37,128
Maureen!

1048
01:14:42,634 --> 01:14:43,635
Maureen!

1049
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,142
Where could she
have gotten off to?

1050
01:14:51,643 --> 01:14:54,646
She knew we'd be back
about noon.

1051
01:15:35,687 --> 01:15:37,654
I love you.

1052
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:39,190
I love you, too.

1053
01:15:40,191 --> 01:15:41,693
I have to go.

1054
01:16:01,713 --> 01:16:03,464
What are we
going to do?

1055
01:16:03,499 --> 01:16:05,358
Don't think
about that.

1056
01:16:05,393 --> 01:16:07,306
We have to think
about it.

1057
01:16:07,341 --> 01:16:09,532
Not yet
we don't have to.

1058
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,723
Yes, we do.
I have to go.

1059
01:16:11,758 --> 01:16:13,242
I'll see you later.

1060
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,726
Court, come on.

1061
01:16:14,761 --> 01:16:15,692
Stop it.

1062
01:16:15,727 --> 01:16:17,729
You're going
to make me late.

1063
01:16:51,763 --> 01:16:54,766
Dani, I need
to talk to you.

1064
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:55,767
Maureen!

1065
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:01,272
Maureen, can you
get in here, please?

1066
01:17:04,776 --> 01:17:06,527
Where have you been?

1067
01:17:06,562 --> 01:17:08,279
The baby's home.

1068
01:18:37,368 --> 01:18:38,835
All right, boys.

1069
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,372
Got to take
your brother his lunch.

1070
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,839
He forgot it again.

1071
01:18:42,874 --> 01:18:45,626
Boy can't remember
his name these days.

1072
01:18:45,661 --> 01:18:48,379
I want you to sit there,
eat your lunch,

1073
01:18:48,414 --> 01:18:50,882
and no messing around,
you hear me?

1074
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:52,401
Do you hear me?

1075
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,885
Yes, ma'am.

1076
01:19:30,922 --> 01:19:31,923
Court?

1077
01:19:33,925 --> 01:19:34,875
Court!

1078
01:19:35,927 --> 01:19:36,928
Court!

1079
01:20:02,954 --> 01:20:04,455
Baby boy.

1080
01:20:10,461 --> 01:20:11,963
Court?

1081
01:20:14,465 --> 01:20:16,467
Go away, Dani.

1082
01:20:16,502 --> 01:20:18,469
Go away, Dani!

1083
01:20:18,504 --> 01:20:19,971
Go away!

1084
01:20:36,988 --> 01:20:38,739
Daddy!

1085
01:20:38,774 --> 01:20:40,133
Dani?

1086
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:41,492
Daddy!

1087
01:20:42,994 --> 01:20:44,495
Daddy!

1088
01:20:44,996 --> 01:20:45,446
Daddy!

1089
01:20:45,997 --> 01:20:47,999
Dani, what's
the matter?

1090
01:20:48,034 --> 01:20:49,500
What's the matter?

1091
01:20:49,535 --> 01:20:50,501
It's Court.

1092
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:51,467
What?

1093
01:20:51,502 --> 01:20:52,503
The tractor...

1094
01:20:52,538 --> 01:20:53,504
it's Court.

1095
01:20:53,539 --> 01:20:55,506
Help!

1096
01:21:00,511 --> 01:21:02,013
Abby!

1097
01:21:03,014 --> 01:21:04,515
Abby!

1098
01:22:41,027 --> 01:22:42,279
No!

1099
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,283
No.

1100
01:22:46,783 --> 01:22:48,285
No.

1101
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:50,287
No.

1102
01:22:55,292 --> 01:22:56,793
No.

1103
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,041
Dani...

1104
01:27:06,042 --> 01:27:07,544
I'm sorry.

1105
01:27:10,547 --> 01:27:13,550
We didn't mean
to hurt you, Dani.

1106
01:27:17,053 --> 01:27:20,021
I love you...

1107
01:27:20,056 --> 01:27:24,526
and I need us still
to be close somehow.

1108
01:27:24,561 --> 01:27:28,565
I don't want to be close
to you anymore, Maureen.

1109
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,567
I don't ever want to be
close to you again.

1110
01:28:03,265 --> 01:28:04,133
Mama?

1111
01:28:04,633 --> 01:28:06,100
Mm-hmm.

1112
01:28:06,135 --> 01:28:09,638
I don't want
to be at church today.

1113
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:13,142
Can I go
with daddy, please?

1114
01:28:14,643 --> 01:28:16,145
All right.

1115
01:29:32,721 --> 01:29:34,723
Mama, I loved him.

1116
01:29:37,226 --> 01:29:41,230
I don't know how to stay
alive without him.

1117
01:29:43,232 --> 01:29:45,234
I know.

1118
01:29:47,236 --> 01:29:49,238
I'm sorry.

1119
01:29:49,738 --> 01:29:50,739
Oh.

1120
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:53,742
I'm so sorry.

1121
01:30:16,765 --> 01:30:18,267
You know, Dani...

1122
01:30:20,769 --> 01:30:22,236
you and Maureen

1123
01:30:22,271 --> 01:30:26,775
are going to be sisters
for a long time.

1124
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:29,278
Don't ask me
to forgive her...

1125
01:30:29,313 --> 01:30:30,779
because I can't.

1126
01:30:32,781 --> 01:30:35,284
You've got a right
to grieve, Dani.

1127
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:38,252
You got a right
to be hurt.

1128
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:41,290
But if you get so wrapped up
in your own pain

1129
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:43,292
that you can't see
anyone else's,

1130
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:47,296
then you might just as well
dig yourself a hole...

1131
01:30:47,331 --> 01:30:49,763
and pull the dirt in
on top of you,

1132
01:30:49,798 --> 01:30:53,802
because you're never going
to be much use to yourself...

1133
01:30:53,837 --> 01:30:55,269
or anyone else.

1134
01:30:55,304 --> 01:30:57,306
You don't know
what she did.

1135
01:30:57,341 --> 01:30:59,308
I know enough.

1136
01:31:02,311 --> 01:31:04,278
I know
hating your sister

1137
01:31:04,313 --> 01:31:07,316
is not going
to bring Court back.

1138
01:31:10,819 --> 01:31:13,322
Maureen's been good to you
all your days.

1139
01:31:13,822 --> 01:31:14,823
Remember that.

1140
01:31:15,824 --> 01:31:18,327
She's hurting bad
right now...

1141
01:31:18,362 --> 01:31:20,829
hurting as much as you.

1142
01:31:22,831 --> 01:31:24,333
Maybe more.

1143
01:32:00,369 --> 01:32:02,836
Hey!

1144
01:32:02,871 --> 01:32:04,873
Hey yourself!

1145
01:32:05,874 --> 01:32:07,876
You ready?

1146
01:32:08,377 --> 01:32:09,878
Just hold on, ok?

1147
01:32:10,345 --> 01:32:10,879
1...

1148
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,631
2...

1149
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:14,008
3...

1150
01:32:14,043 --> 01:32:15,350
go!

1151
01:34:27,516 --> 01:34:28,517
It's ok.

1152
01:34:37,526 --> 01:34:39,027
It's ok.

1153
01:34:39,528 --> 01:34:41,029
It's ok.

1154
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:12,561
Dani: Maureen...

1155
01:35:14,563 --> 01:35:17,566
is it always going
to hurt this bad?

1156
01:35:18,567 --> 01:35:20,569
Mama says it won't.

1157
01:35:23,572 --> 01:35:25,574
I hope she's right.

1158
01:35:28,577 --> 01:35:30,078
I hope so.

1159
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,081
You know...

1160
01:35:34,082 --> 01:35:35,584
sometimes...

1161
01:35:37,085 --> 01:35:41,590
I think that nothing's ever
going to make sense again.

1162
01:35:45,594 --> 01:35:48,597
Maybe life's not
supposed to make sense.

1163
01:35:53,101 --> 01:35:55,103
Doesn't that scare you?

1164
01:35:58,106 --> 01:36:00,108
Yes, it does.

1165
01:36:10,784 --> 01:36:12,536
I wish I could
still talk

1166
01:36:12,571 --> 01:36:14,288
to the man
in the moon...

1167
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:18,757
don't you?

1168
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:20,794
It would be nice.

1169
01:36:23,297 --> 01:36:24,798
Maureen?

1170
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:26,300
What?

1171
01:36:28,802 --> 01:36:31,805
Will we always
talk to each other?

1172
01:36:35,809 --> 01:36:37,811
Always.
