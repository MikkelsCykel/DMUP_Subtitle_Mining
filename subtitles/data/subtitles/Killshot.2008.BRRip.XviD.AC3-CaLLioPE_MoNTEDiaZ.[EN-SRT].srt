00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,440
You gotta know what you're
doing when you go in.

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,120
You gotta have it figured out.

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,080
Those are the rules.

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,440
How you get in, how you get out.
How many shots you gonna need.

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Make sure you know where everybody is.
Make sure nobody sees you.

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,760
Don't hang around. Don't get interested.
Then you don't make mistakes.

7
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,240
Yeah...

8
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,760
I'd just like to go to Detroit and
see a man in the hotel Friday morning.

9
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,280
I don't do that anymore.

10
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,760
I'll double your price.
You can do whatever you want.

11
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,040
Can't hear you chief.

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,560
I'm thinking this guy in the hotel,

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,560
is somebody you don't
want to look in the face.

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm thinking maybe it's the old man with
the big house you want to move into.

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,880
Guy passes time...
and he don't like how you do things.

16
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,120
- Fuck you. I'll get somebody else.
- You don't have no somebody else.

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
You call me when
your people won't do it.

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,200
You want to leave it all behind
chief, here's your chance.

19
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,640
You have a Cadillac.

20
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,360
- The blue one.
- Yeah

21
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,880
Throw that in there you
never see me again.

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,920
You can collect your money next Tuesday.
Union Station. The usual place.

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,400
He'll have a girl with him.
She'll let you in.

24
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,000
You got something for me?

25
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,880
From your son-in-law.

26
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,200
Ah... Christ!

27
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,280
I told my daughter don't marry
that punk. She don't listen.

28
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,920
They gave me six months.
Throw me another funeral

29
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,080
You want him done sooner
than that, you tell me.

30
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,960
- Who the hell are you?
- You don't remember.

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
Should I?

32
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
You know Walpole Island, Papa?

33
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,840
It's an Indian reserve.
My grandmother lives there.

34
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,320
She's a medicine-woman.

35
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,040
She was going to turn me
into an "Owl" one time.

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,840
I told her I don't wanna be no "Owl".
I want to be a Blackbird.

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,080
- That's how I got my name.
- Blackbird...

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,480
You remember now? The Degas Brothers.
One killed working for you.

39
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,400
Shot dead in the hospital.
The other one doing life in Kingstown.

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm the only one left.

41
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,080
Can she do that?
Turn you into an "Owl"?

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,160
If she wants to.

43
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,680
I could use a woman like that.

44
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,840
I'd like to be dressed.
Is that okay with you?

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,120
Whatever you want.

46
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,640
- Are you through?
- Not yet.

47
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,720
It can be used equally as
a recreation room or den.

48
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,920
And more than a distinctive
entrance hall.

49
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,720
It's so practical,
and yet elegant.

50
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,400
Thank you.

51
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,400
What?

52
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,280
What?

53
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,920
Don't call me
about coming back!

54
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,880
Mrs. Palino? Richie Nix.
You were my foster mum for a while.

55
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Got a collection of old
Elvis vinyls I left here...

56
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,200
a while back.
My girlfriend she's a big Elvis fan.

57
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,920
Thought we'd come by
and pick 'em from ya.

58
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
Last time I saw you...

59
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,120
you drove off in my car.

60
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,920
Fuck off.
Before I call the police.

61
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,600
If you're looking for your
grandmother, she's gone.

62
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,120
We buried her last winter.

63
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,520
- Here.
- Thanks.

64
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,040
Wait.

65
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,040
- Yeah...
- You looking for another job?

66
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,920
I don't know... try my hand
in real estate, maybe.

67
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,920
- Put you in an office and a suit.
- You bet!

68
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,840
Hey, Lionel!

69
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,440
Where's your team?

70
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm sorry about your grandmother.

71
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,040
The band office's been trying
to locate the next of kin,

72
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,160
to find out
what to do with her house.

73
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,040
Hey, I've been thinking...

74
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,680
When I get paid for this job I done,
maybe I could fix the place up.

75
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,080
- You could sell it the way it is
- I mean fix it up and live here.

76
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
A guy like you,
used to living in the city?

77
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,600
There's no life for you here.

78
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I could always be a friendly Indian,
like you. Maybe even a guide.

79
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,840
- You wouldn't like it.
- Why not, you do?

80
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,800
Come on. You telling
me I can't live here?

81
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,160
Hey!
You wanna ride in a Cadillac?

82
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,560
Come on we take a drive,
go to Algonac, have some drinks.

83
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
You go. I gotta go home.

84
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,480
- Hey.
- Hi.

85
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,960
- Didn't let myself in.
- Right.

86
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,760
Which is kinda weird.

87
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,760
Well I made a start.

88
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,360
I thought I'd leave
the hunting things for you.

89
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,160
Okay.

90
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,680
All the guns,
I understand, but...

91
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,200
why the suit?
You gonna rob a bank?

92
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,480
You mind if I leave some of
this stuff here till next time?

93
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,280
- What's this?
- Don't fuck around with.

94
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,120
Oh...

95
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,640
- God it smells like hell.
- Don't fuck with it I told you.

96
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,320
So when is next time?
Tomorrow after work?

97
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,240
It could be anytime tomorrow.

98
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
What happened
at 350 Jefferson?

99
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,720
They wanted to put me on a
detail gang on the ground.

100
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,360
I said no.
It's an old man's job.

101
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,880
Nelson Davies Realty.
Nelson Davies speaking.

102
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,080
Nelson, this is Wayne Colson.

103
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,240
Nelson Davies Realty.
Nelson Davies speaking.

104
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,440
Them Tangelwood homes
are going fast, huh?

105
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,040
They sure are sir.
Let me tell you what...

106
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,920
I'll bet they'd go even faster,
if they caught fire.

107
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,600
Who is this?

108
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,760
It's happening now. 27 Pine Ridge
you'll notice a rearrangement.

109
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,120
Just a little wear and tear,
but it can happen again.

110
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,480
Or you could pay, so it won't,
like insurance.

111
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,680
- Sorry, I don't understand...
- You get...

112
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
20,000 cash ready, and I'll come
pick it up sometime.

113
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,840
If you don't have it when I come to
collect, you're dead. You be ready.

114
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,120
'Cause you don't know when I'm
gonna walk through that door.

115
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,720
Or which one that comes in
I'm gonna be.

116
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I'll tell you something else.
You remember a guy...

117
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,200
worked at the Amaco Station
way out in Port Huron.

118
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,000
Got shot dead last year
during a hold-up.

119
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,320
I... I might have read
something about that.

120
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah... that's me.
20,000 when I come to collect,

121
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,720
or you're a dead
real estate man.

122
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
Yeah.

123
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,360
- You owe me some money.
- The fucking money is the...

124
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,120
price on your fuckin' head,
you piece of shit.

125
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,800
Who the fuck told you
to kill the girl.

126
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
She saw my face.

127
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,960
Who cares if she saw your
fucking face, she worked for me!

128
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,200
You better listen to me,
you half-breed fucking moron.

129
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,440
You're dead, you understand? I don't
care if you shoot your own brother,

130
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,200
you soak drunk, if you touch
what's mine, you're dead...

131
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,760
That's a cool car.

132
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,720
- I'm looking for a ride.
- Well, good luck.

133
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,200
You say: "Which way you going"?
And I say: "Any way I want".

134
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,520
Don't worry,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

135
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,880
Just need your car for a
little business I'm planning.

136
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,000
You see, usually I rob banks.
2700 is the best I ever did up in Ohio.

137
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,480
This time I got something
way bigger in mind.

138
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,360
- You got Indian blood, don't ya?
- Enough to own a casino.

139
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,120
You got a cool name?

140
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,520
- A cool name?
- Yeah, like...

141
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,760
"Red Elk" or
"Running With the Wolves?"

142
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,800
- Blackbird.
- Blackbird?

143
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
That is pretty cool.

144
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,400
Well, my name's Richie Nix,
in case you ever heard of me.

145
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,200
That's N~i~x...

146
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,680
not the way
Stevie Nicks spells hers.

147
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,320
Turn left here.

148
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,880
Alright...
now let me have your wallet.

149
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,120
Hey! what the hell
do you think you're doing?

150
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,200
You want my wallet.

151
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Yes, but nice and slow.

152
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,640
What's L & M Distributor?

153
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,120
- The company I used to work for.
- Oh, what are they distributing?

154
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,360
Pepperoni.

155
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,240
Pepperoni Company gives
you a Cadillac to drive.

156
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,400
What the fuck you do for them?

157
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
I shoot people.

158
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Sometimes for money,
sometimes for nothing.

159
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,880
Yeah, I told him about this Amaco
station I held up a while back,

160
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,160
up in Port Huron,
you might've heard about it.

161
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
I told him, I ended up having
to blow a guy away up there,

162
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,600
so now he's scared.
That's why he'll pay me...

163
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
20,000 cash
or you're fucking dead.

164
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,080
I could hear the phone
shaking in his hand.

165
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,440
You scare a guy enough,
he'll pay every time.

166
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,320
A man scared, don't always do
what you expect.

167
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,280
Yeah, but...

168
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,280
You don't wanna talk to much,
don't let him know what you're thinking

169
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,760
You wanna take him by surprise.

170
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,960
You have something to wear, a suit,
or something? You wanna look the part.

171
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,080
See, that's why I need a
fucking partner, man. I mean it...

172
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,280
now, I've no patience
for details, like that.

173
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,080
- You ever worked with anyone before?
- My brothers.

174
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,600
One is in prison for ever.
And my kid brother is dead.

175
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
You remind me of him.

176
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,200
He was a stupid guy.

177
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,640
So, huh...

178
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,240
Black... Blackbird,
how's 10,000 sound?

179
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
Bird.

180
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
Bird?

181
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,160
That's what my kid brother
used to call me.

182
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,960
Alright, Bird, we got a deal?

183
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,520
I told you wouldn't know which one
I'm gonna be when I came in.

184
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,040
Remember it?

185
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,320
What?

186
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,760
On the phone?

187
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,360
I think you wanna talk to somebody
downstairs that'll help you out.

188
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,760
You see that?
He's playing dumb?

189
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,480
Well, he's fucking with you.

190
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,560
You're gonna try to tell me
I never spoke to you?

191
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,480
Huh?

192
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,680
No, I think he said
he don't believe...

193
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,480
what you told him
on the telephone.

194
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
Show him you mean it.

195
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,080
Am I making my point?
Give me the cash,

196
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,960
or you're a dead
fucking real estate man.

197
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,480
Okay, you win.
It's downstairs, in the car.

198
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,680
Welcome to Nelson
Davies Reality.

199
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,480
You own this business and
you still drive a pickup?

200
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,480
I like to think
success hasn't changed me.

201
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,280
Wayne.

202
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,760
- Who the fuck is Wayne?
- Beats me.

203
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
Hey, let's go.

204
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,560
- Wayne
- What's going on here?

205
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Hey, forget it,
let's get out of here.

206
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,360
No, he ain't...

207
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,680
Lock the door!
Call the cops!

208
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,440
Fuck!

209
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
For a job.

210
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,160
Wait a minute, I said that
Nelson knew I was coming by.

211
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,320
It was hardly an appointment.

212
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,560
His wife's an employee, no need
to talk about Wayne dropping by.

213
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,960
Hence the suit.

214
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,680
- But you're an iron worker?
- Hence the boots.

215
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I'm looking at other things, OK?

216
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,880
It's just an odd time
to appear, that's all.

217
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,440
- Lunch? There's nobody here.
- I was here.

218
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Because I could be
making some claims.

219
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,080
- Like the window... damages.
- You didn't know these guys?

220
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,200
No, sir.

221
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,920
Because nobody witnessed
you arriving separately.

222
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,760
Wait just a minute,
they shot at my husband.

223
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
- He probably saved my life.
- Mr. Colson.

224
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
you knew nothing about
these blackmail calls?

225
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,920
- Hey, I don't know about any calls.
- What blackmail calls?

226
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,040
There were some calls last week.
Huh, creeps, I told the police.

227
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,520
But not us? Those creeps
had guns, Nelson.

228
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,520
- Please.
- Wayne.

229
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Asshole.

230
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm bleeding something fierce here, man.
Let's go to Marine City, I wanna see Donna.

231
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,320
- Who the fuck is Donna?
- She's this woman I'm staying with.

232
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,520
Now, she's cool, man,
I told her about you.

233
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,360
It's on the way to "Port Hell".

234
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,560
My brothers and I come up here
one time to kill a guy.

235
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,880
No shit.

236
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,840
- What'd he do?
- I didn't ask 'em.

237
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,040
That, doesn't make sense to me.

238
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,640
I gotta... be pissed
at a guy when I kill him.

239
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,840
Why didn't you just shoot him?

240
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,920
He was standing right there
in the fucking window!

241
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,160
You wanna learn something?

242
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,160
The only time you ever
take out your gun...

243
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,240
- is when you gonna kill somebody.
- Yeah, well you could've right there.

244
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,240
It's the same as a hunter.

245
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,840
The guy who knows what he's doing,
he don't take the shot...

246
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,320
if he thinks he can miss.

247
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,000
If he does, he's gotta find
the animal and finish it.

248
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,680
Two apart.

249
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,720
Are you saying there were
woman there? What...

250
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,320
What the woman do?

251
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,600
She saw my face.

252
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,080
You don't ever
leave things undone,

253
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,080
even if you think somebody's
not going to remember you.

254
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Some people were asking
after you this morning.

255
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,640
What people?

256
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,120
They said they were friends
of yours, from Toronto.

257
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,120
What you tell 'em?

258
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,000
I told them
I hadn't seen you in years.

259
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,440
You see my friend's face, Lionel?
Fell of a ladder.

260
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,680
Got cut up,
couldn't go to work.

261
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,680
I said, hey...
let's go duck hunting.

262
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,200
You free to take us?

263
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,840
Weather's supposed to turn.

264
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
Why don't we go anyway.

265
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,600
- Richie's never seen a marsh before.
- I've seen a marsh

266
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,200
Come on, Lionel.

267
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,440
This won't take long.

268
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,800
You okay?

269
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,080
Guess so.
That Indian guy freaked me out.

270
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,400
Walk you in?

271
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,520
- So, what things are you looking at.
- Huh?

272
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,600
Back there with the police you said
you were looking at other things?

273
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,520
Yeah...

274
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm looking at anything. You said
I'm a dinosaur, either change or die.

275
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,720
- I never said that.
- Then I'm saying it.

276
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,280
So, today is the day you decide to
come in about a job in real estate.

277
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,920
- Well, I could sell a house.
- Absolutely.

278
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,520
Anyway... thank god
you showed up in that suit.

279
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,800
Yeah...
Dangerous suit.

280
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,320
- Got married in it, got shot at in it.
- And you look great in it.

281
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,320
- Anyway, thanks.
- Anytime.

282
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,360
Wayne.

283
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,440
It's a deer. Get some rest.

284
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,360
If you need anything,
just call the Hillcrest Motel.

285
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,680
- I don't see any birds.
- You wanna hunt ducks?

286
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,160
You watch the sky.

287
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,760
- It looks different. All this water.
- Maybe you never came down this far,

288
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,080
you and your brothers.

289
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,920
There're no cats and dogs
around here to shoot.

290
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,480
Last time I saw you,
you were...

291
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,480
you were hunting with some...
guy in a tan working jacket.

292
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,000
Seemed like a nice guy.

293
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,000
What was his name?

294
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,000
- Karl.
- Wayne.

295
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,760
If you can't remember the rest,

296
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,320
we'll go back and ask your...
wife and daughter.

297
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,000
- Wayne Colson.
- Where does he live?

298
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,160
Alkeneck.

299
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,640
Is he married?

300
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,880
- Kids?
- They couldn't.

301
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Hey, there's something.

302
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,280
Looks like you're gonna
have trouble with this one.

303
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,080
He might shoot
the wrong bird.

304
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,520
What's that supposed to mean?

305
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,760
Ducks don't land in trees.

306
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,280
Why don't we go over there?
Stretch our legs.

307
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,400
You want to go first?

308
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,000
You know you really piss me off!

309
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,160
Tell me ducks
don't land in trees.

310
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,080
I know ducks
don't land in trees.

311
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,920
Bird, you coming?

312
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,760
Excuse me.

313
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,800
This is my house.

314
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,600
Oh, yeah...

315
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,600
- It's a dump.
- You certainly have your nerve.

316
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,880
Donna.

317
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,480
Donna...

318
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,080
this is Bird. He'll be staying
with us for a few days.

319
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,800
- What happened to your face?
- I got in a fight. We got any beers?

320
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,880
Well, why don't you fix us
something to eat...

321
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,800
and I'll go get some.

322
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Richie...

323
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,120
don't call me Bird no more.

324
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,400
What'd you want me to call ya?

325
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,160
My name... Armand.

326
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,360
Ar~mand... Armand?

327
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,520
Are you serious?

328
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,360
Listen...

329
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,480
When she's making all this
fucking noise in there,

330
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,440
it means, she's pissed off.
Why don't you go in there...

331
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,960
and give her a pat on the ass.

332
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,440
You want the Weight Watchers
chicken patty or the regular?

333
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,200
Two Weight Watchers please.

334
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Ritchie said you used to be
a hack in a joint.

335
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,760
That how you met?

336
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,440
I was in catering services.

337
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,160
He said you got... fired
for screwing the inmates.

338
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,480
You drive that school bus
out there?

339
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,840
If you could be
any kind of bird there is,

340
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,840
what kind of bird would you be?

341
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,120
What're you doing here?

342
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,880
- Just need a place to stay.
- For how long?

343
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,320
Couple of days. Got some
business to take care of.

344
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,840
You want some bacon
with your chicken patties?

345
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,640
- Thanks.
- Sure...

346
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,440
oh... my pleasure.
I was busy, but, huh...

347
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,320
I jacked myself away from
staring at the ceiling.

348
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,440
Anyway, it turned out to be
nothing... I'm so jumpy, sorry.

349
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,640
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

350
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,440
No, no, go to bed, I'll grab a beer
at least till you're asleep.

351
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
But there's really no need.

352
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,800
Oh...

353
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,760
now you're not scared,
I can't have a beer...

354
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,800
Wayne you shouldn't really
even have keys to the house.

355
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm confused, because for a second
there... I thought you called me.

356
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,840
I did call you,
and I am nervous, but...

357
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
if you can just let yourself in
whenever you want...

358
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,240
Which I've never done.

359
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,120
But you could. I don't know.
I know you've been here.

360
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,720
- But not when you're here.
- So you have been here.

361
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,480
I fixed the porch light.

362
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,960
Come on, I waited till you've gone out,
so we didn't have to get into a fight.

363
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,360
Which means
you were watching me,

364
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
which might be why I'm feeling
watched all the time.

365
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,000
- Come on.
- Alright, you know what?

366
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm thankful to you for
fixing the porch light.

367
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,720
- And the faucet in the bathroom.
- And the faucet in the bathroom, too.

368
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,200
But that's supposed to be a change.
Nothing is changing.

369
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,920
Wayne, I'm moving.

370
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,400
I don't like being this person who's
blaming you for all things I'm blaming for.

371
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,240
No, there's no, uh...
middle, huh?

372
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,600
I mean this is it with you...

373
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,840
You're either fine or you
are leaving the country.

374
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,280
We don't have kids, fine.

375
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,760
We can't have kids, fine,
no, suddenly...

376
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,640
we are killing ourselves,

377
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,240
we are getting a divorce,
we are leaving the country.

378
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,640
I mean, it's like...

379
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,440
it's zero or ten. I mean...
What happened to five?

380
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,840
Five's pretty great.

381
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Now I'll take five again
in a fucking minute.

382
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,040
See what I'd tell you.

383
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,560
He's fucking that woman
from the real estate office.

384
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,160
I got him! You get the woman!

385
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,720
- Hello?
- It's me.

386
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,240
Mom...

387
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,240
Oh...

388
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,720
ask me something else.
How are you, how are you?

389
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,960
Oh, he's out, he'll be back.

390
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,200
Mom?

391
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,720
I have to call you back.

392
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,080
You're going hunting, miss?

393
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,480
Was looking for your husband,
have a talk with him.

394
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,240
He's not home.

395
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,840
I know that.

396
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,760
I was wondering
maybe I come inside and wait.

397
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,240
We've met before. Remember?
At the real estate office.

398
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,240
You're gonna shoot me?

399
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,360
- The police should be here any minute.
- You had time to call them, huh?

400
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,360
I don't think
you're gonna shoot me.

401
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,280
Hi.

402
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,720
Alright...

403
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,200
it's your big day, honey,
it's a double feature.

404
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Get your cash laid out on
the counter, and get some gum.

405
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,160
Get out of there!
Get the hell outta there!

406
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,760
Get up!

407
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,640
Are you Indian?

408
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,200
You look Indian.
You should do something with

409
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,880
your hair, use a shampoo
and conditioner in one.

410
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,000
Give some body.

411
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,480
Look at me.

412
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,880
Are you sure you're not Indian?

413
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,240
Doesn't matter.

414
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
How many times
are you gonna ask me...

415
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,600
did I see him shoot the girl?

416
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,120
I thought she'd gotten
outta there.

417
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,880
How many times are you gonna look
at that bullet hole on the tree?

418
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,240
My wife told you that she
wasn't trying to hit him,

419
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,760
you guys act like
you don't believe her.

420
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,880
Not one of you guys has said, "Nice Going"
or "that was a brave thing my wife did".

421
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,680
These maniacs are trying to kill us
and what are you doing about it?

422
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,360
Mr. Colson.
Mrs. Colson.

423
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm Paul Scallen,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

424
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,600
That's the same color as the guy's car a big
goddamn Cadillac, nobody can seem to find.

425
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,800
We found it. On Walpole Island.
Only there wasn't a lot of paintwork left.

426
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,840
Mr. Colson...

427
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,320
- Do you know a Lionel Adam?
- Yeah, sure...

428
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

429
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,320
Would you mind telling us who
the hell these assholes are now?

430
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,640
Why would they
wanna kill Lionel Adam?

431
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,880
We really don't know for sure,
we think they're trying to find you.

432
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,640
It seems you and your wife
had a good look at them.

433
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,120
So what?

434
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,320
All they're doing at that point was...
shaking down a real estate business.

435
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
How's this gonna make it look?

436
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,400
This one's got all the history,
His name's Armand Degas.

437
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,200
He's known as the Blackbird.

438
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,920
He's a Contract killer
for the Detroit Mafia.

439
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,160
It takes an awful lotta nerve
to stand up to a man like that.

440
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,840
What does the Detroit Mafia
have to do with us?

441
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,680
Last week the head of the family was
shot dead in a Detroit hotel room.

442
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,160
Along with a girl
who had seen it happen.

443
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,880
We think it was an inside job.

444
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,760
Thanks to you, we know that the guy
was in the area at the time.

445
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,360
So if we can, huh...

446
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,080
pick him up, even if it's
just for extortion,

447
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,680
there is a chance,
he may wanna cut a deal.

448
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,080
Wait...

449
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,800
You want us to testify
against a Mafia Hit-man?

450
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,280
He's gonna come after you anyway.

451
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,760
Without you, there's nothing
to say he was even here.

452
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,520
So, what're you suggesting?

453
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,160
Well, your life's are in danger,
so we figure you qualify you for...

454
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,760
Federal Protection under the
witness security program.

455
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,640
- You want to move us someplace else?
- Until we find them.

456
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,640
We'll provide you with
new identities, temporary employment.

457
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,120
You won't need
to sell the house.

458
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,080
I'm sure you can make a deal
with Nelson Davies...

459
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,080
and his company appearently
if you wanted to sell.

460
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,360
- Hello.
- It's me.

461
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,520
Why the fuck
are you calling me here?

462
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,360
I need a car.
A clean one with papers.

463
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,560
Word is...
you really upset the man.

464
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,040
- He was fucking that girl you blew away.
- Can you get it or not?

465
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,520
You can't come here.
They got everyone looking for you.

466
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,120
We'll transfer
your baggage overnight.

467
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,880
Replacement vehicles will be
waiting for you in the morning.

468
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,080
Your home will be held till
you're released fom the program.

469
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,720
You wont care about that, do you?
could be now with his confession?

470
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,520
Destination location,
it's good 2 hours, that's...

471
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,320
about another 2 hour drive south,
down the Mississippi river.

472
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,840
You'll be checking in here
under your new names.

473
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,040
You must be Pam Wenkovsky.

474
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,160
I'm your husband, Matt.

475
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,640
It's best to stick as close
to truth as possible, that way...

476
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,680
you're less likely to have trouble
with your invented histories.

477
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,240
- How long you've been married?
- 15 years.

478
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,560
Where'd you meet?

479
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,360
On a building site in St. Albourn,
June 4, 1991.

480
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,960
- Who asked who out first?
- I did.

481
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,080
How long after that
were you married?

482
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,560
- A week?
- How many children?

483
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,480
Almost one.

484
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,320
Well, if they moved, how come
all their furniture is still here?

485
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,400
- Hey, Bird!
- What?

486
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,120
You gonna kill Donna too?

487
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,240
I mean you gone to all this trouble
finding witnesses, she's a witness.

488
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,160
What does that make you?

489
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,040
But you need me.
Leave my fingerprints everywhere.

490
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,560
Steel cars and shoot people.
Do all your dirty work for you.

491
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,480
Who is it?

492
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,080
Huh, yes ma'am,
I'm looking for Wayne Colson.

493
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,720
Who gave you my number?

494
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,800
Exuse me, ma'am, there's that new fellow
that works here, just asked to call you.

495
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,200
We've been trying
to get hold of Wayne, and huh...

496
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,920
he gave us this number
before he left.

497
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,360
He gave you my number?

498
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,920
Well, as a matter of fact, he gave it
to the boss, the boss gave it to me.

499
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,120
Only he isn't here right now,
because it's so late,

500
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,800
but, huh... he said
you'd know where he was.

501
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,440
Wayne, that is.

502
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
I don't know where Wayne
gone away with my daughter,

503
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,960
they never tell me anything.

504
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,560
You see 'cause, I got this check
that I'm trying to send him.

505
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,240
Mr. Wenkovsky.
Mrs. Wenkovsky.

506
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,520
- Good morning. Welcome.
- Good morning.

507
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,240
- Hello.
- Hi.

508
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,400
Shall we?

509
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,800
If the... neighbors ask,
you paid about $200,000 for it.

510
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,200
Looks more like 150 to me.

511
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,400
Sure ain't much privacy
around here.

512
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,400
You want privacy,
you close the door.

513
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,920
But I don't think
that's what you want.

514
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,920
Well, I guess you're gonna do
whatever it is, you want.

515
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,000
There's no way on earth
I can stop you.

516
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,640
There'll be a slight delay
in the divorce proceedings...

517
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,160
while the couple hides out
from the killers.

518
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,040
This is Elvis Presley Boulevard
on a rainy day. This...

519
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,680
is the Lisa Marie... the jet liner he
bought and named it after his daughter.

520
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,160
Her and I have the same birthday.

521
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,640
And I tell you something else.
My life number is nine.

522
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,760
What's a life number?

523
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,280
Okay, huh...

524
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,720
when you add up
your days birth day...

525
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,000
um... like February
is the 2nd month, that's two.

526
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,320
I was born on the 1st, that's one,
so two and one is three,

527
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,600
Then you add in the year
when you were born.

528
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,880
I'm not gonna tell you when that was.
But my number comes out to nine.

529
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,880
If you were born in 1900,
that would still add up to... ten.

530
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,000
- Yeah, see ten counts as one...
- Donna!

531
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,480
Get dressed...
go buy some fucking beers.

532
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,280
You think he cares
about your queer photos?

533
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,920
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous of what?

534
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,200
You know the difference
between me and Elvis is?

535
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,760
- Yeah... You're ignorant.
- Nope, I'm alive, and he's dead...

536
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,680
Well, I got news for you.
After you die,

537
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,760
you think anybody's gonna go
and visit your grave?

538
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,400
Not even your mama
if you had one.

539
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,680
But a 100 years from now people
will still be going to Graceland.

540
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,960
Donna...

541
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,440
you're so goddamn stupid.
Let me ask you a question, Donna...

542
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,560
would you rather have Elvis
sing to you, or fuck you?

543
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,000
I know what you think
I'm gonna say.

544
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,160
And you probably gonna
call me a liar, but I'd...

545
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,360
I'd rather
have him sing to me.

546
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,480
You know I believe her though.
'Cause Elvis wouldn't have come.

547
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,920
He wouldn't have been dirty
or smelly enough for Donna.

548
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,960
Hey...

549
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,120
- leave her alone.
- Who Donna?

550
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,120
Why don't you shut
the fuck up for a while?

551
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,560
If you ever talk to me
like that again...

552
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Oh, yeah? What?

553
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,600
This is Elvis's billiard-room,
it made 750 yards of matierial...

554
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,920
Can I have a word, "Armand"?

555
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,880
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You are.

556
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,400
And from now on, you don't
leave my fucking sight.

557
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,480
How about when I go to the
bathroom, you wanna watch?

558
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,640
Or when I'm giving Donna a jump and
you're out there wishing it was you...

559
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,160
Or you can keep pretending...
you're not trying to fuck her?

560
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,800
Hey...

561
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,800
you listen to me.

562
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,320
Keep your big fucking mouth shut
and don't worry about it.

563
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,320
- So you're a welder, huh?
- That I am, AWS certified.

564
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,480
Can you weld plates watertight?

565
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,000
I can weld a goddamn building
so it won't fall down.

566
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,080
I got a job
you might wanna a look at.

567
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,200
Hey...

568
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,520
Maybe today... she can't tell us
where they are.

569
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,120
But tomorrow... she might.

570
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,840
What job were you and Wayne
working on?

571
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,120
Well we've been on different ones.

572
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,600
Anyway. What I started
to tell you,

573
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,720
I don't see what difference it makes
who mails the check, you... or us.

574
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,400
But... the boss says we have to do it.
Now I told him you're a nice lady to offer...

575
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,120
I told you I don't have their address.
She never gave it to me.

576
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,560
The only thing I have
is their phone number, you want that?

577
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,800
Oh...

578
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,880
well, you didn't mention that,
did you? You have their number?

579
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,720
Not on the phone I didn't.

580
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,320
I wasn't absolutely positive,
whom I was speaking to.

581
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,040
That's how they find out
if you're home...

582
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,640
so they can come in
and rape you.

583
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,600
I understand.
Can't be too careful.

584
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,480
You give him a check, and
you'll know where he'll cash it...

585
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,760
don't you?
The nearest bar.

586
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,840
- Oh...
- What's up?

587
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,640
I should never bend
that far from the waist.

588
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,440
It's like somebody...
stuck a knife in me.

589
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,840
That's your "Sacro Ileac".

590
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,360
Why don't you...
lay down on the couch.

591
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,640
No, no...
let's get you down here...

592
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,760
on the carpet.

593
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm gonna give you a back rub.
I had a foster mom at one time...

594
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,600
named Jackie, she was
some kinda therapist...

595
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,880
worked with cripples,
she showed me how.

596
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,400
I assume...
you know what you're doing?

597
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,000
Yes, ma'am.

598
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,840
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?

599
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,400
What the fuck did you do?

600
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,600
Cut it out...
I just gave her a back rub.

601
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,200
Jeez...

602
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,600
It's a Missouri code.
Did a bank there once.

603
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,080
Hi, it's Matt and Pam.
We're not here. Call you back.

604
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,880
Hello?
Hello?

605
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,480
Hello?

606
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,000
Hey, it's me... I tried
calling you a couple of times...

607
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,600
Wayne.

608
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,880
No, I'm fine.
What?

609
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,120
I'm losing you... What?

610
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,840
- We gotta make a plan.
- That's my fucking phone!

611
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,840
You wanna wait
till they change the number?

612
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,200
It had all
my fucking numbers in it.

613
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,160
- Why don't we go to Missouri?
- We will.

614
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,760
- Yeah, when?
- When they stop looking for us.

615
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,000
Or when they think we've
stopped looking for them.

616
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,400
So... Gerald,
this is the Master bedroom.

617
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,800
I love how you guys say
"Master bedroom".

618
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,360
Yes, we guys
like our guy words.

619
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,000
- You're not from here.
- That's right.

620
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,520
Where're you from?

621
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,040
- Detroit way.
- I know Detroit.

622
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,520
We didn't look at the kitchen.

623
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,440
- Are you following me?
- What is it?

624
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,240
- Are you following me?
- Mrs. Wenkovsky, hello.

625
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,120
How the viewing work out?

626
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,360
Well, you should know.
You were outside this morning.

627
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,240
Did you make a sale with Gerald?

628
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,440
I know he's been looking
at a lotta places.

629
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,200
Do they know we're here?
Are they coming after us?

630
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,280
Yes, you come by
the office anytime,

631
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,440
it's always good to see you.

632
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,080
- What if we're bait?
- What're you talking about?

633
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,760
What if we're being used as bait.
What if the FBI...

634
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,560
just waiting for those 2 freaks
to find us, so they can find them.

635
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,760
- What if they showed up here, Wayne?
- They get caught.

636
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,080
Oh...
Before they kill us?

637
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,480
Sure... yeah,
I vote for before.

638
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,320
I can't even begin to
pretend to do my job.

639
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,280
I show a house and I'm just waiting
for someone to pull a gun on me.

640
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,360
What's the choice? I don't understand.
Sit here and go crazy...

641
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,760
- I don't know. Why don't you tell me.
- Listen.

642
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,160
Can we try something different?

643
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,400
Come down after work one night.
Meet some of the guys and their wives

644
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,040
You know, they're good people.

645
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,120
There's a lot of places along the
river we can get something to eat.

646
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,680
- Does nothing bother you?
- Sure, yeah, this bothers me.

647
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,160
You and me...
Not gangsters.

648
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,360
I need you to do something for me.

649
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,960
Is that why you dragged me
out here to tell me?

650
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,000
You got some balls on you chief,
I'll give you that.

651
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I don't give a fuck
what you need.

652
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,200
Yes, you do.

653
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,000
That's why you come
when I called.

654
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,480
You don't want the cops
picking me up, if for some reason,

655
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,720
they start asking me
was I in Detroit...

656
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,240
when the old man's killed.

657
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,080
And how the fuck they're gonna
connect me to a half-breed...

658
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,160
piece of shit they dragged up
from the bottom of this lake.

659
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,480
That blue Cadillac you gave me.

660
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,760
The one with the papers
in the glove compartment...

661
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,960
registered to your
pepperoni company.

662
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,200
Anything happen to me, a friend
gonna drive the car to some precinct.

663
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,000
They gonna find the piece I used...

664
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,600
to whack the old man for you,
wrapped in a letter.

665
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,000
From me... about you.

666
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,320
Not a love letter.

667
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,120
This is what you're gonna do for me.

668
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:12,120
There's a cemetery in Port Heron,
my kid brother is buried there.

669
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,080
He never had the kinda
funeral he deserved.

670
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,640
You'll be walking around
on that skinny little beam...

671
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,480
and you've got clouds
around your head.

672
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,200
I mean some days you think
you see things so clear,

673
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,800
The place you live,
the store you shop in.

674
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,720
The church you got married in.
I could see everything...

675
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,920
Everywhere I've ever been my whole life,
from the top of a building.

676
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,720
So why the hell
did you quit and come here?

677
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,400
The job quit me, man.

678
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,000
You get to an age,
they start pulling you down.

679
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,120
One floor a year,
end up to near the ground.

680
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:54,320
- I got my pride. Too much maybe.
- I've been watching you, honey.

681
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,600
Maybe you should talk less
and drink more.

682
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:05,240
I think these poor folks deserve
another a round, there... Linda.

683
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:11,120
Hey, Pam honey, how did you... huh,
fall for a... shy guy like Matt?

684
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,600
- His muscles...
- Ah...

685
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,320
- and the short shorts.
- Uhh...

686
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,920
I had to show off
to get her attention.

687
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,160
Every guy in town's
chasing after her...

688
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,960
not only is she gorgeous,
she's smart as a whip.

689
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,640
Don't exaggerate, Matthew.

690
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,840
Her mother's always saying,
Carmen, honey...

691
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,640
because... that's what
her mother called her.

692
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,240
'Cause she's a great singer.

693
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,440
She would say, Carman honey...
You're a talented beautiful girl...

694
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,680
don't go wasting your life
on an iron worker.

695
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,800
You're gonna wake up in 20 years
and realize he never deserved you.

696
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,240
15 years.

697
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,840
- He's such a liar, my mother adores him.
- We got karaoke here on Friday.

698
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,080
- You gotta come.
- Oh, no.

699
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,080
- Yeah...
- You wait, she's a knockout.

700
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,600
I will knock you out, Matt.

701
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,200
I've been watching you honey,

702
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,400
you should talk less
and drink more.

703
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,720
Why is it that I feel
I knew you best,

704
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,640
when you were talking
with other people?

705
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,040
It felt good tonight.

706
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,200
I like this town.

707
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,080
Telling all your stories.

708
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,800
There ain't nothing
I said tonight back there...

709
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,520
wasn't God's truth.

710
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,080
No... don't turn on the light.

711
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,560
Are you married?

712
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,840
No, sir, I'm on a break.

713
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,320
- Live around here?
- I can't tell you where I live.

714
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,800
It's a government secret.

715
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,200
We found them last week.

716
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,800
Two bodies. Probably shot.

717
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,560
In a remote location
and burnt in the car.

718
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,080
Nothing much left
to be identified.

719
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,640
The Indian
has a surviving brother.

720
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,880
He's doing life in Kingston
correctional facility.

721
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,920
We run DNA tests,
we checked them against his.

722
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,760
Match is positive.

723
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,720
What happens to us now?

724
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,040
After we close the case,
you can go back to your life.

725
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:36,120
- But if we don't wanna go back?
- That happens.

726
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,960
But what you're saying is,
if we wanted to, we could?

727
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,960
That also happens.

728
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,920
- Still busy.
- Try her again.

729
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,120
I'm not your fucking kid brother,
you can't order me around.

730
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,120
I know that, Richie,
I buried my kid brother.

731
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,520
So lighten up, we're dead.

732
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,280
If they dig around some more,
we're alive. We just bought us...

733
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,520
some more time, that's all.
Now try the old lady again.

734
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,720
She's... huh, packing tomorrow,
let me go find her.

735
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,240
She says she'll call you
when she gets back to the house.

736
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,000
No, as a matter of fact I'm
staying down here for a while.

737
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,960
Kind of a...
trial separation.

738
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,800
I don't understand.

739
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,280
I'm not sure we do either,
but... that's where we're at.

740
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,200
No, no, say it.

741
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,680
There's no way the lord's
gonna let you break up.

742
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,200
Okay, mom, appreciate it.

743
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,880
She says no way we'll break up.

744
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,360
The Lord knows I prayed for it,
it'll never happen.

745
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,160
Mississippi river, navigation
and rules of inland water ways?

746
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:13,440
- Homework. A lot of laughs.
- I'll wait for the movie.

747
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,800
Can we at least give it a try?
Now that we're safe?

748
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:24,240
Maybe Matt and Pam can fix the things,
Wayne and Carmen never could.

749
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,760
- You honestly believe that?
- I honestly do.

750
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,040
- Stay.
- No.

751
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,280
- Stay.
- No.

752
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,160
- Fight with me.
- No.

753
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,880
Don't say no.

754
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,480
It's not one thing.
It's not one... day.

755
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,960
It's not... a baby
or... no baby.

756
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,960
It's... years.

757
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,520
And I need time, Wayne.

758
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,160
Time to remember
what I cared for you...

759
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,480
and what you cared for me.

760
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,560
Okay, let's fix that.

761
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,080
I think we can fix that.

762
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,280
I think we started
to fix it right here.

763
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,640
Who is it?

764
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,200
Are you leaving?

765
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,240
Richie too?

766
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,280
What did he tell you...
about me?

767
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,680
You know how he is,
he brags about you a lot.

768
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,760
- What I do for a living?
- That's none of my business, Armand.

769
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,360
I've enjoyed your company.
And I think you're a nice person.

770
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,840
And I wish you all the best.

771
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,760
I forgot something.

772
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,520
Please pick up.

773
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,520
Hi, that's
I'm not here...

774
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,720
Hungry?

775
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,680
Your mom told us,
you'd be home by breakfast,

776
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,440
you could've driven
a little faster.

777
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,120
We're getting hungry.

778
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,240
Oh...

779
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,520
you got nice hair.

780
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,240
Why don't you scoot over.

781
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,760
I wanna get something here.

782
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,480
You wanna fix the Bird
some lunch?

783
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,480
We brought our own food.

784
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,920
- What'd you want?
- Just waiting for your husband.

785
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,920
And then what?

786
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,560
What, you can't say it?

787
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,080
I know why you're here.

788
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,160
Last time you held a shotgun,
the 12 gage,

789
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,680
you wanted to shoot me,
didn't you?

790
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,200
But you couldn't.

791
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,320
- Where is it?
- In Missouri.

792
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,440
- So, your husband has it?
- I hope so.

793
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,240
Why don't we shoot her now Bird
and take care of her husband later?

794
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,360
- Yeah? What if he calls her?
- Don't answer the phone,

795
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,440
he thinks she went out
get food, fix some lunch.

796
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,840
He comes in,
hi honey I'm home...

797
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,360
Boom!

798
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,880
So, what's...
"Hot Doe Buck Lure"?

799
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,960
Why don't you try some,
maybe you'll attract a deer.

800
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:54,560
Making the Bird's lunch?
You put in an order for dessert yet?

801
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,360
I eat chicken every meal,
you know why?

802
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,880
No.

803
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,480
Because of Wade Boggs,
he ate chicken before every game.

804
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,200
That's why they called him
the "Chicken Man. "

805
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,760
Bird, you know who Wade Boggs is?
No, Bird doesn't know shit.

806
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,880
I'm was gonna be a Major
League ballplayer.

807
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,680
Till my deprived childhood
as an orphan fucked up my chances.

808
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,760
So I became
a bank robber instead.

809
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,360
Hey, Carmen...

810
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,760
I got an idea... Why don't you
take your clothes off.

811
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,680
You don't have to take
off all your clothes.

812
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,480
You can leave on
your panties...

813
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,360
and your brassiere...
If you wear a brassiere.

814
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,280
Do you?

815
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,440
Do you?

816
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,320
Oh Bird, she don't wear one.

817
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,320
Well, you can just strip down
to your panties, and...

818
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,720
be our little topless bunny
and serve us drinks.

819
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,320
God... damn.

820
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,080
You need to kick
harder than that.

821
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,680
I think you're gonna feel
a lot better...

822
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,920
go to the bathroom...

823
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,000
take off your clothes...
Wash yourself.

824
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,720
Wait!

825
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,720
Use that one.

826
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,520
You need somewhere
to sleep off that hangover?

827
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,960
Give me five minutes.

828
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,560
Okay.

829
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,200
I said I want you topless.

830
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,320
That's my husband's jacket.
Take it off.

831
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,120
Why don't we make a trade.

832
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,560
I take off the jacket...

833
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,560
you take off your top.

834
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,360
I don't like your outfit.

835
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,760
You look like
a little school girl.

836
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,080
Sherlock...

837
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,600
now you're gonna answer
the fucking phone?

838
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,160
Let it ring.

839
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,120
Hi! We're not in right now,
go ahead leave a message...

840
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,400
Jesus Christ, Bird!
You ever stop eating?

841
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,880
What's wrong with our little bunny?
You scared, what?

842
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,240
There's no reason to be.

843
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,640
Old Wayne comes home, we're just
gonna have a little talk with him.

844
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,320
Isn't that right Bird?

845
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,920
Hey Bird, you gonna ask
if anyone else wants some...

846
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,360
before you finish it?

847
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,080
Man, what you gonna do
when Donna asks you...

848
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,880
to wear one of them
Elvis jumpsuits for her?

849
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,320
I guess you could always wear
that pink one he had...

850
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,520
after he swole up like a pig.

851
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,520
I read about this guy once.

852
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,520
He weighed 1200 pounds.
Can you believe that?

853
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,200
For breakfast he'd have like
two pounds of bacon.

854
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,200
A dozen eggs, some rolls.

855
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,440
Then for lunch he'd have
four hamburgers,

856
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,520
4 double cheeseburgers,
8 boxes of fries.

857
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,160
For dinner three ham steaks,

858
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,880
six sweet potatoes,
six or seven regular potatoes.

859
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,360
Some stuffing...
God!

860
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Can you imagine
this guy taking a dump?

861
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:02,280
See, Donna...
that's the Bird's sweetheart...

862
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,240
When this is all done,
the Bird and Donna...

863
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,240
are gonna go down to Memphis,
hold hands...

864
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:13,720
Look at all that Elvis shit.
Isn't that right Bird?

865
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,640
The only trouble is
that Donna...

866
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,640
is probably fucking Elvis
as we speak.

867
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,680
You get one Ritchie,
just like everybody else.

868
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,680
Do you know why I shot him?

869
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,240
He wasn't who I thought he was.

870
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,440
I had this kid brother.

871
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,440
We were in a hospital
one time... on a job.

872
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,320
And when we were done, there
was this nurse standing there.

873
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,280
She saw us do it.

874
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,120
My kid brother just stood
there looking at her.

875
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,840
He looked at her too long.

876
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,120
Maybe he liked her face.

877
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,680
Anyway, that's what killed him.

878
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,800
Go put some clothes on.

879
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:16,160
I have to go upstairs.

880
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,800
I'm not like Richie.
I'm not the same as him.

881
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,200
I know.

882
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,040
You meet a woman.
You kid yourself, she sees you.

883
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,920
Sees who you really are,
under all this shit.

884
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,440
Turns out...

885
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,440
she's just another bitch
with a lipstick.

886
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,880
You're wrong. I do see you.
I panicked...

887
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,280
I panicked when I saw
the gun... I panicked.

888
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,360
Shut up!

889
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,960
- Where's your husband?
- I don't know.

890
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,480
- When does he get back?
- I don't know.

891
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,480
Then you call him.

892
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,560
You call him and you tell him
to get back here.

893
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,960
I'm tired of waiting.
I wanna finish this.

894
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,680
He's not coming back.
He's in Missouri.

895
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,280
He's not even
my husband anymore.

896
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,680
Don't you get it?

897
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,960
Don't you know anything
about real life?

898
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,800
Real life?
What the fuck is that?

899
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,080
Missouri huh?

900
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,280
Carmen!

901
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,040
It's me.

902
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,920
I tried calling.

903
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,160
Honey?

904
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,960
You have to let me in.
I... don't have a key.

905
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,960
- Will you please go?
- Okay, alright.

906
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,960
Just hear me out.

907
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,800
Look, I've had... huh,
400 miles...

908
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,800
and 15 years
to think about this.

909
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,480
See, five's terrible, right?
That's what you said.

910
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,920
So... let's go for six.

911
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,800
And then...
if we make it to six...

912
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,520
then we can try for seven,
'cause...

913
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,960
I really wanna make it
to ten for you.

914
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,320
Carmen...

915
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,040
'Cause I get it now.

916
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,120
Carmen?

917
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,200
I understand.
So, huh...

918
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,000
If you... if you're not
gonna let me in,

919
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,400
at least let me get something.

920
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:44,200
In the car. A present...
I left it...

921
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:41,640
You gotta know what you're
doing when you go in.

922
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:46,440
You gotta have it figured out.

923
