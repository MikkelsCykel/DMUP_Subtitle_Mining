00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,240
I heard that my son, Dave Jr...
You met Dave Jr, right?

3
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,720
This is great news.
I was notified Sunday that Dave Jr

4
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,520
will be tried as a juvenile for grand theft auto.

5
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,640
Congratulations.

6
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,320
911. 911.

7
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Mommy.

8
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,560
Mom?

9
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm really thirsty, Mommy.

10
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,760
OK.

11
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,880
OK. OK, sweetie.

12
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,320
- Good night.
- Wait. There's one more sip left.

13
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,120
- Half a sip. You don't need it. Good night.
- I do need it. I do need it, Mommy.

14
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,880
OK. Now good night for real, OK?

15
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,880
- Good night, Mom.
- Night-night.

16
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,960
I'm real excited about the field trip tomorrow.

17
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,120
- I love big boats.
- That's good.

18
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,920
- The Circle Line is big, right?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Good.

20
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,285
Mom?

21
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,160
Sleepy time now.

22
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,040
Is Daddy coming
to my soccer game tomorrow?

23
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,805
He's gonna try, Sammy.

24
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,240
Honey, do you remember when
I explained to you that Daddy has

25
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,880
- a different schedule to other daddies?
- Yeah.

26
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,360
Well, musicians don't always know exactly
when they're gonna get a chance to play.

27
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,920
So... there's a chance
he might not come tomorrow.

28
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,200
But he's gonna try.

29
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,485
Yeah. He's gonna try.

30
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,000
I love you a million, billion, zillion.

31
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Do you love him?

32
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
Huh, Mommy?

33
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,400
I will always love your daddy
because he gave me you.

34
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Now go to sleep.

35
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,960
I can't sleep, Mom.

36
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I had a bad dream.

37
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
In just two minutes you already
fell asleep and had a bad dream?

38
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,080
Sweetie...

39
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,800
I don't even think I knew her.
She's lyin'. I'd divorce her.

40
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,760
- Hi, Jack.
- Dad!

41
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,640
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey! You maggot, you! Come here.

42
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Watch your step.

43
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,440
- Maggie, be careful.
- It's all right. She does it all the time.

44
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,000
I can't believe your plumbing's not fixed yet.

45
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,040
- So what's up, Kristen?
- Me and Greg got married last Saturday.

46
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,000
- Oh, yeah. How's Greg?
- He's waiting in the car.

47
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,440
Waiting with an ulcer, hoping you'll say yes.
I need you to watch Maggie for me.

48
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,000
OK. I can do that till about six.
Would that help?

49
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,640
- Well...
- For the whole week, Daddy.

50
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
We were going on our honeymoon today.

51
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,640
But the nanny's gotta go watch her mother
have a benign tumor removed in Ohio.

52
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,240
Greg's parents are too old. Mine are too crazy.
Yours are dead. So that leaves you.

53
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,520
- Please, Jack, do this. Please!
- I would love to but I'm working on a story.

54
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,720
- You're always working on a story.
- Yeah. It's what I do.

55
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,600
The same old one about a good-time father
to whom responsibility is a dirty word.

56
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,840
Here's a hint. For an attempted manipulation,
like the one in progress, I'd have tried flattery.

57
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,840
Why am I always the grown-up?

58
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,240
Because at the start of the relationship, when
we chose sides, you chose grown-up first.

59
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,605
- This is how you want it.
- No. What I want

60
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,160
is just once for you to make a sacrifice
in your career for your daughter.

61
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,080
Come here, my little noodle.
My little creature.

62
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,560
Go pee. And wash your hands and face
and brush your teeth.

63
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
We're in a hurry cos we have to
take your friend Maggie to school.

64
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,000
- We can't be late because of your field trip.
- I hate Maggie. She thinks she's so funny.

65
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,560
- Maggie?
- Here's Maggie's doctor's number

66
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,440
and the number of a baby-sitter
who can help tomorrow.

67
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,360
She's got a walk-on part today.
One last thing. This is really important.

68
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,600
My neighbor was supposed to take Maggie
to school for me this morning.

69
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,600
She lives in my building... Jack. Jack?

70
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,520
- Apartment 501. This is her number.
- OK.

71
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
- Her name is Melanie Parker.
- Melanie Parker.

72
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,120
If you want her to take Maggie
to school for you...

73
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,440
If you want her to take Maggie to school,
bring Maggie to her house before eight.

74
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,240
If not, call Mel and let her know that
you don't need her to take Maggie. Jack? OK?

75
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm gonna miss my plane.

76
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,720
- Maybe I should cancel my honeymoon.
- Don't cancel it.

77
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,960
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Don't worry. Say hi to Greg.

78
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,200
- Bye, baby!
- Bye!

79
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,120
Bye, baby.

80
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,240
Bye, baby. Baby!

81
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Come on, Mom.

82
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,400
OK. Press two, honey.

83
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,160
Where are they?

84
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,200
Want some more? Don't burn your hands.
We're havin' a Manhattan camp-out.

85
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Why don't you just bang on the door?

86
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,640
We can't bang on the door of honeymooners.

87
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,520
- What time does your school start?
- I don't know.

88
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,360
It probably starts around nine. We're gonna
get there a few minutes early just to be safe.

89
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,240
- What street's your school on?
- I don't know.

90
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,240
We're in trouble.

91
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,480
- I'm gonna miss the boat trip, aren't I?
- It won't go on time. We'll make it. I promise.

92
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Let's run, just in case.

93
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
What's it say?

94
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,160
"The whole school is on the Circle Line.
Sorry we missed you."

95
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
That's a big "uh-oh," right?

96
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,680
Mom?

97
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,760
You must be Kristen's ex-husband.

98
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
- Hi, Sammy.
- Hi, Maggie.

99
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,920
And you must be...

100
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,320
OK. Well, you're not Sheila,
the actress/baby-sitter,

101
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
or Maggie's pediatrician, Dr Feldman.

102
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,520
Oh, there you go. "Don't forget to call
Melanie Parker." Underlined three times.

103
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,320
We're not quite together yet. Sorry. What do
you mean, I must be Kristen's ex-husband?

104
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,600
That's her daughter, and this is
a totally ex-husband thing to do.

105
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:15,080
You'd know because that's
a totally ex-wife remark.

106
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,480
You know, I have a day. Taxi!

107
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Taxi!

108
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,280
Get those fish. Let's go. Come on.

109
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,920
Wait, wait, wait! You forgot your fish!

110
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
Pier 56, please, as fast as you can.

111
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,080
- I don't wanna sit next to him, Daddy.
- I don't wanna sit next to her, Mommy.

112
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,600
Come on. Over the top.

113
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,400
Would you please just take those? Thank you.

114
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,640
I don't know why you have an attitude. It's
your fault they'll probably miss the field trip.

115
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:51,920
- Not Central Park West. Broadway's faster.
- My attitude is derived from your attitude.

116
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,200
- Derived? You must be a writer.
- Let me guess. Your ex-husband is a writer.

117
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,800
No. My ex-husband is a musician.

118
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,440
I don't need to see that.
I already have an opinion of you.

119
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,160
And I of you.

120
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,360
Liza! Liza, thank God you're home.

121
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,120
- I need a huge favor.
- Melanie? Is that you? You sound awful.

122
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,600
Where are you? Don't answer. I can't talk.
I'm on the other line organizing a fun run.

123
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,480
No, wait. Don't hang up. I really need you to...

124
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,000
Bye, honey.

125
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,080
- Hello? Hello!
- Yeah, I'm here.

126
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
- What's the matter?
- There's this guy,

127
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,880
who obviously thinks a minor amount of
charm replaces integrity and commitment,

128
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,760
has not only ruined my day but Sammy's
as well. He's completely missed his field trip.

129
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,720
- My mom hates your dad.
- So? My dad hates your mom.

130
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,805
- So?
- So?

131
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,280
Hey, it's me. I just wanna know
if you're wearin' panties.

132
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,125
What color are they?

133
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
Lew, I need this photo approved now.

134
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,760
If I ever act interested in another man again,
would you please shoot me?

135
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,160
- No, don't take 57th across!
- Pink?

136
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,280
- Pink? Sure.
- When is Jack getting in?

137
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,840
No, I will not leave Sammy at the Ninth Street
drop-in center, Liza. He hates it there.

138
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,240
You're my sister.
How can you not watch him?

139
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,605
I have to meet my boss in 15 minutes.

140
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,120
Then I have this presentation, which
could add up to a huge promotion for me.

141
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,320
And you have no job, a nanny,
a cook and a housekeeper.

142
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,680
The nanny is taking Courtney
to Mommy and Me.

143
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,200
Angela is cooking all day for
our dinner party tonight. Berta is cleaning.

144
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,640
- And I'm working at the school this morning.
- What about later?

145
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:37,200
Later I'm getting dressed
for our dinner party tonight.

146
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,640
- Why don't you get a nanny?
- Because I can't afford a nanny, Liza.

147
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,400
You're with a girl, aren't ya? You dog, you!

148
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,760
A real superwoman. Can't open
her door, won't shut her mouth.

149
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,240
Excuse me. Are you talking about me?

150
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,760
The first lady. We're thinking
about doing a piece on her.

151
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,440
You're insulted because I said I had
a presentation and you don't work.

152
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,320
I do work, Melanie.
I am the CEO of this household.

153
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm sorry I can't help you out.
But you're perfect. You'll figure it out.

154
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,960
OK. OK. Bye.

155
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,560
OK, OK. Stay with me. There are cars.

156
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,960
Oh, thank God! It's still here!

157
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,480
- This is it.
- That's not it. There's nobody in there!

158
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,880
- Maybe they're upstairs.
- Upstairs.

159
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
Sammy, wait for me.

160
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,760
- I got it.
- No, I'm fine.

161
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,800
OK. Excuse me.

162
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,280
Go, go! Watch your step.

163
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,440
- It was the first boat. I'm telling you.
- There wasn't anybody on the first boat!

164
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,440
- Oh, no!
- It's OK. We can still make it. Goddammit!

165
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,200
Hey!

166
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Hey, boat! Hey!

167
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Hey, come here! Come back!
I got kids over here!

168
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,560
Come back! Hey!

169
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,520
I got kids here!

170
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,280
Goddammit!

171
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,480
Who wants to go on a boat
in the rain anyway?

172
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
I know. You did.

173
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,160
All right. Listen. Melanie.

174
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,320
I feel awful about this. I'm gonna
make it up to you. You too, kiddo.

175
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,840
All right?

176
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,845
OK.

177
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,720
Here's an idea. I watch the kids right now
while you do your presentation.

178
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:17,960
I heard you say you had one in 15 minutes.

179
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,800
And you watch her for me later today while
I do the column. It'll only take an hour or so.

180
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,160
Hi! Maggie Taylor calling.

181
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,600
I have an urgent message
for stupid Sammy Parker.

182
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm not stupid. You're stupid.

183
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,040
I don't think so. I only let incredibly
responsible people watch my son.

184
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm incredibly responsible.

185
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
- I'm hungry, Daddy.
- Want a Tic Tac?

186
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:45,280
- No.
- That's all I got.

187
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,280
Here, baby.

188
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,760
- What's that?
- A muffin. Thank you, Melanie.

189
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,120
You're welcome, sweetheart.

190
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,320
You were saying?

191
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,600
I was saying that maybe we could
just help each other out today.

192
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Well...

193
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,480
Hey!

194
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,680
- Looks like you missed the boat.
- I guess we did.

195
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,360
I really don't need your help, but if I did,

196
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,520
you would be the very last
person I would turn to.

197
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,160
These are the class fish. They were
supposed to be back in the classroom at 8:30.

198
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,440
Now they are spending the day with you.

199
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,240
God, I am going to be so late.
I have such a day.

200
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,840
- A bus!
- But, Mom...

201
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,800
- Those aren't toys, honey.
- Mom, that's not your phone. Mom!

202
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,520
Don't be like that when you grow up.

203
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:53,360
She just drops off the... bag of cookies...
and tells me to keep 'em for a week.

204
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,725
How do you feel about the cookies, Jack?

205
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,520
Love the cookies.
Have a big problem with the...

206
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,200
- Cookie-maker?
- That's right.

207
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,720
The cookie-maker thinks
that all I am interested in

208
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,280
or all that I'm capable of handling
with respect to the cookie in question

209
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,200
is the...

210
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,040
- The frosting?
- Exactly. Exactly.

211
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,840
Just because the frosting is my specialty
doesn't mean that I can't do more.

212
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,880
I have many layers to me.
And they're not all vanilla, either.

213
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,320
I have chocolate in me.
I have a deep, dark chocolate...

214
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm still hungry, Daddy.

215
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,840
- Darling, let Doc Martin and I finish.
- But what about the cookies?

216
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,240
Just a little while. OK?

217
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,160
I'm sick of angry, resentful...

218
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,080
fish...

219
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,720
who think that you owe them,

220
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,360
but who won't trust you for a second
to do anything for 'em.

221
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,040
- There are other fish in the sea.
- Yes, I know.

222
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,840
It's just... I wish I could find a fish
who wasn't afraid of my dark-chocolate layer.

223
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,440
And she'd have to love my cookie too.

224
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:13,440
You know, I think that my ex... cookie-maker
has turned me off to fish entirely.

225
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,360
I met a real piece of work this morning.

226
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,080
Tell me about her, Jack.

227
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,720
This fish was a fox.
She had her own cookie too.

228
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,600
But what a female dog.
She shoved her fish in my face...

229
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,600
In front of the cookie?

230
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,560
What's she doing with another fish anyway?
Is she AC/DC?

231
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,160
- What are you talkin' about?
- Fish... with other fish, in front of cookies.

232
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,840
Fish.

233
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Fish fish.

234
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,080
I see.

235
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,640
- After you.
- No, after you.

236
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,600
- I insist.
- I insist more.

237
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,560
You can't make any noise in the office.
I have a really important meeting. OK?

238
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,720
- Don't touch that.
- It's empty.

239
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,120
Sammy, I'm really late and I don't
need you spilling anything right now.

240
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,200
- Please don't do that now.
- Why not?

241
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,680
Because I want you
to practice being super-quiet.

242
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,400
OK. Now stay next to me.
Here's your dinosaur.

243
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,600
- You're kidding.
- Please don't give me a hard time, Evelyn.

244
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,960
- I'm also 20 minutes late.
- 25 minutes late.

245
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,360
Mr Leland, as you might expect,
is displeased.

246
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
- What are those?
- The Haskell blueprints.

247
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,520
- Rob Wilding got them in ahead of schedule.
- He did?

248
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,605
Why would you bring a child here?

249
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,880
Remember when Sally brought her kid here
with the poison sumac?

250
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,040
Mr Leland just smelled the calamine lotion
and had to leave.

251
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,120
He does not have poison anything. He's not
even sick. He just missed his field trip.

252
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:16,280
- I don't think so.
- Five minutes. Please?

253
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,280
And I would be doing this because...?

254
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,925
Of our sense of solidarity.

255
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,120
We're both women, and this is
a tough office and a tough world...

256
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,560
- Five minutes.
- Thank you.

257
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,880
Evelyn, has Miss Parker come in yet?

258
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,320
- Miss Parker, you're late.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry, sir.

259
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,080
- You're late.
- Let me go get the model. I'll be right in.

260
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,160
Sammy!

261
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh my God.

262
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Let me look at it.

263
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,520
Oh my God.

264
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,680
Evelyn, would you ask
Miss Parker to come in, please?

265
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,800
No.

266
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
She'll be right in.

267
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,920
Put this in the back room for me, please.

268
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,200
Go, go, go.

269
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,080
You! Get behind the desk and stay there!

270
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,040
I'm sorry, sir. I forgot. The model
is still in the model shop downtown.

271
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:17,120
I'm heading there right now to...

272
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,720
I went by there this morning to pick it up
for this meeting, but the shop was locked.

273
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,120
But I promise you, you are going to
love the model, Mr Leland, sir,

274
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,760
and today at two the people from
Yates and Yates are going to love it too.

275
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:32,760
- I assume you're ready.
- Of course.

276
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,280
There's something I'd like to show you.
Evelyn, bring in the Haskell blueprint.

277
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,205
What an adorable little boy!

278
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,160
Also, check if my amoxicillin prescription
still has refills available.

279
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,800
- Mommy...
- That's a good idea. Let's go find your mom.

280
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm very sorry, sir, but someone spilled
my coffee all over the Haskell blueprints.

281
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,520
Oh my God.

282
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,220
Do you know that every Thanksgiving
I catch strep throat?

283
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:06,800
Healthy children can give you
strep throat from other kids

284
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,200
without your even going near them.

285
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,600
My sister sets up a kids' table
in the next room, and I still get strep throat.

286
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:16,680
We're going to go find his mother, sir.

287
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,080
She must work in the law offices
across the hall.

288
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm sure she does.

289
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,920
Excuse me.

290
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,400
- Hello?
- You asshole!

291
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,920
- What?
- Get over here.

292
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,680
The mayor's called
a press conference at five o'clock.

293
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
While you were talkin' about pink panties,
your story was turning to shit!

294
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,000
You know, Miss Parker,

295
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,440
I don't need to remind you what the Yates
account would be worth to this firm.

296
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,440
- And, by extension, to you.
- No, sir.

297
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,200
Do you know what I think of
when I look at him?

298
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,520
- No.
- A carrier monkey.

299
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,360
He's not a carrier monkey, sir.
He looks like a healthy little...

300
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll go find his mother.

301
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Oh my God. What am I gonna do?

302
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,685
I'm really sorry, Mommy.

303
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,760
It's OK, sweetie. It's really not your fault.

304
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,560
It's Maggie's daddy's fault.

305
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,760
Slow down.

306
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,200
- This isn't a very good breakfast, Daddy.
- That's an advantage of being an adult.

307
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:30,137
You get to act like a kid
any time you feel like it.

308
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:33,040
Mommy would never let me have
hamburgers for breakfast.

309
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,160
You see what I mean?

310
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,280
- Hello.
- Who's that?

311
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,360
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

312
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,160
What are you doing
with my daughter's phone?

313
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,240
Damn. We must've switched. I'm Jack Taylor.
Our kids are in schooI together.

314
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,520
- "You Don't Know Jack" Taylor?
- That's me.

315
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,885
Oh my God! You're so adorable.

316
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,040
- I love your column.
- Oh, thanks.

317
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,120
- Are you married?
- I'm divorced. What's your name?

318
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,640
- Rita.
- Rita.

319
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,040
Listen, Jack. I've got to go get exfoliated.

320
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,480
- Now, Melanie has your phone, right?
- That's right.

321
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,660
- So what is that number?
- Pennsylvania 3317.

322
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:10,685
- Pennsylvania. So cute. 3317.
- My dad used to...

323
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,560
Darling, if you speak with her before I do,
would you do me a favor?

324
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,840
Her sister phoned me to see
if I would baby-sit Sammy later on.

325
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,520
But I'm in the middle of my Spring Spa Day
at Elizabeth Arden. I can't cancel now.

326
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,120
But tell her that otherwise
I would have been happy to baby-sit.

327
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
No matter what she thinks,

328
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,280
I have forgotten all about Sammy
putting my wedding ring up his nose.

329
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,960
- I'll tell her, Rita.
- You're adorable.

330
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,400
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

331
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,280
- Hello?
- It's Jack Taylor.

332
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,960
- How did you get this number?
- You're holding my phone.

333
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,880
- This is so typical of you.
- Let's skip the hostilities and do messages.

334
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,040
- Fine.
- Your mother's at a spa day so can't baby-sit.

335
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,720
It's not because she's upset about
Sammy sticking her ring up her nose.

336
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,200
His nose. Thank you. You have
a press conference at five. Goodbye.

337
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,440
Maybe we ought to arrange
to switch our phones back.

338
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:07,120
Tomorrow when we drop
the kids off at school. On time?

339
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,760
- Fine.
- Fine.

340
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,640
Maggie, when you grow up and you are
incredibly beautiful and intelligent

341
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,320
and possess a certain sweetness

342
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,000
that's like a distant promise
to the brave and to the worthy,

343
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,960
can you please not beat to a pulp every
miserable bastard just because you can?

344
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,960
Can you just not do that?

345
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,840
- OK, Daddy.
- All right.

346
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,000
- Let me help you.
- It's OK. I got it, I got it.

347
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,480
- OK, sweetie. Come on.
- Stupid American woman.

348
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
That guy called you stupid.

349
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,720
I am stupid sometimes, honey.
But I'd rather be stupid than sorry.

350
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,840
- How bad is it?
- Well, it's modular.

351
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,000
So it's conceivable I could
lift out the damaged portion

352
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,280
and replace it from the mockup.

353
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,400
- So I wouldn't have to start from scratch.
- Vincent, that's brilliant!

354
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:21,360
Sammy, honey. You cannot
run around here. OK?

355
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,320
- It won't be perfect.
- I'm thirsty, Mommy.

356
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,440
It's OK.

357
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,800
I know you, Mel. You won't be happy
with less than perfect.

358
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,160
- Today I will.
- I can't get the straw apart, Mommy.

359
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,040
I don't even wanna think about what'll
happen if I don't have that model by two.

360
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,120
- All right, then. I'll give it a try.
- Thanks.

361
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,880
Now, while I'm doing my column,

362
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,960
you need to think of at least 600 fun things
to do, cos the rest of the day is yours.

363
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,400
I already know, Daddy. I wanna go to the zoo
and on a horse-and-carriage ride

364
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,600
and to the carousel and to the Natural
Museum of History and to The Cats...

365
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,920
It's Cats, not The Cats.

366
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,480
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey.

367
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,400
Hi, Jack. I didn't know you had a daughter.

368
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,520
- Yeah, this is Maggie.
- She's so cute.

369
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,200
- She looks just like you.
- She'll grow out of it.

370
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,200
- Why are all the girls talking to you like that?
- Like what?

371
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,520
"Hi, Jack."

372
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,520
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, Celia.

373
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
See what she just did?

374
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,840
You know, I'm doing a story on men like you.

375
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,960
- Oh, yeah? What's the hook?
- Just an expression my mother used to use.

376
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,600
"Love your guy like a little boy
and he'll grow into a man."

377
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,400
Jack! Get in here!

378
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,640
Fish! You're not gonna believe
the morning that I have had already.

379
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,120
You look cranky. You back on that diet?

380
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,880
- Honey, remember Lew?
- We haven't seen each other in a long time.

381
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,440
I am cranky, Jack, and I ate
a very good breakfast this morning.

382
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,880
- We're in big trouble on your garbage story.
- No, we're not.

383
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,200
- Come here, honey.
- It's OK. Go ahead.

384
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,120
This is Lois Lane.
She lives here in the newsroom.

385
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,360
Wow!

386
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,720
Wanna pet her, sweetheart?
Go ahead. She won't bite.

387
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,520
- You got a raging scoop disease, my friend.
- Which is what you love about me.

388
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,760
Stay here and play with the kitty, honey,
while me and your daddy go have a talk.

389
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,360
That's a girl.

390
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,640
- Let's go.
- Now, would you rather that I wasn't first?

391
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,805
- I'd rather you were right.
- I am right.

392
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,200
OK. Who told you that the mayor's reelection
campaign took contributions from the Mob?

393
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:36,840
- Manny Feldstein.
- Manny Feldstein told you, on the record,

394
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,120
"Newark trucking company
Grace and Marra, a Mob front,

395
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,800
made an illegal contribution
to the mayor's campaign."

396
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,200
- That's right. On the record.
- In exchange for the city sanitation contract.

397
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:49,285
- On the record.
- Awarded without bidding.

398
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,800
To Grace and Marra.
That's right. On the record.

399
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,080
Manny Feldstein's gonna say
he never talked to you!

400
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,280
- What? Hey. What?
- At the mayor's press conference today

401
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,360
- Hi, Jack.
- Feldstein's gonna say you made it all up.

402
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
- You didn't, did you?
- Of course not.

403
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,080
Manny told me he saw
the campaign accounts.

404
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,440
$250,000 was deposited
in unnumbered accounts.

405
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,080
Freddy, hold page three.
We may have to print a retraction.

406
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,640
- Of what?
- You're gonna give me an ulcer.

407
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,440
- I can feel it. Couldn't you get two sources?
- Remember the Cardinal O'Brien story?

408
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,320
- We almost got fired!
- I almost got the Pulitzer prize.

409
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,000
It's real simple, Jack. Management doesn't
wanna clean up after you anymore. Not now!

410
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,840
- I'm a good reporter, Lew.
- No. You are a great reporter.

411
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,280
But sometimes you get too excited
and get me too excited.

412
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,220
And now I've given you
enough rope to hang us both.

413
00:31:42,255 --> 00:31:45,040
And, Jack, nobody almost
gets a Pulitzer prize.

414
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,000
- They won't fire me. My picture's on buses.
- I said that.

415
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,520
Then they asked me
to lunch with Frank Burroughs.

416
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,160
- Dad?
- Frank Burroughs?

417
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,920
- "Frankly Speaking" is a popular column.
- He's a pompous, arrogant, humorless ass!

418
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,960
Who's won the Pulitzer prize.

419
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm not gonna lose my job. I got alimony
and shrink bills, old college loans to repay.

420
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:05,680
- Daddy...
- One second.

421
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
I have a plumbing situation.

422
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,080
Now, Manny has been my guy all year long.

423
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,520
One second, darling.

424
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,325
I played bridge with his mother.
I took his niece to Cirque du Soleil.

425
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,440
Just one second. I had to sit through
him playing Tevye in dinner theater, Lew!

426
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,405
- Dinner theater!
- Jack!

427
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,480
I gave you this column, and I love you like
a son. But I can't cover for you anymore.

428
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,885
You've got six hours to that
press conference and no other leads.

429
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,640
Get Feldstein back on the record or find
another source to confirm this thing.

430
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,040
Otherwise we're printing a retraction.
And I guarantee you, Jack, it'll be your last.

431
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,400
That's fine. If you need me,
I'm at a different number today.

432
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,160
- Where are you goin'?
- To find Manny.

433
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,160
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- I will.

434
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,960
Hi, Jack. Listen. I really wanted
to say something to you, Jack.

435
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,400
I've noticed that you haven't
been dating for quite a while.

436
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,280
- Right.
- Actually, we've all noticed.

437
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,400
Hey, there we go. Hi.

438
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,720
I know that you're sensitive,

439
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
but frightened.

440
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm gentle,

441
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,520
but brutal.

442
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,760
Think about it. Think about me, Jack.

443
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,420
I will.

444
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,440
OK.

445
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,600
Brutal.

446
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,480
Marla? Have you seen my daughter?
Have you seen Maggie?

447
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:40,400
- No, I haven't.
- Excuse me, please.

448
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,480
Have you seen my daughter? No?

449
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:45,520
Maggie? Damn it!

450
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,900
Hey, Jack.

451
00:33:47,935 --> 00:33:50,165
Hi, Daddy.

452
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,360
"Hi, Daddy?" Do you do this with
your mother, this wandering-off thing?

453
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,080
- Yeah.
- Cos it's not a good thing to do.

454
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,360
Now I've gotta go talk to a guy downtown.

455
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,520
It's kind of a tricky thing
and I only have one shot at it, so...

456
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,280
- I can't come?
- That's right. What am I gonna do with you?

457
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,520
This is incredibly difficult for me, but you are
the absolute last person I can think of to ask.

458
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,045
I'm really in a bind. I could lose my job.

459
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,720
I know you're recording but...
Can you hold on a minute?

460
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,240
I know you're recording
but it would just be for an hour.

461
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
From two to three.

462
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,760
Come on, Eddie. You're his father.

463
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,720
Fine. Never mind. I'll think of something.

464
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,360
Are you at least coming to his soccer game?

465
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,520
Six. It would mean a lot to him.

466
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,280
- Mel!
- Sammy!

467
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,120
Sammy, get off of that.

468
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,160
Time out!

469
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,400
What is the matter with you?
You almost broke it again!

470
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,320
Why can't you play quietly for five minutes?
Don't you realize how important this is?

471
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,800
- I'm taking you to the drop-in center.
- I don't wanna go there.

472
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,800
- Too bad.
- Those kids'll beat me up.

473
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,160
- They won't.
- They will.

474
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,240
Well, you're just gonna have to be brave.
Vincent, I'll be back in an hour for the model!

475
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,840
When the little hand
gets between 4 and 5, that's 4:30.

476
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,600
- I'm sorry.
- You're not being punished. I'll be back.

477
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,000
- We can go to your soccer game.
- That's too long.

478
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,360
Sweetheart, I set the alarm and I'll be here
for you by the time it goes off. I promise.

479
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,520
- But I don't wanna go in there.
- But it'll be fun!

480
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,960
Look! It's Superhero Day!

481
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,560
Hey! Spiderman!

482
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,000
He can't come in here. He's not a superhero!

483
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,320
Oh, yeah? You guys sure about that?

484
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,200
- He doesn't look like one.
- He looks like a poo-poo crybaby.

485
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,000
When the big hand gets to there,

486
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,080
and the little hand gets to there,

487
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,360
- then...
- You'll be back.

488
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,640
Wait a minute.

489
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
Now you're wearin' Daddy's watch.

490
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,640
- But I don't have a costume.
- A costume?

491
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,080
OK. How about...

492
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,360
Bessie the choreographer?
Five, six, seven, eight!

493
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,600
I don't have... You know,
I don't have a costume, darling.

494
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,000
Hey.

495
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,840
Hey, Maggie. Look, honey. Maggie.

496
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,240
- Hi, Sammy.
- Hi, Maggie.

497
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,840
- You said you weren't gonna bring him here.
- Well, I got desperate.

498
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,485
Me too.

499
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,640
So, looks like we need
two superheroes - and fast.

500
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,880
Mama said there'll be days like this

501
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,480
There'll be days like this, Mama said

502
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,000
Mama said, Mama said

503
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,200
Mama said there'll be days like this

504
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,800
There'll be days like this, my mama said

505
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,240
Mama said, Mama said

506
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,840
I went walking the other day

507
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,440
And everything was going fine

508
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,600
I met a little boy named Billy Joe
and then almost lost my mind

509
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,920
Where do you get a bag like that?

510
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Mama said there'll be days like this...

511
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,920
If those mean boys give you any more
trouble, first go to the teacher.

512
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,720
If she doesn't help, call me on the mobile.
And if you can't reach me, call 911.

513
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,960
Kick the mean boys in the shins.

514
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,120
- Bye!
- Bye!

515
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,640
- Thanks for doin' that.
- Sure. It's hard enough being a kid.

516
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:56,680
- It is excellent.
- And you would know.

517
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,160
- What's that?
- Nothing.

518
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,245
- Know what my mother told me?
- Gee, no.

519
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,760
"Love your guy like a little boy
and he'll grow into a man."

520
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,960
- She knew you were gay?
- I'm not gay.

521
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,360
- Then why the advice about loving guys?
- She hoped I'd meet a woman like that.

522
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,760
I can't stand those people who blame their
worst traits on everyone but themselves.

523
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
It's so '90s.

524
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,800
What are you talkin' about?

525
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,880
You're blaming your Peter Pan complex
on your mother.

526
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,360
- Do you have any friends?
- I don't have time.

527
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,160
That's because of
your Captain Hook complex.

528
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:32,240
- My what?
- Captain Hook complex.

529
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,800
- There's no such thing.
- Yes, there is. And you have it.

530
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,120
- Here's your phone back.
- Here's yours.

531
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,200
Thank you!

532
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,920
Hey! Feldstein!

533
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,960
- Hey!
- I can't meet with you right now, Jack.

534
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Hey, Manny!

535
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,120
Manny!

536
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
- Hey, Manny.
- Please don't hit me.

537
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,200
- I won't. What's goin' on?
- I've been having thoughts.

538
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,760
- We already had our thoughts.
- Please don't yell.

539
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,320
You were the one who said to me
this garbage thing stinks.

540
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,080
I waited for a month for you
to get comfortable with this.

541
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,240
We print the story. It runs on the front page.

542
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,080
And now you tell me you are having
thoughts? What is the matter with you?

543
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,680
I've been having trouble with my medication.
You get the dose wrong, you get grandiose.

544
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,800
We talked about takin' down the mayor
and the Mob together. That's crazy.

545
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,400
- No, it's not.
- It is!

546
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,880
Now that I'm a little better regulated,
I realize they will kill me!

547
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,325
Hey, listen to me.

548
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,000
Don't do this to me.
All right? Look at me. Hey.

549
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,440
I'm the one who started your standing
ovation for "If I Were a Rich Man," right?

550
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,760
- I can't do it.
- You can do it. You're my guy.

551
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,440
I got a wife and a family. I'm their guy too.
You're hurting my neck.

552
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,640
Yeah. Oh, yeah. All right.

553
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,840
I'm sorry, Jack.

554
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,480
- All right. Gimme a name.
- I can't think of any names.

555
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,520
- Whose name is on the account?
- I don't know. I only saw numbers.

556
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,920
- Who set up the account?
- I don't know.

557
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,280
- Who set up the account, Manny?
- Eddie McCoy, maybe?

558
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,400
Maybe Eddie McCoy? How...

559
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,240
You know what? I'm gonna figure it out
myself. OK, Manny? Thank you.

560
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,960
- Hello?
- Mommy.

561
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,320
- What happened?
- I don't wanna stay here anymore.

562
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:26,320
And neither does Maggie.

563
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,880
- Sweetie, you have to, just for a little while...
- No.

564
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,200
What happened?

565
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Spiderman kicked me
and She-Ra took Maggie's snack.

566
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,880
Let me talk to the teacher.

567
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,800
She's outside talking to the Hulk
about not using the F-word.

568
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,200
Sammy, you'll just have to be brave and...

569
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,960
- What's LSD?
- LSD?

570
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Spiderman was talking to Maggie
about LSD that he got from his brother.

571
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,160
Don't move. Stay right where you are.
You will both be picked up in ten minutes.

572
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,640
No. Manny's a dead end.

573
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,880
- You get anything?
- McCoy probably set up the account.

574
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,560
As campaign manager,
he wouldn't implicate himself.

575
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,680
- City comptroller?
- He'll never talk.

576
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,640
- How about the sanitation commissioner?
- Lieberman?

577
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,400
Metro!

578
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,240
- How do we get ahold of Lieberman?
- He's in Barbados.

579
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,440
- He's in Barbados.
- The sanitation commissioner in Barbados?

580
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,240
- During a garbage scandal.
- Maybe the mayor wanted him outta town.

581
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
- Metro!
- What?

582
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,800
- What's Lieberman doin' in Barbados?
- He's there with his new girlfriend.

583
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,400
- He's there with his new girlfriend.
- Which leaves his very angry wife.

584
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,160
- Bingo.
- I'm in the lobby. I'll be right up.

585
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,880
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Melanie Parker.

586
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,560
We have a problem with our kids. They're OK
but they have to be picked up right now.

587
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,920
- Can you do it?
- Me? Now?

588
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,360
I'd definitely jeopardize my career
and my life if I picked them up now.

589
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,680
But your press conference isn't
until five. My presentation is at two.

590
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,360
I gotta see Elaine Lieberman
for some information.

591
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,080
- Can't you phone?
- Yeah...

592
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,560
- Great.
- Isn't there anybody else you can call?

593
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,040
- I wouldn't be asking you if there were.
- Yeah.

594
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,040
I could watch them both from three o'clock
until your press conference ends

595
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,200
if you'll watch them both
from now until three.

596
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,360
- You're asking me for help.
- It would appear that way.

597
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,560
I'll agree if you say
"Please be my knight in shining armor."

598
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,080
Jack, don't be a shithead.
Go rescue our kids.

599
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,400
This is hard for you, isn't it?

600
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:42,320
Are you agreeing or not?

601
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,440
You know, I got a day too.

602
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,200
Sorry. I'll meet you and the kids in my
office lobby at Rockefeller Center at 3:15.

603
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,960
- Fine.
- Fine.

604
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,840
Marla, tell Celia to get Elaine Lieberman's
home number and call me on my cell phone.

605
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,760
No...

606
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,240
What?

607
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,080
I forgot to tell you.
Sammy is allergic to shellfish and dander.

608
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,000
He's not allowed to watch commercial TV.
He has to hold your hand crossing the street.

609
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,520
Also, if you go to the playground,
check the sandbox first.

610
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:18,000
You never know what people
throw in there. Also...

611
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
OK. Bye.

612
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,800
Fine.

613
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,000
Fine.

614
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,400
Hello.

615
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,040
- Hi. It's me.
- Me who?

616
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,440
- Do you have the kids?
- What kids?

617
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,000
You didn't pick up the kids?

618
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,800
Oh, you mean those kids.

619
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,000
- I was just calling...
- To check up on me cos you don't trust me.

620
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,400
Sammy, no! Put the gun down.

621
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,880
You only asked me to watch Sammy
out of sheer desperation.

622
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,520
Part of you would feel safer with him at the
Ninth Street drop-in center with LSD. True?

623
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,080
No, that is not true. I only wanted to warn you
that Sammy can get into trouble faster

624
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,880
than you can make most women smile.

625
00:45:42,915 --> 00:45:45,280
Are you flirting with me?

626
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,400
- Would you please just pay attention to him?
- I won't let him out of my sight.

627
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,960
Sammy! Hey! Guns aren't toys.

628
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,080
- It's not loaded.
- Goodbye!

629
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,360
Sammy, how long have
your mom and dad been divorced?

630
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,200
I don't know. It doesn't matter really
cos she said she'll always love him.

631
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,520
- Yeah? Hey, what's that?
- A marble.

632
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,360
- You get to see your dad a lot?
- Yeah, pretty much, usually.

633
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,565
He has a different schedule than
other daddies. He's a drummer.

634
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,720
But his favorite thing to do is watch me
play soccer. He's probably coming today.

635
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,240
He's taking me fishing this whole summer.
Just us. And maybe Mom will come too.

636
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,360
- Your dad's a drummer, huh?
- Yep.

637
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
- Sounds like a great guy.
- He is.

638
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,400
- Kurt, Jake, you remember Melanie Parker.
- Nice to see you. Nice to see you.

639
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,440
Well... voila.

640
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,120
I love this. This is... What is that?

641
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,200
- A vaulted...
- Vaulted pediment. Vaulted pediment.

642
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,600
- I love that.
- Yeah?

643
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,320
- But I need to see this with cars.
- You don't, Dad. Just use your imagination.

644
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:30,560
My imagination?
I have to see it with the cars.

645
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,080
Cars.

646
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,000
See?

647
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,000
- She's quite a little discovery.
- Yes, she is.

648
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,440
Why don't you join us
for drinks this evening?

649
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,300
Let's say 5:30, at the 21.

650
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:05,080
I... I don't know if I can.

651
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,840
We'll talk about this project. From what I've
seen, you could bring a great deal to this.

652
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,680
- I'll be there.
- Terrific. That's great.

653
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,280
Hi. This is Jack Taylor.
I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman.

654
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,805
- You're trying to be like my dad.
- Am not.

655
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,320
- Daddy, who's that man on the bus?
- One second, darling. What?

656
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,720
- Who's that man?
- It says "Frankly Speaking."

657
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,280
Very important. Elaine Lieberman.

658
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,320
Here we go. Hold hands.

659
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,920
Rosa... Rosa... Could you
just try to speak English?

660
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,040
- OK.
- OK.

661
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
- Hello?
- Hello.

662
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,280
Right, OK. I need...

663
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,440
I need... pronto... her.

664
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,080
- OK.
- OK? OK. Bye-bye.

665
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,320
No, no.

666
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,480
Rosa, listen.

667
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,760
- I need to find Mrs Lieberman.
- OK.

668
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,800
OK. If I don't find her, I could lose my job.

669
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,280
If you don't understand, say "OK."

670
00:49:18,315 --> 00:49:19,965
- OK.
- OK.

671
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,040
OK. Bye-bye. Gracias. Bye-bye.

672
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,120
Gimme that marble! It's my dad's!
Give it! It's my dad's marble.

673
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:31,000
No. Rosa?

674
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,120
No, Rosa...

675
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,800
No, no, don't hang up.

676
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,200
- Do you speak Spanish?
- What do you need?

677
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,520
OK, great. Her name is Rosa Lopez.
Her boss is Elaine Lieberman.

678
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,880
I need to know where she is.
I'm Jack Taylor. I'm a reporter.

679
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,680
Elaine's her boss.

680
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,720
Say Elaine wants to speak to me very badly.

681
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,720
Jack Taylor.

682
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,360
- So?
- So give it!

683
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,080
- Give it!
- No.

684
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,080
Hey, guys. Guys! What are you doin'?

685
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,320
- Guys, what are you doin'?
- Mr Kelly? Mr Kelly.

686
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,920
Senora Lopez said Mrs Lieberman is at the
Elizabeth Arden salon for her Spring Spa Day.

687
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,360
- Excellent.
- Dad!

688
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,560
What? You guys are being...

689
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,480
Oh, man.

690
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,840
- You're so stupid.
- Am not.

691
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,560
Are so. You ruined my dad's marble. He's not
gonna want it with your snot all over it.

692
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:36,040
Yes, I will. I'll just wash it off.

693
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,320
You'll be fine. The doctor's
just gonna pop it right out.

694
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,840
- How come you couldn't do it?
- It's a little nose, big marble.

695
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,600
But the doctor has this clamp thing that's
gonna come up and just yank it right out.

696
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,120
And you are gonna be fine. You just gotta
not worry about it and not think about it.

697
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,680
You gotta think about something else.
You gotta think about...

698
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,760
Hello, Sammy.

699
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,640
- Hello?
- Hi, sexy. I miss you.

700
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,240
Look, whoever you are,
this isn't Jack's phone anymore.

701
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,320
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

702
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,680
- No. Who are you?
- This is Celia.

703
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,560
I'm a friend of Jack's. And who's this?

704
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,440
- Absolutely nobody.
- Whatever.

705
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,805
Could you tell him Kristen called from the
Bahamas to let him know her number there?

706
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,240
And this is very important. Elaine Lieberman
will only be at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.

707
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:48,240
So if you could pass on those messages,
we'd both appreciate it.

708
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,760
Your mom will kill me if I don't have
you guys in the lobby by 3:15 on the dot.

709
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,400
- She won't kill you. She's not like that really.
- She isn't?

710
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,160
No. She just acts tough and mean
cos she'd rather be safe than sorry.

711
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,800
- What does that mean?
- She says it when men try to open her door.

712
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,120
Yeah?

713
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,120
Go, go, go, go, go!

714
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,200
- Hi,you guys!
- Hey!

715
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,240
Yourfriend... Celia called to tell you...

716
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,720
- Sammy?
- It's OK. It's only an escalator.

717
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,840
Kristen called you from the Bahamas.

718
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,920
And also, Elaine... Lieberman
will be at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.

719
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,640
- Great.
- Thank you so much for watching Sammy.

720
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,125
Really, you saved my life.

721
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,360
- Was he any trouble?
- No. Not at all.

722
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,800
Good.

723
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,445
So, everything worked out great.

724
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,000
I was sure you'd either show up
three hours late or not at all.

725
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,960
- I'm not like every other man you know.
- I realize that. I was kidding.

726
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,880
No, you weren't but...

727
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,640
I'm not like every other woman you know.

728
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,160
- Really?
- Yeah.

729
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,080
You probably think I'm a real control freak.
And I'm not, at all.

730
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,920
Well, I mean, I do like things
the way I like them, but who doesn't?

731
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,880
And, anyway, in my life I'm the only one who
ever does anything so... what does it matter?

732
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,720
Maybe you should let somebody
help you out every once in a while.

733
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,520
Definitely not. I've got
all these balls up in the air.

734
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,960
If somebody else caught one
for me, I'd drop them all.

735
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,520
- But you're not a control freak?
- No. I'm a single, working mother.

736
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,885
OK. I have more work to do than time to do it.

737
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,480
So before we get into yet another lengthy
and exhausting thing, I have a career to save.

738
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,880
- Do you have any instructions for me?
- No, no. I trust you completely.

739
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,920
I don't suppose you could
switch your thing from 5 to 4:30?

740
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,720
I just found out that
I have a new thing at 5:30.

741
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,400
- I can't switch.
- I'll switch mine. No problem.

742
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,960
- OK. I'll see you guys at the soccer game.
- Bye, Jack!

743
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,800
- Thanks again, Jack.
- You're welcome.

744
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,440
I realize it's difficult,
what with Celia, Kristen, Elaine...

745
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,440
I know your name, Mel.

746
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,525
So what'd you guys do with Jack?

747
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,400
Quit kicking me, Maggie.
I wasn't gonna say anything about...

748
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:56,240
About what?

749
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,880
It's a secret. We're not supposed to say.

750
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,080
Secret about what?

751
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,960
- About your dad?
- And you too, Mommy.

752
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,440
Me too?

753
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,840
Come on, you guys. Tell.

754
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,560
A secret about me and Jack.

755
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,720
Does it have anything to do with feelings?

756
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
- What do you mean?
- You know. Feelings.

757
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,720
Like being scared or hurt or...
or happy and excited.

758
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,720
- Those are all feelings.
- Definitely about feelings, then.

759
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,320
Yeah. Definitely.

760
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,720
Switch.

761
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,360
- Sorry, Mom.
- It's OK, honey.

762
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,720
- So what'd you get?
- Frozen hot chocolate.

763
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,040
- You like chocolate?
- I love chocolate.

764
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,040
Daddy told Dr Martin that he's got
deep, dark chocolate inside of him.

765
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,960
Really?

766
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:08,160
And that he'd like to meet a fish who
wasn't afraid of his dark-chocolate layer.

767
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,840
I think I'm beginning to guess the secret.

768
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,520
- Are you mad?
- Not really.

769
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,040
- He should have talked about it with me.
- He was afraid you'd hate him.

770
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,160
Of course I wouldn't hate him.

771
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,160
Honestly, that is so silly.

772
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,520
You don't understand. This is an emergency.

773
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,160
I don't interrupt Mrs Lieberman
during her bikini wax.

774
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:34,440
- Now listen.
- Don't bother with the cute face.

775
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,240
I have five sons. You make eyes at me
like that, I make you pot roast.

776
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,600
Excuse me. Hello, Mrs Kempner.
Let me get your robe.

777
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,960
- Goodbye, Mrs Lieberman.
- Next week.

778
00:56:49,995 --> 00:56:52,000
Down, please.

779
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,720
Is Mrs Lieberman here? No? OK.

780
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,200
- Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

781
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,080
Hey, is Mrs Elaine Lieberman
in here, by any chance?

782
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:17,400
It's OK. Sorry.

783
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,240
- Hi. I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman.
- She just left.

784
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,120
- Thank you.
- Jack! Is that you?

785
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,600
- Yeah.
- It's Rita.

786
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,680
Melanie's mother.

787
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,680
- Rita. Hey.
- Sorry.

788
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,640
- What a small world.
- I spent the afternoon with your grandson.

789
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,680
- He's cute, but a handful.
- I need to find Elaine Lieberman.

790
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,405
I wanna tell you one thing about Melanie.
Something you may suspect.

791
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,440
She can make you scream like you're having
a body wax. She's that frustrating.

792
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,960
Inside, Jack, she's mush.

793
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,840
- Mush?
- So you scream all you want.

794
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,680
- But just don't run away too soon.
- OK. All right. Bye.

795
00:57:55,715 --> 00:57:57,680
Bye-bye. You're adorable.

796
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,660
- Mrs Lieberman?
- Right there.

797
00:58:03,695 --> 00:58:06,200
Hey, Mrs Lieberman! Mrs Lieberman!

798
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,880
Mrs Lieberman! Jack Taylor! Daily News!

799
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,120
- Get in.
- All right!

800
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,920
I'm glad I finally found you.

801
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,280
- I have to ask you a difficult question.
- About my husband.

802
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,640
- Do you know about his business affairs?
- Are you referring to the illegal account?

803
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,120
- So you know about that?
- It's in his name.

804
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,920
- Yeah.
- I have the deposit slips.

805
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,125
- I don't suppose you'd...
- Go on the record?

806
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,000
- I know it's a lot to ask.
- Elaine Lieberman. E-L-A-I-N-E

807
00:58:39,035 --> 00:58:41,800
L- I-E-B-E-R-M-A-N.

808
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,680
- I only have one request.
- Anything at all.

809
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,760
- Fax him a copy in Barbados.
- All right.

810
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,920
- Hello.
- Hi, darling.

811
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,485
Mom. Thank God. I'm in big trouble.

812
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,280
I have to have drinks with clients at 5:30
or I'll be fired. I have absolutely no childcare.

813
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,680
When are you done at Elizabeth Arden's?
Sammy! Put that down! You'll break it.

814
00:59:05,715 --> 00:59:08,560
You only think about work.
What about your personal life?

815
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:14,880
Actually, Mom, today I thought a lot
about my personal life. Don't laugh. I did.

816
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,720
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

817
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,720
Kitty?

818
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,920
Kitty! Kitty?

819
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,160
What do you mean, don't be
my usual self with him?

820
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,480
My usual self can't be all that bad

821
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,120
since I'm pretty sure Jack told
the kids he has feelings for me.

822
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,200
- He wants to ask me out on a date.
- Divine.

823
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,445
Maggie? Sammy, where's Maggie?

824
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,960
Take that out of your nose.
What is the matter with you?

825
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,280
Excuse me. And the thing is, I'm...

826
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,160
I think I could have feelings for him too.

827
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,280
Or at least I think I might be able to,
which is... it's a big step up for me.

828
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,040
Mom, could you hold on?

829
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:57,360
Maggie?

830
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,640
Well, I had no idea from that floating head
on top of his column that he was so tall.

831
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,880
And he's got good color in his skin,
which you also couldn't tell from the photo.

832
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,080
He really is altogether yummy, Mel.

833
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,440
- How would you know?
- Because he was just here, darling.

834
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,840
This isn't some horrifyingly elaborate
matchmaking scheme, is it? Maggie!

835
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,720
- Of course not, darling.
- Maggie!

836
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,400
- Oh my God. I just lost his daughter!
- You lost his daughter?

837
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,360
Maggie!

838
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,080
Maggie! Oh my God.

839
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,880
Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl?

840
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,800
Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl?
She's about six years old.

841
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,200
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a little girl?

842
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,360
Excuse me! Have you seen
a little girl about six?

843
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,040
Maggie!

844
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,720
Have you seen a little girl about six?

845
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,640
Excuse me! Have you seen...

846
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,160
Maggie!

847
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,480
Maggie!

848
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,200
Maggie!

849
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,560
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

850
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,680
- Anything else you can tell us, Miss Parker?
- I don't think so. I just...

851
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,600
He's still not answering. I can't believe it.
One minute she was there...

852
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:45,640
- I understand but...
- You don't. I just met this guy this morning.

853
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,760
And I was horrible to him all day!

854
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,960
- Excuse me.
- You're shivering. Jimmy...

855
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,240
Why was I so horrible to him! I called him
immature and uncharming and irresponsible!

856
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,920
- I was my usual self, she said.
- I need to find my purse.

857
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,125
Excuse me, but I've lost a little girl!
I'm sorry.

858
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,000
She said "Don't be your usual self"
and I was my usual self!

859
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,520
And he took perfect care of my son while
I did my presentation, which went very well!

860
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,480
And then I lost his daughter!
How could I have done that?

861
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,400
- It probably wasn't your fault.
- I didn't even pay my bill from Serendipity!

862
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,680
Is that your mom?

863
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,680
Mrs Lieberman... Elaine...
You have saved my life.

864
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,640
Watch your head.

865
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,200
That was smart.

866
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,840
- Jack.
- Mike.

867
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,400
I love you, Lew.

868
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,440
I love this town. I love this job.
I love Elaine Lieberman.

869
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,840
- That's a lot of love for you, Jack.
- I gotta tell you. I met someone today.

870
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,960
- What are you talkin' about?
- I don't know how to describe her.

871
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,840
She's luminous. Her face is...

872
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,900
- You're talkin' about women.
- Yeah.

873
01:03:05,935 --> 01:03:08,200
Your ass is on the line. Are you nuts?

874
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,760
That is under control. I have
Elaine Lieberman on the record.

875
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,160
And she has proof of a campaign account.

876
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:19,640
She's an angry wife. Her husband just sends
her a sorry-gram and she's off the record!

877
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,880
- You have my word.
- Your word means nothing to management.

878
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,240
Make sure Elaine Lieberman
gets to that press conference.

879
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,600
Either she confronts the mayor
or I have to print a retraction.

880
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,720
Don't worry. Elaine's my girl.

881
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,840
I hope so, Jack.

882
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,400
Jack? I just had lunch with Frank Burroughs.

883
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,640
Very bright. Very funny. Very humble man.

884
01:03:39,675 --> 01:03:42,760
- You love me, Lew. You know you do.
- Yeah.

885
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,040
Come on, Lois. Come on. Go ahead. That's it.

886
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,080
Hey, Lew? Lew!

887
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,560
- Where's Jack?
- On the way to city hall.

888
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,760
But I have urgent messages for him.

889
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,240
I can't sit here like this.
I gotta go find Jack.

890
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,840
He's gonna be at city hall
in 15 minutes. Come on, honey.

891
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,480
Uh-huh. Five o'clock. That's great.

892
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,720
Hang on!

893
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,840
Elaine, excuse me one second.

894
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,760
City hall, please.

895
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,440
- Look, I can't thank you enough.
- Duane! Please. City hall.

896
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:27,800
I'll do my best to get there. I was on my way
to Staten Island so I might be a little late.

897
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,360
All right? Bye.

898
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,600
Duane! Hurry up.

899
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,160
- Hello.
- Mr Taylor? Lt Bonomo, 18th Precinct.

900
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,240
We found your daughter.

901
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,080
What?

902
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,720
- Excuse me. Have you seen Jack Taylor?
- No, I haven't.

903
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,820
Excuse me. You don't happen
to know Jack Taylor, do you?

904
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:06,760
- Very well, in fact.
- You're... Celia, aren't you?

905
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:10,680
Yes. And you must be the one
who lost his little girl.

906
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,680
- Hello! Maggie!
- Daddy!

907
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,200
- Hey! Hi.
- Hello.

908
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,840
Hey, I'm Jack Taylor. That's mine.
Thank you very much for watching her.

909
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,360
- It was my pleasure.
- I'm sure it was.

910
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,320
- Come on.
- I wanna play with the kitties.

911
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,880
I gotta go to a press conference. Hi, kitties.
Come on. Tag - you're it! Chase me. Let's go.

912
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,440
- No. I wanna play with the kitties.
- Come on. Red light, green light.

913
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:38,800
- Stop it!
- Let's go. Maggie, don't do this right now.

914
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,760
Don't you understand? If I don't get there...

915
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,880
- No, Daddy, no! Stop it!
- Do you want me to lose my job?

916
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,400
- You really love those kittens, right?
- Yeah.

917
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,400
OK. Come on. Come here.
Watch your head. There.

918
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,000
OK.

919
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,040
What are their names?

920
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,920
This one's Bob cos he looks like a bobcat.

921
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,320
And that one's Fred, and that one's...

922
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,320
I forget this one's name.

923
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,840
OK. Listen, Maggie. I know that
this has been a rotten day for you,

924
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,120
and I know all you wanna do
is play with these kittens.

925
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,680
I don't blame you cos they're great.

926
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,560
But if I don't get to this press conference, I'll
lose my job. And I don't wanna lose my job.

927
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,480
So we gotta work somethin' out.
We gotta make some kind of a deal here.

928
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,600
So... what if we talk
to this beautiful young lady

929
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,720
and we ask her if maybe Bob can come
to the press conference with us?

930
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,320
You mean keep him?

931
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,400
- Borrow him.
- But I wanna keep him.

932
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,080
- You'll have to ask your mother about that.
- She's allergic.

933
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,560
Oh, that's right. She gets all...

934
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,805
All right. You know what?

935
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,880
Bob can just stay at my house.

936
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,440
Where would he sleep?

937
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,960
You know that room with all the boxes in it?
We could clear it out. He could sleep there.

938
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

939
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,760
Of course you're gonna have to come over
and visit every once in a while to check up.

940
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,120
Make sure I'm feedin' him and everything.

941
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:32,640
- I will.
- Yeah?

942
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,680
Come here.

943
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,120
You know, maybe what we oughta do

944
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,760
is put a bed in that room for you too.

945
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,800
Yeah.

946
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,480
- Cos he might get lonely.
- Yeah.

947
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,040
But he's not gonna get lonely with you there.

948
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,200
Let me take a look at this guy.

949
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,440
So this is gonna be our cat, huh?

950
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,520
- Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

951
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,120
Now can we get outta here already?

952
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,000
Mr Mayor! Mr Mayor!

953
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,080
Mr Burroughs?

954
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,960
Do you plan to sue
Jack Taylor and the Daily News

955
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,480
for the apparently false, unsubstantiated
charges they've made against you?

956
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,800
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

957
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,160
- Hey, Dad. That guy's on the bus too.
- Hurry, please.

958
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,760
- His picture's bigger than yours.
- You speak English?

959
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,840
Last question, please.

960
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,320
Excuse me! Excuse me.

961
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,920
Last question, please.

962
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,680
- Mom, you're not a reporter.
- I gotta do something.

963
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,680
- Mr Mayor!
- Mr Mayor!

964
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,800
- What are you gonna say?
- I don't know.

965
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,080
- Mr Mayor!
- Yes?

966
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,560
- You, on the right.
- I...

967
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,520
- What about Elaine...
- Lieberman.

968
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,605
- Lieberman!
- What about her?

969
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,160
She's my sanitation commissioner's wife.
She has nothing to do with this.

970
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,760
What paper are you with, young lady?

971
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,960
I believe Mrs Lieberman has spoken to Jack
Taylor and can back up everything he said.

972
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,760
Jack Taylor is a reckless man
with a gift for manipulating the truth.

973
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,880
I... I know Jack Taylor, sir,

974
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,400
and... and... and... and he is
pretty cocky most of the time

975
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:35,080
and he does seem to have somewhat of
a cavalier attitude, but at least he's honest.

976
01:09:35,115 --> 01:09:38,560
I don't know what relationship
you have with Mr Taylor,

977
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,480
but you clearly know nothing
about politics or journalism.

978
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,440
That's it. No more questions. Thank you.

979
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,765
Melanie!

980
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,400
Look, Melanie. I got a kitty!
His name's Bob and Dad said I can keep him!

981
01:09:56,435 --> 01:09:59,280
- Mr Mayor?
- Jack, Elaine Lieberman didn't show up.

982
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,320
- I know that. Mr Mayor!
- No, no, no, Mr Taylor.

983
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,360
The press conference is over.

984
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,800
Mr Mayor, you may be able
to strong-arm Manny Feldstein

985
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,800
and to buffalo my paper into printing
a retraction, and they may actually fire me.

986
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,920
- But we both know this garbage thing stinks.
- Pitiful, Mr Taylor.

987
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,840
You and your little friend in the outfit.
Just pitiful!

988
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,200
What is pitiful, Mr Mayor, is that
if I had a few minutes more,

989
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,880
Elaine Lieberman would be here
with a canceled check for $250,000,

990
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,200
from a very well-known Mob front,

991
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,680
made out to your reelection campaign.

992
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,480
That's a blatant fabrication! We both know
that no such canceled check exists!

993
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,240
You know, you're right. I'm confused.
There would be no check.

994
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,680
But there would be a deposit slip.
Wouldn't there, Elaine?

995
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,840
- Come here. Hi. Can I have that, please?
- Hello, Sidney.

996
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:55,560
All right. This is dated March 15 of this year.
It is a deposit slip for $250,000.

997
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:01,680
That same day a deposit was made
into your campaign account for $250,000.

998
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:04,560
But I guess that was just a coincidence.

999
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,640
The press conference is over! I said over!

1000
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,640
How'd you discover the account?

1001
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,120
- Elaine, what can I say?
- Jack, it was my pleasure.

1002
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,280
- Can I see that document?
- In the paper tomorrow, Frank.

1003
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,680
You guys wanna go
to the soccer game? Come on.

1004
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,880
- All right. My public. Who first?
- Does your husband know you've done this?

1005
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,440
My husband. Funny you bring that up.
He's in Barbados. B-A-R-B-A-D...

1006
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,040
That was an excellent moment in my life.

1007
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,560
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1008
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,240
- Can we go to the soccer game now?
- Yes, sweetheart.

1009
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,760
- Yeah, boy. Come here.
- I really am so sorry about Maggie.

1010
01:11:36,795 --> 01:11:40,160
- I don't wanna think what could've happened.
- Me neither.

1011
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:45,440
I can't believe I was issued shellfish
and dander warnings. Sandbox alerts.

1012
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,320
You laughed in my face
when I came to your office on time.

1013
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,800
- I know.
- And then you lost my daughter.

1014
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,080
It was the worst thing I could've done.

1015
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,760
- I really am so sorry.
- So someone else is the irresponsible one.

1016
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,560
- Yes, they are.
- I'd like to hear you say that for your kind.

1017
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,805
- My kind?
- The ones with all the balls in the air.

1018
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,000
- It's the least you could do.
- Of course I'll say it, Jack.

1019
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,925
I was the irresponsible one. Taxi!

1020
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,960
- Now say "I can't do everything on my own."
- Why?

1021
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,800
Because with one sentence
you can restore my faith in women again.

1022
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,480
- Of course I'll say it for you, Jack.
- OK.

1023
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,640
- We'll never get a cab.
- You can't say it.

1024
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,480
- Sure I can, but it won't be true.
- I'm waitin'.

1025
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,840
- OK. I can't do everything alone.
- There. Great.

1026
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,480
Even though my daily activities
year after year contradict that.

1027
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,400
Unbelievable!

1028
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,360
- You made me grovel for no reason.
- For a great reason.

1029
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,760
You are an arrogant ball-juggler, baby.

1030
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,560
First of all, don't call me "baby."

1031
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,920
If you don't want your balls juggled,
don't throw them in my face.

1032
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,320
- I never threw them in your face.
- You thrust your stupid column at me

1033
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,280
as a lame excuse for my son
missing his field trip.

1034
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,880
Balls in my face.

1035
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,720
Big Jack Reporter can't possibly
concentrate on mundane details like

1036
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,080
phoning to say "Thanks, but I won't need
you to take my daughter to school today."

1037
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,480
And then you have to ask who I assume
is one of your many girlfriends

1038
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,080
if she's wearing her panties,
as loud as you can! Balls in my face!

1039
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,400
And now, in the midst of
my obvious remorse, you make me grovel?

1040
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,400
First of all, I thrust my column in your face

1041
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:28,720
because I thought you were the most
beautiful woman that I have ever seen, and I...

1042
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,480
I wanted to make a good impression.

1043
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,480
I forgot to call you this morning
because I, as opposed to you,

1044
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,405
am not used to doing everything on my own.

1045
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:50,760
As for the panties, that remark was directed
to my editor Lew simply to piss you off.

1046
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,720
Come on, Dad. I've got a taxi. Can we go?

1047
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,360
Hey. Look who got the cab.

1048
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,520
- I think my dad likes your mom.
- Maybe my mom likes him back.

1049
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,885
Men like you have made me the woman I am.

1050
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,640
All the women I know like you
make me think all women are like you.

1051
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,760
Oh my God. I almost forgot.
I've got a meeting. Drinks with clients.

1052
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,240
It's 5:25. You're never gonna make it.

1053
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,840
Mom! It's the last game of the season.
It's for the championships, Mom.

1054
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,480
The coach said every kid has to play
or they don't get a trophy.

1055
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,440
Even the losers get one.
But you don't get a trophy if you don't play.

1056
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,760
- I know, but it's on the way. We'll make it.
- Let go of it.

1057
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,040
I can't let go of it. It's my job.

1058
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,160
Hold this.

1059
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:49,560
Could we go to the 21 Club instead?
21 West 52nd Street.

1060
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:53,680
And don't try to take 14th
or 32nd or 44th across.

1061
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,560
You can't make a left at this hour.

1062
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,600
I know I can do this.

1063
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,880
- No, don't take Broadway. Try Sixth Avenue.
- Great green gobs of...

1064
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,520
- Greasy, grimy gopher guts
- But after 23rd because of the construction.

1065
01:15:09,555 --> 01:15:12,560
- French-fried eyeballs floatin' in a bowl of...
- Snot

1066
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,680
Snot.

1067
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,800
Here we go.

1068
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,360
Why don't you hold the cab? If I'm not back
in 15 minutes, go on ahead without me.

1069
01:15:52,395 --> 01:15:55,440
- You'll take longer than 15 minutes.
- I can do this.

1070
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,640
OK, baby.

1071
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,800
Mommy, what if you don't come
and Daddy doesn't come?

1072
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:05,600
Oh, sweetheart, I'm going to be there. You are
the most important thing to me in the world.

1073
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,240
- Your job is.
- No. You are.

1074
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,120
But I have to do this now.

1075
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:16,720
Sammy, I know I've dragged you places and
left you and I've been a crazy person today.

1076
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:21,720
But it's going to be better tomorrow. And
I promise I won't take longer than 15 minutes.

1077
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
OK? Huh?

1078
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,680
Hey, Sammy, come here.

1079
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,080
Don't worry. She'll make it.
Let's get ready for soccer. Grab me that bag.

1080
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,520
- Hello. How are you?
- I see my party.

1081
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,720
I'm glad you could make it.
What's your poison?

1082
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,280
- I'll just have some water.
- Nonsense.

1083
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,400
You have some catching up to do.

1084
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,200
She'll have a dry vodka martini, straight up.

1085
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,120
Hey. What are you thinkin' about, kiddo?

1086
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,440
I hope my daddy can come
to our soccer game.

1087
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,560
Yeah.

1088
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,600
Mommy hopes he can come too.

1089
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,520
Last night...

1090
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,605
Last night my mom thought I was asleep
but I really wasn't.

1091
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,200
And I heard her say over and over: "Please
let Eddie come. Please let Eddie come."

1092
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,560
- Eddie? Who's Eddie?
- Eddie's my dad.

1093
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,320
I hope he comes too, kiddo.

1094
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,080
We were just discussing plans for
an upscale amusement complex for adults.

1095
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,520
- You know. With food and games and rides.
- No rides, Dad.

1096
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,280
After drinks, we wanted
to take a drive to Stamford.

1097
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,440
We were hoping to take a look at
a bad version of what we have in mind.

1098
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:54,160
Before we head out, Melanie, maybe you'd
toss out a few ideas off the top of your head.

1099
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,880
Well...

1100
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,480
Adult amusement complexes, up until now,
have been somewhat cheesy.

1101
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,040
Usually attached to
popular video stores and...

1102
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,000
What I'm thinking of is
something a bit more exciting.

1103
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,440
A drawing might help. Don't you think?

1104
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,840
- I...
- I love drawings.

1105
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,520
I don't have a...

1106
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,200
OK.

1107
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,560
Let's see. Something like...

1108
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,400
Isn't that the little lost boy
from this morning?

1109
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,280
With... You know...

1110
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,240
You know... I can't do this now.

1111
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,840
And I can't go with you
to Stamford now either.

1112
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:22,040
Yes, Mr Leland, that is the little lost boy from
this morning. Only he's not lost. He's my son.

1113
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:26,240
I have a child and he has
a soccer game in 20 minutes.

1114
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,240
If he's late, he won't get the trophy. And since
I'm in here with you, he'll probably be late.

1115
01:19:31,275 --> 01:19:34,120
But what gets to me the most is,
instead of crying about it,

1116
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:38,920
he's out there with a big old smile
blowing fish faces at us.

1117
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:46,400
Gentlemen, if you're smart, you will want me
as much for my dedication and ability

1118
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,800
as for the fact that I am going to ditch you
right now and run like hell across town

1119
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,845
so that my kid knows that
what matters to me most is him.

1120
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:59,720
And, Mr Leland, your real grounds for firing
me should be if I were to stay here with you.

1121
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,960
- I like her.
- A lot.

1122
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:14,280
Well, I probably lost my job! But at least
we still have ten minutes to get to the game!

1123
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,920
Hey, shortcut!

1124
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,200
In spite of everything, Jack, I do
sincerely apologize for losing Maggie.

1125
01:20:21,235 --> 01:20:23,645
That's OK. It happened to me this morning.

1126
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,720
- You lost Maggie this morning?
- Yeah. She wandered off after the office cat.

1127
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,360
It might have been helpful if you had
mentioned her tendency to wander.

1128
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,520
Yeah, well, it might have been helpful...
Here we go. Up here!

1129
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,720
.. if you had mentioned Sammy's tendency
to stick things up his nose!

1130
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,200
- He didn't!
- Oh, yeah! Way up there!

1131
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,520
The doctor had to use this plier-type thing.

1132
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:49,400
It's called an alligator.
A tool I have come to know well.

1133
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,080
- OK!
- Hey, get up. Here we go.

1134
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,240
See? I told you we'd make it.

1135
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,640
- Any other catastrophes?
- Lois Lane ate the class fish.

1136
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,840
Why does that not surprise me?

1137
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,440
- Sorry, Sammy.
- Lois Lane?

1138
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,600
Come on! We gotta hurry up!

1139
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,520
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1140
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,000
- I'll take you.
- Why don't I take her?

1141
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,560
So, Maggie, you know that lady,
Celia, from your dad's office?

1142
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,160
Yeah.

1143
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,000
- Is she your daddy's girlfriend?
- No way.

1144
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,280
She wants to be, but she isn't.

1145
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,560
He wants somebody who would love
his cookie too, and Celia's not the type.

1146
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,200
Let me get that other sock for you.

1147
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,800
There's no king when love is the thing

1148
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,800
Play the same rules

1149
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:07,360
In a heartbeat, a wise man can be a fool

1150
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,800
Through the darkest hours

1151
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,160
When all is said and done

1152
01:22:17,195 --> 01:22:22,120
It has the power

1153
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,600
You go from lonely to the lucky one

1154
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,840
Cos love's funny that way

1155
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,680
No matter who you are

1156
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,320
Oh, it can shake your faith

1157
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,920
Or it can break your heart

1158
01:22:40,955 --> 01:22:42,677
Yeah, yeah

1159
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:44,400
There we go.

1160
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,560
Give me that.

1161
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,680
That's my cat.

1162
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,600
So maybe you and Maggie could
come over for dinner after the game.

1163
01:22:57,635 --> 01:23:00,200
Order out a little Chinese or something.

1164
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,600
- Oh, thank God he's here.
- Dad!

1165
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,840
- So what do you say?
- I don't think so. It's been a long day.

1166
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,760
OK. Yeah, I'm a little... a little tired myself.

1167
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:27,160
- I should go over and say hi to Sammy's dad.
- I like to watch the game on the sidelines.

1168
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,040
OK.

1169
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,920
- It was a good day.
- Yeah.

1170
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,400
OK.

1171
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,320
All right. Come here.

1172
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,040
What? You can't even look at me?

1173
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:56,880
This is the second game
you've made it to in two years, Eddie.

1174
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,080
- Look, I'm here, aren't I?
- Daddy!

1175
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,360
Are you staying for the whole game?

1176
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,805
- You bet I am.
- Cool!

1177
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:08,120
I'm gonna play my best.
You watch me. My really best.

1178
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,600
That's great.

1179
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,080
Go get 'em, tiger.

1180
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,360
Come on. I saved us a seat.

1181
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,080
Here, Daddy.

1182
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,480
Hey, Dad!

1183
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,085
Part of the reason I came
was to tell Sammy in person

1184
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,440
that I'm not gonna be able
to make our fishing trip this summer.

1185
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,760
- You can't do this to him, Eddie.
- I got a gig playing with Bruce, Mel.

1186
01:24:48,795 --> 01:24:51,805
Can't you see how much he needs you?

1187
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,720
Come on, Mel. You can't
expect me to pass this up.

1188
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,000
Mom! Hey, Mom! Look!

1189
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,360
Yes!

1190
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,120
Let's go, Maggie! Come on! Maggie, let's go!

1191
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,520
Down the alley! Right down the alley!

1192
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,725
Watch that kid! Bodycheck him, Maggie!

1193
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,400
- But that would be rude, Daddy.
- That's not rude! That's sports!

1194
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,520
That's it!

1195
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,880
Hey! Hey! Come on!

1196
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,560
- What's with that guy?
- Get that kid!

1197
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,560
- Good game there, Sammy.
- Thanks, Jack.

1198
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,440
- I'll see ya.
- Thanks for everything.

1199
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,720
You too. I'll see you.

1200
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,560
OK. Are you ready?

1201
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,680
OK. Hang on.

1202
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,680
You were great.

1203
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,680
So I'll see you real soon, OK, big guy?

1204
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,600
OK.

1205
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,000
- Bye, Mel.
- Bye.

1206
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,960
- Hey. Let's get your rain stuff on. OK?
- OK.

1207
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,040
Let me see your trophy.

1208
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,800
- Wow! Do you think that's real gold?
- Yeah.

1209
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,960
- You do? What is that on his head?
- A soccer ball.

1210
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,760
OK. Are you ready?

1211
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,400
- Should we try to get a cab, Mom?
- No. I kind of feel like walking.

1212
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,760
- In the rain?
- So? You're dressed for Niagara Falls.

1213
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:12,640
Have I told you lately that I love you?

1214
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,320
Have I told you there's no one above you?

1215
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,120
Fill my heart with gladness

1216
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,200
Take away my sadness

1217
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,440
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

1218
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,120
For the mornin ' sun in all its glory

1219
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:44,000
Greets the day with hope and comfort too

1220
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,920
And you fill my life with laughter...

1221
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,160
Mom, I'm hungry.

1222
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,160
I'll be right there, honey.

1223
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,800
All right. That's a deal.

1224
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,800
Give me this one. Come here. Good night.

1225
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,160
- Good night.
- He'll be right here in the box, OK?

1226
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,880
- OK.
- All right.

1227
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,840
You know, when me and Melanie
were in the bathroom,

1228
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,660
she asked me if Celia was your girlfriend.

1229
01:28:13,695 --> 01:28:16,400
- She did?
- Yeah. She really likes you.

1230
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,560
- Good night.
- Good night.

1231
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,360
She told you she likes me?

1232
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,560
It's so obvious, Daddy.

1233
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,680
Night.

1234
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,840
Did she say anything else about me?

1235
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,560
I don't know, Daddy. I'm pretty tired.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

1236
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,880
Yeah.

1237
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,160
- What'll you do about those fish?
- What?

1238
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,800
We gotta go buy new fish.

1239
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,640
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

1240
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,960
Sammy can't go back to class tomorrow
without those fish. Mrs Fineman'll kill him.

1241
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,120
- I'm in my pajamas!
- I know, but we gotta help him out.

1242
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,600
Like the sun

1243
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,320
At the end of the day

1244
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,360
We will give thanks and pray

1245
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,640
To the one

1246
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:21,120
Have I told you lately that I love you?

1247
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:27,360
Have I told you there's no one above you?

1248
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,160
Fill my heart with gladness

1249
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,440
Take away my sadness

1250
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,880
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

1251
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,840
Take away my sadness

1252
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,760
Fill my life with gladness

1253
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,200
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

1254
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

1255
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,160
Maggie insisted that
we bring Sammy some new fish.

1256
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,400
Thank you.

1257
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:18,680
- Do you guys wanna come in for a minute?
- No, no. We don't wanna intrude.

1258
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,760
OK. Well...

1259
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,840
Yes. Here they are.

1260
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,680
- OK.
- OK. Thank you.

1261
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,800
Come on, Dad.

1262
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,880
- Come in. Please.
- OK. For a few minutes.

1263
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,240
Hi, Jack!

1264
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,560
Sammy!

1265
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,920
What do you weigh?

1266
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,320
- Wanna come see my room?
- OK.

1267
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:56,760
- You're investigating my apartment.
- Not as neat as I would've thought.

1268
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,000
It's only neat on Sundays
when my mother comes for brunch.

1269
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,880
If she sees it like this, she shakes her head,

1270
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,360
which means she's unhappy
with my life choices.

1271
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:11,600
And then she lets out a sigh that means she'd
have rather gone to my sister's for brunch.

1272
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,640
- You guys wanna watch a video?
- Yeah!

1273
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,320
- How about The Wizard of Oz?
- Yeah!

1274
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,560
You can get all snuggled up on my bed
and watch for a little while.

1275
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,200
- I wanna watch it all, Mommy.
- It's too late.

1276
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,840
You can watch for as long as it takes us
to drink one cup of coffee.

1277
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:39,800
- Two cups of coffee.
- We'll see.

1278
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,720
It's always such a dilemma
when you have kids.

1279
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:54,120
After Sammy's dad and I got divorced, I put
up pictures of him all over Sammy's room.

1280
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:59,080
I wanted to reassure him that, no matter what,
his dad would still be in his life.

1281
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,360
- You want cream, or...?
- No, that's fine.

1282
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,560
- Sammy talked about him all day today.
- I'm sure he did.

1283
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:11,160
- Is he really a rock'n'roll drummer?
- He's touring with Springsteen this summer.

1284
01:32:11,195 --> 01:32:12,520
- Really?
- Yeah.

1285
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,480
Springsteen? Wow.

1286
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:23,720
You know... I'm beatin' around the bush
here and there's something I gotta ask you.

1287
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,525
Yes?

1288
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:31,120
Why did you spend all day flirting with me if
you meant to get back with your ex-husband?

1289
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,760
What?

1290
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,840
I spent the whole day disliking you intensely.

1291
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,760
You were flirting with me. You even
told the kids you wanted to ask me out.

1292
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,400
- I never told them that.
- Yes, you did. That was your big secret.

1293
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:48,000
They told me. It was all about you and me
and going somewhere and feelings.

1294
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,200
You were going to ask me out.

1295
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,560
The big secret was that Sammy
got my marble stuck up his nose.

1296
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,440
And I never once even thought
about asking you out.

1297
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,720
- I'm so sure.
- I don't know why I would even want to.

1298
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,400
You said I was the most beautiful woman
you'd ever seen.

1299
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:06,400
- That was a line.
- That was not a line, Jack, and you know it.

1300
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,760
You wanted me ever since
I knew you were a writer...

1301
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:15,160
You wanted me ever since the drop-in center
when you saw me put my watch on Maggie.

1302
01:33:15,195 --> 01:33:18,120
For someone so disinterested
in the other person,

1303
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:22,040
- you sure do remember every detail.
- You remember better than I do.

1304
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,480
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

1305
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,080
- What would you do if I kissed you?
- You wouldn't.

1306
01:33:26,115 --> 01:33:28,080
What would you do if I did?

1307
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:33,080
- Do you wanna kiss me?
- I wouldn't have mentioned it if I didn't.

1308
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,600
Fine.

1309
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,400
You're just... reelin' me in, aren't you?

1310
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,160
You're like Roy Scheider at the end of Jaws.

1311
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,120
The minute I open my mouth,
you're gonna drop a big bomb in there.

1312
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,600
Then you'll wear my teeth around your neck.

1313
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,360
So you're admitting you're a big shark?

1314
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,600
I am admitting that I am...

1315
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,720
scared of getting close to anyone again.

1316
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,080
I'm just as scared as you are.

1317
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,680
- Don't bite.
- I won't.

1318
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,360
- Mommy.
- What?

1319
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:50,080
Can you fast-forward for us?
That mean lady is on and we hate that part.

1320
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,480
Sweetheart, you know how to fast-forward.

1321
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,040
- The remote's broken.
- And she's stealing Toto.

1322
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:58,440
There. She's gone. OK?

1323
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,080
This is the colored part. You love this part.

1324
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,800
- Wait.
- Yeah. OK.

1325
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,920
No, let's do this right.

1326
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:34,120
Let me go in and freshen up so I feel
more like a woman and not a dead mommy.

1327
01:35:34,155 --> 01:35:36,120
- OK.
- OK?

1328
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,680
Why don't you go in and
go sit over there and...

1329
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:44,840
close your eyes, lay your head back
and anticipate my return.

1330
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,040
OK.

1331
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,760
Or you can go in and watch The Wizard of Oz

1332
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,840
and wait for me to come back.

1333
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,720
Yeah, OK.

1334
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,800
It's stopped raining.

1335
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,300
Jack?

1336
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,300
I wonder what they're doing.

1337
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,052
