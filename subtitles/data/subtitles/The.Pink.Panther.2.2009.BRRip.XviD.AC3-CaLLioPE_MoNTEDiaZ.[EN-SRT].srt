1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,440
I now bring to your attention

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,920
one of the most stunning treasures
in the British Library's entire collection.

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,560
The Magna Carta.

4
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,640
And now, over here,

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,840
perhaps the most cherished
ancient artifact in the Western world.

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,280
The Shroud of Turin.

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,760
The Imperial Sword!

8
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,840
Chief Inspector Dreyfus is here to see you.

9
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
- Chief Inspector.
- Sir.

10
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,560
I'm sure you know why you're here.

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,960
The British, the Italians and the Japanese
are assembling an elite squad

12
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
of their finest detectives,

13
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,920
an international Dream Team
to track down this Tornado.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,320
- And France will be represented?
- Exactly.

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,120
I am honored, but not surprised.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,280
This is the culmination of my career.

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,720
The moment
that I've been waiting for all my life.

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,920
- No, no, no.
- Well, not all my life, perhaps...

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
- No, no.
- No. Nevertheless...

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
They want Clouseau, since he is
considered the top detective in the world.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,120
We have been asked if Clouseau
is available to lead the Dream Team.

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,560
- Clouseau?
- Yes, yes.

23
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,720
- Is there something wrong?
- No, no, not at all.

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,680
Would you mind if I use your bathroom
just for a moment?

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,520
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,640
Clouseau.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm afraid, sir,
that Clouseau is currently occupied.

28
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,800
- What?
- I've assigned him to a mission

29
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,080
so important for our country

30
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,280
that I fear for our national security
if he was taken off it.

31
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,200
Clearly a violation.

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,360
Parking ticket.

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,800
What is this for?

34
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,120
Thirty-one centimeters from the curb,
nine centimeters too far.

35
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,920
Nine centimeters into
the seamy black underbelly of crime.

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,800
- You must take the ticket. Take it.
- Never!

37
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,360
You must take the ticket.

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,440
You're not wearing your seatbelt.

39
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,360
You are going to have to go
to traffic school.

40
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,320
Pardon me.

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
- Stop this car immediately.
- Okay.

42
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,560
Right.

43
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,040
- Are you finished yet?
- Complete and operational.

44
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,480
Chief Inspector,
your new system will monitor and record

45
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,920
every word and every movement
in this room.

46
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,960
So, if anyone breaks in, what happens?

47
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,480
Your office is linked to the elite
Black Berets. They will be here in seconds.

48
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,360
Sir, Inspector clouseau is here to see you.

49
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,920
Send him in.

50
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,240
- Clouseau?
- I have to appoint him to the Dream Team.

51
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,040
- Clouseau?
- Don't ask, don't...

52
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,520
Good afternoon, Chief Inspector.
I'm here with my report.

53
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,160
This darn Medal of Honor.

54
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,760
You're so fortunate
you never got one, Chief Inspector.

55
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,600
You look so tidy having no honors
or other forms of distinguishing decor.

56
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,240
Why don't you wear it under your shirt,
you know, out of sight?

57
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,200
Brilliant idea, Chief Inspector.
That way it won't clang around.

58
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,240
Now, the parking ticket situation.

59
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,040
Over the last six weeks,
I've given out almost four parking tickets.

60
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,000
One at the Musee, overtime.

61
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
And one, you'll recall, to you,
in violation of the bent-license-plate law.

62
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,600
- Yes, I recall.
- It's all there in the report.

63
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Fascinating.
Well, I shall waste no time in reading it.

64
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,760
And just in case, I've deftly cataloged,
numbered and cross-referenced

65
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,560
each offense here in my little black book.

66
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,040
Now, Clouseau, you remember when I first
put you on that parking ticket detail...

67
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,920
Yes, you explained
it was a top level assignment.

68
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,440
And that if anyone ever asked you
if I was the one who had assigned you

69
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,080
to this incredibly important mission,
you would deny it.

70
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,520
Chief Inspector, I don't even know
what you are talking about.

71
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,080
Good work, Clouseau.

72
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,480
Now, to business.
I have been instructed to reassign you...

73
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Clouseau?

74
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,520
Clouseau.

75
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,120
We were being recorded.

76
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,800
- The Black Berets.
- The password. What is the password?

77
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,040
- I don't know.
- Four, three...

78
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,440
- We weren't yet told.
- ... two, one.

79
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,080
Hamburger.

80
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,400
Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

81
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,200
- The password was "hamburger"?
- No, "hamburger. "

82
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,560
- I said "hamburger".
- No, you said "hamburger. "

83
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
- Hamburger?
- Hamburger.

84
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,320
How did you know
that we were being recorded?

85
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,000
Easy, Inspector.

86
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,960
This pen emits a small beeping noise
whenever it detects microwaves.

87
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,520
- RadioShack. $12.
- What?

88
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,520
- How did you know the password?
- This little LED chip decodes passwords.

89
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,920
I had it attached to the back
of my Medal of Honor.

90
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,840
- RadioShack?
- eBay. I got this there, too.

91
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,960
- What do you think this is?
- A tape recorder?

92
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,360
No. It only looks like a tape-recorder.
It's actually a pen.

93
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,160
So you can write with it
and no one will know.

94
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,640
Bingo!

95
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,040
Now, you were saying, Inspector.

96
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
- You are being reassigned.
- Let me read your mind.

97
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,000
The Tornado is at large, and you want me
to protect the Pink Panther.

98
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
- No.
- No?

99
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,200
It is my job to protect the Pink Panther.

100
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
You've merely been reassigned
to the Dream Team.

101
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,080
That is quite an honor,

102
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,560
- but I cannot accept.
- What?

103
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,440
If Inspector Clouseau
were to leave France,

104
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,680
the Tornado would surely strike
at the Pink Panther.

105
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,720
- I'm guarding it!
- But...

106
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,360
Don't argue.
You fly to Kyoto in the morning.

107
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,960
But I can't fly.

108
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,000
In a plane!

109
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,200
- But still...
- That's an order.

110
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,840
Nicole.

111
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,200
You are traveling?

112
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,600
Yes, Inspector Dreyfus is sending me
on a very dangerous mission.

113
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,760
- For how long? When will you return?
- I will return when the criminal is caught.

114
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,640
It could be a month, it could be a year.
You understand, Nicole.

115
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,840
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Of course, we will have to stay apart.

116
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,000
If the criminal were to, say, kidnap you,
he would have power over me.

117
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,200
Why would he have power over you?

118
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,400
Well, because, well,

119
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,800
you are like a brother to me.

120
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,680
A hot, sexy brother in a dress.

121
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,760
Nicole, I hope you have forgiven me
for that one evening.

122
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,240
Yes, Inspector, it is forgotten.

123
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,960
- I have not forgotten.
- Neither have I.

124
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,840
So, even though, technically,
we are on duty,

125
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
do you think it would be all right
to share a bottle of wine?

126
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I think it would be all right.

127
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,160
Then I will select the wine.
It is one of my specialties.

128
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,880
I would like to select my own wine.

129
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,280
And by the way,
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

130
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,080
Remember this face.

131
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
- This is a very special bottle.
- Delicious.

132
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,840
There was soMething about
burning down a restaurant

133
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,600
that ignited other, More illicit, fires.

134
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,960
- And I'm sorry about that.
- As am I. Terribly remorseful.

135
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,360
It was a night to remember
that we must forget.

136
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,600
We must never forget to not remember it.

137
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,080
And if we do remember it,
we must immediately forget it.

138
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,120
Now, let's have
a professional hug goodbye.

139
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,080
I'll be right there.
I'll see you in several months.

140
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,240
- No problem.
- And I do hope your hearing improves.

141
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,320
Ponton,
I'm worried about my leaving France.

142
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,840
The Tornado is rampant.
The Pink Panther is such a temptation,

143
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,200
and no Clouseau to protect it.

144
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,880
But you visited the museum yourself,
you checked the security.

145
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,360
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yes, I suppose you're right.

146
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,720
- Are you driving?
- I like to stay in practice.

147
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,240
- Okay.
- Remind me where the brakes are.

148
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,840
- Here. Yes.
- There?

149
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,680
- Yes.
- And then you turn here.

150
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,800
- Of course, yes.
- All right.

151
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
- And this turns it.
- Yeah.

152
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,520
Okay, here we go.

153
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,600
- Ponton.
- Yes?

154
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,440
- This case is very strange.
- How so, Inspector?

155
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,920
For 10 years,
the Tornado terrorized Europe,

156
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,360
stealing over a quarter of a billion dollars
worth of artifacts.

157
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Then, for no reason, he suddenly stops.

158
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,120
Maybe the Tornado thought
he had enough money.

159
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,760
If he had enough money, then why,
after 10 years of complete inactivity,

160
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,200
does he suddenly spring back into action?

161
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,480
London, the Magna Carta.
Italy, the sacred Shroud.

162
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,360
The Imperial Sword. Why now?
Why all of a sudden? Why? Why?

163
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,960
You need to calm down.

164
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,680
Hey!

165
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,160
What's the matter, Ponton?
You seem a little depressed today.

166
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,560
- Is it your wife again?
- Yes.

167
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,200
She still feels my job
takes up too much of my time.

168
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
The same old thing.

169
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,400
Next week is our 10th anniversary.
She thinks we should go away together.

170
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,160
Ponton, would you like me
to talk with her?

171
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,240
No.

172
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,480
I mean, this issue must be discussed
between husband and wife.

173
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,440
Well, you must explain to her
that we are men of the law.

174
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,600
Always living in the shadows.

175
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,160
Idiot.

176
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I will miss you, Inspector.

177
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,280
I will miss you, too, Ponton.

178
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,920
- And, Ponton.
- Yes?

179
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,600
I am sorry you can't satisfy your wife.

180
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,880
"I am now leaving France. "

181
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
This is a bad idea.

182
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,800
The legendary Pink Panther DiaMond
has been stolen.

183
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,600
Officials suspect the perpetrator
is the infaMous Tornado.

184
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,320
What'd I tell you?

185
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,720
The theft of the Pink Panther would be
the fourth high-profile criMe...

186
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,320
Oh, my God! He was right.

187
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,240
The Dream Team was supposed to start
its investigations in Kyoto, Japan,

188
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,880
but it's just been diverted to Paris.

189
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,960
France is in shock.

190
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,480
The international Dream Team
of detectives will begin...

191
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,120
I'm standing outside the Grand Palais
where the Pink Panther has been stolen.

192
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,520
Why are they cheering?
This is a national tragedy.

193
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,120
We live in a media age.
You must learn to adapt.

194
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,960
Then adapt I shall.

195
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,840
- Who do you think did this, Inspector?
- Inspector, any comment?

196
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,880
Tornado, I'm coming to get you.

197
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,000
One more.

198
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,920
Tornado, I'm coming to get you.
There's your one.

199
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,000
Good afternoon, Inspector.
The other detectives have already arrived.

200
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,000
They are waiting for you.

201
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,760
- I'm sorry, I don't remember your name.
- What?

202
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,320
- Yes. I am Nicole.
- Yes, so nice to see you again.

203
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,160
You, too, Inspector.

204
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,880
Well, enough of this foreplay.
Where are the other detectives?

205
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes, they're waiting inside.

206
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,400
I hope no one has
tampered with the crime scene.

207
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,960
A crime scene is like a code.

208
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,000
You decipher it,
and it will lead inexorably to the criminal.

209
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,440
That is why it must always be kept
in pristine condition.

210
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,120
Good day. I'm Inspector Jacques Clouseau
of the French Police.

211
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,040
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

212
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,520
And your name?

213
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,000
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

214
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,240
That is your name. I thought you were
ordering in Italian. Once again.

215
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,800
Vicenzo Roccara
Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

216
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,640
Don Corleone.

217
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm Kenji Mazuto.

218
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
Kenji Mazel Tov.

219
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,160
Randall Pepperidge.

220
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,160
And this is my associate Gilbert Ponton,
and this is Nicole.

221
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,960
Nicole is here to service your needs,

222
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,840
so feel free to use her
in any way you wish.

223
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,880
And now there is a crime scene waiting.

224
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,120
Excuse me. "El sceno de crimo. "

225
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,680
- That is not Italian, and I do
speak English. - Really? Prove it.

226
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Gentlemen, we first have to determine
how the crime was committed.

227
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,040
And as I am an expert at deduction...

228
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,840
- You are an expert at deduction?
- That is my field.

229
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,040
I believe deduction is my field
and since you are experiencing hip pain...

230
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,440
How did you know that?

231
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,000
One side of the sole of your shoe
is worn more than the other.

232
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,280
You're favoring your right leg.

233
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,160
Tell me, did you enjoy
your double espresso this morning?

234
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,600
- How did you...
- Your pupils are noticeably dilated.

235
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,520
And will you be moving out
of the Hotel Montmartre?

236
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,800
They are doing construction at night
around the Montmartre

237
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,120
so as not to disturb daytime traffic.

238
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,800
From your puffy eyes,
I deduce you spent a sleepless night.

239
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,800
Speaking of traffic,
are you enjoying your Smart car?

240
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,480
Your trousers are wrinkled
behind the knees.

241
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,400
And how do you think your favorite
football team, Arsenal, will do this year?

242
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,720
That matchbox is from
the only bar in Paris

243
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,640
that shows English football telecasts.

244
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,760
You have tissues in your shoes
to make you look taller.

245
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
You were 14 before you finally
learned to enjoy avocado.

246
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,560
Tell me, how did you enjoy
your trip to the airport this morning?

247
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,160
Now, how did you know that?

248
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,840
- Perhaps one of you should begin.
- Yes, this is silly.

249
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,160
You've recently lost
your favorite cheese grater.

250
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,960
You have an aversion to cow bells.

251
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,480
Stop the insanity and look at this.

252
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,640
Il Tornado is not as careful as he thinks.

253
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,200
Fingerprint. With this small piece of glass,
the case is practically solved.

254
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,120
This one has a fingerprint.

255
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,440
This one has a fingerprint, too.

256
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,320
This one has a fingerprint.

257
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,040
You don't need that.
You have plenty of fingerprint evidence.

258
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,560
Guard that.

259
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,680
What do we know about this man,
this Tornado.

260
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,120
Well, we know that he's a white male
between 50 and 65,

261
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,120
with a scar from a bullet hole
behind his right shoulder.

262
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,000
In 1996, the Tornado was shot right here
in France while trying to steal a gold vase.

263
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,760
Blood was found, and as a result,
his DNA has been on file for over 10 years

264
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,000
without a match.

265
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.
My flight was delayed.

266
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,600
You're Jacques Clouseau.

267
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,400
The Pink Panther detective.
This is such a thrill.

268
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,480
- And who is it that are you?
- I'm Sonia Solandres.

269
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,960
- Didn't anyone tell you that...
- Yes. I was informed.

270
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,840
- A last-minute addition to our team.
- That's right.

271
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,240
I've written a book
on the old Tornado crimes,

272
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,080
but I'm not sure
if I'm really gonna be much help here.

273
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,320
Technically speaking,
I'm not really a detective.

274
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,160
Welcome.
We can always use an extra mind.

275
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,160
Now, let me bring you up to speed.
We know nothing.

276
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,560
You are now up to speed.

277
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,360
In world news today,

278
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,760
MeMbers of the DreaM TeaM gathered for
the first tiMe in front of the Grand Palais

279
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,080
to start their investigations
into the Tornado thefts.

280
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,000
Inspector clouseau had this to say.

281
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,040
Tornado, I'M coMing to get you.
There's your one.

282
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,200
I was able to discover this Tornado
hacked the security system

283
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,480
from a remote location and turned off
all the alarms and surveillance scanners.

284
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,920
- Can you trace the source?
- Yes, but it will take time.

285
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,960
- You are new here?
- Yes, hello. Mrs. Berenger.

286
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,600
- I know who you are, Inspector.
- Do you?

287
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,400
Due to the media frenzy
surrounding this case,

288
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,960
I've been assigned to instruct employees
on political and social correctness.

289
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,200
It's always nice
to have a very sexy woman

290
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,040
clomping around the building
in high heels.

291
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,240
- You must never refer to a woman as sexy.
- But I was complimenting you.

292
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,080
No, Inspector, you must not comment
on a woman's body.

293
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,160
- I get it. I get it. I keep it to myself...
- Yes.

294
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,520
- ... when I am thinking...
- Inspector.

295
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,760
This will be an exercise
and I want you to concentrate.

296
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,160
And no matter what I say,
I want your expression to remain neutral.

297
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,880
That will be easy.

298
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,400
You're here in the corridor
at your employment,

299
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,400
and you see a very pretty young woman
walking toward you,

300
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,280
and her blouse is tight
and is rather bursting at the buttons,

301
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,800
and she drops her pencil,

302
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
and as she bends to retrieve it,
her blouse parts,

303
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,720
revealing the cleavage
of her soft, round, white mounds.

304
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,920
And then the pencil rolls around
and she bends again,

305
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,320
and her undulating buttocks
cause the short skirt to rise

306
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
just shy of the nooks and crannies.

307
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,040
I like you, Mrs. Berenger. I like you a lot.

308
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,720
So, I have made lunch reservations
at four different restaurants,

309
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,680
depending on who wants to eat where.

310
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,560
You know,
I cannot decide what is more beautiful.

311
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
Paris or you.

312
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,400
May I have a word in private?

313
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm worried that your hot Italian blood
might be leading you into an indiscretion.

314
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Really?

315
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,600
Yes, these attentions
you're paying to Nicole.

316
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,720
What?

317
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,440
I see. You and she, you like the...

318
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,800
Oh, no, no, no.
She and I are co-workers, nothing more.

319
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,240
So I'm not stepping on toes.

320
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,360
How could you, since she and I have
absolutely no feelings for one another.

321
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,080
Good, because I find her very alluring.

322
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,360
No. No. For a man like you, she's too drab.

323
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,320
- Drab?
- And she is disgusting.

324
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,040
- Disgusting?
- Yeah, she's drab and disgusting.

325
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,640
I think you are wrong, Clouseau.

326
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,840
You see, you and I,
we are men of the world, no?

327
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,080
We've had all these
sexy and glamorous women, right?

328
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,840
Yes, in fact, I believe
you've made a conquest of your own

329
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,760
in Miss Solandres.

330
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,240
Clouseau, you are a lover.

331
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,600
And Nicole is a woman for a lifetime,
a woman to have the babies with.

332
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,000
- To have the babies?
- Yes, lots and lots of the babies.

333
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
All day long the babies.

334
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,040
All day long the babies?

335
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,520
Ponton.

336
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,840
That Italian and I have locked antlers.

337
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,240
We are like two angry stags
pawing at the ground.

338
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
Have we decided on lunch?

339
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,880
Well, I suppose you will be wanting sushi,
my little yellow friend?

340
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
What?

341
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,440
Inspector, we never refer to Japanese
people as "our little yellow friends. "

342
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,320
- But why?
- Because it is a stereotype.

343
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,920
Inspector, are you prejudiced
against Asians?

344
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,080
Well, of course not.
Except when they drive.

345
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,360
Have you ever seen them drive?

346
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,480
They can hardly see over
the steering wheel.

347
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,880
- Inspector.
- Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Berenger.

348
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,600
I suppose I'm a bit of a dumb blonde
about this.

349
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,160
- What?
- You must never refer to blondes that way.

350
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,800
- But they are so dumb.
- Oh, my God.

351
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
Were you just ogling her?

352
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,000
- No.
- Yes, you were.

353
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I did not.

354
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,320
- You did.
- I did not.

355
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,720
- You did it again.
- No, I didn't.

356
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,320
- Yes, you did. I saw it.
- I did not.

357
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,480
- No, you didn't.
- You did it.

358
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,760
- You did it again!
- No, I didn't.

359
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
- Yes, you did.
- I did not.

360
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,720
- Yes, you did.
- Oh, my God, look!

361
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,240
Oh, my God...

362
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,600
Ponton?

363
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,280
I had it out with my wife.

364
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,280
I told her that she must not
question me about my work,

365
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,240
and that my home life must take
second place to my career.

366
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,560
Good for you. Congratulations!
You are now a real man.

367
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,720
So, then, can I stay here with you?

368
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,600
- What?
- May I stay here? I got kicked out.

369
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,400
- Yes, I suppose. Temporarily.
- Thank you.

370
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,000
It's okay, boys.

371
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,160
What are these?

372
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,320
Ponton?

373
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,760
They are my sons, Louis and Antoine.
They took my side of the argument.

374
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,240
And this is Jacques.

375
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,120
They named him after you.
They idolize you.

376
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,480
Uncle Jacques, what's that?

377
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,640
That is an award given to me
by the President of France.

378
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,960
Go ahead.

379
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,080
- Is that the Pink Panther?
- No, it's a replica.

380
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,400
A copy given to me
for recovering the real diamond

381
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,160
and returning it to France.

382
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,760
Let's show Uncle Jacques what we won.

383
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,440
We won these in a competition
in karate school.

384
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
That is so cute.

385
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,400
Now, let me show you a real trophy.

386
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,920
One I won at a karate competition
just recently.

387
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,760
Wow!

388
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,000
- You like karate?
- We love it.

389
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,160
Remember, boys.

390
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,520
The secret to a successful karate attack
is the element of surprise.

391
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,640
- Good one.
- Thank you.

392
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,520
To find the Tornado,
we must consider his motives.

393
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,280
I'm worried that right now,
the thief is trying to sell the goods.

394
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,600
Right.

395
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,680
"Hey, buddy, do you want to buy
the Shroud of Turin?"

396
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,240
No. These items are too famous to be sold.

397
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,240
Only the Pink Panther can be cut up
and sold as smaller gems.

398
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,720
I suspect that's what he wants.

399
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,400
I have something.

400
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,800
This says the computer that hacked into
the museum is located in Rome.

401
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,120
- Rome?
- Yes. Is something wrong?

402
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,960
No. No. Rome means nothing to me.

403
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,440
I mean...

404
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
Rome? Do you know who lives in Rome?

405
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,520
- Alonso Avellaneda!
- The black market art dealer.

406
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,280
The man rumored to be
the Tornado's fence.

407
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,120
There's always been a suspicion

408
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,560
that Avellaneda's not just the Tornado's
fence, but the Tornado himself.

409
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,720
He is the right age.

410
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,920
Do we have a sample of his DNA?

411
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,320
Not yet, but we should be in Rome
in one hour.

412
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,200
Where is our pilot?

413
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,560
I don't trust any other pilot
for my plane but myself.

414
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,800
Your plane.

415
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,680
Nicoletta,
would you like to be my co-pilot?

416
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,280
- Come.
- Okay.

417
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,120
- Would I be disturbing you if I joined you?
- No, no. Please disturb me.

418
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,680
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said outside the museum,

419
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,280
about the psychology of the criminal.

420
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,360
The "why?"

421
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,440
Perhaps romantic disappointment.

422
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:57,040
A foolish young woman
who leaves a man for a younger man.

423
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,240
That could never happen.

424
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,320
But of course.

425
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
What a man such as that should do

426
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,360
is start a new romance
with someone more appreciative.

427
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,440
That is so funny. "Start a new romance. "

428
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,800
I'm not quite sure what you mean,
but that is funny.

429
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,240
It appears that Inspector Clouseau
does not find Miss Solandres drab.

430
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
"Drab"?

431
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,600
The very word
that he used to describe you.

432
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,840
- He called me drab?
- And disgusting.

433
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,240
Disgusting?

434
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,080
Thank you.

435
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,640
Hey, Ponton.
Tell me more about Inspector Clouseau.

436
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,240
He's a brilliant man, unorthodox, oblique.

437
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,920
But I can tell you
with absolute confidence,

438
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,560
he's the man who will solve this case.

439
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,280
Ponton-san, you are crazy.

440
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,400
If Clouseau solves this case,
I am perfectly willing to run around

441
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,640
like a bare-bummed idiot
wearing nothing but a tutu.

442
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,840
Well, let's talk about Avellaneda.

443
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,400
- What are his proclivities?
- He's an art connoisseur,

444
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,040
but because of his questionable dealings,

445
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,720
he was thrown out of Spain
and must live here.

446
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,880
You see?
He has squandered his reputation,

447
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,600
and he is forced to live in the woods
like an animal

448
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
with the shame of being a criminal.

449
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,320
If there is one absolute truth in this
world, it is that crime does not pay.

450
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,280
You say the bullet hole is
behind his right shoulder?

451
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Yes.

452
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,760
Then all we have to do is figure out a way
to get him to remove his shirt.

453
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,200
I was half expecting you.

454
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,160
Are you the so-called "Dream Team"?

455
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,880
And who is it
who is inquiring of us who we are?

456
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,400
I am Alonso Avellaneda.
Is this more of that Tornado nonsense?

457
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,400
We shall see who is the one
who will be saying nonsensical things

458
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,680
that are something of nonsense.

459
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,240
Well, I suppose I must bow
to the inevitable.

460
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,280
Please, come inside.
I'll join you in a moment.

461
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,800
Nicole.

462
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,760
While the Dream Team plays its
little games, I am going to snoop around.

463
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,200
Who cares?

464
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,800
So, gentlemen and ladies,
please make yourselves at home.

465
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,760
Now, how can I help you?

466
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,440
Senor Avellaneda,
where were you last Friday evening?

467
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,080
Dining with my daughter and my ex-wife.

468
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,800
Don't believe me, call them.

469
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,360
Why call them?

470
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,120
They already lied for you
on the stand 10 years ago.

471
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
I am not the Tornado.

472
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,640
Do you mind
if I examine your computer system?

473
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,760
Be my guest. I have nothing to hide.

474
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,360
Sometimes things hide in plain sight.

475
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,360
My security system.

476
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,320
Answer this question.

477
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,000
In the past, you admitted to dealings
with ll Tornado?

478
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,480
Yes, but that was 10 years ago.

479
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,640
Besides, I never saw his face.

480
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,880
How did you conduct these transactions
if you never saw his face?

481
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,480
He was in disguise.
He always wore a mask.

482
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,400
Did you call him Zorro?
Or the Power Ranger?

483
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
Come, come, senor Avellaneda,
you expect us to believe

484
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,640
that two grown men
do millions of dollars of business

485
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,560
with each other
and you never saw his face?

486
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,120
Perhaps I saw him once.

487
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,640
Did it look something like this?
Or this? How about this?

488
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,440
No, I've told you. I am not the Tornado.

489
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,240
How did you pay him?

490
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,800
With deposits into Swiss bank accounts.

491
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,120
Numbered. Untraceable.

492
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,720
I understand.

493
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,840
Look, I know my answers
are less than satisfactory.

494
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,760
I realize that.

495
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,120
Does this mean
I must spend the rest of my life

496
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,800
living under a cloud of suspicion?

497
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,400
- Forgive my intrusion.
- Yes.

498
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,960
There is one way to prove your innocence.

499
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,920
Back in 1996, while perpetrating a crime...

500
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,480
Yes, yes, yes. He received a bullet wound
in the shoulder.

501
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Is this what it's come to?

502
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,080
That I must strip down
and remove my clothes

503
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
in the sanctity of my own home

504
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,560
before a group of people I've only just met
just to prove my innocence?

505
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,440
Well, it wouldn't hurt.

506
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,400
Fine. Let's get it over with, then.

507
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,640
I believe it was the right shoulder.

508
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,800
So I hope this proves beyond doubt
that I am not the Tornado.

509
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,280
We will have to leave you in peace.

510
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,360
He's already shown us his shoulders.
There is no wound.

511
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,320
He did?

512
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,680
- The man is guilty.
- There's no physical evidence.

513
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,840
Clouseau!

514
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,960
He removed his shirt twice,
and there was no bullet hole.

515
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,800
Haven't you ever heard
of cosmetic surgery?

516
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,520
Yes. Of course you have.

517
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Clouseau Inspector,
I even checked all the house's computers.

518
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,560
None of them are used
to hack into the museum.

519
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,840
Still...

520
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,520
Clouseau, can't you see
what's plain in front of you?

521
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,200
Your unrelenting stubbornness
is maddening.

522
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,840
And I'm telling you I sense
the presence of the Tornado in that house.

523
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,360
They don't know anything.

524
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,560
That blasted bullet wound. It's my mark.

525
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,760
One day they'll find me.

526
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
You're in no danger, Laurence.

527
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,840
This is all very strange.

528
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,920
I even know one of them.

529
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,760
You do?

530
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,280
- Which one?
- You know me.

531
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,560
Isn't it obvious?

532
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,560
Inspector, excuse me.

533
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,400
Are you familiar with a Spanish restaurant
here in Rome called La Plata de Nada?

534
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,560
Know it? I destroyed it.

535
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,440
I found this in a jammed paper shredder.

536
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,480
.00 tonight.
The grand re-opening of La Plata de Nada.

537
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,480
And I thought, "Why would Avellaneda

538
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,080
"shred a simple reminder
of a dinner appointment?"

539
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,920
Good work, Ponton.

540
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,920
- So what should we do?
- Our jobs, Ponton.

541
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,840
We investigate, see who he's eating with.
Perhaps the Tornado.

542
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,960
You go on ahead.

543
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,000
Ponton and I will get a taxi
and do a little sightseeing.

544
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,760
This stakeout was a good idea, Ponton.
Fortunately, I'm an expert lip-reader.

545
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,760
He's saying, "Never retune a wet piano. "

546
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,760
Why is he saying that?

547
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,240
No, he is saying, "My wife will not be back
in Italy until Sunday. "

548
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,920
- No wonder he shredded the message.
- What is all this?

549
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,080
Before they opened tonight, I snuck in,

550
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,400
found out which table he'd reserved,
and planted a bug.

551
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,120
But how did you find out which table
they would be seated at?

552
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,000
You rubbed your fingers together.

553
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,200
That is surprising.

554
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,120
What is she doing here with him?

555
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,760
I'm sorry, Inspector.

556
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,960
We've got to find out
what they are saying.

557
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,400
Why?

558
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,800
We've got to move the bug
from that table to that table.

559
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,880
- How?
- Let me handle it.

560
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,960
Hello. Remember me?

561
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,840
Don't you come back.

562
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,520
What's wrong?
You don't like this restaurant?

563
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Oh, no.
No, I have been here one time before.

564
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,160
It's very nice.

565
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,280
There. It is out.

566
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,880
We've been able to confirM
that the Pope's ring has been stolen.

567
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,160
Ironically, the DreaM TeaM
was no less than five Miles away in RoMe.

568
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,440
The Italian people are outraged
that the Tornado was able to pull this off

569
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,240
right under their noses.

570
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,240
Mr. Clouseau.

571
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,920
Mr. Pepperidge, was the Dream Team
sleeping last night during the theft?

572
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,920
No comment.

573
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,480
Do you think
they will ever recover the ring?

574
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,800
If I made a comment after I'd said,
"No comment,"

575
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,280
I'd look like a complete ass, wouldn't I?

576
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,440
Do not worry.
Vicenzo Roccara Squarcialupi Brancaleone

577
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,200
swears to you by all that is holy,

578
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,600
that St. Peter's ring
will be restored to the Church.

579
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,720
Please sit down.

580
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,080
Now, Mr. Pope,

581
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,720
do you happen to know right now
the whereabouts of your hat?

582
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,560
- My hat?
- Yes, your big, pointy hat.

583
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,200
No, I don't know.

584
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,560
Then I am probably sitting on it.
I thought I felt a little...

585
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,760
This can be fixed.

586
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,120
As good as new.

587
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,160
Now...

588
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,920
How do we know
it wasn't you who stole the ring

589
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,680
so you could collect
on the insurance money?

590
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,000
- I am the Pope.
- Forgive me, Mr. Pope,

591
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,520
it's just that sometimes
when I speak so forcefully,

592
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,920
people just crack instantly.
Now, was the ring insured?

593
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,720
The ring is priceless. It cannot be insured.

594
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,120
- So you had no reason to steal the ring.
- I own the ring.

595
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,720
Perhaps you wanted to sell the ring
so you could live in a big, fancy house.

596
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,760
I kind of do.

597
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,600
Now, let me reconstruct the crime.
You came into the room when?

598
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,120
- At 9:.00.
- And what was the first thing you did?

599
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,880
I went out on the balcony
to admire the Lord's handiwork.

600
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,360
The moon that night was so beautiful.
It made me close to the Lord.

601
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,360
I'm picking up on something.
You're a very spiritual man, aren't you?

602
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,080
It's part of my job to read people.
I think I'm quite good at it, too.

603
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,080
- And then what did you do?
- I removed my robes.

604
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,360
- And you put them...
- In the closet.

605
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
- May I?
- Certainly.

606
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,640
You know,
if you organized your closets by color,

607
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,080
it would save you time
in your rush to get to work in the morning.

608
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,600
It's what I do, and it saves me time.

609
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
Now, in order to better
visualize the crime,

610
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,920
I'm going to place myself in your position.

611
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,320
- With your permission.
- Certainly.

612
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,840
So, I come home, it's 9:.00 p. m.
"I think I'll go look at the moon. "

613
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,120
I am going out onto the balcony.

614
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,320
I walk out on the balcony.
I am now out on the balcony.

615
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,080
I am looking at the moon.
I am looking at the moon.

616
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,400
I'm feeling very, very spiritual.
I come back in.

617
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,920
- And what did you do next?
- I went out for the second time.

618
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,960
You went out a second time
to look at the moon.

619
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,760
It's the Pope.

620
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,160
Looking at the moon,
18 seconds has gone by.

621
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,600
18 seconds is enough time
for the thief to have gained entrance.

622
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,840
Now, you see why it is important
to re-create the events.

623
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,240
Or perhaps the thief was hiding
in a ledge or recess.

624
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,280
Or perhaps he was clinging
to the underside of the...

625
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,240
Thank you, God. Thank you.

626
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,240
Chief Inspector,
Joubert wants to speak to you.

627
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,160
He wants Clouseau off the case.

628
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,640
- No!
- No?

629
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,960
No, let's wait till he does
something really embarrassing.

630
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,080
Home.

631
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,840
- Surprise attack!
- Surprise attack!

632
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,280
- Not now, I'm depressed.
- Perfect for our advantage.

633
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,480
The secret to an attack
is the element of surprise, remember?

634
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,400
Now I will teach you
who is the karate master.

635
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,040
Now watch what I will do to your head.

636
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,640
Now, Antoine.

637
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,680
Let's talk about this, boys.

638
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,200
Come, little ones. All is forgiven.

639
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,000
Ponton, can we see Clouseau?

640
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,600
Is the French idiot home?

641
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,480
How does he feel about his disgrace?

642
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,240
Inspector Clouseau
is the consummate professional.

643
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,960
He always exhibits grace under pressure.

644
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,800
Die, little piglets!

645
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,040
My God, do you understand
what you have done that is wrong?

646
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,440
- Just remind me.
- You cannot beat up children

647
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,840
- and call them piglets.
- The world is changing so fast.

648
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,320
Inspector, you have failed to improve
at every opportunity.

649
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,480
You are the most small-minded nitwit
I have ever encountered.

650
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,120
- I am sure I can do better.
- Very well, we'll give you one more try.

651
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,040
I'm going to hold up a series of images,
and I want you to tell me what you see.

652
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,280
Just say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

653
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,000
A drunken Irishman.

654
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,880
An Englishman with bad teeth.

655
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,640
A San Francisco Nancy boy.

656
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,480
A Polish army officer driving a septic tank.

657
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,800
Where did you get these cards?

658
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,080
It's in every newspaper all over the world.
We're all being made to look like idiots.

659
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,840
Reputations built up over a lifetime
utterly ruined.

660
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,960
I had to quit being a Buddhist
because I feel so much hate.

661
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,800
He sat on the Pope's hat!

662
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:00,040
Look, he recovered the Pink Panther once,
and I believe he can do it again.

663
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,440
If he solves this case, I'm perfectly
willing to run around for 24 hours

664
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,000
wearing nothing but a tutu
and carrying a big, pink, fluffy handbag.

665
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,320
I say we take a vote to get rid of him.
All in favor?

666
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,560
Whatever it is, count me in.

667
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,320
Clouseau, while you were
falling off of the Pope's balcony

668
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,360
dressed as the Pope,
I discovered a key piece of evidence.

669
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,240
And what is this key piece of evidence?

670
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,560
A key.

671
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,520
I found this on the Pope's bedroom floor.
Something, of course, you overlooked.

672
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,080
That could mean anything.

673
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,280
But if this key is so important,
I will take it and duly examine it.

674
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,160
Inspector Clouseau.

675
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:50,520
It is my not-so-sad duty to inform you
that you have been voted off of the team.

676
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,040
Off the team?

677
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,960
You are no longer part
of this investigation.

678
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,520
Cheerio.

679
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,080
Nicole.

680
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,720
- Nicole?
- Inspector.

681
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,920
I was just returning a file.

682
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,520
What are you doing in Nicole's office?

683
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,880
- When I got fired...
- You thought Nicole was the one person

684
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,960
- you could share it with.
- Well, we do go back.

685
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,320
Story of my life,

686
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,680
the men I'm interested in
aren't the ones interested in me.

687
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,120
Really? I would think all men
would be interested in you.

688
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,400
- Why do you say that?
- Because...

689
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,360
- ... you are very attractive.
- I will see you in my office in five.

690
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,960
But really, there is no one?

691
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,000
Frankly speaking, the one big love
of my life didn't quite work out.

692
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,600
You poor thing.

693
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,680
Nicole!

694
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,080
No, no, no, don't let me interrupt.
I only have a message from Vicenzo.

695
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,800
He wants you both at this address,
immediately.

696
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,600
He has decided he needs my expertise.

697
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,080
No. They've solved the case.

698
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,560
- What?
- They've solved the case.

699
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,240
Inspector, welcome.

700
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,160
Even though
we've had certain disagreements,

701
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,280
we are willing to share the glory with you
out of our respect for la Francia.

702
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,840
Pepperidge examined the key
and knew right away

703
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,720
it was made by a French locksmith.

704
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,400
Kenji did research on the locksmiths
in Paris who sell this brand.

705
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,160
We asked for a list of addresses
and we found this apartment.

706
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,440
When we got here,
we found the owner licking the carpet.

707
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,320
His name is Laurence Milliken.

708
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,760
And the stolen items?

709
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,400
The Shroud of Turin!

710
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,600
We should have it dry-cleaned
before we return it.

711
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,000
The Pope's ring.
His wife will be happy to have that back.

712
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,360
- And where is the Pink Panther?
- Unfortunately, that cannot be recovered.

713
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,800
No Pink Panther?

714
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,880
- He explained in his suicide note.
- Yes.

715
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,640
"Life had become horribly dull
and uninteresting.

716
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,480
"Nothing matched the excitement
of stealing great treasures,

717
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,800
"so I returned,

718
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,520
"but I found that even stealing
no longer interested me.

719
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,520
"Without a purpose,
I no longer wish to live.

720
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,760
"I am returning every treasure but one.
The Pink Panther.

721
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,760
"Having it in my possession
for even a few days

722
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,400
"made me realize its fabulous beauty.

723
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,680
"No one must have it but me,
so I destroyed it.

724
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,120
"The Pink Panther is dust,
a final revenge. "

725
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,920
"Laurence Milliken, the Tornado. "

726
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,560
I spent four years researching and writing
my book. I hoped to meet him alive.

727
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,600
The Tornado was an expert
on gems and their value?

728
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,800
Yes, in fact, Milliken was the author

729
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,440
of the most authoritative book
on the subject.

730
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,040
This man did not commit these crimes.
The case has not been solved.

731
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,920
But, look, there's the wound
from 10 years ago.

732
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,440
- I stake my reputation on it.
- Well, that's not much.

733
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,560
- The media are outside.
- Then I will announce

734
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,440
- that we have solved the case.
- I wouldn't.

735
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,080
- I will.
- I wouldn't do it.

736
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,080
- I am going to.
- I wouldn't.

737
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,520
I am delighted to announce
that we have found ll Tornado.

738
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,760
The dead man in the apartment

739
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,720
is indubitably
the perpetrator of these crimes.

740
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,200
Actually, one of us disagrees
with this hypothesis.

741
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,040
I am sure that Milliken is not the thief.

742
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,640
Hold it. We're getting the report
on the DNA evidence.

743
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,280
The DNA taken from the body
of Laurence Milliken today

744
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,880
and the DNA taken 10 years ago
from the blood of the Tornado

745
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,600
are a 100% match.

746
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,440
The man inside is the Tornado.

747
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,440
I'd like to thank my colleagues
for their assistance,

748
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,600
and especially one of your own
here in la Francia.

749
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,520
My most heartfelt appreciation
to Nicoletta.

750
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,680
You are a beacon of light
in a forest of darkness.

751
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,040
Nicole is no less a thief than ll Tornado
because she has stolen this.

752
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,360
Your mama is here.

753
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,400
Say goodbye to Uncle Jacques.

754
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,160
- Goodbye, Uncle Jacques.
- We love you, Uncle Jacques.

755
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,920
You are two fine, young, little pig persons.

756
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,080
- Goodbye, Papa.
- Goodbye.

757
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,920
- When will you be coming home, Papa?
- I'm not sure.

758
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,200
Goodbye.

759
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,320
Well, Ponton,
we are two available men alone in Paris,

760
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,880
the most exciting city in the world.

761
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,680
How should we spend our evening?

762
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,800
- What sort of shampoo is this?
- Jojoba.

763
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,560
- Jojoba.
- Jojoba.

764
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,360
Let me see the bottle.

765
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,520
- It's spelled "Jojoba. "
- It's pronounced "Hohoba. "

766
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,680
It's spelled "Jojoba,"
but it's pronounced "Hohoba. "

767
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,800
- "Hohoba. "
- Why would they do something like that?

768
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:16,440
Well, Ponton, I think our bachelor night
is going very well. Who needs women?

769
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,640
I'm going back home
to my wife and children.

770
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:24,240
- What? What brought this on?
- You. I don't wish to end up... I mean...

771
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,080
I have decided that love and family
must not come second.

772
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,320
If I may, Inspector,
look what that thinking has done for you.

773
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,360
What? I'm very happy living alone
with my various shampoos.

774
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,160
Inspector, I still think you are
the best detective in the world.

775
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,880
Yet, when it comes to love, you never see
what is staring you right in the face.

776
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,000
Take Nicole, for example.
Do you know the color of her eyes?

777
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,960
Her pet's name? Her favorite song?

778
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,840
You can recite an entire section
of every statute in French criminal law,

779
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,800
but you don't know the first thing
about the woman who loves you.

780
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,080
Her eyes are brown.

781
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,600
She loves the smell of vanilla.

782
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,440
She's allergic to shellfish.

783
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,360
She has a small scar on her ankle,
which I gave her.

784
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,480
She loves her cats, Mindy and Wendy,

785
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:27,600
and Cindy, Delores, Frank,
Maxime, Caligula and Louise.

786
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,280
And she does not think she is pretty.

787
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,680
And I can never tell her she is pretty.

788
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,160
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

789
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,680
If she knew how pretty she is,
she might choose someone other than me.

790
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,560
- Ponton.
- Yes?

791
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,560
I need a hug.

792
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,440
Okay.

793
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,840
And now, conditioner.

794
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:06,400
After More than a decade, the infaMous
Tornado has finally been unMasked.

795
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,080
Thanks to the work
of the international DreaM TeaM.

796
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,880
Their success is being celebrated tonight
in a very exclusive event.

797
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,440
Let's go live now to the Petit Palais
in Paris, where the gala is underway.

798
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,320
So, tell us about the case.

799
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,240
This was really not
one of my most challenging cases.

800
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,960
I'm surprised it even took us this long...

801
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,800
My powers of observation
are so finely tuned by this point

802
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,040
that just one look at any situation,
and ideas come flooding into me.

803
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,560
Modern technology makes
the modern criminal obsolete.

804
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,880
And what about the Pink Panther?

805
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,280
- Too bad it was destroyed.
- Yes, we're very sorry about that.

806
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,840
Three out of four isn't bad.

807
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,880
-75%.
- Yes, brilliant.

808
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,560
- Inspector.
- Miss Solandres.

809
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,600
- Quite a snarl here.
- Y es, I know.

810
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,440
A spot just opened up. Take it.
I'll watch the meter for you.

811
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,440
- Nice car.
- It's a rental.

812
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,480
I figured Paris, excitement,
romance, you know.

813
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,320
- I'm leaving Paris tonight, on the redeye.
- Bon voyage.

814
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,040
Goodbye, Inspector.

815
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,520
- You know Mrs. Dreyfus?
- Yes, sir.

816
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,440
Well, let me know immediately
if she arrives.

817
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,520
- Nicole.
- Yes.

818
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,240
- I thought you might be hungry.
- Well...

819
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,440
- That is very thoughtful of you.
- Cute car.

820
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,520
It's Miss Solandres' car.

821
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,960
- Well, it's a little chilly out here, so...
- Nicole?

822
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,800
You are very pretty.

823
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,560
Well, that's odd. Some would say
I was drab and disgusting.

824
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,440
Well, who in their right mind
could call you drab and disgusting?

825
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,360
Whoever could say something like that,
would...

826
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,400
I said it.

827
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,440
- He told you?
- Yes, he did.

828
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:36,160
I only said it
because I didn't want him to...

829
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,440
To what?

830
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,800
To fall in love with you.

831
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,120
I don't know what to think.

832
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,360
- Ponton speaking.
- Ponton, here's what I want you to do.

833
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,880
I'm thinking of recommending

834
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,600
the establishment of a permanent
international police force,

835
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,280
which, of course,
I would be prepared to command.

836
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,880
Excuse me.

837
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,280
- What?
- I have solved the case.

838
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,480
- What?
- I have solved the case.

839
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,600
The case has been solved, Clouseau.
That is why we're having the party,

840
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,280
you see, because we've solved the case.

841
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,880
Are you all right, Chief Inspector?

842
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,920
- It's clueless Clouseau again.
- Is he here?

843
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,240
He's so desperate to regain his status
as the Pink Panther hero

844
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,080
that he's come up with
the most ingenious theory.

845
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,040
- What theory?
- That you are the thief.

846
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Me?

847
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,000
And that you have the Pink Panther
here with you.

848
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,960
Now I'm feeling guilty.

849
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,480
I've been feuding with a man
who is mentally handicapped.

850
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,560
For one thing, how could Sonia
have performed the theft in Rome?

851
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,640
We were all there together.

852
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,600
Actually, the rest of us were all
at the bar.

853
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,640
If you recall, Miss Solandres
stayed home with a headache.

854
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,680
Well, that's right, but...

855
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,640
But where would you get the expertise
for these crimes?

856
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,240
Well, she is the world's
foremost authority on ll Tornado.

857
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,360
Just as a parlor game, what if
she obtained this expertise directly from...

858
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,360
What if she were his daughter?

859
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,040
- No, that wouldn't...
- A lover.

860
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,360
- Yes, a scorned lover.
- Better. Motive.

861
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,760
That would explain stealing
the unfenceable items

862
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,440
- to direct attention...
- To ll Tornado.

863
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,600
So she can bring him out of hiding
and set him up as the perpetrator.

864
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,440
- Then she could kill him, forge a note...
- And keep the Pink Panther.

865
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,920
As Clouseau said, the one fenceable item.

866
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,280
Congratulations, gentlemen,
a very diverting and amusing puzzle

867
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,800
solved in two minutes.

868
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,680
Bravo.

869
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,920
Open your purse.

870
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,960
Nicoletta, you misunderstand.
This is a game, an exercise.

871
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,320
Yes, but just to complete the game,
let's have a look.

872
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,800
I have a plane to catch.

873
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,960
Seriously, gentlemen!

874
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,000
Okay, let's get this over and done with.

875
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,360
Oh, my God! He was right.

876
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,960
Stop! I am the one you want, not her.

877
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,920
Only I possess the evidence that will keep
you in prison for the rest of your life.

878
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,840
So if you're going to shoot anyone,
shoot me.

879
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,080
Okay.

880
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,320
Perhaps I did not think that through.

881
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,840
Jacques!

882
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,800
I wish I'd shot him.

883
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,520
Look, his Medal of Honor
absorbed the bullet.

884
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,680
- What?
- Not exactly.

885
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,560
The bullet ricocheted and killed the waiter.

886
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,520
Where's Sonia?

887
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,280
She mustn't escape. I'll stop her.

888
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,120
Get back.

889
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:00,840
That gun is pointless. There are four of us,
and you only have four bullets left.

890
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,520
That doesn't add up.

891
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,000
All right, I'm warning you, Miss Solandres,
I've got a...

892
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,200
Spoon?

893
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,240
I've got a knife.

894
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,880
Stop. You cannot escape.

895
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,880
- You don't have a match.
- That's right.

896
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,800
Never use an elevator during a fire.

897
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,680
Fire? Leave this to me.

898
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,400
In the name of the statutes and laws
of the great nation of France,

899
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,520
you are under arrest for the theft
of the world's most priceless...

900
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,560
You are under arrest!

901
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,800
Let me go, or I will destroy it.

902
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,120
- Let her go.
- Let her do it.

903
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,200
Are you insane?

904
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,680
Good work, Ponton.

905
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:46,600
You moron! You twerp!
You sad excuse for a human being!

906
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,800
You have just destroyed
the sacred symbol of France!

907
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,840
- Ponton, did you bring what I asked for?
- Boys.

908
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,160
- Here it is, Uncle Jacques.
- Yes, yes.

909
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,320
I knew the Tornado would eventually
come after the Pink Panther.

910
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,680
So I went to the Musee
with a simple plan in mind.

911
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,080
I had convinced My old friend,
Robert the night guard,

912
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:20,200
to turn off the security systeM
for the few MoMents necessary

913
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,440
to save the Most beautiful object
in France.

914
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,840
I then switched the Pink Panther
with the replica I had at home.

915
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,680
This is the real Pink Panther.

916
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,200
It was the fake that was stolen.

917
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,000
Nightmare. Nightmare.

918
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,520
And when the Tornado,
an expert on the quality of gems,

919
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,200
wrote in his supposed suicide note
ofits great beauty,

920
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:52,000
I knew he could never have been the thief.
He would have recognized it as a fake.

921
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,680
How did you figure out it was Sonia?

922
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,280
It was because I spent the last 17 months
on parking duty.

923
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,320
What?

924
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:07,360
Today, I was staring
at Miss Solandres' license plate.

925
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:12,080
I recognized it because of
my unique system of cross-referencing.

926
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,120
I became aware that I had
given a ticket to the same car

927
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,160
two days before Miss Solandres
claiMed she arrived in Paris.

928
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,840
One day before
the Pink Panther was stolen.

929
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,760
You followed my instructions
very well, Clouseau.

930
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,600
It was I, of course, who put Clouseau
onto the parking ticket assignment.

931
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,000
- Isn't that so, Inspector?
- No.

932
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,440
And at Avellaneda's mansion,

933
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,000
when I sensed the presence
of the Tornado,

934
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,960
he was there, all right.

935
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,760
But it was not a he, it was a she!

936
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,880
Clouseau is the greatest detective
in the world.

937
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,360
His mind is sharper
than all of us combined.

938
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,880
- Should we tell him?
- Absolutely not.

939
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,480
Inspector Clouseau.

940
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,680
Sometimes a man must be bold enough
to speak from the heart.

941
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,240
You deserve to know the truth
about Nicole and I.

942
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,160
- Stop. I don't want to hear.
- But nothing happened.

943
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,840
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

944
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:39,880
- It pains me to admit, but no.
- Not even a little smoochie-woochie?

945
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,920
I never had a chance,
because she only has eyes for one man.

946
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,480
You.

947
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,680
Yes, you. Now please, for God's sake,
kiss her already.

948
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,240
Nicole, I have learned that

949
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,040
no man is an island.

950
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,840
So would you,
even though it may lead to possible injury,

951
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,280
marry me?

952
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:38,000
Inspector Dreyfus, thank you again
for agreeing to conduct the ceremony.

953
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,000
It makes everything
that much more special.

954
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,480
Jacques Clouseau and Nicole Durant.

955
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,680
Do you promise to love, honor and obey...

956
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:57,080
Wait! A wife does not
have to obey her husband.

957
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,040
Okay, scrap "obey. " Do you promise
to love and honor each other?

958
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,560
- I do.
- I do.

959
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,800
Good! So by the powers vested in me

960
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,600
as Chief Inspector
of the 13th Arrondissement,

961
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,200
I now declare you husband and wife.

962
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,760
Here's to peace and harmony.

963
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,560
- The password?
- Hamburger!

964
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,080
That's not it.

965
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,720
- Hamburger!
- No!

966
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,200
- Hamburger!
- No.

967
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,920
They must have changed it.
Clouseau, your gadget!

968
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,320
Clouseau, what's the new password?

969
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,080
It says "low battery. "

970
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,760
- Low battery.
- No!

971
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,200
No, wait. That means the battery is low.

972
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,600
It wants me to go online
and renew my subscription.

973
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,800
- For God's sake, Clouseau!
- Kenji, please take care of this.

974
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
We have a plane to catch.

975
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,440
- Was it beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

976
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,760
- Here are your glasses.
- Thanks.

977
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,960
Wait.

978
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,320
- Was my mother there?
- Yes, absolutely!

979
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,120
- Can't you hear her screaming?
- Not really.

980
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:45,120
