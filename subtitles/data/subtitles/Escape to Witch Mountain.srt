00:00:02,000 --> 00:01:02,002
Kikina presents

2
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:05,240
Well, here we are!
You're Tony and you're Tia!

3
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:07,493
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Mrs Grindley.

4
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,662
Such fine-looking children!

5
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:11,832
I know you're anxious
to see your room,

6
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:14,210
but first, we have some forms
to fill out,

7
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,464
then we'll join the others
for dinner, all right?

8
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:21,094
Tia, what a pretty case!

9
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,730
Well...

10
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:35,781
It ain't nothing
writing out those entry forms.

11
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,744
Wait till she lays one of those
enlightened punishments on you!

12
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,954
"And after you watch
the five o'clock news

13
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:44,084
you can write
a 500-word composition!" Brother!

14
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:48,882
Tony, what should I put
after "sports"?

15
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,220
Put "spectator".

16
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:55,600
Dumb pen's out of ink!

17
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:59,230
I'm finished. You can use mine.

18
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,237
Hey, I lost one just like this
when I was coming into this barn!

19
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,619
- Tia's had that since Christmas!
- Sure she has!

20
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:13,290
Give it back!

21
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,045
Take it!

22
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,430
Now, children, that wasn't
so difficult, was it?

23
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,684
No, ma'am.

24
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,273
Now, Truck, I want you
to wait for me in my office.

25
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,026
We'll read this together.

26
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:43,373
I keep forgetting
what it feels like to sit down!

27
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,003
I know how both of you must feel.

28
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,966
Your foster parents
are the only parents you remember,

29
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:55,347
and now that they've passed away,
you're just a little bit scared.

30
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,686
- We loved them very much.
- Yes, ma'am. We miss them.

31
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:04,584
You only remember
your adoptive name, "Malone"?

32
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:10,467
Well, Tia was around three and I was
five when the Malones adopted us.

33
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:17,894
Did either of you ever receive
a birthday card from a relative?

34
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:21,857
Perhaps a phone call at Christmas?

35
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,444
Maybe you've forgotten.

36
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,910
Often, the most trivial thing
is important. Tia...

37
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:32,831
Were you remembering something?

38
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:37,671
No, Mrs Grindley. I'm sorry.

39
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,968
There's nothing
to be sorry about, dear.

40
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:04,623
You're out, Truck.

41
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:21,605
Nobody can jump that high, Malone.
You stood on something!

42
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:42,049
You're just trying to rip me off.
I was safe at third.

43
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:47,556
There's something funny about this,
and I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

44
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,267
<i>Tony!</i>

45
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,415
Cut it out, will ya?

46
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,374
<i>Tony, why did you do that?</i>

47
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,253
<i>You don't think we're gonna
get away with it, do you?</i>

48
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:51,850
<i>You see?</i>

49
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:00,112
<i>Tony, you promised me
and I promised you</i>

50
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:06,578
<i>we wouldn't do the kind of stuff
you did with Truck.</i>

51
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:11,836
<i>Remember when we thought
it was all funny, like a game?</i>

52
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:17,135
<i>And all the other kids thought we
were freaks or witches.</i>

53
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,387
I know, Tia.

54
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:24,102
We lost all our friends until
we quit doing the spooky stuff.

55
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,940
<i>- You should have let Truck hit you.
- Are you kidding?</i>

56
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,318
He's much bigger than me!

57
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:33,448
<i>Then you should have made it
look like he won.</i>

58
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,034
I suppose.

59
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,917
<i>Tony, do you hear the dogs?</i>

60
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:47,383
No. How far?

61
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:55,144
<i>About 20 miles. Big dogs.
Six or seven.</i>

62
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:59,776
Yeah, I can hear them now.

63
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:07,703
<i>That's awful far, even for us.
Why are we hearing them, Tony?</i>

64
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:14,629
I think it means
we're gonna see 'em some day.

65
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:37,827
If the bus is any later, we'll miss
the beginning of the picture.

66
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:41,457
- Yeah!
- I'll see what's keeping them.

67
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,255
Want to see something really neat?

68
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:50,302
- That's my star case, Truck.
- And you're his sister!

69
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,516
<i>Tony, please. Not another fight!</i>

70
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:58,730
It's your star case, Tia.
He might smash it.

71
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,943
Give it back to Tia now!

72
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,365
- I'll fight you with one hand!
- I'll fight you with none!

73
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:14,376
The bus is here!

74
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,443
Nice going, Winkie!

75
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:37,950
Tony and Tia!
What's taking you? Come on!

76
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,621
Hurry up!

77
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:01,607
<i>Tony, across the street!</i>

78
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:06,989
The big car? What about it?

79
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:09,910
Something's going to happen to it.

80
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:14,416
There's a man.
He mustn't get into that car!

81
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,712
There he is!

82
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:21,175
Come on!

83
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:30,521
- Sir, don't get in that car!
- It's no joke, sir!

84
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,441
My sister, she gets these feelings.

85
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,989
- You mustn't get in the car.
- Please, sir!

86
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,788
Children! You know the rules
about leaving the group!

87
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:47,627
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- That's all right.

88
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,259
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to take a walk.

89
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:02,972
- Pick me up by the park.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,747
- Are you all right?!
- Yes, sir.

91
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:43,402
The moon is moving into Aries.

92
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,907
Friday, it will near
the middle of the transit.

93
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:49,452
The bottom line, Mr Meikeljohn!

94
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:52,831
The bottom line, Mr Bolt,

95
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:58,714
shows considerable indications
of some advance towards your goals.

96
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,468
House guru, do you concur?

97
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:05,140
There are profound vibrations,
Mr Bolt.

98
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:07,393
Are there indeed?

99
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,566
Vibrations. My moon in Aries.

100
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:16,489
Mysterious words and phrases haven't
added one cent to my fortune!

101
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:21,871
Wealth is like flesh,
it has to be nurtured and coddled!

102
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:27,211
Ah, Mr Deranian!

103
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm sorry, Mr Bolt,

104
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:33,762
but when you've heard my report,
you will understand.

105
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:36,766
I have found
what you're looking for.

106
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,160
Wait here a minute.

107
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,532
I haven't had a chance to thank you.

108
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,785
Was the man in front all right?

109
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:35,168
Yes, but you knew he would be or you
would have kept him out of the car.

110
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,385
I suppose this sort of thing happens
to you all the time, young lady?

111
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:45,431
Knowing about things
before they happen?

112
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,439
The lunch bell. We have to go.

113
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,737
Excuse me.
Those two children that just left.

114
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,616
I've been trying
to think of their names.

115
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:03,164
Tony Malone and his sister, Tia.
A couple of weirdos!

116
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,841
Suppose somebody else walked in?

117
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:51,479
Everybody knocks.
Pine Woods rules!

118
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,523
Look.

119
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:59,699
Maybe it happened when Winkie
knocked it out of Truck's hands.

120
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:01,784
Can you fix it?

121
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,416
It's a map!

122
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:11,756
- Stony Creek?
- Misty Valley?

123
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,989
It's funny, Tia.

124
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,536
Every once in a while
you get that look on your face,

125
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,207
like you're remembering something.

126
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:40,837
I kind of do,
but then I forget again.

127
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:47,305
It's not someplace big
like a state or a country,

128
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:52,478
but more like a road map -
I just don't know where.

129
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:58,027
When I can figure out
where this place is, we'll go there.

130
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:03,409
Tony, what were you drawing?

131
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,663
It's where those dogs are.

132
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:11,170
- They're barking now.
- I know. I heard them,

133
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:14,591
and then I began
to visualise this castle.

134
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:18,931
Tony, you can only visualise places
we know something about!

135
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:23,980
Or places we're gonna be at.

136
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:28,735
I was drawing a place
we're going to.

137
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:36,538
Soon, Tony. We're going there soon
and I'm afraid!

138
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:03,575
Since the Malones lived in a village,

139
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:07,330
it was easy to find people
who knew the two children.

140
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:12,086
These insights,
these sixth sense incidents -

141
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:16,842
the postman, the school teacher,
the woman who lost her parakeet -

142
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:22,225
how do I know these are not figments
of your very fine imagination?

143
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,478
I have sworn affidavits.

144
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:29,693
People lie very easily. The very
young can deceive the very wise.

145
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,364
I'm not lying.

146
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:37,454
If I'm in any way disappointed
in this Tony and Tia,

147
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,790
you are through here, Deranian.

148
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,043
Yes.

149
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,296
I understand.

150
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:49,971
Then, bring them here. You say they
have no family - well, now they do.

151
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:53,058
You are their uncle,
do you understand?

152
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,770
Perfectly.

153
00:18:55,937 --> 00:19:00,777
Alter records. Forge documents.
Provide proper papers.

154
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:05,157
I will back you
with every means at my disposal.

155
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,870
Just bring me the children!

156
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:11,417
There's no question,

157
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:15,297
considering these documents
your uncle has produced,

158
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:17,550
that he has custody of you.

159
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,512
The judge signed those papers
just today.

160
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,765
- Mr Deranian...
- Uncle Lucas.

161
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:26,187
- Better get used to it.
- Uncle Lucas,

162
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:30,525
did you tell Mrs Grindley
about the first time we saw you?

163
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:35,449
Yes, he did. The day the tow truck
ran into your uncle's car.

164
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,661
That was a lucky day for all of us!

165
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:43,251
You see, Tia, you look so much
like Mr Deranian's sister

166
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:46,964
that he's convinced
you both are her children.

167
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:53,014
My sister, your mother,
died six years ago.

168
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:56,853
If you have any doubts,

169
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,483
I can show you these documents
that prove he is your Uncle Lucas.

170
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,195
I won't have
to leave Winkie, will I?

171
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:07,993
He's very smart, and he knows
how to deal with dogs.

172
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,703
Did I mention dogs?

173
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:17,380
Well, thank you very much,
Mrs Grindley.

174
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:22,929
I'll see you out, Mr Deranian.
Children, don't forget your coats.

175
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,103
Do you have any feelings
about this Mr Deranian?

176
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,690
Only that he isn't our uncle.

177
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:33,486
Must we leave, Tony?

178
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:39,160
That's what these papers mean.
We haven't got a choice.

179
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:04,026
It's all right, Lorko. I'm just
bringing through the children.

180
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:19,631
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm allergic to cats.

181
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,093
Let us through.

182
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,080
<i>Those are the dogs we heard.</i>

183
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:58,389
<i>- There's the mansion.
- It's just the way you drew it!</i>

184
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:10,071
Uncle Lucas, what's "Ex-anthus"?

185
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,787
It's "Zanthus", Tony.
Mr Bolt calls his house "Xanthus".

186
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:18,291
Who's Mr Bolt?

187
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:23,464
He's my employer. And your host.

188
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:29,973
I have spacious apartments here,
and thanks to Mr Bolt's generosity,

189
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,102
they've been enlarged
and redecorated

190
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,440
to accommodate the two of you.

191
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:47,038
So this is your long-lost family!

192
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:50,792
You've a very beautiful niece,
Deranian,

193
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,463
and a most attractive nephew.

194
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,799
You are Tony and you are Tia!

195
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,891
Here!

196
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:06,814
Our favourite flavours!
Vanilla and strawberry!

197
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:09,360
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

198
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,613
After that long drive,

199
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:16,954
I'm sure you'd like to see
your new quarters. Come with me.

200
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,724
Wow! It's beautiful!

201
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:39,359
- Isn't it cute?
- I must be dreaming!

202
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,611
Tony, look at that!

203
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:48,579
Hey, look!

204
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:51,041
Oh, wow!

205
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:57,091
Look at these dolls
and stuffed animals!

206
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,225
Hey, Tony!

207
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:12,695
- When this is completed...
- There's more?

208
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:17,827
Yes! We haven't had time to install
the carousel or the gymnasium.

209
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:20,956
The tennis court
is being resurfaced.

210
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:23,543
Your riding lessons start tomorrow.

211
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:27,341
- Oh, wow!
- We love horses!

212
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,802
I forgot!

213
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:39,357
Winkie's private quarters.

214
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:48,452
I think he likes it!

215
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,667
They're really great.

216
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:56,797
- You still have school work.
- Your tutors arrive next week.

217
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:59,467
Where are the others?

218
00:25:00,718 --> 00:25:03,472
- Other kids?
- Neighbours, I mean.

219
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,853
There are no neighbours.
Look out of the window. Go on.

220
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:10,899
Look as far as you can see.

221
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,707
Mr Bolt owns everything in sight.

222
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:28,715
Well, I could see the sky.

223
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:39,855
I saddled him myself
because this is your first time out.

224
00:25:40,063 --> 00:25:44,194
Always mount a horse
on his left side because...

225
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:47,782
Tia, you'd better pay attention
or you'll be sorry.

226
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,869
That horse over there...

227
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:54,709
Thunderhead's never been broke.
I don't envy anyone who tries!

228
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,465
It should be ladies first,
but show Tia how easy it is.

229
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:03,804
A little filly the size
of your sister can get scared.

230
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:14,611
<i>Thunderhead, that's not nice!
My name's Tia.</i>

231
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:18,449
<i>I want to be your friend,
all right, Thunderhead?</i>

232
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:26,335
Tia, stay away from him!
Hold on!

233
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:37,183
<i>Good boy!</i>

234
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,121
I've never seen this in all my life!

235
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:24,622
Tia! Come here.

236
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:40,518
Why don't you try it
without your harmonica?

237
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:43,397
I forget how. Come to think of it,

238
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:47,945
you can do a lot of things I can't,
like working locks,

239
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:51,784
and the way you can talk to me
without moving your mouth.

240
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:54,204
Maybe it's because you're a girl.

241
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:12,921
That's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen!

242
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:16,719
Thank you. I'm having
more hidden cameras installed,

243
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:19,389
and as soon as I have
enough evidence,

244
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:22,143
I'll show the tapes to the children.

245
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:25,022
Good. If that doesn't put them
on my team,

246
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,985
we'll have to resort
to cruder methods.

247
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,046
Tia?

248
00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:46,509
Tia!

249
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,269
Tia, what's the matter?

250
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,234
Oh, everything. And nothing.

251
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:03,407
I mean, maybe it's because we've
gotten everything we've ever wanted,

252
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:05,493
more, even.

253
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:08,998
I don't know.

254
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:15,132
It doesn't leave us anything
to wish for, is that it?

255
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,384
I think so.

256
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:22,141
Tony, we've got to get out of here
before it's too late. Please!

257
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:27,523
- What do you see?
- Mr Bolt, and he's mean.

258
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:30,193
He's never going to let us go, Tony.

259
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:35,492
You're not always right about things
like this, and I think this time...

260
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:38,621
Well, this time...

261
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:43,795
You're right.

262
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:55,102
I've enjoyed this.

263
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:59,816
Tony, Tia, we should arrange it
so that you dine with me more often!

264
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:02,070
Thank you, Mr Bolt.

265
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,616
There's fine, stimulating
conversation.

266
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,996
However, let us dispense
with the kid gloves

267
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:12,751
and admit that you're
two remarkable children!

268
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,713
I really don't think you...

269
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,927
I don't care what you think!
If these youngsters are psychic,

270
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,681
they've begun to see
through us by now!

271
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,684
Don't lay all...

272
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,021
You have power! I've seen it,

273
00:32:28,188 --> 00:32:32,653
though I don't mean to ridicule
those gifts of yours as others do.

274
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:37,243
- I revere them. Do you believe me?
- What power do you mean?

275
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,039
<i>He knows, Tony.
He knows all about us!</i>

276
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:43,209
What do you mean, Mr Bolt?

277
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:46,839
What you did with Thunderhead
and the marionettes,

278
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:50,385
and the dozens of things
I've seen on my TV console.

279
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:55,934
I want to be able to understand
these powers, but I need your help.

280
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:58,563
You can make it possible!

281
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:03,820
You could walk across a field and
tell where there's oil beneath it!

282
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:07,033
You could foresee revolution,
disaster!

283
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:10,662
Please, Mr Bolt, you're too excited.

284
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:13,333
You're going to make yourself sick!

285
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,586
You should go right to bed, sir.

286
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:20,593
Yes.

287
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:24,306
Yes, I will.

288
00:33:24,514 --> 00:33:29,688
Anything. Anything in this world
you ask me for, I'll bring you.

289
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:32,108
Just never leave me!

290
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:35,446
Not another word. Into bed.

291
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:41,245
Uncle Lucas, you look like you
could use some extra sleep yourself.

292
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:03,359
You heard what he said. He wants
to learn all the things we know!

293
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:08,282
We couldn't teach him,
even if we wanted to!

294
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:12,287
We don't know
why we do all these things.

295
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:14,666
We don't know how it all started.

296
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,344
Tony, we've got to get out of here,
please!

297
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:35,768
But to what, Tia? Where do we go?
Not to mention how?

298
00:34:36,854 --> 00:34:38,898
The map.

299
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:41,443
<i>- Mr Bolt.
- Listen!</i>

300
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:44,155
<i>Don't lay all your cards
on the table!</i>

301
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:48,661
<i>They're cunning. I don't
know the full extent of their power.</i>

302
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:50,873
Here they could escape,

303
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:54,669
but the chalet is an island
in the sea of blinding snow.

304
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,132
They'll never escape from there!

305
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,011
Nutty as a fruitcake!

306
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:04,725
You see? We have to get out of here!

307
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:09,063
I know, but there's that high fence
and the guards and...

308
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:11,317
Children...

309
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:17,992
...finish your ice-creams
and I'll show you to your bedrooms.

310
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:29,466
<i>He's coming.</i>

311
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,688
Come on!

312
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:48,446
So far so good.

313
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,742
Come on!

314
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:42,311
Those dogs will ruin all my plans!

315
00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:47,276
What do you mean it's too late?!

316
00:37:54,912 --> 00:37:57,081
<i>- Now!
- Dogs, stay!</i>

317
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:59,751
<i>Stay!</i>

318
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:05,092
<i>Good dogs! There's some
very bad men after us.</i>

319
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:08,179
<i>Go get 'em!</i>

320
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:19,987
There's still the main gate.

321
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:24,118
They're not gonna stop chasing us.
Call Thunderhead.

322
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:27,330
<i>Thunderhead,
remember what I told you?</i>

323
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:34,006
<i>We're at the gate now.</i>

324
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,320
- Lorko's on that lever!
- I'll help!

325
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:31,376
Winkie! Winkie!

326
00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:41,931
Find them! I don't care how!

327
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,688
Chase 'em on a magic carpet if you
have to, but I want those kids back!

328
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,993
They rode out of here!

329
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:01,917
They're quite a challenge.

330
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:06,673
I will not rest until I get those
children back and neither will you!

331
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:11,430
I'm a vengeful man, Deranian.
I don't make idle threats!

332
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:15,936
Find them!

333
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,544
You'll be all right here, big fella.

334
00:40:34,753 --> 00:40:36,797
Thank you, Thunderhead.

335
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:46,852
<i>We'll miss you, Thunderhead.</i>

336
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:59,620
Those sirens are for us.
We gotta keep moving. Come on!

337
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,795
They're getting closer.

338
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:17,560
Looks like you're taking
a mighty long trip, friend.

339
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,191
Yeah, I figured to drive
all over the United States.

340
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,153
Well, a covered wagon
pulling out of St Joe

341
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:28,742
didn't take near as much supplies
as you got here, Mr O'Day!

342
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:31,997
You're sure
one well-informed man, aren't ya?

343
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:35,919
Now, could you hand me that
without straining yourself,

344
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:40,509
or are you tuckered out from
sticking your nose in my affairs?

345
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:54,570
We're looking for two children.
A boy and a girl. Runaways.

346
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:58,074
If I saw 'em,
I'd let 'em keep running,

347
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:02,121
as long as they're going
opposite to where I'm headed!

348
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:35,601
What do you know about that?
A drifter, huh?

349
00:43:37,396 --> 00:43:40,692
You're a friendly little fella,
aren't ya?

350
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,654
I got some canned tuna for you!

351
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:56,337
Hey! What are you doing here
in my...?

352
00:43:58,007 --> 00:44:02,054
When I was loading supplies,
they were looking for two kids.

353
00:44:02,263 --> 00:44:05,100
A boy and a girl! You two!

354
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,689
Let's get one thing straight
here and now! I ain't no bus line,

355
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,193
and I ain't partial to hitchhikers!

356
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,863
And I don't like kids!

357
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:19,620
And I'm a mean, impatient, selfish
man, so get on your way! Out!

358
00:44:22,665 --> 00:44:25,044
Come on! Out! On your way!

359
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,932
Wait a minute. It ain't right
for no human being to go hungry.

360
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,520
I'll make you some breakfast
before you go.

361
00:44:39,522 --> 00:44:41,065
Don't get any ideas.

362
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:45,696
I got no patience with kids,
especially runaways!

363
00:44:45,905 --> 00:44:50,036
It's just the opposite, sir!
We're trying to find where home is.

364
00:44:51,746 --> 00:44:54,500
Excuse me,
but did you see a black cat?

365
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:59,090
Oh, yeah. Yours, huh?

366
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:02,886
Well, she's around somewhere.

367
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:07,476
Go on down to the water
and clean yourselves off.

368
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:20,285
He just likes to bellow a lot.
He's not really mean.

369
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:22,955
You got to be kidding!

370
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,316
Sorry, sir, no sign of'em.

371
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:47,655
A grocer loaded up a camper
around the time the kids got away.

372
00:45:47,864 --> 00:45:51,493
- They may have hidden in there.
- Did anyone spot a camper?

373
00:45:51,702 --> 00:45:53,496
I let one go through.

374
00:45:54,414 --> 00:46:00,005
The driver was alone, a big fella,
older guy, zip-up jacket, fair hair?

375
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:01,758
That's the one.

376
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:06,306
He was in a recreation vehicle,
heading north on Highway L38.

377
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,935
All right. North on Highway L38.

378
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:14,066
Now get out an APB
on an RV heading north on L38.

379
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:22,827
You see, Mr O'Day, we don't expect
to find our real parents,

380
00:46:23,037 --> 00:46:28,377
- but maybe someone who knew them.
- And can explain things to us.

381
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:32,424
And we gotta make sure Mr Bolt
and Deranian don't catch us.

382
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:37,098
Well, maybe that's the truth
and maybe it ain't,

383
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:39,850
but I'm not gonna complicate things.

384
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,271
I'm gonna be on my way.

385
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:53,786
What did I do with my keys?
I know I had 'em in my pock...

386
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:06,053
- I must have lost 'em out there.
- You should have a spare key, sir.

387
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:11,352
I know that, young lady.
I am not a losing man,

388
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:13,981
at least not till you showed up!

389
00:47:14,189 --> 00:47:17,110
Do you know a place
called Stony Creek?

390
00:47:17,277 --> 00:47:22,409
Stony Creek?
Yes, there's good fishing there.

391
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,331
If we get the motor started...

392
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:31,004
and clean up the back section,
will you take us there?

393
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:35,051
Oh, so that's it?

394
00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:40,516
You're nothing but a conniving pair
of undersized land pirates!

395
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:44,313
You swiped my keys
to make sure you'd get a ride!

396
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:46,566
Give me my keys.

397
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:51,907
Sir, the engine will start now.

398
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,612
All right.

399
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:26,453
You go back there and clean up.
Make everything ship-shape.

400
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:29,583
I'll see that you get to Stony Creek.

401
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,983
You just remembered something!

402
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,029
It has something to do
with the ocean.

403
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:55,869
Come on! Go on back. Clean up.
Let's get on the way!

404
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:45,350
Sure is a nice day!

405
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:48,646
Not with the prices
you're charging for gas!

406
00:49:57,533 --> 00:50:01,079
Keep still. This fella's
acting mighty peculiar.

407
00:50:01,288 --> 00:50:04,375
- Nobody could know we're with you.
- Maybe not.

408
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,632
You'll be out of my hair by tomorrow
once we get to Stony Creek.

409
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:11,219
- How much?
- Ten dollars even.

410
00:50:11,427 --> 00:50:13,680
Ten. There you are.

411
00:50:39,173 --> 00:50:42,094
Mr O'Day,
I think you bought too much.

412
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:46,934
Winkie can't drink four quarts
of milk between now and tomorrow!

413
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:51,356
If you weren't joshing me about
Aristotle Bolt being after you,

414
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:55,154
we might be together
longer than we planned.

415
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:58,700
He's a powerful man, too power...

416
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:05,333
Motorcycle cop!

417
00:51:09,172 --> 00:51:11,216
That attendant at the gas station!

418
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:13,720
You won't get in trouble, will you?

419
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:16,265
It's not me he's after!

420
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:41,671
On second thoughts,
I might not drop you off too soon.

421
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:45,801
I might get an honest day's work
out of you! Take you fishing!

422
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:53,020
Deep sea fishing. Pit you
against half a ton of blue marlin!

423
00:53:03,993 --> 00:53:06,914
Tia, what are you thinking about?

424
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,752
About before.
It had to do with fishing.

425
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,425
- With Daddy Malone?
- No...

426
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:18,304
But we were on a boat.

427
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:20,933
A trawler...

428
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,603
...like Daddy Malone had.

429
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:26,815
That's all I remember.

430
00:53:27,816 --> 00:53:31,948
Every lawman in the county
is probably looking for this camper.

431
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:43,672
Here you are. Hot chocolate.

432
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,092
Thank you.

433
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,847
What's that you have there?

434
00:53:51,015 --> 00:53:52,559
My star case.

435
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:56,063
Look at what we found
in the secret compartment.

436
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,067
- You see where Stony Creek is?
- Yes.

437
00:53:59,234 --> 00:54:03,740
There's a path that leads
away from it up into some mountains.

438
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:08,581
We think maybe that's where we come
from, somewhere in those mountains.

439
00:54:10,082 --> 00:54:15,965
No, I don't think it was that way.
Not exactly.

440
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,621
- There was an accident.
- Well, go on!

441
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:41,959
I... It's gone.

442
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:45,881
- What kind of an accident?
- I don't know.

443
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:48,968
- In a car?
- No.

444
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:54,601
On the ocean. And someone
helped me save my star case.

445
00:54:54,768 --> 00:54:58,690
- Well, who?
- Whoever put the map in the case

446
00:54:58,857 --> 00:55:03,780
hid it so well, it took you
all these years to find it.

447
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:07,702
That's right, Mr O'Day.
Why would anybody do that?

448
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:11,332
I don't know. Maybe...

449
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:16,005
Maybe waiting for you to get
old enough to do something about it.

450
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:21,053
- Like now!
- Very peculiar, huh?

451
00:55:22,264 --> 00:55:24,642
I wonder...

452
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:28,855
I wonder how I'd handle you kids
if you were mine?

453
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:34,905
Maybe that's why I never married!

454
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:39,203
But, Mr O'Day, you were married.

455
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:43,542
What?

456
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:49,091
A long time ago. She was so pretty!
And you had a little house.

457
00:55:49,884 --> 00:55:52,847
Yeah! I can see it!

458
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:57,144
It was white, with yellow shutters.

459
00:55:57,311 --> 00:56:00,356
There was a big elm branch
over the whole roof.

460
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:04,446
Tony knows about people.
He can see places they've been.

461
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,245
What else?

462
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:14,835
Your wife died a few months after
you were married. You were so sad.

463
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:21,344
You swore you'd never give your love
to another woman or to anyone,

464
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,056
and you never have.

465
00:56:29,313 --> 00:56:31,398
I'm sorry, Mr O'Day.

466
00:56:31,565 --> 00:56:36,197
The name's Jason! You know so much
about me, you might as well use it.

467
00:56:36,364 --> 00:56:38,158
Jason, you understand?

468
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:40,370
I like the name Jason.

469
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:44,208
We didn't mean
to make you sad, Jason.

470
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:59,944
Well, come on!
Are we gonna dawdle here all night?

471
00:57:00,111 --> 00:57:03,074
Let's clean up here
and get some sack time in.

472
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,580
We'll pull out of here
a couple of hours before sun-up.

473
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:16,717
They're going to Longview,
do you understand?

474
00:57:16,884 --> 00:57:21,641
Mr Deranian, $ 1,000 reward
speaks mighty clear in these parts.

475
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:24,019
You can count on me!

476
00:57:24,186 --> 00:57:27,941
<i>- Yes, I'll do that, Sheriff.
- It's been a pleasure!</i>

477
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:35,034
A real pleasure!

478
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:55,937
Ubermann! Over there.

479
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,291
This time, no mistake.

480
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,492
Now, listen close.
We're coming into Longview.

481
00:59:57,658 --> 01:00:02,081
My brother's house is two miles
outside of town, up the north road.

482
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:04,626
His name is Hiram O'Day.

483
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:10,050
There's a car behind us, Jason!

484
01:00:10,217 --> 01:00:14,932
In Longview, I'll find a place to
make a fast turn and a quick stop.

485
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:19,187
You two jump out the side door
and hide. You got that?

486
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:21,690
Sure, Jason. You watch Winkie.

487
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:23,944
Yeah, I'll keep going.

488
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:27,698
If luck is with us,
Deranian and his pal will follow me.

489
01:00:27,907 --> 01:00:29,952
You wait till he gets past.

490
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,914
Then we'll head
for your brother's house.

491
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:35,126
Hiram O'Day.

492
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:37,921
Don't lose him.

493
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:32,912
Well, now! Welcome to Longview!

494
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:50,019
6.10 a.m. OK, let's have your names.

495
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:53,440
- Tony Castaway.
- Tia Casta...

496
01:01:56,903 --> 01:02:00,449
"Castaway"?
That's no name, it's a word.

497
01:02:00,658 --> 01:02:04,622
Your legal name is "Malone"
and don't kid me about that.

498
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:12,382
I think I'll let you see
what lying to the law will get ya!

499
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:20,017
Come on.

500
01:02:32,785 --> 01:02:34,829
In you go.

501
01:03:02,158 --> 01:03:07,123
Tony, I've been thinking about
why we said our name was "Castaway".

502
01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:11,630
It might have something to do
with us speaking another language

503
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:13,882
when the Malones took us in.

504
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,593
Another language?

505
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,971
That's why we didn't talk.

506
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:21,601
You mean, we had to learn English?

507
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:25,397
We spoke a funny kind of language.

508
01:03:26,107 --> 01:03:29,529
- Uncle Bene spoke it to us.
- Who's Uncle Bene?

509
01:03:44,047 --> 01:03:50,264
- I think he died. Drowned.
- What did he look like?

510
01:03:51,974 --> 01:03:54,894
He had white hair...

511
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:57,439
<i>We don't want no panic.</i>

512
01:03:57,648 --> 01:04:01,237
<i>Well, Mr Deranian's on his way.</i>

513
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,074
<i>I'll be home if you need me.</i>

514
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:07,120
We've got to think of something fast!

515
01:04:14,755 --> 01:04:17,676
Hey, Tony, look!

516
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:29,400
Tony, that bear looks so unhappy!

517
01:04:34,031 --> 01:04:36,493
Tia, we need my harmonica.

518
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,030
Now, open the cell door.

519
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:28,021
When I get the star case,
you run to the edge of the woods.

520
01:05:28,188 --> 01:05:30,065
After I've freed the bear.

521
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:32,944
How can we get any place
with a big bear?!

522
01:05:33,111 --> 01:05:37,325
- He's counting on me!
- But this is an emergency!

523
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:42,541
We have to get past the sheriff.
Why don't you think about that?

524
01:07:35,444 --> 01:07:37,529
Get off me!

525
01:08:42,631 --> 01:08:47,596
I hope we don't have to pass a zoo
before we get where we're going!

526
01:08:52,811 --> 01:08:57,818
I know what I saw, and I say
there's only one explanation!

527
01:08:57,985 --> 01:09:02,033
Those two kids are witches
and they're from Witch Mountain!

528
01:09:04,452 --> 01:09:09,500
Arm yourselves
and divvy up into hunting groups!

529
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:14,341
What you gonna do? Chase 'em
all the way to Witch Mountain?

530
01:09:15,258 --> 01:09:18,930
We'll stop 'em before they get there.

531
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:24,897
Now, listen close and I'll give you
the areas to cover.

532
01:09:25,064 --> 01:09:28,360
Those look like hunting parties.

533
01:09:34,826 --> 01:09:39,750
They got away, but we know
what they are - evil itself!

534
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:43,755
- We got to catch 'em!
- They're from Witch Mountain!

535
01:09:43,922 --> 01:09:46,259
We need more ammunition.

536
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:49,012
We'll get 'em, Mr Deranian.

537
01:09:52,308 --> 01:09:54,937
They've really got blood
in their eyes.

538
01:09:55,104 --> 01:09:58,693
There's no use trying
to reason with them now.

539
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,456
Security. This is Deranian.

540
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:15,256
I want a complete check
on a Jason O'Day.

541
01:10:27,815 --> 01:10:30,736
Tia, I know how you feel
about the bear,

542
01:10:30,903 --> 01:10:33,406
and I think he's real neat, too,

543
01:10:33,573 --> 01:10:36,619
but a lot of people
are gonna be looking for us,

544
01:10:36,785 --> 01:10:39,331
and he'll be safer on his own.

545
01:10:39,497 --> 01:10:43,629
Anyway, they might shoot him
just for the sport of it.

546
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:47,884
Look! He'll be safe there
until tonight.

547
01:10:48,051 --> 01:10:52,599
- He can move on when it's dark.
- You're right. I'll talk to him.

548
01:10:52,766 --> 01:10:56,646
<i>You be a good bear
and wait in that cave.</i>

549
01:10:59,775 --> 01:11:02,487
<i>We don't want anything
to happen to you.</i>

550
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:10,539
Tony, his feelings were hurt.

551
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:05,448
Watch it!

552
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:20,134
Jason!

553
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:26,350
Hunters are everywhere!
They think you're witches!

554
01:12:26,516 --> 01:12:31,272
My brother ain't home, but I'll get
you some food and you can rest.

555
01:12:37,113 --> 01:12:43,623
There's a brother. Hiram O'Day. 244,
Cayhill, just north of Longview.

556
01:12:44,415 --> 01:12:47,711
We can be there in 15 minutes.

557
01:12:56,306 --> 01:13:00,896
I still can't figure out why we both
came up with a name like "Castaway".

558
01:13:01,063 --> 01:13:04,943
I noticed that you two
are very smart for your years.

559
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,738
Do you know what a castaway is?

560
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:13,037
Sure. It's like being shipwrecked
and left on a desert island.

561
01:13:14,832 --> 01:13:19,964
I just remembered. "Castaway" is
the name of someone we have to see.

562
01:13:20,131 --> 01:13:24,553
That's funny.
I just remembered the same thing!

563
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,849
Suppose you two are castaways?

564
01:13:28,016 --> 01:13:31,229
Then it would fit things
Tia's been remembering!

565
01:13:31,396 --> 01:13:35,901
- Uh-huh.
- We were in some kind of wreck.

566
01:13:36,068 --> 01:13:40,658
- And we were in the sea!
- You mean like a boat sinking?

567
01:13:40,825 --> 01:13:45,373
I guess, but if it was a boat,
I don't remember where it came from.

568
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,756
We had an uncle. Uncle Bene.

569
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:54,594
He kept us afloat
and then he drowned.

570
01:13:56,388 --> 01:14:00,268
For a long time, we didn't
understand anything anyone said.

571
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:03,230
You must have come
from another country.

572
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:09,280
We won't know everything till we get
to the mountains above Stony Creek.

573
01:14:09,447 --> 01:14:13,536
- Like it shows on the map.
- Witch Mountain.

574
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:18,459
Hiram mentioned that place
to me in his letters.

575
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:23,216
He said some strangers settled
there, they kept to themselves,

576
01:14:23,383 --> 01:14:26,345
and nobody ever knew
where they came from.

577
01:14:26,512 --> 01:14:29,307
You think they might be your people?

578
01:14:29,474 --> 01:14:31,310
They must be!

579
01:14:37,902 --> 01:14:43,535
Security. Have you notified Mr Bolt
of our destination? Then do so.

580
01:15:02,936 --> 01:15:05,356
We just heard from Mr Deranian, sir.

581
01:15:05,523 --> 01:15:09,696
He's on his way to a Mr Hiram
O'Day's cabin, north of Longview.

582
01:15:09,863 --> 01:15:12,491
Don't just sit here! Get going!

583
01:15:13,701 --> 01:15:19,167
When Hiram gets home, he's gonna
find his cupboard is bare!

584
01:15:32,352 --> 01:15:35,105
Come on. The camper's out the back.

585
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:37,524
Tia!

586
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:42,323
<i>Can you hear me?
We need another favour.</i>

587
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:44,493
- Come on!
- Tia!

588
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:07,423
There's no way we can get by 'em
without their seeing us.

589
01:16:37,506 --> 01:16:43,431
I remember more. It wasn't just
Uncle Bene who died in the ocean.

590
01:16:43,597 --> 01:16:46,643
A lot of other people died, too.

591
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,440
And those people
that live here in these mountains,

592
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,738
all of us came from the same
country, but on different ships.

593
01:16:56,072 --> 01:17:01,121
You mean, yours sank
and the others made it to port?

594
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:07,588
But, Tony, it wasn't a country.
It was a place!

595
01:17:08,923 --> 01:17:12,344
Yeah. A place
that isn't there any more!

596
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:15,056
Castaways?

597
01:17:16,558 --> 01:17:20,105
That's why my people
call themselves that!

598
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:23,526
And this was the emblem
for where we used to live!

599
01:17:25,195 --> 01:17:29,284
Two stars?
I don't know no place named that.

600
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:32,705
- It wasn't called that.
- No...

601
01:17:32,872 --> 01:17:36,418
Two stars... because our world
had two suns!

602
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,755
Double stars!

603
01:17:39,507 --> 01:17:43,136
Another planet!
A whole other solar system!

604
01:17:45,473 --> 01:17:49,061
Then it wasn't a boat...

605
01:17:50,437 --> 01:17:52,315
...it was a spaceship.

606
01:17:54,902 --> 01:17:57,656
Our planet was dying.

607
01:17:57,823 --> 01:18:01,995
The only industry left was
the manufacturing of spaceships.

608
01:18:02,162 --> 01:18:03,831
Like ours.

609
01:18:03,997 --> 01:18:07,335
We had to find
another planet to live on.

610
01:18:07,502 --> 01:18:12,342
Then the other ships in your cluster
landed here in these mountains,

611
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:16,306
and yours didn't make it?

612
01:18:16,473 --> 01:18:21,604
I think we might be the only ones
in our spaceship to have survived.

613
01:19:11,176 --> 01:19:13,680
We lost them again.

614
01:19:14,806 --> 01:19:19,062
We're going south on Highway 211.
Why don't you search the north?

615
01:19:38,047 --> 01:19:41,676
Not too many people around,
are there?

616
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:44,764
"Misty Valley Cooperative"?

617
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:46,850
This is it.

618
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:04,707
Maybe they've gone out to lunch.

619
01:20:06,585 --> 01:20:09,214
We'll wait.

620
01:20:21,438 --> 01:20:25,987
Are you the Longview bunch
chasing after those two witch kids?

621
01:20:26,153 --> 01:20:30,033
That's right. I'm Cort.
Are you putting up the reward?

622
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:35,207
That's right,
except it's now $5,000.

623
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:40,589
But there's a catch.
I want those two children alive.

624
01:20:40,756 --> 01:20:45,262
I don't care about the old man. They
were in a camper headed this way.

625
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:50,185
- Sounds good, friend.
- Any idea where to look for them?

626
01:20:50,352 --> 01:20:56,027
Well, they're not around here.
Maybe the next town up the line?

627
01:20:57,779 --> 01:21:00,408
Stony Creek.

628
01:21:17,389 --> 01:21:21,645
Stony Creek?
We're changing course now.

629
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:34,871
They've sure had time enough
for a lunch break.

630
01:21:40,045 --> 01:21:43,716
It has something to do
with the phone book!

631
01:21:53,855 --> 01:21:57,110
Let me have another look
at that map.

632
01:22:05,413 --> 01:22:07,916
<i>Misty Valley Cooperative.</i>

633
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:12,005
I was calling the Castaway family
and I was wondering if...

634
01:22:12,171 --> 01:22:15,300
<i>Were you looking
for Mr Castaway?</i>

635
01:22:15,467 --> 01:22:17,429
Yes!

636
01:22:19,265 --> 01:22:21,810
Watch it! Here comes Deranian!

637
01:22:21,977 --> 01:22:24,439
<i>- Is this Tony?
- Yes.</i>

638
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:27,192
<i>- Is Tia with you?
- Yes. Who is this?</i>

639
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,197
<i>Thank the stars! We've been
searching for you for years!</i>

640
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:34,201
<i>Listen carefully.
Everything must time out.</i>

641
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:38,916
<i>Take the back door
and go to Mr O'Day's camper.</i>

642
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:54,562
<i>Children, we want to make sure
Mr Deranian doesn't lose you.</i>

643
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:58,193
<i>We have a plan that will stop them
pursuing you again.</i>

644
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,861
Come on!

645
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:04,368
Everything's all right.

646
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:07,830
You've got a funny idea
of what's all right!

647
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:12,212
Maybe Bolt can spot
the RV from the helicopter.

648
01:23:14,547 --> 01:23:17,051
Men! Come on!

649
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:44,255
We've got a fix on them, sir.
Robertson Canyon, headed north.

650
01:23:53,976 --> 01:23:59,233
How can he lose us in that monster
he's driving? Close in on them!

651
01:24:00,694 --> 01:24:03,197
He's not exactly crawling.

652
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:14,171
They're getting closer, Tony!

653
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:04,405
Good driving, Al!

654
01:25:04,571 --> 01:25:08,661
How did we wind up here?
Let's get out.

655
01:25:22,096 --> 01:25:23,973
<i>Very ingenious!</i>

656
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,770
<i>But remember we want Deranian
to see what's coming up.</i>

657
01:25:27,937 --> 01:25:29,981
I don't understand, sir.

658
01:25:30,148 --> 01:25:35,196
<i>We have something planned
that will convince Deranian and Bolt</i>

659
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:38,492
<i>that you're both
out of their reach for ever.</i>

660
01:27:00,293 --> 01:27:04,758
Deranian, I've spotted a route
that will let you cut ahead of them.

661
01:27:04,925 --> 01:27:07,554
<i>It's the second turn on the left.</i>

662
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,474
<i>I'll signal the others
not to follow you.</i>

663
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:12,601
<i>- Repeat, not.
- Understood.</i>

664
01:28:55,157 --> 01:28:58,704
- I don't believe it!
- It's what you call levitation.

665
01:28:58,871 --> 01:29:03,252
That ain't what I call it!
You two got powers beyond belief!

666
01:29:03,419 --> 01:29:07,883
We're not doing this. This is
something too powerful for us to do.

667
01:29:08,049 --> 01:29:11,470
Somebody else is making this happen.

668
01:30:23,032 --> 01:30:26,495
That thing's flying upside down!

669
01:30:27,997 --> 01:30:30,084
That's impossible!

670
01:30:31,043 --> 01:30:34,172
That kind of vehicle
can't fly upside down.

671
01:30:34,339 --> 01:30:36,967
It's not supposed to fly at all!

672
01:30:48,483 --> 01:30:51,904
They're not upside down, WE are!

673
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,602
The voice says
we should get out here and wait.

674
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:03,168
We'll never forget you, Jason.

675
01:32:04,086 --> 01:32:06,672
Would you take care of Winkie?

676
01:32:06,839 --> 01:32:09,218
Oh, no, Tia. Winkie's your cat.

677
01:32:09,385 --> 01:32:13,264
It wouldn't be right for her
to be with anybody else.

678
01:32:13,431 --> 01:32:15,518
It would make us happy.

679
01:32:15,684 --> 01:32:18,730
It sure would,
and Winkie would like it, too.

680
01:32:19,941 --> 01:32:24,363
Maybe we ought to ask Winkie
how she feels about that.

681
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:26,074
Winkie...

682
01:32:26,241 --> 01:32:31,289
...how do you feel about going
around with a crusty old man?

683
01:32:36,045 --> 01:32:38,799
Look...

684
01:32:38,966 --> 01:32:41,428
...if you don't mind,

685
01:32:41,594 --> 01:32:45,934
I'd like to plan
on remembering you two...

686
01:32:46,852 --> 01:32:49,439
...as if you were my kids.

687
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:54,779
The kids I never had.

688
01:33:13,236 --> 01:33:16,909
Uncle Bene!

689
01:33:20,997 --> 01:33:24,668
You all did so well!
Congratulations, Jason O'Day!

690
01:33:24,835 --> 01:33:28,383
You're a man of courage
and compassion.

691
01:33:28,549 --> 01:33:30,636
We thought you'd drowned.

692
01:33:30,803 --> 01:33:33,932
Well, if you know exactly
what to say to a shark,

693
01:33:34,099 --> 01:33:36,352
he can be very accommodating!

694
01:33:39,898 --> 01:33:42,902
Tia, you never forgot.

695
01:33:43,736 --> 01:33:45,823
You didn't lose the star case.

696
01:33:45,989 --> 01:33:48,368
We only found the map
a few days ago.

697
01:33:48,535 --> 01:33:52,665
I knew when you were old enough
to understand it, you'd find it.

698
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:58,047
It's good to know that there are
earthmen such as you, Mr O'Day.

699
01:33:58,214 --> 01:34:03,096
If the stars are willing, perhaps
the other children who survived

700
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,474
will find men equally as kind.

701
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:10,523
- There are more?
- Yes. All with star cases and maps.

702
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:13,777
So far, only Tia and Tony
have found the way.

703
01:34:20,828 --> 01:34:23,874
Now that I know what to keep
my eyes peeled for,

704
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:28,380
perhaps I could spot some
of these kids and bring them here.

705
01:34:31,134 --> 01:34:34,263
Deranian's car.

706
01:34:42,232 --> 01:34:46,739
I'll have to attend to Bolt's
helicopter. Stay and watch.

707
01:34:48,032 --> 01:34:51,787
You'll see how we came
into this world of yours!

708
01:35:45,233 --> 01:35:48,654
What?! Stop this thing!

709
01:36:07,388 --> 01:36:10,100
I'm all right!
Where are the children?

710
01:36:54,243 --> 01:36:58,999
I should have known there was more
than ESP with those two!

711
01:37:32,628 --> 01:37:35,841
Well, they're home now.
