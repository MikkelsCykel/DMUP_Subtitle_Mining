March 11.

2
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:30,417
Dear diary,
my husband of 18 years...

3
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,687
this week is being honored
by the city of Atlanta...

4
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,354
as the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year.

5
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,260
I am so proud of him.

6
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,856
He has worked so hard.

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,908
I wanna swing

8
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,346
Swing till daylight
with you

9
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,408
I wanna dance

10
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,284
Dance the whole night through

11
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,518
Where the beat-beat-beat
is jumping

12
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,822
And the crowd is feeling fine

13
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,295
Where the dance-dance-dances
are popping

14
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,458
Theirs are flowing like wine

15
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,833
I wanna swing

16
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,634
Swing till daylight with you

17
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,302
I wanna dance...

18
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,072
To look at us...

19
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,979
you would think
that we've got it all together.

20
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,482
But looks can be deceiving.

21
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,487
Some days are good
and I think he loves me.

22
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,489
Then other days...

23
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,923
I think he doesn't care.

24
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,654
Dancing till daylight

25
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,663
Just us two

26
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,323
Kicking up my heels...

27
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,663
I never thought
I'd see this day.

28
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,169
I was just saying
to my wife this morning...

29
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,671
that if I died and came back...

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,004
that I would want
to come back as me.

31
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,011
No, truly it is an honor...

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,277
to receive the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year Award.

33
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,443
It's especially
an honor because...

34
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,113
He is so into appearances.

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,282
What looks one way
on the outside...

36
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,485
can be a totally different
matter on the inside.

37
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,964
There is no way...
no way...

38
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,297
that I could have done
any of this...

39
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,735
without my wonderful wife
of 18 years.

40
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,145
I don't know this stranger
I sit next to.

41
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,987
All I know is that with
every dime and every case...

42
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,526
he has changed.

43
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,905
How about l...
run us a hot bath?

44
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,446
I left something at the office.

45
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,844
I have to go.

46
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,113
Who is she?

47
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:17,316
When you get a job
and pay one of these bills...

48
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,950
then you can ask me questions.

49
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,789
I am still your wife.

50
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,755
That's cute.

51
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:30,132
Charles...
I don't want to fight.

52
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,798
This is your night.
Let's just enjoy it.

53
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:38,139
Tell me what I need to do,
and I will do it.

54
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,907
You really want to know
what you ought to do?

55
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,754
Get the hell out of my car.

56
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,876
What a way
to start our anniversary.

57
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:48,971
Tell me...why do I love
that man so much?

58
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,982
Maybe if I could stop
thinking about...

59
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,984
how good things used to be...

60
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,021
I might be able to find
the strength to leave.

61
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,932
Hi, Sarah. How are you?

62
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,271
Hi, Mrs. McCarter.

63
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,606
Hey, Mrs. McCarter.

64
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,544
Kalvin, how are you?
How is Joanne?

65
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,582
-She's doing great.
-That's great.

66
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,947
-You doing all right?
-I'm wonderful. Thank you.

67
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,885
Listen, is he in?
Because I brought him, uh...

68
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,944
lunch.

69
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,887
Actually, I'm headed that way--

70
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,621
No, no. Please.
Thank you, though. Thank you.

71
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,219
Helen.

72
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,433
What, um...

73
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,701
Um...hi.
I'm Brenda Marcos.

74
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,503
How do you do?

75
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,144
Um...we got to go.

76
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,804
You ready, little fella?

77
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,179
It was nice to meet you.

78
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,781
Is that her?

79
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,518
Don't play games with me.
Tell me, Charles.

80
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,116
Is that her?

81
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,632
Thank you.

82
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,963
I'll see you at home.

83
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,950
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

84
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,120
What?

85
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,960
-What are you doing?
-Working.

86
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,296
Where are you going
with my things?

87
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:52,497
Lady, look...I'm just filling in
for my cousin because he's sick.

88
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,972
Somebody named Charles McCarter
or something like that...

89
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,134
rented this truck,
told me to load it up and wait.

90
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,472
So that's what I'm doing.

91
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,409
No. Wait. Wait.

92
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,950
Christina?

93
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,580
Christina.
Christina, there--

94
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,093
there is a man out there
putting my things in a truck.

95
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,594
What is going on?

96
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,597
Mr. McCarter asked me to pack
all your things this morning.

97
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,998
And all these clothes
are from the boutique.

98
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,301
I wish I had a man to do
something like this for me.

99
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,542
Happy anniversary.

100
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,738
-I have something to tell you.
-Your gift first.

101
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,081
Aren't you going to open it?
Charles, I have to admit...

102
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,144
I thought you forgot,
but I saw all the clothes...

103
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,749
in the closet
and...ta-da! Ha ha!

104
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,726
It's not exactly my taste,
but I love it.

105
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,023
Helen--

106
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,927
This one, it doesn't really
fit quite right, though.

107
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,727
I think I'm going to have
to get some alterations--

108
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,892
Helen.

109
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,731
You see how I keep
interrupting you?

110
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,930
Charles, I only want
to hear the good tonight.

111
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,667
OK?

112
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,214
I need to tell you something.

113
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,014
What is she doing here?

114
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,918
I asked her to come.

115
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,881
Charles, what is going on?

116
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,393
Is she wearing the dress
that I just picked out?

117
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,190
What?!

118
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,128
There's no easy way
to say this...

119
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,291
but our marriage
has run its course.

120
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,062
It's over.

121
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,126
What? What are you
trying to say?

122
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,138
I'm saying...
it's over.

123
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,366
Charles!

124
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,636
Helen,
don't act so surprised.

125
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,974
I mean, I haven't
touched you in a year.

126
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,478
I haven't...well...

127
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,538
I haven't been happy for years.

128
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,641
18 years, and you think
you can just come in here...

129
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,946
and end it like this?

130
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,251
Charles, what am I supposed
to do without you?

131
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,120
You're a bright girl.
You'll figure it out.

132
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,426
Charles...please.

133
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,433
-Oh, my God.
-Don't do this.

134
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,901
Please tell me you're not one of
those weak begging sisters.

135
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,201
Brenda, let me handle this.

136
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,274
You are not leaving.

137
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,681
No...I'm not leaving.

138
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,185
But you are.

139
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,118
There's a truck outside.

140
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,815
It's full of gas,
and I hired some guy...

141
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,653
to take you
anywhere you want to go.

142
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,784
I can't keep treating her
like this. And my children...

143
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,488
not seeing their daddy
every night.

144
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,792
I'm staying here and there--

145
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,196
Children?

146
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,670
Two boys. They need me.

147
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,173
Charles.

148
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,311
It's me.
How can you say this to me?

149
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,246
How can you do this to me?

150
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:28,480
Good-bye, Helen. Now,
be a lady and leave quietly.

151
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,317
-No.
-No?

152
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,482
You would've never had
any of this without me.

153
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,116
Now, you better
get up out of here...

154
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,629
-before I lose my temper.
-No!

155
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,096
No, I am not leaving!

156
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,657
-You what?
-No!

157
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,669
You're leaving, all right.

158
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,500
You're leaving. Go on.

159
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,335
Any way you want to do it.

160
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,511
Get up! Get up!

161
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,844
Aah! No! Charles! No!

162
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,153
Come on.

163
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,292
Huh? Come on.

164
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,463
What you doin'?

165
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,031
Get out of here! Get out!

166
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,799
Charles! Charles!

167
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,899
Charles!

168
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,530
Oh, what the hell
have they got me into?

169
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,285
Hey, look...

170
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,549
we've been driving
around for hours now.

171
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,592
I do have another job that
I have to be at in a few hours.

172
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,459
So there's got to be
someplace I can take you.

173
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,225
Take me where?

174
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:24,167
He has alienated me
from my entire family.

175
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,967
He made me put my mother
in a home bec--

176
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:34,510
Because she didn't fit
into his "American dream."

177
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,176
I don't have anyplace to go.

178
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,980
Lady, I'm really sorry
to hear about that...

179
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,315
but it's the middle
of the night--

180
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,414
-Just stop the truck!
-I'm trying to help you out.

181
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,721
-Just stop the truck!
-I'm not stopping the truck.

182
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,159
All you men are just alike!
You just think about yourselves!

183
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,992
You don't think about
anybody else but yourself!

184
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,827
Just stop the truck,
and I will drive myself...

185
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,491
where I have to!
Pull the truck over!

186
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,594
Hey! Don't grab the wheel!
Hey. Don't touch the wheel.

187
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,002
I'm stopping. I'm stopping.

188
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,472
-Then get out!
-We're in the middle of nowhere.

189
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,099
I don't care!
Get out of the car!

190
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,507
I'll drive myself!

191
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,273
You know what? Now I see
why you're going through...

192
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,938
what you're going through.

193
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,447
Oh, you go to hell!

194
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,211
Have a nice life.

195
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,951
Yeah, you're welcome!

196
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,747
Don't shoot! It's Helen...

197
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,114
your granddaughter!
Don't shoot!

198
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,482
What the hell? Girl!

199
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,885
I always open the door
this time of night shooting...

200
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,446
'cause there ain't nothing
but a crackhead...

201
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,355
or the police knocking
on your door this time of night.

202
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,688
What you doing here this late?

203
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,522
I was in the neighborhood and--

204
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,431
You were in the neighborhood?

205
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,799
I thought I'd come by
and say hi.

206
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,634
You live in a mansion
on the other side of town.

207
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,640
What the hell you doing
in the ghetto?

208
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,471
You ain't on that stuff, is you?

209
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,135
Is you over here trying
to buy some stuff?

210
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,406
I missed you.

211
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,607
Come by in the daylight here.
Don't come by--

212
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,050
Madea, please.

213
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,849
Come on in here.

214
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,148
Who that is at the door?

215
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,420
Shut up, Joe. I got this.

216
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,429
...I'm gonna have
to put my foot down.

217
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,261
Kunta Kinte put his foot down,
and it got chopped off.

218
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,802
Now shut the hell up
and go back to sleep.

219
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,790
I know I had some
cigarettes in this--

220
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:33,984
Harpo.

221
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,257
Harpo, who this woman?

222
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,127
Joe, go in that room
and take your medicine.

223
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,030
You know you crazy as hell
when you don't take it.

224
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,798
I say hell...no.

225
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,042
What the hell?

226
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,135
Look what you
done made me do!

227
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,509
Oh, hell!

228
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,480
Get the hell up.

229
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,642
You didn't come by yesterday.

230
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,652
You got to eat something
out there on them streets.

231
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,120
You got to be careful,
you hear?

232
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,852
Look at you. Lord help me.

233
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,520
You ain't got
no regular clothes, do you?

234
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,528
What?

235
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,690
Helen...hey.

236
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,795
Debrah?

237
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,930
Yeah, girl.

238
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,935
You gonna hug me?

239
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,477
Yeah.

240
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,285
So, how are you doing?

241
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,821
You look good. You look good.

242
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,323
Marrying that rich lawyer.

243
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,622
When we were kids, we both said
we'd get a rich man, right?

244
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,025
We both got lawyers.

245
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,587
Deb, what--
what's going on?

246
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,692
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't judge me.

247
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,332
Thank you. I got to go.

248
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,673
You take care of yourself
out there.

249
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,574
Lord.

250
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,206
You hungry?

251
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,080
I can't eat anything.

252
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,415
You need to eat something.

253
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,614
What happened to her?

254
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,784
Life.

255
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,019
Brian and the kids must
really be going through it.

256
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,530
They're doing all right.

257
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,395
But I want to talk about you.

258
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,094
I called Charles this morning...

259
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,636
and he told me,
before he hung up...

260
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,195
that you and him
is getting a divorce.

261
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,764
But what I can't seem
to figure out is why you here.

262
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,607
He put me out of the house.

263
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,704
-Who house?
-Our house.

264
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,147
Exactly. How the hell
a man gonna put a woman...

265
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,048
out of her own house?
He might've put me out...

266
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,484
but he was gonna
put me out of half.

267
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,986
I'm gonna go in
the other half of the house.

268
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,420
He wasn't puttin' me
out of all of it.

269
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,117
The house is in his name, Madea.

270
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,751
Lord have mercy.
That's how women get messed up.

271
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,991
Too busy out shopping when you
need to be checking the deed.

272
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,499
Whoo! That makes me mad, girl.

273
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,898
I don't have any rights
to the money.

274
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,266
No right?

275
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,062
I signed a prenup.

276
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,938
What the hell
you sign a prenup--

277
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,000
I ought to punch you
in the face.

278
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,739
Who the hell told you
to sign a renup?

279
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,111
He didn't have nothin'
when you married him!

280
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,911
Charles always knew
he'd be successful.

281
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,212
And he said to me...

282
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,412
"l want to know that
you're here for love."

283
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,512
And I didn't have a job.

284
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,079
So it's his money.

285
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,321
Is it? What was you doing
while he was working, honey?

286
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,420
Taking care of the house,
cooking and cleaning.

287
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,933
Exactly.
That sounds like a job to me.

288
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,696
Cooking and cleaning--
how long you do that?

289
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,363
18 years.

290
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,429
All right. OK.

291
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,941
18 years...

292
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,979
let's see how much he owes you.

293
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,281
18 years...

294
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,613
you've been cooking...

295
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,482
cleaning...

296
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,623
having sex with him
when he wanted.

297
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,489
-Was it good?
-No.

298
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,223
Major deduction.

299
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,730
And I didn't tell you
that he hit me.

300
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,314
Girl, that man
owes you 64 billion...

301
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,649
283 million, 974 trillion...

302
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,382
5 thousand...

303
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,755
and 20 dollars and 82 cents.

304
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,418
Now, you need to get your money.

305
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,554
-That'll never happen.
-You want to bet?

306
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,326
I can happen
one of two ways, honey.

307
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,493
You can get it from his
checking account voluntarily...

308
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,002
or his insurance policy.

309
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,733
Involuntary manslaughter.
Which one it's gonna be?

310
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,001
-Madea.
-Mm-mm.

311
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,010
I ain't gonna have this.
Come on.

312
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,013
-What? Where are we going?
-To your house.

313
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,015
Oh, no. The guard
will never let us in.

314
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,914
I said come on!

315
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,748
Mayday! Mayday!

316
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,831
Lord have mercy.

317
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,902
Get your stuff.

318
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,633
What the hell
is wrong with you?

319
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,140
These your clothes?

320
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,437
They're hers.

321
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,307
Oh, they're hers?

322
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,247
Who is, uh...
"Dol...say & Gab-anna?"

323
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,374
Who that is?

324
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,977
Dolce and Gabbana.
They're designers.

325
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,851
Oh. She a label ho.

326
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,993
$700 for a damn rag?

327
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,995
Just a rag.

328
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,497
Madea, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

329
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,826
This man left you...

330
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,532
for some old floozy.

331
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,045
Madea, what's wrong?

332
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:03,077
A wire hanger!

333
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,161
Rip it.

334
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,456
Rip it?

335
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,758
-Rip it.
-No, no.

336
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,423
Rip it!

337
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,330
-Rip it? Rip it!
-Rip it!

338
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,459
Rip it!

339
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,798
Rip it!

340
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,864
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,543
Rip it like this!
Get mad at it!

342
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,877
It'll make you feel better!
Rip it!

343
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,543
Rip it! Rip it!

344
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,642
Rip something!

345
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,711
-Rip it!
-Rip it!

346
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,346
Rip it real good. Rip it.

347
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,948
Wait a minute.
What's this gonna solve?

348
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,587
Nothing. It's just gonna
make you feel better.

349
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,826
-Rip it! Ha ha ha!
-Rip it!

350
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,667
This is for every black woman...

351
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,873
who ever had a problem
with a black man!

352
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,016
Goodness.

353
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,055
Calm down, girl.

354
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,290
I'm tired as hell.

355
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,763
OK.

356
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,893
I'm gonna go down
to the office.

357
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,839
I forgot some things.

358
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:33,173
OK...you go down
in the office...

359
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,236
because you forgot something.

360
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,476
Find me some oxygen.

361
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,383
And bring me some oxygen!

362
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,926
What are you doing in here?

363
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,552
Charles.

364
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,426
Are you stealing from me?

365
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,489
No. No, I just--

366
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,968
How did you get in here?
I changed the locks.

367
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,808
What the--who are you?

368
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,402
Who are you?

369
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,175
I'm the owner of this house.

370
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,875
Wrong answer.
My granddaughter Helen...

371
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,815
is the owner of this house.

372
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,445
You're the ho. You ain't
got no power or no deed.

373
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,785
Did you do this?
This is Vera Wang!

374
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,985
Who that is? She do nails?
I need to get my nails did.

375
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,119
That's it!
I'm calling the police!

376
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,993
I'm not scared of no popo.
Call the popo, ho.

377
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,260
Call the popo, ho!

378
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,894
Charles, please...

379
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,598
I don't have any money, and--

380
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,606
I tried to be nice to you,
didn't l?

381
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,807
Didn't l?

382
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,541
I'll just go.

383
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,175
You'll just go?

384
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,286
I'll just take it,
and I'll just go.

385
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,289
Oh, you'll just
take it and go, huh?

386
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,985
You're gonna take
my money and go?!

387
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,220
If I call the police, they're
gonna be here in ten minutes.

388
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,992
OK. Then that leaves me nine
to beat the hell out of you.

389
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,465
You think?
I know tae kwon do.

390
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,470
And I know whoop your ass.
Come on. Bring it on.

391
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,529
You don't know me.
I'm from the projects.

392
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,541
Come on.
What the hell is your problem?

393
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,133
Come on. Shut up. Shut up!

394
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,477
Oh, hell no. Watch out.

395
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,879
Yeah, you keep running!

396
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,541
What?
Now you asking me questions?!

397
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,982
You begging now?

398
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,986
Oh, please do it.
Please hit her.

399
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,147
Please!
I want to see you do it.

400
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,520
What the hell's wrong with you?

401
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,320
Here, now, you bastard.
Put your hands on her.

402
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,156
Oh, my God! Don't hurt him!

403
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,752
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm gonna kill him.

404
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,126
Putting his hand
on my granddaughter.

405
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,824
I'm calling the police.

406
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,833
You call the police, so they can
see how you done hit her.

407
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,993
No, just get out.

408
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,436
Charles, I have been nothing but
a good woman and wife to you.

409
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,440
I don't deserve this.

410
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,205
You will reap what you sow.

411
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,269
Keep your money.

412
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,076
You crazy as hell.

413
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,117
Just leave it.

414
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,948
I might leave some of it.

415
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,581
It was this that made you
the evil bastard that you are.

416
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,749
Get out.

417
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,190
Here, now, the way I see it...

418
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,727
half of everything in this house
belongs to her...

419
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,228
and I ain't leaving here
till she get it.

420
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,628
-She'll never see it.
-What did he say?

421
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,257
Come on, Madea. Let's go.

422
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,562
That's right. Go.

423
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,466
Give me 5 minutes with her
in the bathroom, please.

424
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,129
Madea, let's go.

425
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,571
OK. Oh, yeah. I'm leaving.

426
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,640
It's just a matter of time...

427
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,309
before he does
the same thing to you.

428
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,047
Never. I could never be you.

429
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,090
I'm a woman who knows
how to get and keep her man!

430
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,790
What's that?

431
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,089
Madea...

432
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,789
Half of everything
in here belongs to her.

433
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,695
Which half do you want?
Do you want this half...

434
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,495
or do you want this half?

435
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,498
Madea.

436
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,073
Your Honor,
case number 456790--

437
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,813
the People versus Mabel Simmons
and Helen McCarter.

438
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,287
Criminal trespassing,
reckless endangerment...

439
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,755
criminal possession
of a handgun...

440
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,189
assault with a deadly weapon...

441
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,126
What are you
walking so fast for?

442
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,163
Suspended license,
expired registration...

443
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,189
reckless driving,
and a broken taillight.

444
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,963
Girl, I know that ain't
who I think it is.

445
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:29,496
I know you didn't say
Mabel Simmons. Madea?

446
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,508
How are you doing,
Judge Mablean?

447
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,602
It's good to see you.
Your hair is pretty, girl.

448
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,374
Look at you.
You're looking good.

449
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,006
How you been?

450
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,380
You're still at it?

451
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,884
This ain't even my fault.
What had happened was--

452
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,648
Save it.
Who's here for the defense?

453
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,314
Brian Simmons here on behalf...

454
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,255
of Mrs. McCarter and
Mrs. Simmons, your Honor.

455
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,520
-Brian?
-How you doing, Judge Ephriam?

456
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,154
I'm getting tired
of seeing your aunt.

457
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,460
I'm tired of seeing you.

458
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,758
It won't happen again.

459
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,235
Yeah, I bet.

460
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,829
Bail is set at $5,000
for Miss McCarter...

461
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,069
property or cash.
But as for you, Madea...

462
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,611
I'm placing you
under house arrest.

463
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,408
You ain't putting me
on no house arrest, honey.

464
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,778
I ain't fi'n
to to deal with that.

465
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,340
It's either that or prison.
What's your choice?

466
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,079
I'll take the house arrest.

467
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,519
Bailiff, call the next case.

468
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,423
The city of Atlanta
versus Bobby Brown.

469
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,051
What is this,
repeat-offender day?

470
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,791
Bobby! Bobby, I love you!
Sit down, Miss Houston.

471
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,471
-OK, you like hot sauce?
-Put that lid down!

472
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,676
What the hell?
How the hell you do that?

473
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,449
You don't know
what we're playing?

474
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,155
Hey, Daddy.

475
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,889
I see you got Thelma and Louise
out of jail.

476
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,590
Yeah, I did. Hey, stop running.

477
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,963
Stop running.
Say hi to your aunt Helen.

478
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,467
-Hi.
-Hi.

479
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,630
That's your son. Tiffany.

480
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,004
-My God. How old is she now?
-She'll be twelve tomorrow.

481
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,565
Hey, baby. How you doing?

482
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,306
-Can l?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,972
So...

484
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,516
I saw Debrah.

485
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,217
I didn't know she was so bad.

486
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,819
Yeah. She took it pretty hard
when you left.

487
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,728
Charles wanted us
to move away from anything...

488
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,996
that reminded him of the past,
and why I let him do that...

489
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,594
Debrah and I were thick
as thieves growing up, huh?

490
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,334
Yeah, you were.

491
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,672
I'll tell you what.
Y'all about to be set.

492
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,335
What you got? Oh, hell.

493
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,346
Y'all don't know nothing
about playing no cards.

494
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,847
I'm gonna take mine and git.

495
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,507
I could have spent my money
in a better place.

496
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,812
Did you hear me, John?

497
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,218
We gonna play, or we gonna talk?

498
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,688
Joe, let me get some.

499
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,790
That's some good stuff.

500
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,198
You want some, John?

501
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,630
I guess not.

502
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,467
Joe, let me get some.

503
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,632
Last time we gave you
some of this stuff, Mildred...

504
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,300
we had to call the popo on you.

505
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,536
We had to call the ambulance
and everything.

506
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,976
You went crazy as hell.

507
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,013
You ain't supposed to smoke this
when you're on lithium.

508
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,673
I'm all right.

509
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,082
All right. Don't wet up my butt,
get the lipstick all over it.

510
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,484
You act crazy if you want to.
Whose play is it?

511
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,681
Play something.
Play something.

512
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,317
Brian, can you handle
my divorce?

513
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,088
You don't even have to ask.

514
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,496
I always thought that
if I did all I could...

515
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,558
God would bless my marriage.

516
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,366
It takes a lot more
than you doing all you can.

517
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,838
And who's to say that
this is not your blessing?

518
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,500
You know, sometimes
we hold onto the things...

519
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,271
that God himself
is trying to tear away.

520
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,538
It's not that easy.

521
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,341
You know women. We love hard.

522
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,814
-And men don't?
-Not like a woman.

523
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,510
I don't know
if I agree with that.

524
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,950
We don't love as easy...

525
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,612
but when we love,
we love just as hard.

526
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,349
You don't see men
getting themselves...

527
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,789
in situations like mine.

528
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,623
The mother of my kids
is a junkie...

529
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,263
and I love her.

530
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,425
That's a tough situation.

531
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,799
Yeah. I look at Tiff--

532
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,237
she is so much like her.
She wants to sing.

533
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,809
I can't let her do that.

534
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,435
She's not Debrah.

535
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,980
Tell that to my heart.

536
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,081
Orlando. O-dawg,
what's going on, man?

537
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,746
Big Brian, what's up, man?

538
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,482
Y'all got it smelling
real right around here.

539
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,955
That's my deal, man.
That's my deal.

540
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,753
Hey, I want to introduce
you to somebody.

541
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,989
This is my cousin Helen.
Helen, this is Orlando.

542
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,093
Did I miss something?
You two know each other?

543
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,896
This is the sweet young lady...

544
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,096
that threw me out
of a moving truck.

545
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,605
This is the crazy woman--

546
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,004
That's her.

547
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,667
This town is too small.

548
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,074
I think you owe me an apology.

549
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,805
I don't owe you anything.

550
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,006
I was just trying
to help you out the other night.

551
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,016
Oh, yeah, right.
You're no good Samaritan.

552
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,780
He paid it. It's not like
you're some savior or something.

553
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,448
I'm gonna go...
check--do something.

554
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,953
Just another bitter
black woman, huh?

555
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,962
Excuse me?

556
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,466
I called you bitter, because
now every man you meet...

557
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,467
is gonna have to pay
for what he did.

558
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,093
You don't know
anything about me.

559
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,138
I know I watched a man
drag you out of a house...

560
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,673
and treat you like dirt.

561
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,438
Now there's another story
you can tell my cousin.

562
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,105
And I'm not bitter.
I'm mad as hell!

563
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,679
Turn that off up there.
Turn it off.

564
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,324
Shut up up there, all that
music.

565
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,825
How you doing, Henry Lee?

566
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,326
It's good to see y'all.

567
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,987
See, I'm on house arrest.

568
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,325
What is that?

569
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,831
You don't even
want to know, baby.

570
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,332
You don't even want to know.

571
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,232
Get somewhere and sit down
over there, little boy...

572
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,668
before I knock the hell
out of you. Where's your mama?

573
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,638
There you go.

574
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,311
-Mildred, you all right?
-Mm-hmm.

575
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,711
Mildred, don't you start
acting crazy.

576
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,080
Give me, give me. Here.
I'm gonna put this out.

577
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,779
You acting like you crazy.
I'll save that for later.

578
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,480
Your play, Mildred.

579
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,748
Play something.

580
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,828
Help! Somebody help me!

581
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,701
I'm out.

582
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,137
What happened to my eyes?

583
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,538
Everything is dark!

584
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,099
Open your eyes, and you might
be able to see something, fool.

585
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,907
Crawling all over me!
The rabbits!

586
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,880
The rabbits
are crawling all over me!

587
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,440
You ain't supposed to be
smoking that stuff, Mildred.

588
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,610
Rabbits!

589
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,454
Brian, please take her home
to her house.

590
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,853
I don't know why the hell
you come over here...

591
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,948
to my yard with that.

592
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,492
Get on, rabbit. Go, rabbit.

593
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,394
Go. Go, rabbit. Go.
OK, the rabbit's gone. OK?

594
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,930
All right. No more rabbits.

595
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,593
Hey, Mildred,
you forgot your rabbit.

596
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,437
Don't come back over here
no more, Mildred!

597
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,975
Don't come back over here!

598
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,135
I don't see no rabbit.

599
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,803
That was good stuff we had.

600
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,847
Is that a rab--
that's a rabbit!

601
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,049
Here. Use this.

602
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,148
What's this,
your way of apologizing?

603
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,285
Because if it is,
I'm not accepting it.

604
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,488
I'm sorry, mister.

605
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,500
Hey, hey.

606
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,163
My name's Orlando.

607
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,403
Orlando.

608
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,639
Willie, put some music on.
Something we can dance to.

609
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,476
You got it.

610
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,482
Let's turn this party up.
Y'all, come on. Dance.

611
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,074
Come on. Everybody come on.
Come on, Helen.

612
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,585
You and that young man.

613
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,314
Come on, young man. Come on.

614
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,271
March 19.

615
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,940
Dear diary...

616
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,474
I look out at my family
having fun and laughing...

617
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,784
and everything in me
is screaming for help.

618
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,189
How do I get to that place?

619
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,285
How?

620
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,200
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

621
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,365
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

622
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,342
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

623
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,685
Hello?

624
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,813
Chuck, this is Jamison.
Man, I need to talk to you.

625
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,221
You know what time it is?

626
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,724
I don't really care
what time it is.

627
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,024
I got a situation.
We need to talk now.

628
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,267
It went bad.

629
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,769
What are you talking about?

630
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,270
-I shot him.
-Who?

631
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,637
Some cop undercover
who was trying to sting me.

632
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,403
What does that
got to do with me?

633
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,273
Charles,
I need a lawyer and a judge.

634
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,711
Now, there is $300,000
in that bag.

635
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,543
That ought to
buy me both, right?

636
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,107
Look, I'm a legitimate
defense attorney...

637
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,348
and I would advise you
not to try and bribe a judge.

638
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,945
Look, man, I'm hot!

639
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,082
I don't have time for
all this legal stuff, man.

640
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:44,252
OK, look, you know I don't deal
with your kind anymore.

641
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,660
My kind? Brother,
before you started...

642
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,392
defending all
these rich white boys...

643
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,297
it was my kind
that got you down.

644
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,960
-I'm going home.
-Home?

645
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,266
Oh, how quickly we forget.

646
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,738
I ran so much coke
for you back in the day...

647
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,365
I paid for that house.

648
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,707
Now look here. I need you,
like you needed me...

649
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,306
back in the day
to get all you got.

650
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,080
No. What you need
is a lawyer...

651
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,451
and not to ever
call my house again.

652
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,604
You are my lawyer.

653
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,905
You know where to find me.

654
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,916
Lord Jesus. All of this
calamity in the world.

655
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,788
But I tell--

656
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,952
The paper's sad.
It's really sad.

657
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,019
You nasty as hell.

658
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,964
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

659
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,466
Here.

660
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,468
What?

661
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:00,936
You need a job.

662
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,269
Oh, Madea, I don't--

663
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,070
I don't know
how to do anything.

664
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,769
I got a job for you...

665
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,108
as soon as I get
some more Vaseline.

666
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,980
Joe, that is your--
that's your family.

667
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,745
That's your dead husband's
side of the family.

668
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,753
She ain't no kin to me.

669
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,984
I could introduce you to Harvey.
Maybe he'll help you out.

670
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,355
She ain't selling no dope, Joe.

671
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,417
If I had a bottle
of battery acid...

672
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,690
I would give you
a chemical peel...

673
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,392
just scrub all of that ugly
off of your face.

674
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,958
I know you're my brother...

675
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,470
and the only reason I'm
letting you stay in my house...

676
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,199
is to get your check.

677
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,036
But I can still
get your check...

678
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,508
if you come up missing.
Keep trying me.

679
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,169
But you're gonna end up
in the Chattahoochee river.

680
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,442
What you looking at?!

681
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,142
You ain't moving in here.

682
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,980
Next thing you know,
she'll be getting mail here.

683
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,986
Joe, leave that baby alone.

684
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,544
If their name
comes on the envelope...

685
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,146
that means they move
right the hell in.

686
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,657
Get out.

687
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,057
Get--get out.

688
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,688
Baby, take that newspaper...

689
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,062
and go on in the kitchen
and look for you a job.

690
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,464
And an apartment.

691
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,798
Look for an apartment
while you're in there.

692
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,497
You always messing
with somebody.

693
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,129
What the hell's wrong with you?

694
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,730
You're just grouchy as hell.
You been grouchy.

695
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,969
That's why Mommy and Daddy
didn't like you.

696
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,136
She ain't moving in here.

697
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,476
Ain't enough room in this house
for all of us here.

698
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,483
This ain't "Roots." These rooms
are barely big enough...

699
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,984
for you to turn around in.

700
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,815
Man, but you know,
you're just huge.

701
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,914
You big as a Buick.
You just fat as hell.

702
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,720
I watched you walk
down the hall the other day.

703
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,920
I thought somebody had put
a refrigerator on your butt.

704
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,485
You're huge. You're big.

705
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,622
And that's something
you'll never...

706
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,360
in your life hear a woman say.

707
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,137
Yes!

708
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,614
Thank you, Mrs. McCarter.

709
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,317
She's in her room.

710
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,754
Hi, Mama.

711
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,498
Hi.

712
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,631
I brought you some things.

713
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,169
Hey, baby. How you doing?

714
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,806
Oh. I'm doing OK.

715
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,749
Yeah.

716
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,417
They talked to me
about the bill here yesterday.

717
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,855
They call you?

718
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,120
Yes.

719
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,526
I'm gonna get that paid.

720
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,792
You know Charles
don't care nothing about me.

721
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,026
What makes you think
he's gonna pay it?

722
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,535
I talked to Madea.

723
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,970
I know what's going on.

724
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,910
I think I'm...

725
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,776
losing my mind, Mama.

726
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,849
He hurt me so bad.

727
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,818
He was my everything.

728
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,984
God is your everything.

729
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,324
Don't you know
he's a jealous god?

730
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,194
He don't want no man before him.

731
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,494
I don't even know
where to begin...

732
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,663
to pick up the pieces
of my life.

733
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,263
Lord have mercy.

734
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,945
I was 39 years old
when you were born.

735
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,779
I never ever dreamed
I'd have children.

736
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,444
And then here you come...

737
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,578
sweet bundle of joy.

738
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,823
But what did I do?

739
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,486
I think I shielded you
way too much.

740
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,258
Now you got to get out there...

741
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,361
try to stand
on your own two feet.

742
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,269
Oh, no, Mama.

743
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,968
I can't do that.
I'm not strong like you.

744
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,977
Sure you are.

745
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:46,915
You got the strength
God gave us women to survive.

746
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,782
You just ain't
tapped into it yet.

747
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,620
Come here.

748
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,958
Come on.

749
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,457
Come on now.

750
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,129
Oh...

751
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,441
just let it go.

752
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,445
Nothing wrong with
shedding a few tears.

753
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,640
It cleanses the soul.

754
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:24,621
You know, you need
to stop thinking...

755
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,452
about what you think
you lost...

756
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,459
and look forward
to what there is to gain.

757
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,495
It's a new life, baby.

758
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,396
It's right in front of you.

759
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,492
All you got to do
is reach out and grab it.

760
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:44,599
How do I do that, Mama? How?

761
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,903
By waking up every morning...

762
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,972
and thanking God that you did.

763
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,986
And then ask him to help you.

764
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:00,217
Just ask the savior to help you.

765
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,197
April 18.

766
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,038
Dear diary,
every day I wake up...

767
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,602
I take my mother's advice.

768
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,615
Most days, I don't want
to get out of bed...

769
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,947
but I do.

770
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:32,147
Some people say,
"One day at a time."

771
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,952
Seems too long for me.

772
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,791
Most days, all I can do
is moment to moment.

773
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,955
The good thing
about being this low...

774
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:46,162
is that there's
nowhere to go but up.

775
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,631
Hi. Can I get your order?

776
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:50,764
Hi.

777
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,473
OK, I'm gonna kill Brian.
Did he tell you I work here?

778
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,979
Hey, easy. Easy.

779
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,481
A man's got to eat, right?

780
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,609
What can I get for you?

781
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,745
How about a coffee
and a number four?

782
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,985
We don't have number fours
in this restaurant.

783
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,322
OK. How about just a coffee?

784
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,726
Coffee.

785
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,696
OK.

786
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,958
I like the new haircut...

787
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,333
a lot.

788
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,463
Thank you.

789
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,116
Oh, no matter what

790
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,778
You may be going through

791
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,788
Take it to the master

792
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,120
He'll see you right on through

793
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,455
I know Jesus, whoo!

794
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,154
Take it to him

795
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,289
You can leave it there

796
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,799
He will work it out

797
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,132
No matter what

798
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,468
You may be going through...

799
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,132
April 25.

800
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:02,645
Dear diary,
today was a bad day.

801
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,581
I got up and came to church
because I was so angry.

802
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,584
When I think
about all the blood...

803
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,586
and sweat and tears
I put into my marriage...

804
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,588
it makes me want to hate him.

805
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,351
Let me tell you something, boss.

806
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:18,258
I paid you a lot of money,
and that judge, he ain't down.

807
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,761
The judge had no choice...

808
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,593
but to allow the videotape
into evidence.

809
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,758
I told you
to make this go away.

810
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,098
Say it wasn't me,
I wasn't there.

811
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,763
How the hell do you
use self-defense?

812
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,272
You're on videotape.

813
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,773
And it will be
very hard to explain...

814
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,605
you not being there
at the time of the murder.

815
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,269
Self-defense is our only option.

816
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,472
Then put me on the stand.
I'll say it wasn't me.

817
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,105
Then all your priors
come into play.

818
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,310
Look, Mr. Jackson,
you have to let me work here.

819
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,752
Look, man, you can get me off,
make this go away.

820
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,345
Look, I said
I would do all I can.

821
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,448
Well, that better be
a hell of a lot, brother.

822
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,958
Or I will do all I can.

823
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:51,460
Wait a minute.
Are you threatening--

824
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,462
Ain't nobody talking to you.

825
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,465
I done paid you a lot of money.

826
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,127
You know how it is
on the streets, Chuck.

827
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,466
Brother don't do what he say.

828
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:05,406
However you and your homeys
settle your disputes...

829
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,909
this has to play out in court.

830
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,913
-If I go down, man--
-If you go down?

831
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,915
Kalvin, walk away.

832
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,450
Walk away.

833
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,925
Don't let this suit fool you.

834
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:27,930
I don't take too kindly
to threats, Mr. Jackson.

835
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:32,435
And I don't make
idle threats, Mr. McCarter.

836
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,130
I better get off.

837
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,942
May 12.

838
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,779
Dear diary...
