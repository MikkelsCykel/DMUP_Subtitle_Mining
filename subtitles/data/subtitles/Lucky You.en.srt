This is New Country 95.5,
country from the heart...

2
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:36,417
...sending out a big welcome
to all the hopefuls...

3
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:39,350
...for the 2003 World Series of Poker.

4
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,788
Here 's a George Jones classic
for all you players in the game of cards...

5
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,727
...or the game of love.

6
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:15,748
Evening.

7
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:18,751
One-fifty.

8
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,555
Brand new. Never been used.

9
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:23,790
I got three of them. One-fifty.

10
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,492
-It cost 500.
-1 50.

11
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,995
-I need three.
-Sorry.

12
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,438
You have three digital cameras.

13
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:39,377
-AII the same.
-Pretty much.

14
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:42,450
Well, here's what
you can do with four cameras...

15
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,109
...that you can't do with three.

16
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:48,946
You take two of the cameras,
you price them identically.

17
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:53,289
The third camera, you price a Iittle Iess.
The fourth camera, you price a Iittle higher.

18
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,455
Customer comes in
wanting to buy a camera.

19
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:59,193
Figures the Ieast expensive camera's
either a bargain...

20
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:01,132
...or there's something wrong with it.

21
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:05,070
But it gets him thinking.
It gets him talking to you.

22
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,540
In other words,
you've got him in the game.

23
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,172
Odds are, he doesn't take camera number
three because he reads it as defective.

24
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,817
But it pushes him towards cameras
one and two...

25
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:18,010
...which he already thinks
are a good deal...

26
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,679
...because of the higher price
of camera number four.

27
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,848
Or maybe he's
drawn to camera number four.

28
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,085
I mean,
why is this camera more expensive?

29
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,922
You tell him it's never been used.

30
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:30,088
You point out that cameras one
and two have never been used...

31
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:35,226
...the only difference is,
camera number four is still in the box.

32
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,737
Now, he does one of two things.

33
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:41,004
He either buys one of your cameras
at the regular price...

34
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,111
...which he now thinks is a bargain...

35
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,476
...or, he springs for the one in the box...

36
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:49,243
...because he plans to give it
to someone as a present...

37
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:51,717
...and he needs the box
so it Iooks new...

38
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,819
...and not Iike some camera
he just picked up at a pawn shop.

39
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,026
You're good.

40
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:04,155
So by purchasing this camera in its box...

41
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:07,735
...you increase the value
of the three cameras you already have.

42
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,969
You work this hard at your day job?

43
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:18,045
Only problem is,
my cameras all have boxes.

44
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,187
What?

45
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,648
I'II tell you what.

46
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:33,861
If you can show me your boxes,
I'II give you my camera for nothing.

47
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:37,397
But, if you can't,
you pay three bills for mine.

48
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:40,736
You're pretty sure of yourself.

49
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,432
You don't have the boxes, do you?

50
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:50,908
I'II give you the 1 50,
plus 50 for the entertainment...

51
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:52,513
...but that's as high as I go.

52
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,950
Done.

53
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,224
What about this?

54
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:10,861
What's it worth?

55
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,058
To me or to you?

56
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,726
Well, it's worth a Iot to me.
It was my mother's.

57
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,769
She used to take it off...

58
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,773
...and then one day my dad
took off with it to get some cash.

59
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,909
How did you get it?

60
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,972
I won it off him in a poker game.

61
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:28,443
It was too Iate
to do my mom any good, though.

62
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,519
Sorry to hear that.

63
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,178
PIain band. Nothing special.

64
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,790
I could give you a hundred,
you'II have your three.

65
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,395
-He told me it was worth more than that.
-So sell it back to him.

66
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:42,463
I'm not selling it to you.
I'II be back for it.

67
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,191
What's your name?

68
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,726
Huck.

69
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:52,804
Well, Huck, I'II give you another
buck and a half for the ring...

70
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:56,612
...and you have 1 20 days
to come back and see me.

71
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,005
Hey, Huck.

72
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,162
There'II be a seat available at
table four in just a few minutes.

73
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,923
-Thank you.
-Eight to call.

74
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,461
What time can you have it here?

75
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,295
AII right. If that's the best you can do.
Get it here as soon as you can.

76
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,706
Beating up on a whale.
Some real estate guy from FIorida.

77
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:13,508
I guess you could call that a tell.

78
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:16,174
He's stuck a quarter mil and change.

79
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm down
with the Iittle fish tonight, Tommy.

80
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,983
-Swimming with the guppies for awhile.
-Okay, kid. Good Iuck.

81
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,859
Three-Fifty.

82
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:34,332
Small blind. Big blind.
Sir, you wanna post?

83
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:35,903
Yeah.

84
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:45,113
-Water, Huck?
-Yeah, thanks.

85
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,911
I raise.

86
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,845
Well, Iet's raise it up, then.

87
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:54,487
-Fold.
-That's a good decision. You too.

88
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:57,023
AII very good decisions.
Especially you, water boy.

89
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,965
How do you Iike that river, water boy?

90
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:16,077
Sixteen is the bet.

91
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,173
It'II only hurt for a Iittle while.

92
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,917
Really.

93
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:29,480
You're betting Iike you have the eight
for the belly straight.

94
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,127
Or you might have caught
a third seven.

95
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,530
No matter how I Iook at it,
you probably got me beat.

96
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,364
Then again...

97
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:44,731
...maybe you don't.

98
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,437
It's raised to 32.

99
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:50,044
Thank you.

100
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,476
Screw it.

101
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,154
Never touch another player's cards.

102
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:08,422
Nothing. You raised me with nothing?

103
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,667
Sometimes nothing's enough.

104
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:17,863
-Let's Iine them up, please.
-Show cards, please.

105
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,302
Pair of queens.

106
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:24,472
Maverick. Jacks and queens.
Two pair is good, sir.

107
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:27,905
The winner.

108
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,714
Thank you.

109
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:39,122
Gentlemen. It's great to be alive, isn't it?

110
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,224
Raise.

111
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,483
Sometime today, sunshine.

112
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,545
You in a hurry?

113
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,380
PIaces to go? People to see?

114
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,720
Maybe.

115
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,393
Let's see if we can get you there
a Iittle faster, cowboy.

116
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,324
Raise.

117
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:22,729
Back at you.

118
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,207
Giddap.

119
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:43,551
Okay, it's eight, 1 0,000...

120
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,389
...two hundred and twenty-eight.
Do you want that in cash or chips?

121
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,329
Give me the ten in chips, Larita.

122
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,969
Robin, grab Huck's box for me, please.

123
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,074
-What time's your shift end?
-Not for another three hours.

124
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,937
My first bad beat tonight.

125
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:10,110
Get it over.

126
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:16,015
-What was that?
-Here you go. Here you go.

127
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:20,492
AII right, the over and under is three.
AII right, I got the under, who's got over?

128
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,361
-Hey, Huck. How you doing?
-Hey, Eddie.

129
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:26,126
Hey, three times over the net pays off,
five pays double.

130
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:29,135
-You want some of the action? Okay.
-No thanks, Eddie.

131
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:31,739
AII right, all right.
Who's got ponytail's side?

132
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:34,068
That's payday. That's payday.

133
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,535
Come on, you can do better than that.

134
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,083
Smell this, it's new.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,782
-Smells good, right?
-Yes.

136
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,691
But it's not cologne
or deodorant or anything...

137
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,656
...it's just me.

138
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,954
It's just Iike my natural--
I know it's weird--

139
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:57,327
Sorry. Time got away from me.

140
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:00,760
It happens.

141
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,336
I know, but I keep saying
it won't happen again.

142
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,133
But it does.

143
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,867
And I'm Iate.

144
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,406
So you guys are...?

145
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,650
Yeah.

146
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:21,314
-Nice to have met you.
-Nice to have met you.

147
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,918
Do you always intrude
on private conversations?

148
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,964
Well, it seemed Iike an intrusion
might be welcome.

149
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:31,963
So you're a mind reader?

150
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:37,094
Body. Your body Ianguage indicated
a certain Iack of enthusiasm.

151
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,039
You might have been wrong.

152
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
-Huck.
-Billie.

153
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,013
-New in town?
-No.

154
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,308
Really?

155
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,348
See, you are wrong
every once in a while.

156
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:51,452
Hey, sorry I'm Iate.

157
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,023
That's what he just said.

158
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:59,287
Yeah, but he's a poker player, Billie,
so you can't believe anything he says.

159
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:02,192
-Busted. Suzanne.
-How you doing, Huck?

160
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:05,697
-Great, now that I've met your friend.
-My sister.

161
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,829
-Your sister?
-My Iittle sister.

162
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,639
Little sister. Even better.

163
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,078
Ginger. Hey.

164
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,976
-Hey, Huck.
-Ginger.

165
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:23,914
This is my sister, Billie.
She just got in from Bakersfield.

166
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,721
-This is Gary.
-Hey, you work at the....

167
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,256
-At the Venetian. You're the gondola guy.
-That was Iast year.

168
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:35,261
I'm a Nubian slave at The Luxor now.

169
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,399
-We gotta go.
-Nice to meet you.

170
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,397
Nice to meet you.

171
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,130
-See you Saturday at the party?
-Yeah.

172
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,465
Hope you enjoy your visit.

173
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,766
Suzanne.

174
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,970
That was a fast withdrawal.

175
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,943
Yeah, well,
Huck's not one to waste any time.

176
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:54,412
Boy, you're up.

177
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:57,313
You're my sister,
there's no way I'm Ietting that happen.

178
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,310
Bad news?

179
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:02,981
There's quite a few
who would say it's a good time.

180
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:05,649
-Does that include you?
-No.

181
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,796
I had Huck's number pretty early on.

182
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:12,263
-What number is that?
-Hustle 1 0, commitment zero.

183
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,560
Maybe he hasn't found
what he's Iooking for.

184
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,639
Billie, no.
Don't even think about it.

185
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,707
Come on,
we've been through this before.

186
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:24,107
Some people don't wanna be fixed.

187
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:26,214
They Iike things just the way they are.

188
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,227
French toast. Bacon on the side.

189
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:49,701
Fruit. Strawberries only.
Hang on a second, Lucy.

190
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,432
Why don't you just go rest up a Iittle?
We never close.

191
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,098
No time Iike the present, Tommy.

192
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:56,801
Oh, I should've gotten
away from that.

193
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,238
-Hey, Huck.
-Hi, Huck.

194
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:02,509
-Have a seat.
-What's going on, Huck?

195
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,676
Fasten your seatbelts. Huck is here.

196
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:09,081
What's for breakfast?
And don't say "you are."

197
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,998
Eighty-six for Iow.

198
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,803
Eighty-seven.

199
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:26,666
-Ace wins for high.
-You win the whole pot.

200
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,309
Nice deck.

201
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,502
-Look who's here.
-Good morning, gentlemen.

202
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:32,613
-Well, he's back.
-Hey, good to see you.

203
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,375
-What's going on?
-Good to see you.

204
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,486
Big Buckle, good to see you.
Sammy, Chau.

205
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:41,714
-Good to see you.
-Michelle, my belle.

206
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:44,984
Oh, I've missed you, L.C.
You in town for the tournament?

207
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:49,722
Yeah, well, someone's gotta try
and stem the tide of those couch potatoes.

208
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:53,595
-Is there an empty seat?
-Right here between me and Chau.

209
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:55,927
Twenty thousand.

210
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,938
Couldn't go another World Series
without you, L.C.

211
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,134
So how was the south of France?

212
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,472
French.

213
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:07,138
They hate our politics,
but they Iove our games...

214
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:09,409
...I'm happy to say.

215
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:14,016
Yeah, Iooks Iike the kid
has got the jump on everybody.

216
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,213
He's really hot.

217
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:18,656
-What's new and different, kid?
-Your hair, for one thing.

218
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,990
Kid tries to bring out the worst in people.

219
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,660
As I get on in years, Iike all human beings,
I become acquainted with vanity.

220
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,601
How about you? Still blasting away?

221
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,207
Thousand to go.

222
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,980
Re-raise.

223
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,345
Nice to play with you again, kid.

224
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,608
What do you say, fellas?

225
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,879
Not a spectator sport.

226
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,599
Five thousand.

227
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,395
How deep are you?

228
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,039
Oh, I've got about eighteen thousand.

229
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,578
Okay.

230
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,376
I'm putting you all-in.

231
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,153
Well, I'm gonna have to call you, L.C...

232
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:23,689
...because my pretty Iadies
are just dying to step out.

233
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,522
Well, they'II be in good company.

234
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,224
Three Kings.

235
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,702
You son of a bitch.

236
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:37,405
You're the only man
I enjoy Iosing money to.

237
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,004
Loan me twenty, L.C.?

238
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,648
Is there anybody who doesn't owe you?

239
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,386
Just you, kid. Just you.

240
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,955
Raise you 60.

241
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,137
Eight thousand.

242
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,178
It's an interesting situation.

243
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,652
I had you sitting
with a medium pocket pair.

244
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:29,780
Nines wired, perhaps,
which would give you a set.

245
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,121
You had me figured for a straight draw.
Now, the question is:

246
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,887
Am I four to a flush, too?

247
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:38,055
With a pot this size,
I'II call you no matter what you raise.

248
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:42,602
The prudent thing would be
to just call, protect your chips...

249
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:45,740
...so you can play again, another day.

250
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:50,009
No, Prudence, the question is...

251
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:53,342
...you talking because you got
the diamonds, or because you don't?

252
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,479
You and I both know
what the book says you should do, kid.

253
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,914
Is that what you do now?

254
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:02,386
Just play by the book?
You might as well play online.

255
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,750
Raise.

256
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,155
I'm all-in.

257
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:09,263
You sure?
Now, you can pull it back if you want.

258
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:10,693
I'd bet more if I had it.

259
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,263
-You would?
-Yeah.

260
00:19:13,263 --> 00:19:15,426
I'II Iet you throw in
that charm of yours...

261
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,629
...that wedding ring
you're fond of carrying.

262
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:21,139
AIthough, I notice
you don't have it with you.

263
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,644
You're right, I don't.

264
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,581
But I'II put up the pawn ticket
that redeems it...

265
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:35,723
...against that wristwatch
you're wearing.

266
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:37,290
Yeah?

267
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,359
Okay. May I?

268
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,974
Get out of here.

269
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:58,179
A buck and a half?

270
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:00,941
You must have been up against it, kid.

271
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,578
I know that ring's worth a Iot more
than that to you.

272
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,279
And my watch is worth a Iot more
than that to me.

273
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,255
My father's 1 938 Bulova.

274
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:14,953
He wore it through the war,
but I'II take that bet.

275
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:16,256
Anybody mind?

276
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,194
Are you kidding? Come on.

277
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:20,062
This is between you two.

278
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:22,465
But we're happy to watch.

279
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,495
So insane.

280
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,337
I got you covered.

281
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:34,940
Possible flush...

282
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:38,617
...open-ended straight draw.

283
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,683
How are you fixed?

284
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,325
Pocket nines.

285
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:50,795
Imagine that.

286
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,966
Let's see the river.

287
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,303
Diamond flush, the winner.

288
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,536
That hurts.

289
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:03,507
Too bad, Huckleberry.

290
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:06,443
Sometimes it pays to be prudent.

291
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,287
Hey, Huck,
you know what your problem is?

292
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,519
You.

293
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,561
You're a great player.
You know the math.

294
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:25,393
You read your opponents
as well as anybody I've ever seen.

295
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:28,468
The trouble is you're a blaster.
You always have been.

296
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:29,797
Thanks for the analysis.

297
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:32,463
Listen, go for broke,
you're gonna wind up broke.

298
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:35,041
He drew Iucky.
I caught a case of second best.

299
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,268
You want sympathy...

300
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:39,380
...you'II find it between
shit and syphilis in the dictionary.

301
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,607
If you don't Ieave
your volatility at home...

302
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:44,513
-...you'II never be in the same Ieague--
-What do you want?

303
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,415
I want you to play with my money.

304
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:48,920
It'II even you out.
It'II make you a better player.

305
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,151
Your money's not involved,
your emotions will be Iess involved.

306
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:57,060
I'II stake you the ten grand buy-in
to the World Series, we split the winnings.

307
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,361
Let me ask you something,
how much do you weigh?

308
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,995
Oh, 1 50, give or take a Iittle.

309
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,936
How much you think I weigh?

310
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:11,802
-One-eighty-five.
-One-eighty-five.

311
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:14,574
Now you tell me,
how well do you think I'm gonna play...

312
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:18,117
...with an additional 1 50 pounds
on my back?

313
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:20,379
Give or take a Iittle.

314
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,262
That is an arbitration clause,
but it may not be binding here.

315
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,334
We may be in Iuck. Why don't
you read me paragraph two again...

316
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:36,027
...one more time from the top.

317
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:38,536
-Hope this isn't about money.
-You got any money?

318
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:40,641
It's good to see you, Huckster.

319
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,569
-1 -900-Mental.
-Is this a real psychologist?

320
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:46,908
Yes, all of our psychologists
are board certified and accredited.

321
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,277
-That's a relief, because--
-One moment, please.

322
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:50,782
Okay.

323
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,446
-1 -900-Defend. PIease hold.
-I have a--

324
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,117
Yes. This is Dr. Shuman.
May I ask your name?

325
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:00,556
Yeah, Toby.

326
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:02,196
What seems to be the problem?

327
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:04,355
-It's my girlfriend.
-Come on, Jack.

328
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:07,764
Turn into 1 -900-Loan, spot me a thousand
to get me going again.

329
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:09,733
What did I just tell you?

330
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,135
-Dr. Shuman, are you there?
-Sorry, Toby, yes.

331
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:15,435
-When I drive by, she's out.
-What do you think she's telling you...

332
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,840
-...with this chronic behavior?
-I don 't know.

333
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,948
I'm wondering if I shouldn't put you
on with our relationship...

334
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:23,949
...and commitment therapist,
Dr. Gregory.

335
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,643
-Okay.
-Keep him talking.

336
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,024
-You're playing a Iosing hand.
-Really, you think so?

337
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:32,422
This is a case of throwing
good money after bad.

338
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:35,654
-You should just get out, Toby.
-Thanks, doctor.

339
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:39,130
Hold on one moment. Our contract
specialist will be with you presently.

340
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,029
-What are you doing?
-What?

341
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:44,730
Rule number one, be a Iistener. Listen.

342
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,808
-I can't help you. I want to, but I can't.
-Jack, come on, you know I'm good for it.

343
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:51,639
Why does everyone
try to take advantage of me?

344
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,642
Cheryl, I am hearing you
express your pain...

345
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:58,183
...and I'm feeling empathy.

346
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,014
You understand, don 't you, doctor?

347
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:04,056
Yes. From my own experience,
I know how disheartening it is...

348
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:07,127
...to feel that you're being
taken advantage of by friends.

349
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:10,662
-All they do is take from me.
-Exactly, Cheryl.

350
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:14,461
When the motives become monetary,
it's parasitic.

351
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,297
It is parasitic.

352
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:19,963
Julie split and took the kids.
I think she means it this time.

353
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,366
-She always means it.
-No, I'm telling you.

354
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:25,672
She does not even wanna talk
about talking about it.

355
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,109
You might need to dial 1 -900-It's-Over.

356
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,385
Thanks.

357
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,555
I don't even go to restaurants.

358
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,354
-You okay?
-I don 't have anybody to talk to.

359
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,104
No.

360
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,830
Don't you ever get Ionely?

361
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,936
I don 't know what
I'm gonna do with myself.

362
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,938
I feel as though I'm stuck here
waiting for my life to start.

363
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:57,602
-If I could just hit a button....
-With friends Iike you? Never.

364
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:00,872
-Still not getting nickel one.
-Damn.

365
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,709
That's not fair to you, Cheryl.
Are you gonna accept that?

366
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:17,397
You Iocked out?

367
00:25:17,397 --> 00:25:20,034
Either that,
or I just enjoy sitting on staircases.

368
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,730
How Iong before Suzanne will be back?

369
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,269
I don't know.

370
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,636
-She was gonna Ioan me some money.
-Oh, yeah?

371
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:33,147
Well, I've got...

372
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:35,112
...$1 9, is that enough?

373
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,275
That's all you brought with you?

374
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,212
And a thousand dollars
in traveler's checks.

375
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:45,950
Excuse me.

376
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:48,094
Hello?

377
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,994
Yes. This is she.

378
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,894
Yes. Hello.

379
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:57,868
Tonight? Yes.

380
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,906
AII right. Thank you very much.

381
00:26:01,906 --> 00:26:05,877
I got a job. Singing at Dean's.

382
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,605
-Dino's?
-You know the place?

383
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:08,942
Sure.

384
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:11,976
It's my first job singing professionally.

385
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:15,247
Oh, we should celebrate.
This is an occasion.

386
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:17,914
You're right. It is.

387
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,185
Well, Iet's go.

388
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,392
Good Iuck to you.

389
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:24,994
Thank you.

390
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,930
Discipline's the key.
We have serious celebrating to do...

391
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,073
...so we only play
until we double our money.

392
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:36,609
-Do you know how to play poker?
-I know that three of a kind beats two pair.

393
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,609
Very good.

394
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,980
Binion's Horseshoe Casino
in downtown Las Vegas...

395
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,586
...proud home
of the World Series of Poker.

396
00:26:46,586 --> 00:26:51,749
The 2003 Omaha event will commence
in two hours in Benny's Bullpen.

397
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,825
BIinds, please.

398
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,131
Okay. In T exas Hold ' Em...

399
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:04,500
...each player gets two cards
that no one else sees.

400
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,006
Then five cards are dealt
face up on the table.

401
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:10,838
Now, these are cards
that everybody can use.

402
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,980
If you think you have
the best two cards...

403
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,117
...or two cards
you'd Iike to draw to, you bet.

404
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:18,684
And, if you don't, you fold.

405
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,653
Raise.

406
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:31,564
Call.

407
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:36,500
Four players.

408
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:44,940
-Check.
-Check.

409
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:50,951
If, for instance,
someone had a king in the hole...

410
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:55,385
...they'd now have two pair.
kings and fours.

411
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:59,092
One more heart and you've got a flush.

412
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,396
That's right. Of course, the trick
is to not Iet the other players know...

413
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:15,406
-...when you got something good.
-Okay.

414
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:18,705
Hence the expression, "poker face."

415
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,815
Three players.

416
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:38,062
-Check.
-Check it.

417
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,964
Forty.

418
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,367
Raise it to 80.

419
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:52,235
I call.

420
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:55,509
Call 80.

421
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,551
-Check.
-Check it.

422
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,062
Check it.

423
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,559
-What are you doing?
-Forty.

424
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,795
I'II raise.

425
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,140
Raise it to 80.

426
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:22,934
I give her a king and a queen in the hole
for an ace-high straight.

427
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,279
-Yeah?
-Fold.

428
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,712
I call.
I've got Broderick Crawford.

429
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:30,214
Tens and fours. Two pair.

430
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,211
A straight.

431
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,656
Ace-high straight. The winner.

432
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,053
Nice hand.

433
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:42,890
Over and out.

434
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,789
How did you know?

435
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:49,835
It was the way she bet before the flop,
and the way she bet after the flop.

436
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:54,100
A good fold is as important as a win.
Sometimes more important.

437
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,744
Pair of kings. Kings are the winner.

438
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,783
This is fun.

439
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:08,349
-BIinds, please.
-Hey, Huck. How they falling?

440
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,684
Lester. Billie Offer.

441
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,121
Nice to meet you.

442
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:15,922
Ready Eddie bet me 20 Iarge I couldn't
Iive in the AIaddin bathroom a month.

443
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:18,691
-You gonna take him up on it?
-I'm thinking about it.

444
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,563
Want a piece of my action if I do?
30 days in the bathroom.

445
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:25,502
How hard can it be?
Maybe I can even get him to give us odds.

446
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:27,834
I'm kind of financially handicapped
right now.

447
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,510
So, Billie...

448
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,476
...a hundred bucks
says I can make it...

449
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:36,116
...to the end of the room
without touching the ground.

450
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,943
-Bet.
-Bet.

451
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:41,752
Fold.

452
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,391
Call 40. 20 to call.

453
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,658
Three players.

454
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,133
-Send the hundred over.
-You still owe me $1 000...

455
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:57,135
...from miniature golf, remember?
Shovel against a rake?

456
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:59,239
Then put it on my account.

457
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,971
Did that man have breasts,
or is he physically challenged?

458
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:09,650
Well, someone bet him 50 grand
he wouldn't get breast implants...

459
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,409
...and keep them for six months.

460
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:14,111
Guy named Zembic did it 1 2 months
a couple years ago...

461
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:18,191
...said the women went wild
for the breasts, so Lester took the bet.

462
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:19,621
Raise. PIay for 80.

463
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:22,388
Well, he should wear
a more flattering blouse.

464
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:25,089
Hey, Huck. Can I get you anything?

465
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,559
No thanks, Sherry.

466
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:32,973
You must play a Iot.
You know so many people.

467
00:31:32,973 --> 00:31:34,836
Well, this is what I do.

468
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:37,671
What, Iike a job?
You don't work, you just gamble?

469
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:40,871
Well, who said it's not work?
It's the work this city's all about.

470
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:42,846
I'm all-in.

471
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,712
Raise. AII-in. PIaying for 35.

472
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,219
35 to play.

473
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,917
Call.

474
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,534
Why'd you turn your cards over?

475
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:04,103
Well, he's out of chips,
so there's no more betting.

476
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,239
Two players.

477
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,403
Pair of queens.

478
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:15,947
Unless he gets another nine,
we've got him.

479
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,618
Come on, nine.

480
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:21,721
-Come on, nine.
-Come on, nine.

481
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,257
-Yes!
-Yes!

482
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:26,120
Three nines the winner.

483
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:32,866
-Thank you.
-Well, you beat him once.

484
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:36,094
-It doesn't work Iike that.
-Well, maybe it should.

485
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:40,666
L.C. Great to see you.
How you doing?

486
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,639
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

487
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,574
BIinds, please.

488
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,650
-Hello, Huck.
-Hey.

489
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,052
Hey. You remember Isabel.

490
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:59,523
-Beautiful as ever.
-Thank you.

491
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:04,290
-I hear that your Ieft pocket is empty.
-Really?

492
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,692
-How you hitting them?
-Down the middle.

493
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:11,464
Yeah, we should tee it up.
It's been a Iong time.

494
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,507
I went and got this out of hock.

495
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,141
It's nice to have it back.

496
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:21,782
I have a feeling it's gonna bring me Iuck.

497
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:26,745
-I'm L.C.
-Hi, I'm Billie Offer. Nice to meet you.

498
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,220
-Thank you very much.
-Is he related to you?

499
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:38,791
-Why do you say that?
-Because your eyes went all quiet.

500
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:42,701
BIinds, please.

501
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:47,739
In poker, we call that a tell.
He's my father.

502
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:53,811
Dr. Laura says, " If you Iive your Iife
angry at your parents...

503
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:55,812
...you're only hurting yourself."

504
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:57,883
Well, who said I was angry at anybody?

505
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:03,221
-Raise.
-Call.

506
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,223
-You know what, I should get going.
-Five players.

507
00:34:07,223 --> 00:34:09,420
I don't wanna be Iate
my first night of work.

508
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,997
-Anybody mind? I owe the Iady 1 000.
-Nobody cares.

509
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,728
Your stake, plus a 20 percent return.

510
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:16,529
-You don't have to.
-Fair is fair.

511
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:18,194
Do you mind cashing it in yourself?

512
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:21,671
I've got the best of it right now.
I really shouldn't Ieave the table.

513
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:24,573
And I'm sorry we didn't get around
to the celebrating.

514
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:28,910
No, don't be. I haven't had
this much fun since junior high.

515
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,252
Thanks, sugar.

516
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:38,923
Raise.

517
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:43,357
-Raise.
-Re-raise.

518
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,580
-What are you watching?
-Australian games. Not bad.

519
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,479
Helps with March Madness withdrawal.

520
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,586
-Got any money?
-I don't Ioan to gamblers.

521
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,855
-I gotta get up the 1 0 for the World Series.
-Save your money. That's a sucker bet.

522
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:12,617
Against a thousand computer geeks.

523
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,785
Hey, foul! He's fouling him. That's a foul.

524
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:17,089
How about advancing your rent?

525
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:20,359
I'm paid up
through the NCAA Finals 2008.

526
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,935
-You wanna buy the house?
-You grew up in this house.

527
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:25,937
PIus, the bank already owns it.
30 seconds.

528
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:28,735
AII right. Just dribble out the clock.
Come on.

529
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:32,573
Okay. Pick it up. Get it back.
Get it back. Get it back.

530
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,948
I'm heading back East tonight.

531
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:42,417
Hey, you haven't seen
my digital camera, have you?

532
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,305
-I was so nervous.
-Didn't show.

533
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:43,540
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

534
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,653
You're not trying to rustle me, are you?

535
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:50,888
What about that celebration?

536
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,888
-It's kind of Iate, isn't it?
-This is Las Vegas.

537
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:57,996
I don't know.

538
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:16,881
-Can it be Chinese?
-Let's go.

539
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,552
Thanks.

540
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:54,286
-Can I get you something to drink, sir?
-Billie?

541
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:58,585
Do you mind if I get my fortune cookie first?
I Iike to think about it during the meal.

542
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,791
Could you bring her a fortune cookie
before we order?

543
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,264
What about you?
Don't you wanna read your fortune?

544
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,833
I can't afford to be superstitious.

545
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,130
-Don't you believe in Iuck?
-I believe in skill.

546
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,175
AIthough, it did seem the cards ran
a Iittle better for me when you were around.

547
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,142
-What happened to "the best of it"?
-Turned into a Iittle bit of the worst of it.

548
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,646
Maybe after dinner,
we'II go play some pok--

549
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:32,185
Hey. Billie Offer, Chico Banh.

550
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,260
-My pleasure.
-Hello.

551
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,926
-You get a seat yet?
-I'm working on it.

552
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,203
-He doesn't Iook Mexican.
-Vietnamese.

553
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,346
Grew up in Texas. Speaks Spanish
better than he does English.

554
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:55,641
PIays tournament poker
better than anybody.

555
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:57,340
Really?

556
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,188
What? What's it say?

557
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,892
" Big contest is yours to win
and riches too."

558
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:11,722
Let me see that.

559
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,530
" He who thinks too much
is thinking too much."

560
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,675
Got you,
Mr. I-Can't-Afford-To-Be-Superstitious.

561
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,208
Okay.

562
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:33,184
When someone says "Ieft pocket,"
what does that mean?

563
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:38,991
-It's where you keep your important money.
-Like the money to enter the tournament.

564
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:43,090
And the winner of the World Series
is the best there is?

565
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:47,963
Tournaments are for the public.
You know, the perception of who's best.

566
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:50,467
To determine who's best,
you'd play head-to-head...

567
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,367
...no Iimit, with your own money.

568
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:55,703
Then why do you wanna play in it?
Did your father win it?

569
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,145
Twice.

570
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:03,610
Was he always a gambler?

571
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,610
He was an English professor
when he married my mother.

572
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:11,019
She stuck by him until he Ieft her,
after he stole everything he could.

573
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:13,217
The Ieaf doesn't fall far from the tree.

574
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,633
You hate him, but you still play poker.

575
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:26,763
He taught me to play. Pennies, nickels,
and dimes on the kitchen table.

576
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:29,876
I could never beat him
and he never Iet me win.

577
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:33,410
Mama was a piano teacher...

578
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,914
...and she taught her students
Brahms and Chopin...

579
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:39,552
...but her real Iove was Nashville.

580
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:45,090
We used to sing together,
all around the house and in the car.

581
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:48,454
And I always wanted to try it for real.

582
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:51,189
So your mother must be proud of you.

583
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,227
She died Iast October.

584
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:59,729
But tonight,
I almost felt Iike she was Iistening.

585
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:34,403
You know what I think?

586
00:41:34,403 --> 00:41:38,102
I think everybody's just trying
not to be Ionely.

587
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:50,649
-You cold?
-A Iittle.

588
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,467
Thank you.

589
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:52,010
-Where's all the furniture?
-I'm redecorating.

590
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:57,281
Come on. Let me show you
what I've done with the rest of the place.

591
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:38,997
-AII-in.
-How much you got?

592
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,403
Twelve thousand two hundred.

593
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,170
-Coffee?
-Yes.

594
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:03,186
You've been running over everybody
all morning.

595
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:06,520
Don't chase what you can't catch.

596
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:13,497
No matter what's prudent,
sometimes you gotta play your gut.

597
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,634
I think I got him.

598
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:21,633
-I think he knows it too.
-Don't Iet your ego get involved.

599
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:26,710
If you're so sure, want a side bet?

600
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,609
-Yeah.
-The ring?

601
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:32,346
Against 500.

602
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:36,082
The price of poker's gone up.

603
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:41,583
-You're on.
-Which one of you am I playing?

604
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:44,955
Or is this a team?

605
00:44:44,955 --> 00:44:48,192
Call. Stuck on deuces.

606
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:51,632
Deuces?

607
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:56,566
AII you got is deuces?
And you call me with this shit?

608
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:11,080
Deuces the winner.

609
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,770
That was a great call.

610
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:36,380
-Thanks, Robin.
-Thanks, Huck.

611
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:38,909
-How did you do?
-Not bad.

612
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:42,021
Where you going, Huck?
That real estate guy just walked in.

613
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,089
We're starting the big game.

614
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:11,047
-You stole from me.
-Borrowed. I-- I had it way up.

615
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:13,914
Borrowing is when you ask!

616
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,721
-You'II get it back, I promise.
-I worked hard. I needed it.

617
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:23,352
I've got responsibilities and bills.
I'm trying to get a place on my own.

618
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:26,397
If I'd have won, you'd have a share.
Just Iike before.

619
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:29,593
You think that the only person
that matters is you.

620
00:46:29,593 --> 00:46:31,465
What you need, when you need it!

621
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:35,065
-You're a sick pony.
-Puppy.

622
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:38,336
Billie? Look, it was wrong,
but I'm gonna pay you back.

623
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:42,346
I'm not a bank! You can't make deposits
and withdrawals whenever you feel Iike it.

624
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:44,177
-Wait. Just Iet me--
-Don't say it.

625
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:47,809
You say whatever you think
somebody wants to hear.

626
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:50,957
It's dangerous to be around you.

627
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:57,023
That's why you came
to the club, isn't it?

628
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,562
You knew I had the money.

629
00:46:58,562 --> 00:47:01,826
Decided why not get some put-out
at the same time?

630
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:06,098
-It wasn't Iike that.
-Here. You missed some.

631
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,921
We're a couple minutes away
from the Super Satellite.

632
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:28,118
Winner gets the $ 1 0,000 seat
at the No Limit Texas Hold 'Em event.

633
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:30,024
-Hey, Bill.
-The Super Satellite?

634
00:47:30,024 --> 00:47:33,394
-How many entries you have?
-Well, Iet' s see.

635
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:38,736
SIug your way through 44 wannabes,
and you got your seat in the big one.

636
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:41,204
Two and a quarter if you wanna try it.

637
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:45,144
-I call.
-And then there were three.

638
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:48,008
Mr. Ray Zumbro, Mr. Huck Cheever...

639
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:52,311
...and the current chip Ieader,
Ms. Shannon Kincaid.

640
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:56,752
Cheever? L.C. Cheever's son?
And you play cards?

641
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:59,119
That takes balls.

642
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,391
Heads up.

643
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:16,262
I'm all-in.

644
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:23,907
Call.

645
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:30,639
Two pair. Kings and deuces.

646
00:49:31,685 --> 00:49:33,983
Kings and eights the winner.

647
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:45,761
She did play well.

648
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,339
Must be tough
playing in the shadow of your father.

649
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:57,641
Little coffeehousing for distraction?

650
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,880
No, you wouldn't be bothered
by anything Iike that. I mean...

651
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,246
...you wouldn't have gotten this far
if you couldn't stand on your own two feet.

652
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,691
I'm all-in.

653
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:25,898
You're not trying
to steal the blinds, are you?

654
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,470
How much does he have?

655
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:41,343
Jesus, old man,
when you gonna Iearn to count, huh?

656
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,750
It's 20 a stack. See? 20 a stack.

657
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:52,062
Fifty-one hundred, sir.

658
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,491
Call.

659
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,731
Pair of eights.

660
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:04,577
Tens to eights.

661
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:14,918
Tens to eights still stand.

662
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:24,424
Pair of tens are still tall. Last card--

663
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,833
The tens stand up. Mr. Cheever wins
a seat in the World Series.

664
00:51:34,474 --> 00:51:37,204
Sorry I won't be seeing you
at the big dance.

665
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:44,016
Hey, wait a minute,
there's only two burn cards.

666
00:51:44,016 --> 00:51:45,481
What?

667
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:53,058
Mr. Cheever. Mr. Cheever.

668
00:51:57,397 --> 00:52:02,528
-I'm afraid we've had a misdeal.
-What do you mean you've had a misdeal?

669
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:06,968
No card was burned, the dealer neglected
to burn a card before the river.

670
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:09,472
That's not my problem.
A card Iaid's a card played.

671
00:52:09,472 --> 00:52:13,909
I'm sorry, but house rules require a card
to be burned before any cards are turned.

672
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:17,982
And in the event of this situation the card
is put back, it's used as a burn card...

673
00:52:17,982 --> 00:52:20,449
...and then a new river is dealt.

674
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,319
Take back the six.

675
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:33,197
Burn it.

676
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:37,759
Deal the river.

677
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:48,840
-Yeah! Yeah, baby!
-A set. Three eights the winner.

678
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,583
Guess you won't be needing
to press your dress quite yet, Cinderella.

679
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:05,957
I heard about the misdeal.
Boy, talk about a bad beat, huh?

680
00:53:05,957 --> 00:53:10,034
Okay, so you put up the 1 0,
we split anything I win fifty-fifty.

681
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,170
-Seventy-thirty.
-What happened to sixty-forty?

682
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:16,503
Went away when your tens
went down to a set of eights.

683
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,375
Okay. Sixty-five-thirty-five.

684
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,717
Fine, seventy-thirty.

685
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,259
I need an extra 1 200.

686
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,760
It's that or no deal.

687
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:11,357
-You took the bet.
-It's Iike stealing money.

688
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:15,524
Look at him. Checking up on me.
He's still hoping I'm gonna sneak out.

689
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:17,861
He's having a party now,
three days into it.

690
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:21,599
In a week, you'II be begging to get
out of here. You play any golf Iately?

691
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:23,441
-A Iittle.
-"A Iittle."

692
00:54:23,441 --> 00:54:26,909
-Four handicap and he says "a Iittle."
-Six from the black tees.

693
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:31,574
I'II tell you what. I'II bet you 5000
that you can't run five miles...

694
00:54:31,574 --> 00:54:35,152
...shoot 1 8 holes of golf, 78 or under,
in three hours or Iess.

695
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:37,551
-Forget it.
-Room service.

696
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:40,318
Oh, yeah. Put it right here, boss.

697
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,429
Paulie's right outside that door, just in case
you're thinking of trying anything.

698
00:54:44,429 --> 00:54:46,792
Think about that bet, Huck.

699
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,733
Comfort food.

700
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:52,524
-Hi.
-Hi.

701
00:55:59,472 --> 00:56:01,531
I'm truly sorry, Billie.

702
00:56:08,548 --> 00:56:10,675
I want you to give me another chance.

703
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:15,449
Why should I?

704
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,484
You know what you said before
about everybody trying not to be Ionely?

705
00:56:21,484 --> 00:56:24,824
I feel Iike we have a chance
at something special here.

706
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:29,435
And if you cut it off now,
we'II never know.

707
00:56:35,075 --> 00:56:38,442
Why don't you just come have breakfast
with me, see how it goes?

708
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:50,319
Thanks.

709
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,118
-Don't you ever sleep?
-I don't need much sleep.

710
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,352
So you play poker instead.

711
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:01,833
Why do you Iike it so much?
Is it the money?

712
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:04,469
The money's just a way of keeping score.

713
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:09,167
Poker is competition in the purest sense.

714
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:13,067
Doesn't matter who you are,
or what you are...

715
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:15,043
...everybody's equal at the table.

716
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,977
But you can't have sympathy and win.

717
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:21,810
In order for you to win,
someone else has to Iose.

718
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:25,123
It seems so cruel.

719
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:27,916
So you just gamble all the time?

720
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:31,962
I never bet on sports,
never play against the house...

721
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:35,898
...and I only bet on my skills
against the skills of other people.

722
00:57:37,103 --> 00:57:41,301
That sounds Iike an alcoholic saying,
"I only drink tequila."

723
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:44,509
What about Festus,
or whatever his name is...

724
00:57:44,509 --> 00:57:46,975
...jumping across the floor?
You bet on that.

725
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,680
The chair thing's an old gag,
and I did it for you...

726
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,044
...because I thought
you'd think it was funny.

727
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,259
-Miss Offer.
-Mr. Cheever.

728
00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:03,418
I thought you might be here.

729
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:06,187
I hear Roy Durucher's backing you.

730
00:58:06,793 --> 00:58:08,988
You know I'd have backed you
if you'd asked me.

731
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,629
If I'd asked.

732
00:58:15,736 --> 00:58:18,170
Hello? Yes.

733
00:58:18,805 --> 00:58:22,536
Excuse me. Yes, it is available.

734
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:26,577
This is the second time I've seen you
with her. Must be some kind of record.

735
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:30,016
-She thinks I'm compulsive.
-Are you?

736
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:33,377
If I am,
I'm not hurting anyone but myself.

737
00:58:34,454 --> 00:58:36,115
Touch.

738
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:41,159
It was good when I figured out how to play
poker and have a Iife too. I recommend it.

739
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,162
The Grecian Formula's in aisle three.
Or did you come for the waffles?

740
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:49,026
Not a bad idea.

741
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:53,035
Well, good to see
there's something of the old town Ieft.

742
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,801
Now, humor me a minute.

743
00:58:58,612 --> 00:59:00,273
How would you have played this?

744
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,748
Okay, here's how it went.
Seat three, he bets. Seat four, he raises.

745
00:59:09,748 --> 00:59:12,756
Seats five and six fold.
Seat seven calls. Seat eight folds.

746
00:59:12,756 --> 00:59:15,918
Seat one raises over the top.
Seats two and three fold.

747
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:20,829
Seats four and seven call.
Only three players Ieft to see the flop.

748
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:24,368
You're seat four. The raise and the call.
You're sitting on something.

749
00:59:24,368 --> 00:59:26,199
Yeah.

750
00:59:29,342 --> 00:59:32,778
The flop comes. King of spades,
four of clubs, jack of hearts.

751
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:36,404
Hand one checks. I bet.
Hand seven folds.

752
00:59:36,404 --> 00:59:38,175
Hand one...

753
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,547
...raises.

754
00:59:42,823 --> 00:59:45,986
Sandbag. Probably two pair
or three of a kind.

755
00:59:45,986 --> 00:59:48,889
Most Iikely. To be certain,
I make a small raise and he--

756
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,495
Calls.

757
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:55,526
-Why do you say that?
-He reads you for pocket aces.

758
00:59:55,526 --> 00:59:59,229
Wants to drag you along, get another bet in
before he puts the hammer down.

759
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,896
Risky. I might improve.

760
01:00:00,896 --> 01:00:04,771
Well, if he's two pair, he's 74 percent
favorite. Three of a kind makes him 90.

761
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:08,075
-Yeah.
-Okay.

762
01:00:08,515 --> 01:00:12,815
Two of us Ieft. On the turn, six of clubs.
No help. I check.

763
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:16,012
-He bets.
-I call.

764
01:00:16,289 --> 01:00:18,416
Okay, on the river
what should show up?

765
01:00:19,059 --> 01:00:20,458
Another ace.

766
01:00:20,994 --> 01:00:24,122
Makes me the man and a half,
three aces.

767
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:25,958
So I bet. He says:

768
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:29,898
"I don't think you had aces going in.
I think you got stubborn with a bully ace.

769
01:00:29,898 --> 01:00:32,732
I think my hand is still tall."

770
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,509
And he raises. Big.

771
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:38,906
Something doesn't feel right. Like...

772
01:00:39,513 --> 01:00:44,610
...I'm about to walk into Hydra
with his nine heads, so I just....

773
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:48,647
I call and I turn over my pocket aces.

774
01:00:51,157 --> 01:00:52,784
And he rolls over....

775
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,723
Two clubs. One of them a king.

776
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:03,893
You got it.

777
01:01:05,472 --> 01:01:08,737
A club flush. On the come-all-along.

778
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,507
That was a $267,000 Iesson.

779
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:16,513
I should have gotten away from it.

780
01:01:16,513 --> 01:01:21,586
I had such a hard-on for my aces,
I never Iooked beyond the obvious. So....

781
01:01:23,757 --> 01:01:27,488
What's the worst thing can happen
to a poker player?

782
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:28,855
Lose his nerve.

783
01:01:30,363 --> 01:01:31,557
What else?

784
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:36,235
Nobody's better
than anybody else at the big tables.

785
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:40,032
They have different styles.
Different ways of doing things...

786
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:42,834
...but everybody knows how to play.

787
01:01:47,213 --> 01:01:50,239
The key to winning
is watching and understanding.

788
01:01:55,155 --> 01:01:57,623
There's things I don't see anymore.

789
01:01:59,259 --> 01:02:01,124
A blind spot.

790
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:07,058
It's just a hand.
Could have happened to anybody.

791
01:02:09,836 --> 01:02:10,860
You saw it.

792
01:02:16,142 --> 01:02:19,305
Okay. Guts. Head to head.
A nickel a pop.

793
01:02:20,113 --> 01:02:21,774
-Why not a dime?
-Let's go.

794
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:36,157
Two thousand dollar burn.

795
01:02:46,673 --> 01:02:47,867
I'm in.

796
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:50,635
-I'm with you.
-Queen, seven.

797
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:51,799
Queen, ten.

798
01:02:57,484 --> 01:02:59,076
It's coming.

799
01:03:06,593 --> 01:03:08,584
-Check.
-I'm in.

800
01:03:10,997 --> 01:03:12,362
Re-ante.

801
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:30,080
I'm in.

802
01:03:31,251 --> 01:03:32,377
Call.

803
01:03:33,987 --> 01:03:35,511
King, ten.

804
01:03:36,356 --> 01:03:37,584
Beat you, slick.

805
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:49,295
Check.

806
01:03:51,237 --> 01:03:52,568
-I'm in.
-Call.

807
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,838
Pair of tens.

808
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:10,650
I'm in.

809
01:04:11,357 --> 01:04:13,382
-I've improved.
-You needed to.

810
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:17,257
-Call.
-Caught the cowboy, kings and tens.

811
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:20,866
Caught the bullet and his Iittle friend,
aces and threes.

812
01:04:23,169 --> 01:04:26,502
You might want to think about quitting,
because I've got the best of it.

813
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:30,336
-Re-ante. Four thousand dollar burn.
-I don't wanna clean you out.

814
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,273
You playing or not?

815
01:04:32,812 --> 01:04:35,246
You're not gonna be happy
till you have nothing Ieft.

816
01:04:45,024 --> 01:04:46,423
I'm in.

817
01:04:51,564 --> 01:04:54,124
Call. Jack, four.

818
01:04:55,869 --> 01:04:56,927
Nice read.

819
01:04:58,805 --> 01:05:02,468
I'm weak, but not quite that weak.
Jack, five.

820
01:05:09,415 --> 01:05:10,848
I'm in.

821
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:31,293
It's yours.

822
01:05:47,153 --> 01:05:49,986
This was your stake for the big one.
Take it.

823
01:05:49,986 --> 01:05:51,714
I don't want it.

824
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:53,781
Pick it up.

825
01:05:55,495 --> 01:05:56,587
Pick it up!

826
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:59,693
I could have played it safe.
That's not who I am.

827
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,467
You got it backwards, kid.

828
01:06:02,467 --> 01:06:05,126
You play cards the way
you should Iead your Iife...

829
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:07,773
...and Iead your Iife
the way you should play cards.

830
01:06:09,442 --> 01:06:12,172
Maybe everybody has a blind spot.

831
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:17,040
Maybe everybody has to Iearn
from their mistakes.

832
01:06:20,286 --> 01:06:22,686
I sure Iearned from mine.

833
01:06:30,496 --> 01:06:31,520
Fun game?

834
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,326
Yeah.

835
01:06:35,168 --> 01:06:40,037
You've come a Iong way since pennies,
nickels and dimes on the kitchen table.

836
01:06:42,275 --> 01:06:44,140
Excuse me a minute.

837
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,474
Boys will be boys.

838
01:06:49,515 --> 01:06:51,540
Fathers will be fathers.

839
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:53,913
I tried to give it back to him.

840
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:55,611
You could Ieave it on the table.

841
01:06:55,611 --> 01:07:00,157
Then the waitress
would get a $1 0,000 tip.

842
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:05,761
Well, if he's gonna take anything from me,
he's gonna have to win it, all right?

843
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:08,264
And that's not Iikely to happen.

844
01:07:10,203 --> 01:07:16,073
Maybe giving and receiving are
more complicated than winning and Iosing.

845
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,134
Maybe so.

846
01:07:22,715 --> 01:07:23,909
Good day, Miss Offer.

847
01:07:29,756 --> 01:07:33,419
Right. Right. Right. Okay, Eddie.

848
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,758
He'II go for it. He'II go for the ten.

849
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:39,956
Want to come along? As moral support?

850
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:45,127
Sure. I'm getting an education
on what it's Iike not to be compulsive.

851
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:48,399
Come on.

852
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:51,642
Just so we're straight.
You have to run five miles...

853
01:07:51,642 --> 01:07:56,271
...shoot 1 8 holes of golf, 78 strokes
or under, in Iess than three hours.

854
01:07:56,271 --> 01:08:01,079
And the ball has to be in the cup
before time expires...

855
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,620
...for $1 0,000. Bet?

856
01:08:04,924 --> 01:08:06,050
She holds the stopwatch.

857
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,957
She holds it where I can see it. Bet?

858
01:08:09,262 --> 01:08:10,251
Bet.

859
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:11,727
-You ready?
-Ready.

860
01:08:11,727 --> 01:08:13,160
Get set.

861
01:08:14,734 --> 01:08:15,894
Go!

862
01:08:15,894 --> 01:08:16,644
Go!

863
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:25,907
Nineteen seconds, 20, 21, 22--

864
01:08:25,907 --> 01:08:29,640
Billie. Every couple of minutes
will do it just fine.

865
01:08:33,786 --> 01:08:35,515
Twenty minutes.

866
01:08:36,823 --> 01:08:39,314
You've gone three miles.

867
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:47,357
There it is! Thirty-nine minutes,
ten seconds.

868
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:50,696
-Pop the trunk!
-Pop the trunk, pop the trunk.

869
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,517
Hit a duck and it's two strokes.

870
01:09:12,992 --> 01:09:15,825
AII right, you get the golf cart.
We'II meet you on the green.

871
01:09:15,825 --> 01:09:17,155
Great shot!

872
01:09:18,431 --> 01:09:19,796
Forty minutes, 1 0 seconds.

873
01:09:54,534 --> 01:09:58,163
-How many shots?
-Four. Damn it.

874
01:09:58,163 --> 01:10:00,362
Here. Move over, I'II drive.

875
01:10:02,508 --> 01:10:07,104
Forty-six minutes and 50 seconds.

876
01:10:09,215 --> 01:10:10,465
Fore!

877
01:10:17,957 --> 01:10:21,415
-PIaying through.
-Hey. What? Who is this?

878
01:10:38,744 --> 01:10:40,211
Yes!

879
01:10:43,316 --> 01:10:46,547
Two hours and 1 3 minutes,
and you're two shots ahead.

880
01:10:49,322 --> 01:10:51,313
You're in the rough, Huckster!

881
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:15,041
This is the Iast hole, Huckey-baby.

882
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:22,217
You only have seven minutes
and 45 seconds.

883
01:11:23,222 --> 01:11:25,452
You bogey this, you're toast.

884
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:30,322
That's 75.

885
01:11:30,322 --> 01:11:33,056
Only three more.

886
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:45,200
Wow! They should have
put some hazards on this hole.

887
01:11:53,853 --> 01:11:54,842
-Yes!
-Shit!

888
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:58,718
-Seventy-six shots.
-AII right, all right!

889
01:12:05,565 --> 01:12:08,534
Two hours, 57 minutes and 40 seconds.

890
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:11,135
You shank this, it's all over.

891
01:12:17,276 --> 01:12:19,403
-Get in the hole.
-Stay out of the hole.

892
01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:20,739
Go ball, go.

893
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:23,006
Yes, baby. Legs, Legs, Legs!

894
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:26,982
Good boy. Good boy.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

895
01:12:27,453 --> 01:12:28,977
AII right.

896
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,053
It's not an impossible putt.
I think Jack Nicklaus made it once.

897
01:12:34,053 --> 01:12:36,855
Two hours, 59 minutes, and 46 seconds.

898
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:39,156
Forty-seven, 48.

899
01:12:39,156 --> 01:12:43,428
-Your dick's beginning to sweat.
-Forty-nine, 50, 51, 52...

900
01:12:43,428 --> 01:12:47,505
Your arms are heavy.
-...Fifty-three, 54, 55...

901
01:12:47,505 --> 01:12:51,302
...fifty-six, 57, 58.

902
01:12:55,615 --> 01:12:56,865
Yeah!

903
01:13:07,526 --> 01:13:09,187
Three hours and two seconds.

904
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:13,225
You Iost.

905
01:13:14,967 --> 01:13:16,594
Yes!

906
01:13:16,594 --> 01:13:20,068
Yes! Yes! I win! I win!

907
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,673
I win. I win.

908
01:13:27,013 --> 01:13:28,503
Yes!

909
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,115
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
01:13:33,115 --> 01:13:37,347
Three hours and two seconds.

911
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,483
Two seconds, baby! Yeah!

912
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:44,824
-Hey, where you going?
-I'II catch up with you.

913
01:13:45,197 --> 01:13:46,425
Where's my money?

914
01:13:46,799 --> 01:13:48,892
Come back here.

915
01:13:50,269 --> 01:13:52,635
How come you couldn't have
helped me out a Iittle?

916
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,238
Helped you out?

917
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:56,602
Yeah, just a couple of seconds.

918
01:13:57,843 --> 01:14:00,368
You mean, cheated?

919
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:02,639
Is that what you mean by moral support?

920
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,376
I'm stuck 20,000
and I still got no entry fee.

921
01:14:07,086 --> 01:14:11,546
I don't Iie, cheat,
or steal for anything or anyone.

922
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:13,749
AII you had to do
was give me a Iittle edge.

923
01:14:14,393 --> 01:14:16,122
Call it what you Iike, it's cheating.

924
01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:20,823
It was two seconds!
Anybody would have done that.

925
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:24,159
Well, I don't believe that.

926
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,237
It's the way it is.

927
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,199
You always have the hard answers,
don't you?

928
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,809
How do you Iive with yourself?

929
01:14:31,809 --> 01:14:34,844
-You mean the easy answers, Billie.
-No, I mean the hard ones.

930
01:14:38,284 --> 01:14:41,685
I don't wanna see you anymore.
Just stop this thing.

931
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,152
Billie, what are you doing?

932
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:50,491
Making a good fold.

933
01:15:19,425 --> 01:15:22,690
-Dude, what happened to your furniture?
-Who are you?

934
01:15:24,063 --> 01:15:28,261
Mr. Durucher was upset to hear you Iost
his ten grand to Ready Eddie.

935
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:31,462
Tell Mr. Durucher
he's got nothing to worry about.

936
01:15:31,462 --> 01:15:33,935
We'II get a seat in the big show.

937
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,064
Nice pool.

938
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:40,507
Shame there's no water.

939
01:15:42,314 --> 01:15:43,975
Hey.

940
01:15:55,027 --> 01:15:57,962
You got 24 hours
to return Mr. Durucher his money...

941
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:01,426
...or get a seat in the tournament.

942
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,594
What happened to you?

943
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:09,701
Is Billie here?

944
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:14,241
Do you believe in karma?

945
01:16:16,649 --> 01:16:17,946
Is this a trick question?

946
01:16:19,685 --> 01:16:22,552
Everyone over 21
gets what they deserve.

947
01:16:26,191 --> 01:16:29,092
Come on, Suzanne.
Give me a Iittle more than that.

948
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:37,325
I'm sorry, Suzanne, about everything.

949
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,741
Her seeing me wasn't her fault.
It was mine.

950
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:48,839
I know you, and I know Billie.

951
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:58,353
What are you doing here?
This isn't your style, going out on a Iimb.

952
01:16:58,723 --> 01:17:01,317
Some people think
I spend my whole Iife out on a Iimb.

953
01:17:02,527 --> 01:17:07,328
Maybe at the poker table.
But in real Iife you play it pretty tight.

954
01:17:12,637 --> 01:17:14,696
More power to Billie.

955
01:17:16,074 --> 01:17:17,166
She got through to you.

956
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:29,052
She went back to Bakersfield
for a couple days.

957
01:17:33,959 --> 01:17:36,894
So this thing,
safe to assume it's about money?

958
01:17:38,797 --> 01:17:41,197
I got a day to clear it up.

959
01:17:42,067 --> 01:17:44,900
Oh, what's that old poker saying
about a chip and a chair?

960
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:50,204
If anyone could turn
nothing into something, it's you, Huck.

961
01:17:51,443 --> 01:17:54,378
Trouble is, you always throw it away.

962
01:17:59,084 --> 01:18:00,847
Night, Huck.

963
01:18:20,138 --> 01:18:22,572
-I can almost predict these cards.
-Dj vu.

964
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:41,120
I have something you said you valued.

965
01:18:47,165 --> 01:18:50,498
Buck and a half, just Iike the pawn shop.

966
01:18:57,342 --> 01:19:00,140
Five. Fair's fair.

967
01:19:07,352 --> 01:19:08,819
Thanks.

968
01:19:10,922 --> 01:19:12,150
Huck.

969
01:19:15,093 --> 01:19:16,424
Good skill.

970
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:28,017
I got a seat in the tournament.

971
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:34,728
You came all the way out here
to tell me that?

972
01:21:38,736 --> 01:21:40,897
You're the only one I wanted to tell.

973
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:49,672
You were right not to cheat.

974
01:21:51,716 --> 01:21:53,707
You've been right about a Iot.

975
01:21:54,586 --> 01:21:56,417
Hard answers...

976
01:21:57,055 --> 01:21:59,888
...my telling people
what they wanna hear.

977
01:22:01,092 --> 01:22:04,926
Ever since I was a kid, I've always
been able to talk my way out of things.

978
01:22:05,263 --> 01:22:09,927
But when I told you we had a chance
at something special, I meant it.

979
01:22:13,037 --> 01:22:14,800
I just wanted you to know that.

980
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,394
We will high-card for the button
on table number 58.

981
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:47,299
That's my ace.

982
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:51,067
The button starts on seat number five.

983
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:53,972
-The button starts here, boys.
-AII right, dealers.

984
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:56,978
Put the button at seat number five.

985
01:22:56,978 --> 01:22:59,480
Dealers, make sure you're
checking receipts.

986
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,051
Make sure everybody's
at the correct table and seat.

987
01:23:02,051 --> 01:23:04,848
Two minutes till we start
the World Series main event.

988
01:23:04,848 --> 01:23:07,184
Here at the featured table,
the hole card cam...

989
01:23:07,184 --> 01:23:10,020
...is being used for the first time
at the World Series...

990
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,685
...even though no one will see
what the camera sees...

991
01:23:12,685 --> 01:23:14,832
...until the tournament is broadcast...

992
01:23:14,832 --> 01:23:17,126
...the camera's getting mixed reviews.

993
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:21,363
Two-time world champion L.C. Cheever,
your thoughts on the hole card cam.

994
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:26,302
I made a good Iiving for a Iong time
because people don't know how I play.

995
01:23:26,302 --> 01:23:27,808
I'd rather keep it that way.

996
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:30,240
There you have it. Like it or not...

997
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:34,875
...poker as a spectator sport
is about to undergo an enormous change.

998
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:38,147
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the World Series of Poker.

999
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:40,658
Dealers, shuffle up and deal.

1000
01:23:40,658 --> 01:23:42,725
Let's get those cards in the air.

1001
01:23:42,725 --> 01:23:47,092
Jack Binion 's father, Benny Binion,
started the World Series in 1 970.

1002
01:23:47,092 --> 01:23:50,063
Today, there are over 800 players.

1003
01:23:50,063 --> 01:23:55,297
Five days from now,
the winner will receive 2.5 million dollars...

1004
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:58,738
... the richest individual prize in sports.

1005
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:08,781
We're down to 320 players.

1006
01:24:08,781 --> 01:24:10,716
We' re halfway through day number two.

1007
01:24:29,474 --> 01:24:30,498
Good Iuck.

1008
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:34,611
Ladies and gentlemen,
Doyle Brunson has just been eliminated.

1009
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:44,148
Sam. You're out?

1010
01:24:44,148 --> 01:24:48,486
This guy over there, he never played
a Iive tournament in his Iife.

1011
01:24:48,926 --> 01:24:52,726
And he beat me. I don't know
if this makes me feel better or worse.

1012
01:25:05,443 --> 01:25:08,276
So, I hear Huck's doing really well
in the tournament.

1013
01:25:09,447 --> 01:25:10,880
Good.

1014
01:25:12,417 --> 01:25:13,907
That's nice.

1015
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:20,290
We're breaking another table.

1016
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,790
Only 1 35 players remain.

1017
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:27,893
Dealers, please check all
incoming players' seat cards.

1018
01:25:27,893 --> 01:25:29,226
Look who's here.

1019
01:25:33,137 --> 01:25:36,595
I managed to get my dress pressed,
after all.

1020
01:25:42,046 --> 01:25:43,445
Heads up.

1021
01:25:52,457 --> 01:25:53,924
Thirty thousand.

1022
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,683
AII-in.

1023
01:26:38,169 --> 01:26:40,729
Do I really Iike these cards...

1024
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:44,932
...or is it just the irresistible Iure
of sending you home?

1025
01:26:51,182 --> 01:26:54,276
-How much to call?
-It's about 1 50.

1026
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:57,046
I mean, do you need an exact count?

1027
01:27:07,498 --> 01:27:08,795
Call.

1028
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:14,797
Ace, king high.

1029
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,437
Pair of fives, the winner.

1030
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,284
Nice hand.

1031
01:27:37,495 --> 01:27:41,192
Michelle has aces and jacks,
two pair, and wins the pot.

1032
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:44,600
It's three a.m. We'II stay until
we eliminate one more player.

1033
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,499
Then the final table will be set.

1034
01:27:47,499 --> 01:27:50,038
The action is to Huck Cheever.

1035
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:02,909
And Huck raises it to 40,000.
And Frank folds.

1036
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:09,088
Jason re-raises to 1 00,000.
Michelle folds.

1037
01:28:09,088 --> 01:28:14,220
And L.C. folds. Chico folds.
The action is to Karim Kasai.

1038
01:28:18,202 --> 01:28:20,466
-AII-in.
-Karim Kasai is all-in.

1039
01:28:24,809 --> 01:28:28,245
Josh is out.
The action's to Huck Cheever.

1040
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:43,717
Huck folds.
And the action's back to Jason Keyes.

1041
01:28:43,717 --> 01:28:45,691
-How much?
-He's asked for a count.

1042
01:28:45,691 --> 01:28:48,195
I'm somewhat surprised
at the play of Huck Cheever.

1043
01:28:48,195 --> 01:28:52,632
He has the reputation of being a blaster.
He's playing very patiently here.

1044
01:28:56,407 --> 01:28:59,308
-Fifty-two to call.
-Fifty-two thousand more.

1045
01:28:59,308 --> 01:29:00,637
-Call.
-And he's called.

1046
01:29:00,637 --> 01:29:02,745
Action's complete. Let's see them.

1047
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:05,314
Ace, queen.

1048
01:29:05,314 --> 01:29:07,917
Karim Kasai has Ace, Queen.
Jason Keyes, two kings.

1049
01:29:11,022 --> 01:29:12,990
Two kings versus ace, queen.

1050
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,920
And the flop...

1051
01:29:17,361 --> 01:29:20,762
-...is a three and two queens.
-Yes! Beautiful!

1052
01:29:21,599 --> 01:29:23,726
Karim Kasai has made trip Queens.

1053
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:26,369
Beautiful! You Iike?

1054
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:27,697
The women, they Iove me.

1055
01:29:28,372 --> 01:29:31,034
The turn card coming up is a jack.

1056
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:35,110
Karim Kasai Iooking to double up.
One card Ieft, and here it is.

1057
01:29:36,447 --> 01:29:37,539
Is a king.

1058
01:29:40,151 --> 01:29:44,053
A Full House for Jason
and Karim Kasai has been eliminated.

1059
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:46,918
Congratulations, everybody.

1060
01:29:47,391 --> 01:29:51,521
That's it. We've reached our final table.
See you in the morning.

1061
01:29:51,521 --> 01:29:54,096
-Bad beat.
-Now Iet's get some sleep.

1062
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:03,960
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

1063
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:08,037
We have reached the final table of the
World Series of Poker main event.

1064
01:31:08,037 --> 01:31:10,469
That's tournament director, Gil Edwards...

1065
01:31:10,469 --> 01:31:14,202
...about to introduce the players
at the final table.

1066
01:31:17,615 --> 01:31:21,210
And the players are, in seat number
one, from Toronto, Canada...

1067
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:25,048
...680,000 in chips, Mr. Josh Cohen.

1068
01:31:27,158 --> 01:31:33,961
In seat number two, from Tucson, Arizona,

1069
01:31:33,961 --> 01:31:38,227
Jason Keyes, the amateur
internet player from Tucson, Arizona...

1070
01:31:38,227 --> 01:31:40,427
...playing in his first Iive tournament.

1071
01:31:40,427 --> 01:31:45,735
In seat number three, 664,000 in chips,
from Detroit, Michigan, Frank Belando.

1072

1073
01:31:49,607 --> 01:31:54,683
In seat number four, from Las Vegas,

1074

1077
01:32:17,134 --> 01:32:22,371
Michelle Carson, the second woman player
in 33 years to make it to the final table.

1078
01:32:23,848 --> 01:32:27,511
In seat number seven,
with 753,000 in chips...

1079
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:32,588

1080
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:35,281

...1,072,000 in chips, David Chen.

1082
01:32:39,897 --> 01:32:41,296
Hey, guys.

1083
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:46,296
And our chip Ieader, in seat number eight...

1084
01:32:46,296 --> 01:32:49,803
...most recently from the south of France,
two-time world champion...

1085
01:32:49,803 --> 01:32:53,933
...2,1 1 6,000, L.C. Cheever.

1086
01:32:53,933 --> 01:32:55,601
L.C. and Huck Cheever.

1087
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:59,180
The first time ever a father and son
have competed against each other...

1088
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:01,318
...at the final table of the World Series.

1089
01:33:01,318 --> 01:33:03,282
The blinds are eight and 1 6,000...

1090
01:33:03,282 --> 01:33:06,014
...the button will start in
seat four with Huck Cheever.

1091
01:33:06,014 --> 01:33:08,181
Good Iuck, players.
Shuffle up and deal.

1092
01:33:21,105 --> 01:33:23,665
The action will start with
Ralph Kaczynski.

1093
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:33,810
Ralph folds.

1094
01:33:41,859 --> 01:33:44,453
L.C. raises to 50,000.

1095
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:47,119
David folds.

1096
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:54,235
Josh is out. Jason folds. Frank folds.

1097
01:34:00,811 --> 01:34:03,974
Huck re-raises to 250,000.

1098
01:34:08,419 --> 01:34:10,182
Chico folds.

1099
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:14,051
Michelle folds.
The action is back to L.C. Cheever.

1100
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:16,522
You trying to steamroll us, kid?

1101
01:34:17,094 --> 01:34:19,187
Another 200,000, you can find out.

1102
01:34:19,187 --> 01:34:21,126
I know you're reckless, Huckleberry...

1103
01:34:21,126 --> 01:34:24,267
...but I also know you don't wanna
be the first to go out.

1104
01:34:27,404 --> 01:34:30,567
L.C. folds, and Huck Cheever
wins the first pot.

1105
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:56,730
The action is still early here
at the final table...

1106
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:59,061
...but Huck Cheever remains consistent.

1107
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:03,605
He's the only player refusing to show
his cards to the hole card camera.

1108
01:35:03,605 --> 01:35:10,043
Even Chico Banh and L.C. Cheever, two
former world champions, have acquiesced.

1109
01:35:19,323 --> 01:35:23,692
And the river is a five.
Chico Banh wins the pot.

1110
01:35:24,628 --> 01:35:25,822
Nice hand.

1111
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:28,999
Josh Cohen is our ninth place finisher.

1112
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,483
David bets 250,000.

1113
01:36:06,937 --> 01:36:09,428
And the river is a jack.

1114
01:36:09,428 --> 01:36:11,233
Huck Cheever wins the pot.

1115
01:36:11,233 --> 01:36:13,638
David Chen finishes in eighth place.

1116
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:19,148
I'm all-in.

1117
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:20,912
Michelle Carson is all-in.

1118
01:36:20,912 --> 01:36:22,950
I call.

1119
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,587
Frank calls.

1120
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:27,688
Frank Belando finishes in seventh place.

1121
01:36:27,688 --> 01:36:29,758
-Nice playing with you.
-Here, you take this.

1122
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,049
Thanks.

1123
01:36:32,029 --> 01:36:33,428
How much does he have Ieft?

1124
01:36:34,064 --> 01:36:37,761
About...270.

1125
01:36:37,968 --> 01:36:39,128
Raise.

1126
01:36:41,271 --> 01:36:42,431
400.

1127
01:36:42,431 --> 01:36:45,097
Ralph re-raises to 400,000.

1128
01:36:49,813 --> 01:36:53,408
L.C. folds.
The action's back to Chico Banh.

1129
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:54,573
Call.

1130
01:36:54,573 --> 01:36:56,686
Chico's all-in with two eights.

1131
01:36:58,789 --> 01:37:03,453
Ralph Kaczynski has ace, king.
Two eights versus ace, king.

1132
01:37:04,128 --> 01:37:05,356
And the flop.

1133
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:10,197
FIop is a king, a seven and a deuce.

1134
01:37:10,197 --> 01:37:13,393
Two kings for Ralph Kaczynski.
Two eights for Chico Banh.

1135
01:37:13,393 --> 01:37:16,471
Unless the Spanish-speaking Vietnamese
catches another eight...

1136
01:37:16,471 --> 01:37:18,665
...it's hasta Ia vista for Chico Banh.

1137
01:37:18,665 --> 01:37:19,866
And the turn.

1138
01:37:20,744 --> 01:37:25,113
It's a three.
Only an eight will save Chico Banh.

1139
01:37:25,113 --> 01:37:26,306
And the river...

1140
01:37:28,452 --> 01:37:29,851
...is a jack.

1141
01:37:31,989 --> 01:37:36,392
Chico Banh, our sixth place finisher.
Takes home $200,000.

1142
01:37:36,392 --> 01:37:37,618
Good Iuck, Huck.

1143
01:37:52,576 --> 01:37:53,702
And the flop.

1144
01:37:57,714 --> 01:38:00,274
Queen, nine, six.
AII clubs.

1145
01:38:02,286 --> 01:38:04,186
L.C. bets 200,000.

1146
01:38:09,026 --> 01:38:10,425
Huck folds.

1147
01:38:15,165 --> 01:38:17,224
-Call.
-Michelle calls.

1148
01:38:23,173 --> 01:38:25,971
The turn card is a deuce of clubs.

1149
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:28,910
You have to assume they
both have flushes.

1150
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:32,606
The question is who has
the highest club in the hole.

1151
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:34,080
L.C. checks.

1152
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:40,351
Michelle bets 400,000.

1153
01:38:45,529 --> 01:38:46,655
L.C. calls.

1154
01:38:52,936 --> 01:38:54,369
And the river...

1155
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,606
...is an eight of clubs.

1156
01:39:01,678 --> 01:39:03,737
L.C. checks.

1157
01:39:14,057 --> 01:39:17,117
-I'm all-in.
-Michelle Carson is all-in.

1158
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:23,358
-Call.
-L.C. calls.

1159
01:39:25,569 --> 01:39:29,198
Michelle has a king of clubs
for a king high flush.

1160
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:30,863
Very nice.

1161
01:39:31,775 --> 01:39:33,800
But not nice enough.

1162
01:39:38,749 --> 01:39:40,944
-Jeez.
-A straight flush.

1163
01:39:42,753 --> 01:39:47,656
L.C. Cheever has eliminated
Michelle Carson with a straight flush.

1164
01:39:51,595 --> 01:39:55,429
The Iast straight flush at the final table
in the World Series of Poker...

1165
01:39:55,429 --> 01:39:58,534
...was 1 994.
There were none before that.

1166
01:39:59,636 --> 01:40:00,967
Go get him.

1167
01:40:02,439 --> 01:40:08,435
And Michelle Carson,
our fifth place finisher, wins $320,000.

1168
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:27,628
Nice hand.

1169
01:40:27,628 --> 01:40:31,393
Yeah. It's usually not the big hands
that do it, though.

1170
01:40:32,903 --> 01:40:37,533
Twenty-eight years ago I was head to head
with Doyle Brunson at the final table.

1171
01:40:37,533 --> 01:40:41,872
He caught a 1 0 on the river for three 1 0s,
and he won the tournament.

1172
01:40:41,872 --> 01:40:44,377
It was his time.

1173
01:40:44,377 --> 01:40:48,177
Two years Iater, I knocked Bobby Baldwin
out with a pair of jacks.

1174
01:40:48,177 --> 01:40:50,115
It was my time.

1175
01:40:51,388 --> 01:40:54,414
This could be my Iast chance
to win this thing again.

1176
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:59,028
Tournament's too big.
Luck's too much of a factor now.

1177
01:40:59,028 --> 01:41:01,391
Why do you even care?
You got nothing to prove.

1178
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:03,430
You've already won it twice.

1179
01:41:04,901 --> 01:41:06,528
Legacy.

1180
01:41:07,404 --> 01:41:11,807
If I could win a third time,
I'd be in the book.

1181
01:41:11,807 --> 01:41:13,442
On the first page.

1182
01:41:15,312 --> 01:41:16,802
Well, one way or the other...

1183
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:22,449
...we're making a kind of history here.
You and me at the final table.

1184
01:41:25,322 --> 01:41:27,017
Yeah, that's one way to Iook at it.

1185
01:41:28,558 --> 01:41:29,752
How do you Iook at it?

1186
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:35,925
You can call it what you Iike.
What goes around, comes around.

1187
01:41:41,038 --> 01:41:44,530
That's a Iong time ago, Huckleberry.
Your mother forgave me.

1188
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,266
Why can't you?

1189
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:48,937
What makes you think
she ever forgave you?

1190
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:51,205
She told me so when she gave
me back her ring.

1191
01:41:51,205 --> 01:41:52,643
You stole the ring.

1192
01:41:55,085 --> 01:41:56,450
That's right, I did.

1193
01:41:57,287 --> 01:41:59,812
Hocked it. Redeemed it.
Gave it back to her.

1194
01:41:59,812 --> 01:42:02,356
She never wore it again.

1195
01:42:02,356 --> 01:42:04,892
Before she died, she gave it back to me.

1196
01:42:12,235 --> 01:42:17,002
I kept the ring because your mother's
forgiveness meant a Iot to me.

1197
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:26,976
Well, then, why did you gamble with it?
I won it from you, remember?

1198
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:31,350
Because she's your mother.

1199
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:37,485
-Hey, Eddie.
-Welcome back.

1200
01:42:42,566 --> 01:42:45,364
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1201
01:42:51,842 --> 01:42:52,968
He's the man.

1202
01:43:08,792 --> 01:43:10,419
Huck raises to 90,000.

1203
01:43:15,732 --> 01:43:17,461
Raise.

1204
01:43:19,836 --> 01:43:22,100
Ralph re-raises to 300,000.

1205
01:43:23,874 --> 01:43:25,000
L.C. folds.

1206
01:43:31,114 --> 01:43:32,103
Jason folds.

1207
01:43:39,456 --> 01:43:41,583
Having fun, Ralph?

1208
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:50,760
Huck folds, and Ralph wins the pot.

1209
01:43:57,874 --> 01:43:59,603
Jason raises to 1 00,000.

1210
01:44:11,354 --> 01:44:12,912
Huck calls.

1211
01:44:19,596 --> 01:44:21,188
And Ralph calls.

1212
01:44:21,665 --> 01:44:25,499
Three players in the pot.
And the flop.

1213
01:44:27,971 --> 01:44:30,235
Jack, four, three. AII different suits.

1214
01:44:31,808 --> 01:44:33,639
Huck checks.

1215
01:44:43,253 --> 01:44:46,450
Ralph bets 350,000.

1216
01:45:03,006 --> 01:45:05,270
Jason calls.

1217
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:28,824
And Huck calls.
This pot is now over one million dollars.

1218
01:45:35,605 --> 01:45:37,197
And the turn...

1219
01:45:38,908 --> 01:45:40,205
...is the king of hearts.

1220
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:46,879
Huck checks.

1221
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:54,614
I'm all-in. Nine-fifty.

1222
01:45:54,614 --> 01:45:57,282
Ralph Kaczynski's all-in for 950,000.

1223
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,139
Jason folds.

1224
01:46:16,413 --> 01:46:17,402
Call.

1225
01:46:17,402 --> 01:46:18,945
Huck calls.

1226
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:22,050
Ralph Kaczynski can't be feeling
too good about this.

1227
01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:26,518
In fact, he probably feels a Iittle Iike
a bear who's walked into a trap.

1228
01:46:27,924 --> 01:46:30,757
Ralph Kaczynski has
kings and jacks, two pair.

1229
01:46:30,757 --> 01:46:32,258
Huck has a set of threes.

1230
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:36,021
Kaczynski needs a king or a jack.

1231
01:46:36,021 --> 01:46:40,533
Anything else, and Huck Cheever
has knocked him out of this tournament.

1232
01:46:42,739 --> 01:46:44,536
And the river.

1233
01:46:47,344 --> 01:46:49,244
And the river is a queen.

1234
01:46:49,244 --> 01:46:51,209
And Huck Cheever has won the pot.

1235
01:47:06,429 --> 01:47:11,196
Ralph Kaczynski wins 440,000,
with his fourth place finish.

1236
01:47:12,102 --> 01:47:14,468
We're down to our final three.

1237
01:47:22,879 --> 01:47:25,814
Yeah, that was smooth play, man.

1238
01:47:29,185 --> 01:47:31,380
Huck is first act on the button.

1239
01:47:53,543 --> 01:47:55,443
Huck calls 40,000.

1240
01:48:06,456 --> 01:48:09,254
L.C. raises to 1 00,000.

1241
01:48:11,795 --> 01:48:13,763
Jason folds.

1242
01:48:19,235 --> 01:48:21,760
-I'II just call.
-Huck calls.

1243
01:48:22,672 --> 01:48:24,367
What do you mean, "just call"?

1244
01:48:26,576 --> 01:48:29,636
Take it any way you want.
It's just a call.

1245
01:48:33,416 --> 01:48:34,747
And the flop.

1246
01:48:36,653 --> 01:48:39,952
The flop is seven, five, deuce, rainbow.

1247
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,352
Let's play for three.

1248
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:47,928
L.C. makes it 300,000.

1249
01:48:56,039 --> 01:48:57,597
Raise.

1250
01:48:59,843 --> 01:49:03,904
Your three, and three more.

1251
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:05,980
Huck raises to 600,000.

1252
01:49:07,450 --> 01:49:11,409
Interesting raise, Huckleberry.

1253
01:49:30,673 --> 01:49:32,334
Just call.

1254
01:49:34,944 --> 01:49:36,741
L.C. calls.

1255
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:43,251
Turn.

1256
01:49:44,988 --> 01:49:47,286
Turn is a deuce of spades.

1257
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:55,390
Another five to go.

1258
01:49:55,390 --> 01:49:58,500
L.C. bets 500,000.

1259
01:50:07,644 --> 01:50:09,669
-Call.
-Huck calls.

1260
01:50:09,669 --> 01:50:12,280
The pot is now two million dollars.

1261
01:50:14,951 --> 01:50:17,078
Now you smooth call.

1262
01:50:17,078 --> 01:50:18,220
The book says:

1263
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:22,484
"If you're holding the bullets now would
be the time to go over the top."

1264
01:50:22,484 --> 01:50:24,126
Go all-in.

1265
01:50:26,829 --> 01:50:28,296
The river.

1266
01:50:29,365 --> 01:50:31,265
River's the eight of hearts.

1267
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,436
So, here we are.

1268
01:50:39,776 --> 01:50:41,505
Here we are.

1269
01:50:43,313 --> 01:50:44,575
How much do you have?

1270
01:50:49,018 --> 01:50:51,213
About 650.

1271
01:51:06,169 --> 01:51:10,037
I think I have you, Huckleberry.
AII-in.

1272
01:51:10,037 --> 01:51:12,299
L.C Cheever is all-in.

1273
01:51:14,711 --> 01:51:16,372
Huck calls.

1274
01:51:16,372 --> 01:51:18,070
And he'II double up, or be out.

1275
01:51:22,552 --> 01:51:25,043
-Call.
-Huck calls.

1276
01:51:27,757 --> 01:51:29,816
L.C. has two kings.

1277
01:51:58,755 --> 01:52:01,747
Kings, nice hand.

1278
01:52:02,825 --> 01:52:04,292
They're good.

1279
01:52:05,328 --> 01:52:07,796
L.C. Cheever wins the pot.

1280
01:52:10,933 --> 01:52:12,423
Nice playing, Huck.

1281
01:52:30,653 --> 01:52:36,683
Huck Cheever, is our third place bencher,
winning 650,000 dollars.

1282
01:52:36,993 --> 01:52:38,358
Huck.

1283
01:53:01,451 --> 01:53:05,046
This is it, we're down to the final
two players for the world championship...

1284
01:53:05,046 --> 01:53:09,157
...L.C. Cheever and our chip Ieader,
Jason Keyes.

1285
01:53:09,157 --> 01:53:13,125
Make way for
the two point five million in cash.

1286
01:53:20,403 --> 01:53:26,000
Huck. I put you on queens, right.

1287
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,369
Right, queens.

1288
01:53:27,369 --> 01:53:29,704
Huck, could we have
a couple of words with you?

1289
01:53:29,704 --> 01:53:32,541
Knocked out by your own father.
Kind of cold-blooded, huh?

1290
01:53:32,541 --> 01:53:36,082
L.C. re-raises to 620,000.

1291
01:53:36,082 --> 01:53:37,412
Jason raises one more....

1292
01:53:37,412 --> 01:53:41,045
Well, somebody who understands
the game very well once said:

1293
01:53:41,045 --> 01:53:44,387
"Poker's cruel. You can't
have sympathy and win."

1294
01:53:44,387 --> 01:53:46,187
L.C. Cheever is all-in.

1295
01:53:46,187 --> 01:53:47,852
Excuse me.

1296
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:52,467
The action is for Jason Keyes.
This could be it.

1297
01:53:54,704 --> 01:53:57,400
-Call.
-Jason Keyes, calls.

1298
01:53:58,708 --> 01:54:02,804
L.C. has ace, king.

1299
01:54:02,804 --> 01:54:05,504
Jason Keyes has ace,
queen of diamonds.

1300
01:54:06,315 --> 01:54:10,012
Jason Keyes needs a queen,
and the river.

1301
01:54:11,587 --> 01:54:13,111
It's a queen.

1302
01:54:14,724 --> 01:54:17,557
Jason Keyes is a world
champion of poker.

1303
01:54:24,734 --> 01:54:30,229
And L.C. Cheever, our runner-up,
wins 1.3 million dollars.

1304
01:54:35,111 --> 01:54:37,477
Huck! Hey!

1305
01:54:44,687 --> 01:54:46,587
You had the bullets, didn't you?

1306
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:48,884
Your kings were good.

1307
01:54:48,884 --> 01:54:52,687
No. You gave it to me. Why?

1308
01:54:58,701 --> 01:55:01,329
Let's just say I thought it was your time.

1309
01:55:02,171 --> 01:55:05,937
Well, you were wrong about that.

1310
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:12,879
So, where to now? Back to France?

1311
01:55:12,879 --> 01:55:15,540
Tunica. Then Atlantic City.

1312
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:17,549
-Tournaments?
-Yeah.

1313
01:55:17,549 --> 01:55:22,157
They're flying a couple of us old-timers
down, comping the entrance fees.

1314
01:55:22,157 --> 01:55:25,658
The game is being marketed now.
They need celebrity gamblers.

1315
01:55:25,658 --> 01:55:30,765
Like everything else, they wanna pretend
it's the way it used to be.

1316
01:55:36,439 --> 01:55:37,963
Let's play.

1317
01:55:40,576 --> 01:55:41,702
-PIay?
-Yeah.

1318
01:55:41,702 --> 01:55:47,407
Right now. You and me. Head to head.
Come on. Like the old days.

1319
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:50,476
Do us both good.

1320
01:55:52,922 --> 01:55:54,685
CIear the air.

1321
01:55:56,225 --> 01:55:58,284
As far as I'm concerned, the air is clear.

1322
01:55:58,284 --> 01:56:00,622
Then you'II play better.

1323
01:56:03,132 --> 01:56:04,463
Come on.

1324
01:56:12,575 --> 01:56:14,600
Cut for deal.

1325
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:17,746
Angelina, we need
some change over here.

1326
01:56:22,051 --> 01:56:24,849
Got you! Pennies, nickels and dimes.

1327
01:57:01,524 --> 01:57:03,992
-Night, Billie.
-Night, Andy.

1328
01:57:15,071 --> 01:57:16,060
Can we talk?

1329
01:57:17,606 --> 01:57:20,700
Outside. I need some fresh air.

1330
01:57:21,344 --> 01:57:24,040
So, how did the tournament go?

1331
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:27,148
-Win some, Iose some.
-Easy come, easy go?

1332
01:57:27,148 --> 01:57:29,375
Yeah, same old story.

1333
01:57:31,087 --> 01:57:34,386
And the money's just
a way of keeping score.

1334
01:57:34,386 --> 01:57:36,047
Yeah.

1335
01:57:36,047 --> 01:57:39,922
Except for my Ieft pocket winnings.

1336
01:57:39,922 --> 01:57:42,530
The important money.

1337
01:57:46,669 --> 01:57:49,331
Four dollars and 37 cents.

1338
01:57:51,474 --> 01:57:54,739
Pennies, nickels and dimes.

1339
01:57:54,739 --> 01:57:57,845
Like on the kitchen table.

1340
01:58:01,884 --> 01:58:03,181
You got it.

1341
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,853
You Iet your father win
in the tournament, didn't you?

1342
01:58:10,493 --> 01:58:11,960
You were there.

1343
01:58:19,068 --> 01:58:20,763
Am I that easy to read?

1344
01:58:22,838 --> 01:58:25,272
When you know the tells.

1345
02:03:00,015 --> 02:03:04,008
Guess what, buddy?
You just Iost 20,000 dollars.

1346
02:03:04,008 --> 02:03:06,313
Thirty days. It's a month. You Iose.

1347
02:03:06,313 --> 02:03:10,254
Hate to tell you this,
there's 31 days in May.

1348
02:03:13,362 --> 02:03:15,387
Well, how many days in August?

1349
02:03:15,387 --> 02:03:17,293
-August?
-Yeah.

1350
02:03:17,293 --> 02:03:19,093
Thirty, I think.

1351
02:03:19,093 --> 02:03:21,395
-Double or nothing says there's 31.
-Bet!

1352
02:03:21,395 --> 02:03:22,594
Yo, buddy!

1353
02:03:30,145 --> 02:03:32,136
