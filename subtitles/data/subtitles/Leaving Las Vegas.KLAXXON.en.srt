00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,300
- To a wonderful film. You were great.
- Thank you.

2
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,420
- What a romantic you are.
- To the agency and my little protege.

3
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,340
Bless you.
Thank you, daddy.

4
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,700
Eight years at Berlitz,
that's what you learn?

5
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,500
He learned chin the first month
and then chin-chin.

6
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,380
Am I right?

7
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,820
I can't be clever.

8
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,900
It was really beautiful,
what you guys did.

9
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,740
It was beautiful,
and you guys are great.

10
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,140
I love the food here.

11
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,500
The nicest thing about the film
is that we get to handle guns.

12
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,420
- I had never done that.
- Peter.

13
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,860
- Very rare.
- What?

14
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,260
- How are you?
- Wow. Ben, how are you?

15
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,180
Outstanding, sir.

16
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,540
Excuse me.
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum.

17
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,780
- Of course.
- How are you?

18
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,540
- Sheila.
- Ladies.

19
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,100
- Hi, Ben.
- Nice to meet you.

20
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,660
I'm a big fan of your writing.
I thought Bay of Pigs was great.

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,020
Actually, I didn't write it,
I just got the credit. I was fired.

22
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,340
Didn't I talk to you a couple
of years ago when you both worked...

23
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,740
- at MGM with Laddie?
- That's right, by God.

24
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,620
So are you still at ICM?

25
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,580
- I'm at TriStar.
- You're at TriStar.

26
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,260
- You'll have to say hello to Mike.
- I will.

27
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,620
He's not there anymore,
but I'll hunt him down.

28
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,500
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

29
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,260
- Please?
- Be right back.

30
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,740
Hold the fort, kiddo.
I have my own office this way.

31
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,220
- What is the matter with him?
- He's sick.

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,500
I can't help you anymore.
Do you understand?

33
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,140
This is the last time. I promise.
I just need some cash tonight.

34
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,060
- How are you?
- I lost my credit cards.

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,860
The money will be on your desk
first thing in the morning.

36
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,700
How's the new one coming along?
I hear you got Dickie Gere.

37
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,380
- That is great, man.
- I got everybody in the movie.

38
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,260
Look, you're sick.

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,660
This is all I have in cash.

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,180
Please, don't drink it in here.

41
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,100
- Man.
- That's fine, Peter.

42
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,580
I'll messenger it over to you
in the morning.

43
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,460
I don't want it.

44
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,620
I think it would be the best thing
if you don't contact me again.

45
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,860
- What's your name?
- Terri.

46
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,740
- Terri, I am going to buy you a drink.
- I'm okay. Thanks.

47
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,740
Bud, please. Buy the lady a drink
and another one for you.

48
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,020
I'm Benjamin. Ben.

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,300
Benny Goodman, that's me.
I think you're sexy. That's right.

50
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,620
Look at those eyes.
Sexy like a kitty cat.

51
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
You turn me on

52
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,740
You're not too tall
You're not too short

53
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,500
You're not too round

54
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,020
You're like a cat
The cat in the hat

55
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,420
Look at those eyes.
Honest to God.

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,980
You're luminescent, baby.
What?

57
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,660
- You've been drinking all day.
- Of course.

58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,180
Speaking of drinks,
here is yours.

59
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,660
- Thanks.
- Down that hatch.

60
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,060
And here is mine.
Cheers. Come on.

61
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,380
There we go.
Let's do it to it.

62
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,420
I just thought
of an amazing concept.

63
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,540
What do you say
we finish these...

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,500
and we go back
to my apartment on the beach!

65
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,820
I'll throw a movie in the VCR...

66
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,660
and mix you up
a gooey blender drink.

67
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,020
Sound good? Sound sexy?

68
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,660
Bud, give me another.

69
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,380
I really wish you'd come home with me.
You're so cute.

70
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,140
I'm really good in bed too.
Believe me.

71
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,060
And you smell great...

72
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,940
and you look great
and your hair's great.

73
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,860
Look, I've got to wake up early
in the morning.

74
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,300
I have to go. Thank you.

75
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,700
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

76
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,980
Maybe I shouldn't breathe so much.

77
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,380
That's it, pal.
We're closing up now.

78
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,340
I'm gonna finish this.

79
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,220
Hey, Mr. Erection,
you want a date?

80
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,340
The room is 20.
You pay for it.

81
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,940
But only because I think...

82
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,100
that the concept of surrender...

83
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,580
fits with the big picture right now.

84
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,100
Hey, get outta the street!

85
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't remember
if I started drinking...

86
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,220
because my wife left me or...

87
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,420
my wife left me
'cause I started drinking.

88
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,340
Fuck it anyway!

89
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,820
Next, please.

90
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,660
One moment, sir.

91
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,820
Sign the back
of the check, please.

92
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,140
- Can't you just cash it as it is?
- Is there a problem?

93
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,500
I'm a little shaky right now.

94
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,020
I had brain surgery.

95
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,980
I'll go get some lunch,
and then I'll come back...

96
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,460
and take care of it then.

97
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,220
Next I'll have a gin and tonic.

98
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,020
Do you know what time it is?

99
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,380
You should be drinking coffee.

100
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,140
You're a young guy.

101
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,140
It's none of my business...

102
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,340
but if you could see
what I see...

103
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,700
you wouldn't be doing this
to yourself.

104
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,260
I understand
what you're saying.

105
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,980
I appreciate your concern.

106
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,300
It's not my intention
to make you uncomfortable.

107
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,540
Please, serve me today,
and I'll never come in here again.

108
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
If I do, you can 86 me.

109
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,580
Stop fucking with me!

110
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,900
I can 86 you anytime I want to.

111
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,660
I don't give a fuck what you do.

112
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,620
That one's on the house, son.

113
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,460
Were you in Los Angeles
for the earthquake?

114
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,740
- It was pretty scary.
- Did you have a lot of damage?

115
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,220
- Just a little bit.
- Are you desirable?

116
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,860
Are you irresistible?

117
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,100
Maybe if you drank bourbon with me,
it would help.

118
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,500
If you kissed me, and I could taste
the sting in your mouth, it would help.

119
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,180
If you drank bourbon with me naked...

120
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,980
if you smelled of bourbon
as you fucked me, it would help.

121
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,020
It would increase
my esteem for you...

122
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,620
if you poured bourbon on your naked body
and said to me, "Drink this."

123
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,580
If you spread your legs and you had
bourbon dripping from your breasts...

124
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,300
and your pussy and said,
"Drink here"...

125
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
then I could
fall in love with you.

126
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,740
Because then I would have a purpose:
to clean you up.

127
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,940
And that would prove...

128
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,300
that I'm worth something.

129
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,700
I'd lick you clean so that you could
go away and fuck someone else.

130
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,660
Our business is
to make our customers happy.

131
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,540
Next, please.

132
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,740
I am back.

133
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,460
I've got my check,
and, baby, I'm ready to sign.

134
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,100
There.

135
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,340
Steady as a fucking rock.
Excuse my French.

136
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,260
Want to have dinner with me?

137
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,060
But what's the back end like?

138
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,300
By the time we're through
with P and A...

139
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,100
the "above the line"
is gonna take it to about 15.

140
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,020
With something like this,
what would Disney think?

141
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,420
Messages.

142
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,620
What did Diller say?

143
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,300
Listen, I'm very busy.
Just kidding.

144
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,860
Can I call you back on this?

145
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,260
Ciao for now.

146
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,660
Could somebody fix the phones
around here?

147
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,980
- Good morning.
- Mr. Simpson's looking for you.

148
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,860
He wants you to go in
as soon as you get--

149
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,780
- Are you all right?
- Outstanding.

150
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,380
But I have to go
to a very important meeting.

151
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,780
Could make a couple million
for the company.

152
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,300
What?

153
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,900
You should go in there now.

154
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,500
- Hi, Bill.
- Take a seat.

155
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,700
We're gonna let you go.

156
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,740
This is too generous, Bill.

157
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,860
We really liked having you around,
but you know how it is.

158
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,860
What are you gonna do now?

160
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,060
I thought--

161
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,860
I thought
I'd move out to Las Vegas.

162
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,140
My name is Yuri Botsov.

163
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,220
Where you from, Yuri?

164
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,620
You sure don't sound like you come
from around these parts.

165
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,100
That is very true.

166
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,500
Very good observation.
I am from Latvia.

167
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,020
Very tough place.

168
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,420
I hear this,
but I am not a tough man.

169
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,700
I am a humble man who is here to learn
from my friends in the New World.

170
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,100
This must be Yuri's friend.

171
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,740
Sera is my gift to you all.

172
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,140
You will find her a very willing girl
for each of you...

173
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,220
just as we arranged.

174
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,620
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

175
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,900
Do you wanna watch?

176
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,780
Are you scared?

177
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,540
It's all right.

178
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,100
It's okay.

179
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,820
I bring out the best
in the men who fuck me.

180
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,380
It's not easy,
but I'm very good.

181
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,860
It's amazing. I haven't worked
for a really long time...

182
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,420
and I can just turn on a dime.

183
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,620
I can just become
who they want me to be.

184
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,220
I walk into that room,
I know right away...

185
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,420
this is their fantasy,
and I become it.

186
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,620
I'm that service.
I perform it, and I perform it well.

187
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,020
I'm an equation mostly.

188
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,180
Thirty minutes of my body
costs $300.

189
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,420
That's just to get into the room.

190
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,780
It's about $500 after that.
We negotiate.

191
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,460
But it's a performance.

192
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,940
It's definitely a performance.

193
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,580
I am very pleased with how
you've moved up in the world.

194
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,180
It is, after all,
a glamorous world I showed you.

195
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,300
Why did you leave me
in Los Angeles?

196
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,620
Because you are sly.

197
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,620
You knew there was more money
here in Las Vegas.

198
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,340
You don't need to fear me, Sera...

199
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,580
because we belong together.

200
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,940
Don't we?

201
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,140
- Are you lonely?
- I am lonely, Yuri.

202
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,900
So am l.

203
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,380
Janek, we called you last night!

204
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,620
There was no one home.

205
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,220
We're 30 miles
outside of Las Vegas.

206
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,060
Someone saw him there yesterday.

207
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,620
No, this is the end of it!

208
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,020
Yuri knew what he was doing.

209
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,300
That was a red light.

210
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,220
I walk, you stop.

211
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,260
Are you sorry?

212
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,220
Good.

213
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,260
Three towels in each room
and a complimentary bar of soap.

214
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,100
If you run out of soap,
you can buy an extra bar.

215
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,580
Feel free to use our pool,
but use it at your own risk.

216
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,700
- There are three towels in your room.
- Do you have vacancies?

217
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,020
We do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

218
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,860
Linens are provided for you.
Rooms are $29 a night.

219
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,900
You pay at the beginning of each week.
Maid service is optional.

220
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,340
Maid service is optional.
It costs $3.50 a day.

221
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,340
Feel free to use the pool,
but use it at your own risk.

222
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
We don't have a lifeguard.

223
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,220
No kids, no pets and no guests
after 11:00 at night.

224
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,140
You've been provided
with three towels.

225
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,020
We expect when you check out
there will still be three towels.

226
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,780
There's a complimentary
bar of soap.

227
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,460
I walked into the room,
and he was lying on the bed.

228
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,700
He had his arms
behind his head...

229
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,020
and there was
just hair everywhere.

230
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,780
He was really, really fat.

231
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,100
He had a large erection.

232
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,580
I remember he was so proud
of his large erection.

233
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,380
I asked him where my money was,
and he pointed to the dresser.

234
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,140
And then I asked him
what he wanted...

235
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,420
and he said,
"Lie down, I'm on top."

236
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,660
He started pounding me
really hard.

237
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,660
I had to bite my tongue
to keep from crying.

238
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,060
He did that for awhile,
and then I started to get up.

239
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,700
He pushed me back down,
and he held my hair.

240
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,020
He was pulling it,
and he stuck his penis in my mouth.

241
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,380
I tried to get up again,
and he said...

242
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,260
"Stay there, baby,
I'm gonna come on your face."

243
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,700
So he did.

244
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,540
Then he rubbed his semen
all over my face and in my hair.

245
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,460
Then he kicked me off the bed
and told me to leave.

246
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,900
- Are you working?
- What do you mean? I'm walking.

247
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,820
Just wait one second.

248
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,060
Great ass!

249
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,900
- Want some?
- Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?

250
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,020
That's pretty funny.

251
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,540
I wonder if you'll take $250
to fuck me?

252
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,620
That is, if you'll come
to my room for one hour...

253
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,900
I will give you $500.

254
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,020
- You're pretty drunk.
- Not really.

255
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,540
My room's not far.
It's The Whole Year lnn.

256
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,500
You could drive with me if you want
or we could walk.

257
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,100
Or I could give you cab fare.

258
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,700
- In the car.
- Whatever you want.

259
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,100
Why don't you give me the money
in the car?

260
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,860
I'm Ben.

261
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,100
I'm Sera.

262
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,500
Sarah with an "H"?

263
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,020
With an "E." S-e-r-a.

264
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,580
You wanna start the engine?

265
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,860
What this room needs
is more booze.

266
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,700
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

267
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,820
Want a drink?
I'm having one.

268
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,420
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila,
if you can spare it.

269
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,980
Your drink's here.

270
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,420
For 500 bucks, you can do
pretty much whatever you want.

271
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,100
- You can fuck my ass.
- Oh, my God.

272
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,740
You can come on my face.
Whatever you want to do.

273
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,300
Just keep it out of my hair.
I just washed it.

274
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,380
Just because my feet
were too big in the morning

275
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,620
Just because I can't remember
your mother's name

276
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:37,860
Just because I put the octopus
in the bed

277
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,580
Just because, because
because, because Bill Cosby

278
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,220
You wanna fuck now?

279
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,060
Maybe something to drink first.
More tequila?

280
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,460
Whatever.

281
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,380
What's the story?
Are you too drunk to come?

282
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,300
I don't care about any of that.

283
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:50,740
There's time left.
You can have more money.

284
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,620
You can drink all you want.

285
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,660
Just stay.
That's what I want.

286
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,540
I want you to talk or listen.

287
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,060
Just stay.

288
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,420
So, Ben with an "N"...

289
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,580
what brings you to Las Vegas?

290
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,100
Business convention?

291
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,900
I came here
to drink myself to death.

292
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,740
Cashed in all my money...

293
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,580
paid my American Express card...

294
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,660
gonna sell the car tomorrow.

295
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,060
How long is it gonna take
for you to...

296
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,500
drink yourself to death?

297
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,900
I think about four weeks.

298
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,340
I don't know for sure,
but I think.

299
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,980
I got enough
for about 250, $300 a day.

300
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,900
That should do it.

301
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,060
What am l? A luxury?

302
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,500
You're a luxury,
and your meter just ran out.

303
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,620
That's a nice watch.

304
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,060
You do like it?

305
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,940
You can talk
a little bit more.

306
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,180
I don't have to be anywhere.

307
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,900
Talk.

308
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
In Los Angeles...

309
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,220
I kept running out of booze
and the store would be closed...

310
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,340
because I forget
to look at my watch.

311
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,140
I used to live in Los Angeles.

312
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,620
But I don't anymore.

313
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,660
I think the tough times
are finally behind me.

314
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,660
There'll always
be bad things, but...

315
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,980
my life is good.

316
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,340
It is as I want it to be.

317
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,900
It's good.

318
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,980
It's good being here with you.

319
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,260
Shit.

320
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,260
Hey, Bill.
How are you?

321
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,620
Is this a full night's work?

322
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,940
I'm really sorry.

323
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,060
It was such a slow night,
and I couldn't score.

324
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,180
What do you think?

325
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,100
You're just a 16-year-old girl
on Hollywood Boulevard?

326
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,940
Is that what you think?
ls that what you play?

327
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,500
Here.

328
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,980
Go ahead.

329
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,540
I could kill you, Sera.

330
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,340
You work tonight,
and you bring me the money.

331
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,460
It doesn't matter how late.

332
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,780
I will.

333
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,500
He cut me a couple of times.

334
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,940
He'd always say,
"Never on the face."

335
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,620
So, he cut me right here.

336
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,740
He cried...

337
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,780
and I felt sorry for him.

338
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,020
In his mind,
I'd done something bad...

339
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,540
but in my mind
I hadn't done anything bad.

340
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,620
He's kind of paranoid.

341
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,540
This ring is a ruby.
It's my lucky ring.

342
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,140
This watch is real gold.
It's not plated.

343
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,500
It's the real thing.
Feel how heavy it is.

344
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,300
- These rings, $3,000.
- One thousand.

345
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,260
One thousand?
Look what you're getting.

346
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,340
It's a ruby. It's my lucky ring.
It's a beautiful thing.

347
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,460
I can put that in.
Two thousand dollars.

348
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,260
- I can't give you more than a thousand.
- But I just added the ring.

349
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,420
- Synthetic ruby.
- Look--

350
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,620
What can I do for you?

351
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,260
Five hundred.

352
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,940
Five hundred dollars
for a 1993 Rolex Daytona watch.

353
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,300
I'll do it.

354
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,340
- How are you doin'?
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

355
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,780
Are you here for the convention?

356
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,780
I didn't think I was that obvious.

357
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,180
- It was just a wild guess.
- My name's Paul, honey.

358
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,500
- Vodka Seven.
- And for the lady?

359
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,980
- Are you ready for another one?
- Sure.

360
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,140
- I'll have a margarita.
- Good choice.

361
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,740
Are you alone?

362
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,380
Or are you using me
to make someone jealous?

363
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,340
Alone. I'm here alone.

364
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,300
Thank you.

365
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,340
Cheers.

366
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,180
Where are you staying?

367
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,420
Right here at the hotel.
Why?

368
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,260
I thought
you might be looking for a date.

369
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,620
"A date"?
What are you, a hooker?

370
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,100
What exactly do you mean
by a date?

371
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,260
I got a wife waiting
for me at home.

372
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,100
- I just came over to talk.
- I'm sorry. I guess I misunderstood.

373
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,820
- I guess you did.
- Just keep your voice down.

374
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,060
I won't bother you again.

375
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,620
Here, have another one on me.

376
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,180
Christ.

377
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,420
Maybe you should give it a miss
for tonight.

378
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,060
I don't know, it's just--

379
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,940
I really like this guy.
I've never felt anything...

380
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:14,540
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

381
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,500
It's weird.
I feel kind of confused about it.

382
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,860
We were with each other
only one night...

383
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,060
but I felt like
the relationship--

384
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,220
I felt like there was
a relationship being formed.

385
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,180
I was kind of scared.

386
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,420
I don't think
I should see him again.

387
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,340
But I look for him.

388
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,100
I went out last night.
I was looking for him.

389
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,140
Where's your car?

390
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,620
I sold it this morning.

391
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,220
I'm gonna take cabs from now on.

392
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,900
What's it tonight?
Another 500 to watch you sleep?

393
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,140
- What's up?
- I was looking for you tonight.

394
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,940
I don't know
if you have a boyfriend...

395
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,700
or a girlfriend...

396
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,500
but, if you have
some free time...

397
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,980
I thought maybe
we could get some dinner.

398
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,220
Are you serious?

399
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,540
I think you know I'm serious.

400
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,820
I'll pay you if you like,
but I just want to see you.

401
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,860
I can't have dinner with you.

402
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,860
We could get prime rib.

403
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,500
They've got it on sale for $2.99.

404
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,780
I love that dress.

405
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,820
I had a really good night.

406
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,300
I think things
are finally picking up.

407
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,220
We made so much money.
Look.

408
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,900
Come here.

409
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,900
Now listen.
Do you hear?

410
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,220
They're talking about me.

411
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,580
Are you all right?

412
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,460
Get out.

413
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,020
Do not come back here.
I'll not see you again.

414
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,740
Do you still wanna have dinner?

415
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,900
I think I put too much salt on it.

416
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,340
- It's not good.
- It's good.

417
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:38,020
- Why are you a drunk?
- Why am I a drunk?

418
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,500
Is that really
what you want to ask me?

419
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,500
Then this is our first date
or our last.

420
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,900
Until now,
I wasn't sure it was either.

421
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,660
First.

422
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,580
It's our first.

423
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,380
I just wanna know.

424
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,980
Why are you killing yourself?

425
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,260
Interesting choice of words.

426
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:17,140
I don't remember.
I just know that I want to.

427
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,580
Is your drinking a way
to kill yourself?

428
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,220
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

429
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,180
Shoot.

430
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,020
Can I have another one?

431
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,620
What are you thinking?
Are you angry?

432
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,580
Good night.

433
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,140
-I had the most wonderful--
-Why don't you stay at my place tonight?

434
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,020
Look, you're pretty drunk.

435
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:41,740
- I like you. I trust you.
- Wow. That's astonishing, Sera.

436
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,180
I hate to think of you
in that cheesy motel.

437
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,860
I'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow
if it makes you feel better.

438
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,020
Let's talk about tomorrow.
Do you want to do something?

439
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,860
We'll talk about it tonight
at my place.

440
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,860
I'm not much good in the sack.

441
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,780
It's not about sex.

442
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,180
I'll make you up a bed
on the sofa.

443
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,660
We'll talk till late.
We'll sleep till late.

444
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,540
As you know,
I am my own boss.

445
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,900
Do it, Ben.

446
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,700
I'll do it.

447
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,100
This is the home of an angel.

448
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,900
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

449
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,180
You look extremely beautiful.

450
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,100
I do?

451
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,900
It's really weird because...

452
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,660
you know...

453
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,380
it's just like
this thing's happening...

454
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,300
really quickly.

455
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,420
I just don't know
what's going on.

456
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,140
Just the second I met him,
and the way I said my name.

457
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,380
I just said, "Hi, my name's Sera,"
and that's not what I do.

458
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,980
And it's just--

459
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,500
It's all happening really quickly.

460
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:51,380
I just felt like
we've been together for a long time.

461
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,380
It just felt so easy...

462
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,580
and I felt like--

463
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,980
I felt like I was me.

464
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,420
I didn't feel like I was...

465
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,300
trying to be somebody else.

466
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,780
When is your rent coming up
at the motel?

467
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,700
What do you mean?

468
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:41,060
I think you should go
and bring all your stuff over here.

469
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,700
- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

470
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,020
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

471
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,340
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

472
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,660
These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

473
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,620
I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

474
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,700
Right now I feel really good.

475
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,420
You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

476
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,660
But that won't last forever.

477
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,580
All right,
you go back to your motel.

478
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,300
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

479
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,540
The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash...

480
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,980
to take the taste
of come out of my mouth.

481
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:56,340
I'm tired of being alone.
That's what I'm tired of.

482
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,420
Don't you like me, Ben?

483
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,980
What you don't understand is--
No. See? No.

484
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,660
What?

485
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:37,260
You can never, never...

486
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,660
ask me to stop drinking.

487
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,780
Do you understand?

488
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,140
I do.

489
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,860
I really do.

490
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,300
I'm nuts about you.

491
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,300
We didn't know...

492
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,740
- whether to call the police.
- He has been here about half an hour.

493
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,940
- I know that--
- Mickey had seen you two together.

494
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:00,100
I wasn't opening the door.
I don't know who, I don't know where...

495
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,340
I don't know what,
I don't know whatever these days.

496
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,740
He's my friend. I'm sorry.
He must have had too much to drink.

497
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,380
That's why I had him patch the key code.
Because he's not gonna do it.

498
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,140
I'll help him inside.
Thank you so much.

499
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,220
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- No trouble.

500
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,620
You just give me a call
if you need any help.

501
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,260
Ben, can you wake up?

502
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,380
We gotta go inside,
but I have some presents for you.

503
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,860
Up we go.

504
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,300
- Here we go.
- This is Mrs. Van Houten.

505
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,940
This is Ben.

506
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,500
Outstanding, sir.

507
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,220
All right.
Here we go.

508
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,020
- You're okay?
- I'm fine.

509
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,740
- Good.
- I'm so sorry to bother you.

510
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,620
- Thank you for being so nice.
- Sure.

511
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,500
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

512
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,100
Sorry.
I was miles away.

513
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,100
The gifts.

514
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,900
I love that name.

515
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,260
Before we proceed onwards,
there's something I have to say.

516
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,900
I've come this far.
Here I am, in your house.

517
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,380
- Let me pay this month's rent.
- Why?

518
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,940
Because--

519
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,940
Because it's better for me
that way.

520
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:47,140
I'll tell you right now...

521
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,300
I'm in love with you.

522
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,140
But, be that as it may,
I am not here...

523
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,780
to force my twisted soul
into your life.

524
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,140
I know that.

525
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,820
We both know I'm a drunk.

526
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,860
And I know you're a hooker.

527
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,700
I hope you understand
that I'm a person...

528
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,220
who is totally
at ease with this...

529
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,380
which is not to say that
I'm indifferent or I don't care.

530
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,500
I do.

531
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,460
It simply means I trust
and accept your judgment.

532
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,380
I was really worried
about how that would be...

533
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,100
but now I'm not.

534
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,300
But you should know that included
with the rent around here...

535
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,420
is a complimentary blow job.

536
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,420
I suppose sooner or later
we ought to fuck.

537
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,620
Whatever that means.

538
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,140
- Open your presents.
- Presents!

539
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,020
All right.

540
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,540
Open this one first.

541
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,420
Very nice.

542
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,260
This should go very nicely
with my suit...

543
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,380
which, by the way,
is the only item of clothing...

544
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,780
I brought over
from the motel with me.

545
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,380
Right.
The suitcase was clinking.

546
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,260
What did you do
with your clothes?

547
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,180
I threw them out,
which was perhaps immoral...

548
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,980
but I wanted to come to you clean,
so to speak.

549
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,020
Thought we'd go shopping
for a pair of jeans...

550
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,060
and 45 pairs of underwear,
and just throw one out each day.

551
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,820
That's nice talk, Ben.
Keep drinking.

552
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:58,300
Between the 101-proof breath
and the occasional drool...

553
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,020
some interesting words
fall from your mouth.

554
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,860
It looks like
I'm with the right girl.

555
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,460
I'm very impressed
you would buy this for me.

556
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,660
I'm gonna fill it right now.

557
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,060
Do you want
to go gambling tonight?

558
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,700
I was thinking we could go
and just play for a few hours.

559
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,540
I hadn't planned to gamble...

560
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,740
but if you could keep
the bulk of my money...

561
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,900
I could safely blow
a couple hundred bucks.

562
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,340
Giving you money
makes me want to come.

563
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,340
Then come.

564
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,020
I'm sorry.

565
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,940
I love you.

566
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,540
- You got a 13.
- Hit me.

567
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,140
- Wait. She's got a seven.
- I don't know. You tell me.

568
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,500
- Hit.
- I'm busted. That's all right.

569
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,820
You got it.
You can do it.

570
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,220
Wait a minute!
Really? Oh, man!

571
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,660
- What?
- He's okay.

572
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,060
Do you want anything?

573
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:04,020
Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.
Can you make that?

574
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,780
What?

575
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,860
Fuck you! Fuck!
You fucker!

576
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,620
That boy is--
You can't judge me!

577
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,100
You! I am his father!

578
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,580
Get up!

579
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,060
Let's go, guys.

580
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,740
How are you?

581
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,220
Very well.

582
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,260
I never expected
to have to ask this again...

583
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,500
but how did our evening go?

584
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,740
I remember getting
to the casino.

585
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,300
And I remember kissing you.
That was really nice.

586
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,660
And then playing blackjack...

587
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,740
and then security came.

588
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,220
But after that, everything's a blank.
What happened?

589
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,420
They wanted to carry you out
and dump you onto the street...

590
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:55,300
but I talked them
into letting me walk you out.

591
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,540
That's impressive.

592
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,460
How did you do that?

593
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,620
I told them
that you were an alcoholic...

594
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,620
and that I would take you home...

595
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,340
and that we would never
go in there ever again.

596
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,060
"We"?

597
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,660
That's amazing.

598
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,700
What are you?

599
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:42,340
Some sort of angel visiting me
from one of my drunk fantasies?

600
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,820
How can you be so good?

601
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,580
I don't know
what you're saying.

602
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,660
I'm just using you.

603
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,020
I need you.

604
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:09,220
Can we not talk about it anymore?
Not a word.

605
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:14,380
You go back to sleep...

606
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,340
and I'll go out
and get us some breakfast.

607
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,820
- Will you be careful?
- Don't worry.

608
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,140
Ben, I'm working tonight.

609
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,220
I know.

610
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,100
I fuckin' talk all the time
because you never fuckin' listen to me!

611
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,500
- So fuck you!
- Shut the fuck up.

612
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:15,100
I'd like a beer
and a double Kamikaze, please.

613
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,340
We mustn't kick the bar.
We lean into the bar.

614
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,620
Just lean into the railing.

615
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,100
It's not vino veritaz.
It's en vino veritaz.

616
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,180
Who the fuck are you talking to?

617
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:33,820
Little brown-nosed gnomes
with a slingshot.

618
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:42,900
- To be in drunk.
- Lean into the bar?

619
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,220
You lean into the bar.

620
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,060
My boyfriend over there
is really boring the shit out of me...

621
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,420
and I was wondering
if you would buy me a drink?

622
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,980
Do you mind
if I buy her a drink?

623
01:06:55,060 --> 01:07:00,060
- I don't care what you do with her.
- I'll have a rum and Coke, please.

624
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,380
Barman, a rum and Coke.

625
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:09,300
Can I stay with you for awhile?

626
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:13,100
You mean move in with me?
lsn't this a bit sudden?

627
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,460
I don't have a lot of things.

628
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,300
I don't think my wife
would dig it very much.

629
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:25,780
Then maybe we should just go
to a motel and fuck all day.

630
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,860
I could suck you like this.

631
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:31,420
I'm sure fucking you
would be wonderful...

632
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:36,220
but it's almost impossible for me
to imagine being with someone else.

633
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,980
Now listen, asshole,
I'm not just gonna sit here...

634
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,220
and watch her suck on your ear!

635
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,620
Shut the fuck up!

636
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,780
I am sorry...

637
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,500
but she and I have decided to spend
a few hours together...

638
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,620
in a motel.

639
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,980
And after that, caviar.

640
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,460
Baby, wait up!

641
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,540
You're quite a fighter.

642
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,620
Here.

643
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:22,620
Listen,
this may sound silly...

644
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,540
but I have to ask you
to leave.

645
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,820
It's what we do around here
when there's a fight.

646
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,820
The men's room
is around the back.

647
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,420
Sexy.

648
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,020
I'm back.

649
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,300
Oh, my God.

650
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,860
- Did I scare you?
- What happened?

651
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,180
Fuck, Ben.
Did you get in a fight?

652
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,500
I thought you said
you didn't fight.

653
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:04,020
How do you feel?

654
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:07,980
Like the kling-klang king
of the rim-ram room.

655
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,900
Did you stop at a bar?

656
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,620
Did you say something stupid
to somebody stupid?

657
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,500
Absolutely not.

658
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:21,020
I was defending the honor
of some poor wayward maiden.

659
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,940
I bet you were.

660
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,820
Why don't you go take a shower
and put on your other shirt?

661
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:36,500
Then we'll go shopping
and buy you some new clothes.

662
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,900
I think this shirt is unlucky.

663
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,260
Not at all.

664
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,140
Your blood tastes good.

665
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,180
We got eggs.

666
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,780
I always had a fantasy
of being a flamenco dancer.

667
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,380
I think you look great.

668
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,300
We'll just get you a bow tie...

669
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:02,380
and then you can be one
of those blackjack dealers.

670
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,060
- All right?
- They wear it because they have to.

671
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,780
I'll wear it
because I want to...

672
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,020
which will make me
look different.

673
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,500
Let's get a drink!

674
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,340
- What is that?
- What?

675
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,860
Holy cow.
It came out of your ear!

676
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,380
I didn't have time
to write you a card...

677
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,740
with you breathing down
my neck all day...

678
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,860
so you'll just have
to wing it, baby.

679
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,580
Open it.

680
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,140
They're your color.

681
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,820
I think you should wear
one of them at a time.

682
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:53,060
One of these
and one of your other ones.

683
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,380
I was gonna buy you just one...

684
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,500
but I didn't think it would fly.

685
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:01,020
Nurse!
As a gift, I mean.

686
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,100
I'll wear them tonight.

687
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,180
One of them.

688
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,220
Tonight.

689
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,980
Put it on.

690
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,940
I can't get it.

691
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,900
I'll help you.

692
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,820
You'll be able to feel it,
sharp and hot under your ear...

693
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,220
as one of the brothers
is putting your head facedown...

694
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:48,540
into one
of the penthouse pillows.

695
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,460
Wait!

696
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,460
Maybe you should wait.

697
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,700
- Why?
- You can tell.

698
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,620
She really wants you to.

699
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,180
Maybe I should
follow you around...

700
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:06,900
and ask one of your tricks
what it's like to sleep with you.

701
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,820
They wouldn't know.

702
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,380
Maybe you should ask me
sometime.

703
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,620
Be happy to show you.

704
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:22,660
I'm gonna be home around 3:00.

705
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,940
If you're back, we could
watch some TV or something.

706
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:32,940
What I'm saying is that I hope
you're back when I get home.

707
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,260
Be careful.

708
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,060
You be careful too.

709
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,500
I'm gonna miss you.

710
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,700
I know this really cool place
in the desert.

711
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,620
We could go away
for a couple days.

712
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,180
I'd like that.

713
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:21,060
I make comic faces and...

714
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,540
stand on my head and grin at you
between my legs and...

715
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:28,740
I know loads of jokes.

716
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,660
Wouldn't stand a chance,
would l?

717
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:46,140
You did tell me
I ought to find myself a girl.

718
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,820
I like it here with you.

719
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,940
Let's stay for awhile.

720
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,580
- Need a mix master.
- What?

721
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:38,740
Just sort of take everything
and blend it all together.

722
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,940
Take this off.

723
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,260
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

724
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,300
I want my drinky.

725
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,540
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

726
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,740
You're bleeding.
Wait. Hold it.

727
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:45,060
- There's glass in here.
- I'm like a prickly pear!

728
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:49,220
- I'm a prickly pear!
- Go inside.

729
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:53,860
- I wanna clean up the glass.
- Go inside. I'll take care of it.

730
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,620
Are you sure?

731
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:58,180
All right.

732
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:14,180
- Everybody okay?
- We're fine.

733
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,420
I'm so sorry.
We'll pay for the table...

734
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,260
- and I'll clean this up.
- Don't worry.

735
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,940
You seem prepared for accidents.

736
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,060
We get a lot of screwups here.

737
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:31,780
You two take your loud talk
and your liquor to your room.

738
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,500
You check out
first thing tomorrow.

739
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,060
I don't want to see
either of you here ever again.

740
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,140
Don't you worry
about paying for anything.

741
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,220
And don't you worry about cutting
your little hands on the glass.

742
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,900
Let's just leave it at that.

743
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,660
See you in the morning.

744
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,620
I'm in here, Ben.

745
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,060
I bought some plain rice.

746
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:25,500
You probably don't want
to hear it right now, but...

747
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,780
I think it's something
that you could eat.

748
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,260
If you get hungry,
will you let me know?

749
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,500
I think I'm ready for rice.

750
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,060
I want you to see a doctor.

751
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:03,140
I'm not gonna see a doctor.

752
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,660
Maybe it's time
I moved to a hotel.

753
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,140
And do what?

754
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:17,580
Rot away in a room?

755
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,140
We're not gonna talk about that.

756
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,100
Fuck you.

757
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,180
You're staying here.

758
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,660
You're not going to any motel.

759
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,020
It's just one thing
you can do for me.

760
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,100
That's all I ask.

761
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:46,140
I've given you
gallons of free will.

762
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,660
You can do this one thing for me!

763
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,620
I have to go to work now.

764
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,260
Snake eyes!

765
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,620
Five!

766
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:16,580
Boxcars!

767
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:33,020
Five!

768
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:37,500
- Are you in for the convention?
- What?

769
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,780
You're making me really hot.

770
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:21,900
Perhaps I could crash on the couch
for a few hours and then leave.

771
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:23,460
Get out.

772
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,740
I was wondering
how much it would cost?

773
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,660
Sorry, guys.
I don't know what you mean.

774
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,980
- Anyway, I only date one guy at a time.
- Wait. We got money.

775
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,420
Show her the fucking money.

776
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,420
- How much are you willing to spend?
- How much do you want?

777
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,860
Two hundred for an hour?

778
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,420
- Don't your friends talk?
- Sure.

779
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,900
- Get this on camera.
- Smile.

780
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:50,260
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

781
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,420
- Do you want something to drink?
- I'm fine. Where's the money?

782
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,860
Money.

783
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,220
Twenty, forty, sixty,
eighty, a hundred.

784
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,220
- Get it on camera, dude.
- Two hundred dollars.

785
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:08,340
- All right, who's first?
- Hold on a second.

786
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:11,220
Miser! You've gotta get him
on camera when he comes out.

787
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,900
- Come on.
- Look, you two go downstairs.

788
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,820
I'll be half an hour
and then--

789
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,140
The only thing is,
we really wanna get him on tape.

790
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:20,300
This is his first time.
Come on, Miser!

791
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,700
We just wanna see him.

792
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:38,220
- Ask her the question, man.
- Ask her. Come on, ask her.

793
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:43,340
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Nobody's doing any of that.

794
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:46,540
You're all going straight,
one at a time, and then I'm outta here.

795
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:47,980
- You hear me?
- Ask again.

796
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:51,340
- How much to fuck you up the butt?
- He said it again!

797
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:54,700
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Fuck one of your friends in the butt.

798
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:59,660
- I'm outta here.
- Wait. What did she say?

799
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:01,740
- Get out of my fuckin' way.
- What did you say? Hold on.

800
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:05,020
- Get the fuck out of my way!
- Don't fuckin' push me!

801
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,780
What the fuck is your problem?

802
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:13,980
Look, I'm really sorry, guys.
Let's just calm down.

803
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:16,500
I'm sorry.
Just calm down.

804
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:23,580
- Fuck, Miser.
- Shit.

805
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,020
- Shit.
- Fuck.

806
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,620
Where you headed?

807
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,060
421 Vista.

808
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:24,340
I couldn't help but notice
you had a little trouble sittin' down.

809
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:27,340
You get a back door delivery
you weren't expectin'?

810
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:33,780
You gonna be able
to pay for this?

811
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:37,620
I asked you a question.
You got money?

812
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:42,260
- I'll let you out here, sister.
- I have money.

813
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:46,380
All right.
Don't take it out on me.

814
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:49,100
I'm just covering my ass.

815
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:51,700
Somethin' maybe you should have
thought about doing.

816
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,140
Get her, Miser.

817
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,540
Here, I got her.

818
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,860
Fuckin' bite me.

819
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,740
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Van Houten.

820
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:55,220
I am sorry, but we have to ask you
to be out by the end of the week.

821
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,300
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He hasn't checked back in.

822
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:46,820
What is your problem?
You're on strike?

823
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:04,780
Out.

824
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,340
What's the problem?

825
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:11,980
We don't want you in here.
That's the problem.

826
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,900
Come on. Let's go.

827
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:17,740
Let go of my arm.
If you want me outta here--

828
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:21,100
- I don't wanna be outta here.
- You're going out.

829
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:27,340
Next time it won't be
so fuckin' easy.

830
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:03,700
It ain't none of my business,
but what in the hell happened to you?

831
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:08,220
I had an argument.

832
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,460
Must have been
a hell of an argument.

833
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:12,740
If I was you, I'd leave him.

834
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,620
A pretty,
young lady like you--

835
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:19,380
You can get any man you want.
Don't you know that?

836
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,420
Where the fuck are you?

837
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,780
Give me the address.

838
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,980
It's so dark in here.

839
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:06,700
You're so sick...

840
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,380
so pale.

841
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,260
My love.

842
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,300
You're my love.

843
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,860
Do you want help?

844
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:30,020
Do you want my help?

845
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:36,220
I want to see you.

846
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,660
You're my angel.

847
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,980
I'm right here.

848
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,860
What happened?

849
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:02,580
Something went wrong,
but I'm okay.

850
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,940
I'm sorry I put us asunder.

851
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,420
It's okay.

852
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,340
Let me do it.

853
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,180
There. There you go.

854
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,820
See how hard
you make me, angel?

855
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:49,860
You know I love you.

856
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:57,860
I know.

857
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:35,420
I love you.

858
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:35,660
I think the thing is...

859
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:39,540
we both realized that
we didn't have that much time...

860
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:42,420
and...

861
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:47,340
I accepted him for who he was.

862
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:51,980
I didn't expect him to change.

863
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:56,500
I think he felt that for me too.

864
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,300
I liked his drama.

865
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:06,220
And he needed me.

866
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:11,460
I loved him.
