00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,291
I'm an attorney and this
isn't how I argue a case.

2
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:28,930
You're getting on my nerves!

3
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,898
This building has been here 75 years.
It deserves to remain for the community...

4
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,594
...because it represents
the ideals of that time!

5
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:39,538
The community deserves to have
this as a landmark. It is something to...

6
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,577
And we're removing it from
our children's children. You go back here.

7
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,375
This a community theater, and everyone
should benefit from this building!

8
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,078
This is your last warning!
We got a permit to take down this building!

9
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,985
I have a permit that allows me
to gather for the purpose...

10
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:58,059
...of expressing my constitutionally
protected right of free speech!

11
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:01,720
- You want to get killed, lady?
- Sir, according to city code...

12
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,992
- Forget about your code!
- Section 245: If a landmark's committee...

13
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:10,869
- Forget about the code, lady!
- When a landmark's committee decision...

14
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,134
- Lady, you're in violation here!
- Have you ever read the Constitution?

15
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,642
Take it up, Charlie!
Watch this constitution.

16
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:19,111
- Do you read?
- Come on, clear the area!

17
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,250
Yeah, you're clear. Go ahead.

18
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:29,090
Okay, you guys,
this is just a scare tactic.

19
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,659
- That's all this is.
- Well, it's sort of working.

20
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:36,424
Meryl, they do productions from the Y here,
productions with little people!

21
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,832
<i>The Nutcracker</i> and <i>Hair.</i> We have
to lie down in protest. Take out your mats.

22
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,696
Here, I've got your protective eye gear,
your sun block and your wet naps.

23
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,936
- Everybody, lie down in protest!
- You better get out of the way.

24
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,877
- We will prevail!
- You will go to jail!

25
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,609
Tom! Lock arms.

26
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:58,811
- I'm not feeling great about this.
- Have a little faith, please.

27
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,082
Meryl, would you marry me?

28
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:03,850
Really?

29
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:08,258
Oh, my God! Yes!

30
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:11,161
Shut this down, Charlie.

31
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:19,066
- I love you.
- Hey, you guys, they stopped.

32
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:23,235
You're good luck. There is justice
in the world. We prevailed!

33
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,381
Lunatic!

34
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,578
Crazy lady!

35
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,619
- We should call our parents.
- Guys, here are your wet naps.

36
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,817
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks. We had a good time.

37
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:39,325
- I'm glad. Bye.
- Bye.

38
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,793
Bye. Thank you.

39
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:44,297
I'll pay you back
this time, guys. I promise.

40
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:48,335
What are parents for, if not to bail
their daughter and her friends out of jail?

41
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:51,098
So did they knock it down?

42
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:57,106
I'm not getting through to people.
Why don't people respond to me?

43
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,938
Honey, Wade Corporation is not people,
it's a heartless profit machine.

44
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,210
And it's getting worse all the time.

45
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,513
They're bidding
on the Surf Avenue lot.

46
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:08,179
They wanna put up condos
and tear down the center.

47
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,088
Wait, our community center?
My community center?

48
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,626
Come on, honey,
let's discuss it over dinner.

49
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:17,594
No, Dad, you know what? I'm just tired.
I think I'll just go home.

50
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:36,012
<i>Hi, honey, it's Ansel.</i>

51
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:38,847
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna</i>
<i>make it back for your birthday.</i>

52
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:43,049
<i>We got a lot of new trainees onboard</i>
<i>and they put the green in Greenpeace.</i>

53
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,956
<i>But I'm saving whales</i>
<i>and thinking of you. Love you.</i>

54
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,724
Yeah, hi, Mr. Wong. Lucy Kelson.

55
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,698
Fine. I would like a number 17...

56
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,637
...a number fou... Number five.

57
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:03,438
No. Number seven? Seven.

58
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:08,880
Can I get the number four
without the garlic sauce?

59
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:14,991
Okay, and then maybe
two orders of number 26.

60
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,557
And...

61
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,754
Yes, it's for one.

62
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:23,326
And that's it.
No! Give me a number eight.

63
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,160
Give me two number eights.

64
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,323
Okay.

65
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:27,696
Okay.

66
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,771
Okay. Bye.

67
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:55,455
When they told me I'd been chosen
the Medical Center's Man of the Year...

68
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,496
...I assumed it had
something to do with...

69
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,261
...the millions we have contributed
to the new pediatric wing.

70
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:04,532
But as it turns out, I had my appendix
removed earlier this year...

71
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,301
...and under anesthesia,
I apparently proposed marriage...

72
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,069
...to every nurse in the hospital.

73
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,347
Including the many attractive male nurses.

74
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,576
Why are pediatrics
so important to Wade?

75
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,984
I think feet are very important,
aren't they?

76
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:24,024
I'm just teasing. I know there's
more to pediatrics than feet.

77
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:28,027
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Always nice to see you.

78
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,563
- George, congratulations.
- Hey, Terry, how are you?

79
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,360
- Still slicing people up?
- Indeed.

80
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,627
Yeah, I bet you are.

81
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:37,830
Hi, there. Oh, yes, the Emile family.
Lovely. So good.

82
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,942
- Hi.
- Nice to see you. Take care.

83
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,170
Melanie Corman.
Hospital administration.

84
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:47,714
My friend Elaine Cominsky wants
to meet you, but she's shy. Is that okay?

85
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,512
That's fine. I've been too nervous
to meet Elaine myself.

86
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:54,588
- Good. Don't move. Great tie, by the way.
- Thanks. I was rather nervous about it.

87
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:55,746
- Hey.
- Hey.

88
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:59,417
- Hey, your brother wants to see you.
- What? Now? Tonight?

89
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:04,259
Yeah, that's what he said. Although
sometimes it's hard to tell with the accent.

90
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,526
This is Elaine.

91
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:09,899
- Oh, hello.
- Hi. Would you sign my <i>GQ</i>?

92
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,341
Oh, <i>GQ</i>! I see what you mean.

93
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,410
Sorry, I thought it was a medical term.
You had me all excited.

94
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:21,215
- "To Elaine, George Wade."
- Thank you.

95
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:22,544
Hang on just one second.

96
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:25,812
There's no way I'm running up
to Westchester just because he calls.

97
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,616
It's absurd. He'll just have to wait.

98
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,726
- Right on. Hey, man, forget him.
- Yeah.

99
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:34,055
- Should I get the car?
- Yes, get the car.

100
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:50,740
- Good evening, Mr. George.
- Good evening, Rosario.

101
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:54,440
- Excellent new hairdo.
- Mr. George.

102
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,246
No, I'm serious. You look like
a young Imelda Marcos.

103
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,821
- Hello, George.
- Hello, Helen.

104
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,653
Don't you think Rosario
looks particularly lovely tonight?

105
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:08,524
I hadn't really noticed.
Rosario, the children need baths, please.

106
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,666
Yes, Miss Helen.

107
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,295
- So how are the kids, apart from dirty?
- They're fine.

108
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,633
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd love some Milk Duds.

109
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:20,667
We don't have any.
I could send out for one.

110
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:25,109
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
If you're going to send out, get a whole box.

111
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,316
- Howard is in the gym.
- Right.

112
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:34,719
Forty-five minutes, 6.5 miles an hour,
at an elevation of three.

113
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,652
It's incredible how much
more relaxed I feel.

114
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,630
- Helen does an hour a day too.
- Yes, you both seem extremely relaxed.

115
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,496
You can cut the relaxation with a knife.

116
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,002
So why am I here, Howie?

117
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,637
We lost the West Side waterfront deal
because your chief counsel...

118
00:09:55,811 --> 00:10:00,043
...your latest model/attorney...

119
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:03,208
...forgot to file
an Environmental Impact Report.

120
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:06,082
I will admit that the law
is not Amber's strong point.

121
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,587
- That's why I fired her.
- No, I fired her.

122
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:12,250
Just as I fired Debbie
from St. Barts' Law School...

123
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,397
...and Stacy from Online Law School.

124
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:20,058
I want someone from Yale or Columbia
or from the continental United States.

125
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,835
Women of that level of intellectual ability
often find me shallow.

126
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,531
- Then hire a man.
- Don't be absurd.

127
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,700
Because they wouldn't sleep with you?

128
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,245
No, because it would make you
and Dad too happy.

129
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,682
Dad has been dead for 10 years.

130
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,149
Well, there is no reason for him
to start enjoying himself now.

131
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:44,019
You need someone who can write
a brief instead of removing yours.

132
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:46,457
And she can handle your divorce
while she's at it.

133
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:49,393
You are still getting divorced?

134
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:55,902
Unless my ex-wife decides to fall in love
with me again, or for the first time, yeah.

135
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,841
No! Why do you always
find that so funny?

136
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,707
- It's very hard to say.
- Hire a real attorney by tomorrow.

137
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,582
Don't!

138
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:21,193
- Hello, have a good day.
- Thank you, ma'am.

139
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,627
- So you're Russian, you say?
- 100%% .

140
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:27,962
Hence, blond hair,
blue eyes, cheekbones.

141
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:31,833
Sorry to have kept you so long, but at least
I feel I know everything about you.

142
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:36,341
And I you. You know, usually I'm so nervous
at interviews, but that was fun.

143
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:40,777
Yes. Isn't "fun" fun?
It's been a pleasure, Tiffany.

144
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:45,519
Mr. Wade? Mr. Wade?

145
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:47,712
Hi, I'm Lucy Kelson. I'm an attorney.

146
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,050
Have you ever heard
of Saint-Tropez Law School?

147
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,193
- No.
- Shame.

148
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,487
- Where did you go to law school?
- Harvard.

149
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,357
- Harvard?
- Yes.

150
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:59,295
Intriguing. Tell me more.
What's your background?

151
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,868
I don't see how that's relevant.
I work for the Coalition for the Homeless.

152
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,869
- I'm working at Legal Aid.
- That can't pay much.

153
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,771
Well, I'm not very interested in money.
Now, Mr. Wade...

154
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:11,275
Wait a minute. You're Kelson.

155
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,505
You lie in front of our wrecking balls.

156
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,876
- You attacked the Zegman brothers...
- I did not.

157
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:18,485
It's not my fault they walked
under a protest sign.

158
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,917
- You're not here for a job?
- I'm here representing...

159
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,785
...the Coney Island Community Center.
It was built in 1922.

160
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,052
It's the heart of Coney Island.
It has adult education, basketball...

161
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:30,925
...CPR, Lamaze, water ballet,
senior's tae kwon do. It's great.

162
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,964
For children, it's a home away from home.

163
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,193
I mean, I practically grew up there.

164
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,396
It's lovely, but Trump
has the inside track. Nice to meet you.

165
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,200
No, Mr. Wade, you don't understand.

166
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,070
I live there, as well as my parents.

167
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,211
They know Assemblyman Perez,
who's on the board.

168
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:49,214
If you can guarantee the preservation
of this center, I can guarantee you the build.

169
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,243
But why us? Why Wade?

170
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:57,148
Well, I can't get in to see Trump
and the Zegmans have a restraining order.

171
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:58,857
Mr. W?

172
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:03,125
You're supposed to be taping
<i>The View</i> in half an hour...

173
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:07,894
...and <i>Public Policy</i> magazine needs a quote
on the challenges of urban planning. Hey.

174
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,266
Right. Yes. Quote, quote, quote, quote...

175
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:15,000
What I love about architecture
is its ability to shape a community.

176
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:19,613
This center has shaped the community!
It turns strangers into neighbors...

177
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:22,375
Its ability to change
strangers into neighbors.

178
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,348
How the right design for a park
makes people feel secure.

179
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,581
How a school building can be functional
and beautiful so that kids feel...

180
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:34,820
No, the community center makes children
feel engaged, and it allows them a place...

181
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:38,989
Functional and beautiful so that kids
feel engaged instead of imprisoned?

182
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,634
- Yeah, it sounds good.
- I like that.

183
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:43,327
But I said a community center,
not a school.

184
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:47,236
I know, it's all very good.
Jump in. Thanks.

185
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,244
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:01,855
So do we have a deal?

187
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:05,789
No. I want something else from you.

188
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:11,527
No. I am fully aware of your reputation
and there's no way you're getting that. No.

189
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,133
- Getting what?
- You know.

190
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:16,930
The sex. That's not gonna happen.

191
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,198
No, that would be nice.

192
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,095
I promise to save your community center.

193
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,236
On top of which, you can direct
our pro bono efforts.

194
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:36,067
That's millions at your charitable disposal.

195
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:41,402
I've spent my entire life
working against people like you.

196
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,878
Well, maybe if you work for me,
you'll win occasionally.

197
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:50,216
I need an answer, I'm afraid, immediately.
Here is my direct number at the Grand Hotel.

198
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:53,516
- You live at a hotel?
- Well, I own the hotel and I live there.

199
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,352
My life is very much like Monopoly.

200
00:14:55,526 --> 00:15:00,862
And I know you wouldn't care,
but I'll start you at $250,000.

201
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:06,062
There's also usually
a very nice Christmas bonus.

202
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:09,434
Thank you.

203
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:13,030
- I can't believe how much I ate.
- I'm proud of you.

204
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:15,263
The whole left side of the menu.

205
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,466
You know when I get tense,
I just start to eat.

206
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:23,273
- Honey, you cannot work for that man.
- Hey, we can use the bail money.

207
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,348
- Remember what Sun Tzu said?
- Yes.

208
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:29,179
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

209
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:31,480
Sun Tzu didn't have a daughter.

210
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:34,291
What's this? Oh, dessert. Thank you.

211
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,326
It's the only way to save
the community center.

212
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,395
It is. And if I work for him...

213
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:43,330
...I have huge resources
at my disposal for charities and shelters...

214
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:46,026
- Yes, but...
- Mom, I promise.

215
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:49,139
I will still be your daughter.
I will still be a lawyer.

216
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,538
And I will still have
all the same ideals.

217
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:56,411
Let's update all the files.

218
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:01,544
Especially the muni-codes
because I'll need those.

219
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,051
I'm gonna speak with Mr. Wade.

220
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,621
Mr. Wade, so sorry to bother.

221
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,123
I've been over the Environmental
Impact Reports for Island Towers.

222
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,488
- I would really love to talk to you.
- Very good.

223
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,995
I really wanted to ask you:
Which one of these do you prefer?

224
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:19,500
- How do you mean?
- It's for my new personalized stationery.

225
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,139
Is this a trick question?
They look exactly the same to me.

226
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:28,904
No, not at all. This is a linen finish
and this is a watermarked vellum finish.

227
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,777
Leaving aside the fact
that they've taken perfectly good forests...

228
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,477
...and denuded them in order
to produce this nonrecyclable paper...

229
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:40,021
...I would say it was...

230
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:50,692
Well, then this one. It tastes better.

231
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,235
Do you know, I've asked
30 people that question.

232
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,243
You're the only one to come up
with that answer.

233
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,138
My God, you're good.
I'm getting you a bigger office.

234
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:09,411
No, it's very sweet,
but I'd rather go over the...

235
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,748
Very firm.

236
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:17,460
But is it too firm?

237
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:21,826
There's some debate among chiropractors
about the optimum level of mattress tension.

238
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,125
What are your thoughts?

239
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,360
If you really want to know,
the more firm the mattress...

240
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:29,371
...the more pressure on the 5th vertebra.

241
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:36,612
Quite bouncy, though. Have a bounce.

242
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,146
No.

243
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,286
- Hello.
- Yes, I'm glad you're up.

244
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:49,153
I didn't want to wake you.
I just felt like a chat.

245
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:52,318
George, it is 2:15 in the morning.

246
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:55,158
Can't you talk to whatever
Mensa candidate you're with?

247
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:56,731
I resent the implication...

248
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,597
...that because someone
may not share your high IQ...

249
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,330
...they're not a person
of substance and depth.

250
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:05,805
- You all right?
- I swallowed my Altoid.

251
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:10,038
She swallowed her Altoid. That can happen.
A sudden hair flick, very dangerous.

252
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,206
Okay, George, I am tired.
Put her on the phone.

253
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,548
You mean, put her on the phone?

254
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,386
Put her on the phone!

255
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:20,456
All right. Someone for you.

256
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:26,028
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:29,598
The man you're dancing
with is deeply troubled, okay?

258
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,031
And even though he's rich
and attractive...

259
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:35,104
...you're too young to trade
yourself like a stock on NASDAQ...

260
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:37,638
...for someone who won't
remember your name...

261
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:40,140
...or his in the morning,
is still married...

262
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:44,213
...and has recently had
a very suspicious rash.

263
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,813
It is 2:16.

264
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:50,317
Go home, finish high school
and reach your potential!

265
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,712
You all right?

266
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,881
I think I'm gonna go.

267
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,787
- What did you say to her? Nice chat?
- Yes.

268
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,896
That we have to talk about.
Now, do you think I should cry?

269
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,802
I was thinking bursts of sobs.

270
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:18,870
<i>More of a whimper.</i>

271
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:22,018
You're pathetic. Good night.

272
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,615
All right.

273
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,398
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Is there any more Diet Coke?

274
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,337
Sorry, everybody.

275
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:54,142
Did I miss the blessed event?

276
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,318
Check with me before you talk.

277
00:20:57,487 --> 00:21:00,615
Now that we're all here, I'd like to discuss
the settlement terms.

278
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,122
The terms have been set.
It's called a prenup.

279
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:04,260
We both know...

280
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:07,453
...that a prenup doesn't preclude
certain recompensatory...

281
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:11,658
In plain English, although I can follow
you in German and Japanese if you prefer.

282
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,827
- She wants double the alimony.
- No way.

283
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:18,439
Given the situation,
it's not an unreasonable request.

284
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,504
You're referring to the alleged infidelity,
are you not?

285
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:24,772
Alleged? He was having
sex with her in our bed.

286
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,508
I knew you were worried
about getting anything on that sofa.

287
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:30,812
- How dare you come in here...
- I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

288
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:32,420
Please.

289
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,751
So you are saying that infidelity
is worth twice the alimony.

290
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,260
Using your reasoning,
any infidelity on her part...

291
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,228
...would have to be held against her
in a monetary accounting.

292
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,628
What are you suggesting?

293
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:49,864
The soon to be ex-Mrs. Wade did a little
couch time with a company accountant.

294
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,736
And he's willing to testify.

295
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:56,245
I have Ioyal employees.
I think it's the health plan.

296
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:59,439
- The health plan is excellent.
- Thank you.

297
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:02,642
- We will not agree to pay any...
- We will pay the alimony...

298
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,549
...plus $100,000 and
a generous property settlement...

299
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:08,282
...if you release me from further obligation.

300
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,857
- You son of a bitch!
- What?

301
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,654
Watch your language
or you will not get the estate, Mrs. Wade.

302
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:16,196
Don't call me that!
You're just another one of his stupid bimbos!

303
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,800
Now, wait! She is far from stupid...

304
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:22,501
- What do you think you're doing?
- Went up my nose.

305
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:24,833
- Water went up my nose.
- It's only water.

306
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:28,842
Okay, this hankie is very nearly clean.
I'm going to dab you.

307
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:30,036
- You may blow.
- Thank you.

308
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:31,202
Good.

309
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,718
Divorce always gives me
an appetite. Kebab?

310
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,878
No, I've never warmed
to the idea of a flesh Popsicle.

311
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:43,617
- One, please. Chicken, thank you.
- Why did you give her the money?

312
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:46,694
She'd never have stopped
till she got what she wanted.

313
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:49,923
You always say I have a responsibility
towards those less fortunate.

314
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,364
Everybody is less fortunate than you...

315
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:56,232
...so just give the money to someone
who's not gonna spend it on collagen.

316
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:59,102
You only want me to be generous
to those you approve of.

317
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:03,336
No. I only want you to
finally allow me to do my job.

318
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:07,210
You did your job. This morning I was married,
now I'm not. You did it superbly.

319
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:08,908
Thank you very much.

320
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:12,748
Here, that's fine. You keep the change.
Thank you.

321
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,451
George.

322
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,656
- Hey, that's my coffee, you jerk!
- Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

323
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,130
- Moron!
- I thought you were needy.

324
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:28,031
What's wrong with you?!
Can't a guy have a cup of coffee?!

325
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:32,004
- It's all right. Come on, Mother Teresa.
- My only cup of the day! You ruined it!

326
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:45,015
Okay, now, what do you think?

327
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,024
Too ornate?

328
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:53,187
I don't care about the belt.

329
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:54,728
You're upset.

330
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:58,061
Look, from now on, I'll get someone else
to handle my divorces.

331
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:00,429
It's not like I enjoy them.

332
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:03,504
Maybe I should go somewhere where
no one knows how much money I have.

333
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:06,164
Where is Staten Island?
Why don't we go there?

334
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:17,445
Thanks, but Harvard
doesn't give a degree in yenta.

335
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,214
I'm not here to find you a wife
or to pick out your clothes.

336
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,225
My heroes are Clarence Darrow,
Thurgood Marshall...

337
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:27,922
Who's another non-scummy lawyer?

338
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:30,588
My parents!
My father worked for Martin Luther King.

339
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:32,097
My mother is a law professor.

340
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:34,930
They taught me that lawyers
should be treated with respect.

341
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:39,564
I have complete respect for you.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

342
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,608
Luce, wait. Wait!

343
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:51,317
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
to join together Meryl and Tom...

344
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:53,978
...as they stand before us
on this joyous day...

345
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:58,623
...proclaim their love and enter
into that most sacred bond of all...

346
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:01,354
...the bond of holy...

347
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,655
<i>Is that yours?</i>

348
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,675
I'm so sorry.

349
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:22,874
Please continue. Everyone looks so beautiful.
Just keep going.

350
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:25,748
Bye. You guys, I'll be right back.

351
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,522
Hold this for me. I'll be back.

352
00:25:40,903 --> 00:25:42,495
Twenty bucks for your cab.

353
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,798
Keep the 20 and let's have dinner.

354
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:47,441
Keep your dinner. I'll keep my 20
and we'll call it even.

355
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:49,474
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay, bye.

356
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:51,010
Go.

357
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,850
George, pick up. What's wrong?

358
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:59,920
Don't tell me that the construction permits
didn't come through...

359
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:03,923
...because I had the application
into the Zoning Committee by 9 a.m.

360
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:15,703
- Evening, Miss Kelson.
- Willie, told you the Mets would sweep.

361
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:23,478
- Miss Kelson.
- Ms. Hana.

362
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:30,475
- Good evening, Miss Kelson.
- Linda.

363
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:44,122
- George?
- Help! I'm in my closet.

364
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:49,036
- What is it?
- That is a very attractive.

365
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:56,143
Okay, I'm judging the Miss New York contest
in under an hour. It's on television.

366
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:57,573
What do you think?

367
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:01,546
Please don't tell me you called me out
of a wedding to help you pick out a suit.

368
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:05,083
- You ran out of a wedding? That's horrible!
- You said it was an emergency!

369
00:27:05,253 --> 00:27:07,881
Didn't I memo you as to what
constitutes an emergency?

370
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:11,321
Yes. Large meteor, severe loss of blood
and what's the third one again?

371
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,984
- Death! And you're not dead.
- No.

372
00:27:14,162 --> 00:27:16,426
You weren't dead when
you called me at 3:00 a. m...

373
00:27:16,598 --> 00:27:19,362
...because you had a nightmare about
becoming a member of KISS.

374
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:22,435
Just like when you barged in
on my woman's doctor appointment...

375
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:25,698
...to ask me which picture
to put on the cover of <i>People.</i>

376
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:29,537
I don't like those very much. If it's any
consolation, I will be dead eventually.

377
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:34,277
Tonight is important. I'm representing
the Wade organization. That includes you.

378
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:35,643
Not anymore, George.

379
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:40,119
- I'm sorry?
- You got Island Towers, I got Coney Island.

380
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:43,655
Why don't we just call it quits, okay?
I can't take it anymore.

381
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,725
- What, are you serious?
- Yes.

382
00:27:48,063 --> 00:27:51,499
Please, consider this my two weeks' notice.

383
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:57,263
- I find you ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?

384
00:27:57,439 --> 00:28:00,067
- Yes, ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!

385
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:03,507
Yes. I hire you with
no corporate experience.

386
00:28:03,678 --> 00:28:07,205
I give you an apartment, a great office,
the nonfat muffin basket every morning.

387
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:09,612
- George!
- Why do you keep your phone on?

388
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,210
You crave the excitement.

389
00:28:17,692 --> 00:28:19,489
This is entirely my thing...

390
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:22,630
...because I've managed
to turn myself into this...

391
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,030
It's not like I'm enjoying it either.

392
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:32,602
Now I can't. I'm addicted.
I have to know what you think.

393
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:34,605
What do you think?

394
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:37,472
I think you are the most selfish
human being on the planet.

395
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:40,671
That's just silly. Have you met
everyone on the planet?

396
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:43,078
Goodbye, George.

397
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:46,516
I don't have a shirt.

398
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:51,950
Ansel, I finally quit. He called me
out of Meryl's wedding.

399
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:54,060
- I'll never get that moment back.
- <i>Okay.</i>

400
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:57,095
I'll set up interviews with law firms
that do pro bono work, and...

401
00:28:57,265 --> 00:28:58,391
- <i>All right, hang on.</i>
- What?

402
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:01,933
<i>Look, we're shipping out.</i>
<i>I gotta go. You take care of yourself.</i>

403
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:03,229
<i>I gotta go, hon.</i>

404
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:06,202
Okay, just don't fall in love with
any cute marine biologists.

405
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,638
- <i>Okay, I promise. Bye.</i>
- Okay.

406
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,108
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Bye.

407
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:22,848
I am really looking forward
to a new challenge...

408
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:26,551
...and your firm has the optimal blend
of public and private interest law.

409
00:29:26,728 --> 00:29:28,889
Lucy, your resume is amazing.
You know that.

410
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:30,826
But we do a lot of business with Wade.

411
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:33,466
All the more reason for me
to make a smooth transition.

412
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:34,623
- Lucy.
- Yes.

413
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:37,168
George Wade called me this morning
and informed me...

414
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:40,637
...that you are indispensable
to his organization.

415
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:46,404
At the moment, we're not hiring.

416
00:29:47,014 --> 00:29:48,572
Then why did you agree to see me?

417
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,184
Honestly, we're partners
with Zodiac Construction...

418
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:54,014
They do millions of dollars
of business with Wade Realty...

419
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:57,021
- And Mr. Wade...
- Doesn't want you to hire me.

420
00:29:57,425 --> 00:30:00,121
The attorney who was planning
to quit reconsidered.

421
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:02,319
- When did Mr. Wade call?
- Mr. Wade never called.

422
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:04,658
- When?!
- Maybe an hour ago.

423
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,091
Make sure you massage his cloven hoof!

424
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:10,134
I'm suddenly feeling a pain in my ass.

425
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:13,364
I am unemployable! You called everyone
except for Slurpee Heaven!

426
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:16,669
That is not true. I did call Slurpee Heaven.
They didn't want you.

427
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:19,108
Heard you had attitude.
Said you weren't Slurpee material.

428
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,977
- You should really let us work on you.
- I don't like to be touched!

429
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,346
I'm sorry, you guys are great.
It's not you.

430
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,515
All right, listen.

431
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:31,749
You have a contract and it says
you will work until Island Towers is finalized.

432
00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:35,919
Which is completion of construction,
or I can stop you working elsewhere.

433
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:39,555
And there's no loopholes
because you drafted it and you're the best.

434
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:45,068
Subconsciously, I think you drafted it that
way because you don't really want to go.

435
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:47,571
Does it kill you how well I know you?

436
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,638
Honey, this contract is excellent work.
I'm very proud of you.

437
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:54,645
<i>Dad, I'm trying to get out of it.</i>

438
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:58,183
I don't know why you went to work
for that philandering robber baron.

439
00:30:58,352 --> 00:31:00,115
<i>You usually have impeccable instincts.</i>

440
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:03,655
<i>Look at your boyfriend, Ansel.</i>
<i>He's a dedicated environmental warrior.</i>

441
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:06,919
This is ironclad. Houdini couldn't
get out of this contract.

442
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:09,494
You should've stayed
at the legal aid job.

443
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:12,895
If I do pro bono work with a company
with these resources...

444
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:16,264
...I can accomplish so much...
- Come on over for strawberry ice cream.

445
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:20,771
Have Tofutti! You heard what the doctor
said. Your cholesterol is over 300!

446
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,500
You're basically a solid.

447
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:25,874
Two of the greatest legal minds
in this country arguing over dessert.

448
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:28,948
Lucy, it was your choice to work
for that man.

449
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:32,779
You could've done anything. You could've
clerked for the Supreme Court.

450
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:34,353
I don't know what to tell you.

451
00:31:34,522 --> 00:31:37,355
Short of going in
and deliberately trying to get fired.

452
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:40,289
<i>You stay away from that freezer!</i>

453
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:57,777
Good morning, boys.

454
00:31:59,313 --> 00:32:02,714
Sorry, I am so late.

455
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:04,749
That's fine. We only just got here.

456
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,978
Forty-five minutes ago.

457
00:32:07,154 --> 00:32:08,951
Howie, are these your kids?

458
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,991
You know, I've never actually met them.

459
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,787
They are good-Iooking boys.

460
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:18,796
That's a girl. That's Sue and Paul.

461
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:22,836
Yes, so it is.

462
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:26,997
You know what?
She is gonna be a heartbreaker.

463
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,639
That's Paul.

464
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,574
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sorry.

465
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:37,780
So we've got the Coney Island project.

466
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:40,921
I'd like to stir up some publicity if we could.

467
00:32:44,191 --> 00:32:46,352
Yes, very nice.

468
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,360
I'm...

469
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:57,561
I'm working on endorsements
from local merchants.

470
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:10,048
We were working
on some ideas there.

471
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:14,585
I thought that was terrific.

472
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,446
- Pathetic.
- What's pathetic?

473
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,560
- You. I know what you're doing.
- I am not doing anything.

474
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:25,220
You think if you come in late and spit
on the boss that will get you fired?

475
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:27,127
Not in this company.

476
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,632
- Chris.
- George.

477
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:34,566
George, I have an ulcer.

478
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:37,733
I don't sleep well, mostly because
you keep calling me at night.

479
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,242
If you don't call me,
I dream you're gonna call me.

480
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:43,246
I think about you in the shower,
not in a good way...

481
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:46,749
...but in an I'm-so-distracted-I-can't-
remember-if-I washed-my-hair way.

482
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,750
So I wash my hair twice.

483
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:52,049
So I have a hole in my stomach,
I am running out of shampoo...

484
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:56,093
...and today is the first time in my life
I did not give a 1000 percent on the job...

485
00:33:56,262 --> 00:33:58,924
...and I hate that feeling!

486
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:08,737
- I won't call after hours.
- You will, George! You know you will.

487
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:10,841
Yeah, I will.

488
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:17,946
I just don't think we can see each other
professionally anymore.

489
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:29,427
All right. Stay until you find
a replacement.

490
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:32,860
Train him up for a couple of weeks,
then you can go to Slurpee Heaven.

491
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,798
Thank you! I promise I will find
you somebody amazing.

492
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,631
Somebody better than me
because I'm not even any good.

493
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:43,037
- No.
- A glorified ambulance chaser.

494
00:34:45,044 --> 00:34:46,875
Thank you.

495
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:02,052
I got it. It's just my earring.

496
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:06,657
- My hair!
- Careful! That's my overpriced Italian belt.

497
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,631
Just get it off!

498
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:12,337
Howard.

499
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,672
Join us. We were just brainstorming.

500
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:18,240
- Lucy?
- Yes.

501
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:23,348
I was thinking it might be a good idea
to do a photo op at the build site...

502
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:26,349
...where George would be in the...

503
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,150
George in the foreground,
pointing up to the sky...

504
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:31,915
...like this.
- Yes.

505
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:37,085
Then I thought I could take my belt off,
as if to say, let's get to work!

506
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:40,198
Right. Right-o.

507
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:44,032
On behalf of Wade Corporation,
I'd like to thank the Community Board...

508
00:35:44,203 --> 00:35:47,229
...for giving us the opportunity
to work with you on this project.

509
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:50,603
And we look forward to seeing
all of you at the groundbreaking.

510
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:52,704
I did well with those eight people.

511
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:55,347
- I thought you were fantastic.
- This way, Mr. Wade.

512
00:35:55,515 --> 00:35:56,641
Just Mr. Wade.

513
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:59,946
- More.
- Great. Can we go now?

514
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,952
Absolutely. I just want to say hello
to my folks.

515
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:04,111
Folks?

516
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:06,288
Excuse me.

517
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:08,119
Hello.

518
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:09,352
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

519
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:11,326
- Is that a new coat? I like it.
- Thanks.

520
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:16,161
What a wonderful surprise!
We finally meet after all this time.

521
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:17,632
George Wade.

522
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:19,965
Mrs. Kelson, I presume.

523
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,197
What a pleasure.

524
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,642
Well, I can certainly see
where Lucy gets her stare from.

525
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:33,752
I'm Larry. It's a pleasure to meet you.

526
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,979
Thanks, Larry. Same here.

527
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:38,988
Thank you for letting Lucy quit.
It certainly made our week.

528
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:41,820
- Great pleasure.
- We should get back to the office.

529
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,928
- Come on! Have some cake.
- We can't.

530
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,326
We're two blocks from the apartment.

531
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:47,796
- You live around here?
- Sure.

532
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,435
- What a charming coincidence.
- It won't be charming...

533
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:55,267
...once you block out the sun
with this condo-hotel monstrosity!

534
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:59,103
We will have a sun deck.

535
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:03,042
That's something, isn't it?

536
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:07,013
Larry, Ruth, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your support on this project.

537
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:10,019
At least you're keeping
the community center.

538
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:13,181
Unless you're willing to reconsider
the entire project.

539
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,294
I'm afraid that won't happen.
It is over 50 million in profits.

540
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:19,954
I think it's immoral that any human being
should acquire that much wealth.

541
00:37:20,132 --> 00:37:21,793
I don't know how you sleep at night.

542
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:23,162
A machine that plays the ocean.

543
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:35,976
I used to come up here all the time
when I was a kid. My special place.

544
00:37:38,317 --> 00:37:40,182
I had a small one-bedroom
on Park and 91st.

545
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:44,484
That's so very <i>Oliver Twist</i>.

546
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:48,217
Times were hard. But you know what?
We were happy.

547
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:53,162
- Didn't have a view as good as this.
- It's great, isn't it?

548
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:56,495
I used to take up some ice cream
and my Carole King tape...

549
00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:58,135
...and look at the neighborhood.

550
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:01,898
It's amazing what you could see. At night,
the whole building went downstairs.

551
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:05,168
The fathers stood on one corner.
The mothers stood on the other.

552
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:08,677
Kids would just ride their bicycles around.

553
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:11,338
As you can see, not much has changed.

554
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,847
Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb would be sitting
in the middle of the street...

555
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,684
...saving a parking space for their children
who were coming next weekend.

556
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:23,358
And you up here on your own.

557
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:26,792
It's hard to find a quiet place
in Brooklyn to think.

558
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:32,333
Or to replay whatever argument
I just had with my mother.

559
00:38:33,372 --> 00:38:34,930
Yes.

560
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,098
Yeah, she's terrifying.

561
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:40,370
I thought she was gonna kill me
and feed me to the poor.

562
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:42,877
Yeah, she's a piece of work.

563
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:48,216
But for better or worse, she's the voice
in my head pushing me to do better.

564
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:52,380
Challenge the accepted wisdom. Never
settle for a B instead of an A on a test.

565
00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:53,717
You once got a B?

566
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,826
- Hypothetically speaking.
- Right.

567
00:38:57,562 --> 00:39:03,398
Of course, no matter how hard I try,
I will never live up to her expectations.

568
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:09,029
Well, there are worse things in life.
Like no one having any expectations.

569
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:21,409
There's something amuck
with this sponge cake.

570
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,921
Tofu.

571
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,002
You're not concentrating.
This offends me.

572
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:43,266
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ton.

573
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:44,739
I lost Lucy.

574
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,675
I just think it's a shame because I've
come to rely on her for everything.

575
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:55,013
And I trust her completely,
and she's funny.

576
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:57,451
Not deliberately, of course.

577
00:39:57,622 --> 00:40:00,113
Hey, you know, it's probably
for the best though.

578
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:02,590
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

579
00:40:03,295 --> 00:40:06,594
Two things I know is chess and women.

580
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:12,701
Chess, it has rules, pieces,
rooks, knights, bishops.

581
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:16,705
They move in predictable patterns.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

582
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,311
But women, they don't have no rules, man.

583
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,640
They move in unpredictable ways too.

584
00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:25,305
Nobody ever wins or loses
when it comes to women.

585
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:28,817
You talk about your feelings
until your breath is sucked out your body.

586
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:32,551
All men are pawns when it comes
to women.

587
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:35,989
Especially a smart one like Lucy.
She's hard to control.

588
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:39,619
And you know, the man has got
to be in control.

589
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:42,556
Like with me.

590
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:47,762
I come home. When I walk in,
I know my mama has dinner on the table.

591
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,506
All right, so you're still living at home?

592
00:40:53,178 --> 00:40:55,169
Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,241
Of course.

594
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:04,947
Here's somebody interesting,
Polly St. Clair.

595
00:41:05,123 --> 00:41:09,583
Well, it's a terrific resume, Polly.

596
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,490
Congratulations on the baby.

597
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:12,921
What baby?

598
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,266
Maybe you should check with me
before you talk.

599
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,427
What baby?

600
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:24,505
I'd like to talk about
your moot-court experience.

601
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:25,768
What baby?

602
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,204
Yeah, what baby?

603
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:35,551
You should do the interviews on your own.

604
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:45,089
Harry Raskin, Richard Beck.

605
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:49,099
Interesting prospects for my replacement.
Let's see.

606
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:52,564
No, it's gotta be a woman.

607
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:53,897
What a surprise.

608
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:57,701
I suppose a certain bust size would help.
Maybe some bathing-suit shots?

609
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:01,301
It will annoy Howard if it's a woman.

610
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,810
- Thank you.
- Tell you what.

611
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:05,074
All I want is someone
as intelligent as you...

612
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,309
...but a little less tense
and argumentative.

613
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:10,579
A sort of Katharine Hepburn figure.

614
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:12,484
You don't deserve Katharine Hepburn.

615
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,090
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Also too good.

616
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:16,159
Just stay away from the Hepburns.

617
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,760
You forgot a beet.

618
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:19,590
Beet.

619
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:21,926
Thank you.

620
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:36,943
I've got that charity tennis thing tonight.

621
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:41,745
And I need to know, does this shirt make
me look a bit kind of Bjorn Borg?

622
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,118
Ansel and I got into a huge fight,
and I think we just broke up.

623
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:47,346
Really?

624
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:50,289
He wants me to go on a Greenpeace boat.

625
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:52,292
He thinks I can't embrace life.

626
00:42:52,463 --> 00:42:54,863
Is that the case?
Because I just don't see it.

627
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,557
I just don't see it.

628
00:42:56,868 --> 00:43:00,634
And by the way, how can I embrace him
when he is never here?

629
00:43:00,805 --> 00:43:06,266
Maybe it's me. Maybe the rose-colored
glasses have finally come off.

630
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,379
Okay.

631
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:13,483
We obviously can't leave you alone
with the stapler.

632
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:16,279
I'll tell you what. I'll cancel tennis.

633
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:19,651
They always make me play with Ed Koch.
What can we do to cheer you up?

634
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,257
Nothing. There's no solution.

635
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:22,791
Good. Good attitude.

636
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,724
I can't help it if I don't like boats.

637
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,131
Surely not all boats.

638
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:31,166
Yes, all boats.

639
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:36,663
I don't understand.
What is wrong with me?

640
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:39,173
At the moment,
huge quantities of alcohol.

641
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:42,074
I don't know. I just seem
to drive men away.

642
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,181
There's Ansel.

643
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:47,250
There's Billy from Legal Aid who ran
off with a stripper.

644
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:50,182
Don't forget Gary from the Peace Corps
who married his trainer.

645
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:52,255
Gary, yes.

646
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:56,086
What is wrong with me? I want to know.
You're sort of a man.

647
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:01,588
- All right?
- I'm good.

648
00:44:03,868 --> 00:44:06,928
So tell me. What's the matter with me?

649
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:10,006
Well, you can be somewhat intimidating.

650
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,772
You could loosen up a little,
get in touch with your feminine side.

651
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:17,779
- Okay, that's a good suggestion.
- Perhaps soften your appearance.

652
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:23,444
Not that I don't love that look,
but you could get dolled up occasionally.

653
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:26,556
I'm not going to spend hours
fluffing my hair and applying...

654
00:44:26,724 --> 00:44:28,453
...animal-tested makeup to my face...

655
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:34,064
...just so I can turn myself into some
male fantasy, degrading Kewpie doll.

656
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:37,395
Unless I, you know, really like the guy
or something.

657
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:39,900
You see, maybe that's the problem.

658
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:41,800
You don't like these guys.

659
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:45,374
You drive them away because you realize,
deep down, they're wrong for you.

660
00:44:45,543 --> 00:44:46,703
They're not wrong for me.

661
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:51,915
We have all the same political goals
and ideals, all of them.

662
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:55,985
Which I guess isn't very romantic,
but what can I say?

663
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:59,317
I'm fine. What can I say?
I'm just not a romantic person.

664
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,653
Never felt that way about anybody.
Nope. No.

665
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:06,763
No, in high school, Rick Beck took
me parking. You know, parking?

666
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:09,764
And the whole time I talked
about Nelson Mandela.

667
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:11,834
Don't know why I did that.

668
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:15,871
That is hard to say. I certainly would have
found it extremely erotic. Come back.

669
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,940
I'm fine.

670
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,705
I don't know. Maybe I'm
just not good in bed.

671
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:26,849
Maybe you're not.

672
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:31,178
I am.

673
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:35,119
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I am really good in bed.

674
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:38,023
- You might be lousy.
- No, believe me, pal.

675
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:41,632
You should be so lucky because
the lawyerly exterior...

676
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:46,634
...don't let that fool you because
inside I am, like, a complete animal.

677
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:50,137
It's, like, bobcat. You know, it's scary.

678
00:45:50,308 --> 00:45:55,974
- I can see that it might be.
- No. No. Look, I can bend like a pretzel.

679
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,815
I'm serious.

680
00:45:58,983 --> 00:46:02,646
And I'm not talking the straight kind.
I'm talking, like, the twisty kind.

681
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,223
Twisty like the bobcat,
salty type of pretzel.

682
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,883
Because that's what men want, right?

683
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:12,894
- That is their dream.
- The twisty-bobcat kind of pretzel...

684
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:17,831
...because that's what you want, and I bet
I could give you a twisty-bobcat pretzel.

685
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:19,833
Do you want it?

686
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,740
You're a really good listener.

687
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,683
Luce?

688
00:46:37,355 --> 00:46:39,016
Luce?

689
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,524
Are you...? Hello?

690
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:45,689
Cormac!

691
00:46:45,863 --> 00:46:47,524
Help!

692
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,155
Help!

693
00:47:01,045 --> 00:47:03,036
I'll just get her upstairs.

694
00:47:03,214 --> 00:47:04,875
Think you can make it?

695
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:08,450
No. No, let's put her somewhere else.

696
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,287
Good.

697
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:23,293
Good.

698
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,933
Like a doll.

699
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,543
A doll with a sinus problem.

700
00:47:34,711 --> 00:47:38,807
We should put a pillow under her head.
I think that helps.

701
00:47:45,922 --> 00:47:47,651
Good.

702
00:47:49,092 --> 00:47:50,116
Much worse. Interesting.

703
00:47:54,348 --> 00:47:57,408
Do you think we should change
her clothes?

704
00:47:58,085 --> 00:48:01,418
Right. Don't know where that came from.

705
00:48:04,024 --> 00:48:05,514
Morning!

706
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:09,025
Okay, not so loud.

707
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:13,098
We didn't...

708
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:17,264
Last... We didn't...

709
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,872
It was a magical night.

710
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,203
You made sounds I've never heard
a woman make before.

711
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:27,104
We didn't...

712
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:31,383
Not physically, but spiritually,
you were the best I've ever had.

713
00:48:33,553 --> 00:48:39,287
Whatever I did or didn't do
or said or didn't say...

714
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:42,724
...it was all a little mistake.

715
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,556
Well, nothing happened.

716
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,062
That's a relief.

717
00:48:54,574 --> 00:48:57,407
I'm very busy. I have work to do.
You stay there and relax.

718
00:48:57,577 --> 00:49:00,410
Okay, I'll see you later.

719
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:06,844
Lucy!

720
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:08,579
Jesus, careful.

721
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:12,691
There's a June Carver to see you.

722
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:15,918
- June Carver, June Carver, June Carver.
- She went to Harvard.

723
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:18,690
Yeah, well, so did I. Now look at me.

724
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:21,757
Norman. Norman. Norman.

725
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:23,732
- Norman!
- Sorry.

726
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:27,331
She didn't have a strong background
in property law.

727
00:49:27,774 --> 00:49:30,937
She's down from Boston.
She only wants five minutes.

728
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:36,112
Lucy.

729
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:37,910
Lucy.

730
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:39,677
This is June Carver.

731
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:43,854
- Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

732
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:46,891
I don't have an appointment,
so feel free to throw me out.

733
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,722
Well, I have security on standby.

734
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:52,296
- Have a seat, please.
- Thanks.

735
00:49:52,632 --> 00:49:55,726
Did you have Criminal
with Professor Rappaport?

736
00:49:55,902 --> 00:49:58,598
- Oh, my God. I'm still shaking.
- Yeah.

737
00:49:58,772 --> 00:50:02,868
But I have to tell you, Miss Kelson,
you are a legend there.

738
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,034
- Me?
- Editor of the <i>Law Review</i>.

739
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:08,613
The articles you wrote on
the Richmond case. You're an inspiration.

740
00:50:08,982 --> 00:50:10,313
Well, yeah, I...

741
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:13,647
I don't have a strong background
in property, but neither did you...

742
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,051
...and look what you've accomplished.

743
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:19,692
Well, you know, not that much, really.
I just...

744
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,828
And there's this.

745
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:23,485
I've never met Mr. Wade...

746
00:50:23,663 --> 00:50:26,496
...but in <i>Public Policy</i> magazine
he was interviewed...

747
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:31,035
...about the challenges
of urban development and he said that...

748
00:50:31,204 --> 00:50:33,672
Is it ridiculous that I'm quoting this?

749
00:50:34,174 --> 00:50:35,300
No, not yet.

750
00:50:35,475 --> 00:50:39,741
"Architecture can shape a community
and turn strangers into neighbors.

751
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:42,507
The right design for a park
makes people feel secure.

752
00:50:42,682 --> 00:50:45,378
A school building can be functional
and beautiful...

753
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:48,851
...so kids feel engaged instead
of imprisoned."

754
00:50:49,022 --> 00:50:52,185
When I read that, it made me feel
I'd be working for a cause...

755
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:53,451
...not just a company.

756
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,822
Okay. You're hired.

757
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,530
You're Mr. Wade.

758
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,930
Someone has to be.
Although, I didn't write that.

759
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:05,594
- Lucy did.
- No, you did. I remember being shocked.

760
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,372
We've been working together so long
it's hard to remember who did what.

761
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:12,034
- Sounds like an amazing team.
- George, do you mind...?

762
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:16,945
I was saying how incredibly presumptuous
it was of me to come waltzing in here...

763
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:19,278
...but Miss Kelson was nice enough
to see me.

764
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:22,047
They're calling from
the Zoning Commission, Lucy.

765
00:51:22,222 --> 00:51:26,886
June, why don't we set up
a proper interview for tomorrow.

766
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:31,827
It's all right. It's all right.
I could finish up with June.

767
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:33,898
You're not coming to the meeting?

768
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:36,535
- Have I ever come to the meeting?
- Good point.

769
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,630
- Alrighty.
- Alrighty.

770
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:42,138
Stupid plant. Do something
with this, will you?

771
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:44,800
Absolutely. The ficus is fired.

772
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:46,912
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

773
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,741
- So tell me...
- Yes.

774
00:51:48,915 --> 00:51:51,679
...first of all, you come from which...?
- Harvard.

775
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,755
I was just wondering, are we still on
for the Mets game tonight?

776
00:51:55,922 --> 00:51:57,719
I love baseball.

777
00:51:57,991 --> 00:51:59,583
So are we still good?

778
00:51:59,759 --> 00:52:01,920
I'm a Red Sox fan, all the way.

779
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:04,325
A Red Sox fan? Interesting.

780
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:09,094
You obviously have a rich fantasy life
which is a fabulous plus in this company.

781
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:13,262
Okay, that means you're a Boston girl,
probably a little bit Irish, Catholic...

782
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,840
...big family, dirty, that kind of thing.
- Exactly.

783
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:20,241
<i>Let's go, Mets! Let's go, Mets!</i>
<i>Let's go, Mets!</i>

784
00:52:20,413 --> 00:52:21,402
Strike him out!

785
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:23,674
So, what did you think of June?

786
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,908
Loved her. Loved her.

787
00:52:25,352 --> 00:52:26,910
Great. Yeah, me too.

788
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:29,612
Yeah, she smiled obsequiously,
flattered me constantly.

789
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:33,418
She'd have no problem picking out
an ottoman. Exactly what I'm looking for.

790
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,854
A tad weak on the experience side, but...

791
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:38,122
We went out for a drink,
talked for an hour.

792
00:52:38,298 --> 00:52:42,462
She's a very clever girl, you know. Sharp.

793
00:52:44,304 --> 00:52:47,137
So you guys went out for a drink and...

794
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:51,108
She got nowhere to stay at the moment,
so I found her a room at the Grand.

795
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:56,147
And I invited her to the company outing.
Turns out she's a useful tennis player.

796
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,278
Well, I can swing a racket.

797
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:01,477
Yes, I know, at my head.
I've experienced it.

798
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:04,715
But listen, thanks to you
for finding her. Genius.

799
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,792
Oh, God! It's gonna hit us!

800
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:09,753
Get out of the way. Move!

801
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,164
- Mike, you all right?
- Yeah.

802
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,166
- Take it easy, the season just started.
- Thanks, George.

803
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:18,099
Next time, go to a Yankees game.

804
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,409
Hey, look, you're on TV.

805
00:53:30,684 --> 00:53:32,311
<i>I don't hear you.</i>
<i>I don't hear you.</i>

806
00:54:04,884 --> 00:54:06,215
Nice!

807
00:54:06,386 --> 00:54:08,286
- Nice one.
- Thank you.

808
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:27,567
- Three-Iove.
- All right. Cool.

809
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:39,809
Nice.

810
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,658
Yeah!

811
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:57,666
Mine, mine, mine! Okay!

812
00:54:57,837 --> 00:54:59,031
Come on!

813
00:55:15,422 --> 00:55:18,391
Lucy! Oh, my God, Lucy, are you okay?

814
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:20,458
Do I have a concussion?
Ask me something.

815
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:25,161
- Name all the Supreme Court Justices.
- Thomas, Ginsburg, Scalia, Stevens...

816
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:28,301
...Kennedy, Rehnquist, Souter, Breyer,
O'Connor. Is that right?

817
00:55:28,802 --> 00:55:29,791
How should I know?

818
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:34,038
Want some?

819
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:35,970
Thanks, I really shouldn't.

820
00:55:36,142 --> 00:55:37,131
Okay.

821
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:45,876
You think she's a natural redhead?

822
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:03,997
You know, I was gonna give June a lift,
and then Howard offered.

823
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,832
The fact that he liked her is
a big strike against her.

824
00:56:07,006 --> 00:56:11,739
Although I will say she's
an excellent tennis player. Very nice form.

825
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,503
- Fantastically nice form.
- Oh, man.

826
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,171
Incredibly lithe.

827
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:18,909
What? I thought you liked her too.

828
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:22,748
No, I jus... I think I just ate too much.

829
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,686
Really? What did you have?

830
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:30,193
Just a chili dog and some fries
and a soda...

831
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:33,764
...and a bag of some little girl's
cookies...

832
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,697
...and another chili dog
stuck in there somewhere.

833
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,269
Okay.

834
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,099
Let's try and take your mind off it.

835
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:42,173
Okay.

836
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:43,832
Heard from Ansel lately?

837
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:46,878
I'm sorry.

838
00:56:47,046 --> 00:56:49,879
I've been thinking about this.
You should move on. Forget him.

839
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:53,746
Plenty of other pebbles on the beach.
The world must be full of men who'd die...

840
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,480
...to be with a compulsive
eater who can't fall in love.

841
00:56:56,656 --> 00:56:59,056
What? I've fallen in love.

842
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:00,886
- Yeah?
- Yes!

843
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,654
With whom, might I ask?

844
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:04,888
And no pets.

845
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,368
Billy Westhouse.

846
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:16,136
Billy who?

847
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:19,403
Westhouse. I knew him in high school.

848
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:21,843
Did you tell Billy that you loved him?

849
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:26,418
Did you say, "Billy, I love you"?

850
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,820
Goodness!

851
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,158
It's not funny.

852
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,267
Sorry.

853
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:45,931
That last chili dog is really barking.

854
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,224
It's not perfect timing, I must say.

855
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:55,490
We'll be in the city in 20 minutes.

856
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:58,861
I don't have 20 seconds!
I feel like I swallowed a cruise missile.

857
00:58:02,037 --> 00:58:03,231
What...? What am I? 5 years old?

858
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:08,707
- It's only a Volvo.
- Well, people just don't go in Volvos!

859
00:58:08,877 --> 00:58:11,277
- I'll buy you another Volvo.
- No!

860
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,040
That'll be the only thing you'll ever
remember about me.

861
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:17,276
I'll be the woman who went
on the front seat!

862
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,886
That would be hard to forget.

863
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,387
Okay, I have an idea. See that RV?

864
00:58:28,563 --> 00:58:30,690
- Yes.
- That is our target.

865
00:58:31,066 --> 00:58:33,091
Can you make it?
Therein lies your salvation.

866
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:34,963
- No.
- Yes, it's an excellent idea.

867
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:38,629
- It's unclean! I can hold it!
- It's a brain wave. Out of the car!

868
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:44,336
I can hold it! George, I can hold it!
I'm holding it! I'm fine, I can hold it!

869
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:50,480
No! No, no, George, I don't want...
I'm not going. I'm holding!

870
00:58:54,856 --> 00:58:56,847
Hi there!

871
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,834
- You all right?
- Yes.

872
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,162
- Okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

873
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:14,673
- You all right?
- I'm good.

874
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,174
- What?
- My ankle. My ankle.

875
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,776
No! No, no! Oh, God! No!

876
00:59:22,284 --> 00:59:23,751
Hi, there!

877
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:27,952
Oh, God!

878
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,217
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

879
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:35,795
I'm not insane, but my friend needs to use
a bathroom. It's an emergency.

880
00:59:35,964 --> 00:59:37,955
- I'll give you $100.
- A thousand!

881
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,293
Okay.

882
00:59:39,468 --> 00:59:40,958
Thank you. Very sweet of you.

883
00:59:41,136 --> 00:59:42,967
Thank you.

884
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:18,100
Clean, clean, clean.

885
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:20,099
Where are you guys from?

886
01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:25,135
Well, Kentucky originally,
but now this is pretty much home.

887
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,345
Come here, babies.

888
01:00:32,521 --> 01:00:34,148
Hurry!

889
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,591
What kind of mileage do you get
out of this thing? It's an RV, right?

890
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:42,252
A recreational vehicle?

891
01:00:42,697 --> 01:00:45,097
Traffic's moving.

892
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,827
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it one sec!

893
01:00:48,003 --> 01:00:50,528
Honey, how are you doing?
Are you nearly ready?

894
01:00:50,705 --> 01:00:52,605
Kill me!

895
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,972
Look at that poor jerk.

896
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:03,947
Yes, poor jerk.

897
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:06,778
Whoa, Nelly.

898
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,061
George, where's the car?

899
01:01:14,229 --> 01:01:16,060
I'm sure it's been safely towed by now.

900
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:18,631
Oh, God! George, George, George!

901
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,998
Don't worry, don't worry! In many ways,
it was the perfect end to the day.

902
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:25,298
Except for those poor children
in the trailer.

903
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:28,068
They actually looked quite frightened.

904
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,142
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

905
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:35,409
Once it's published in the company
newsletter, there'd be absolutely no point.

906
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:40,087
All right, I'll call for a lift.

907
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,924
Would you like to have
your nails done?

908
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,990
A Hollywood tan, perhaps?

909
01:02:34,175 --> 01:02:37,338
God, it is such a beautiful city.

910
01:02:37,779 --> 01:02:39,940
And my favorite building of all time.
Look at that.

911
01:02:40,148 --> 01:02:42,946
Nirosta steel, sunburst tower,
gleaming gargoyles...

912
01:02:43,118 --> 01:02:45,780
...all designed by a man called
William Van Alen...

913
01:02:45,954 --> 01:02:47,922
...obsessed with beating
his former partner...

914
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:51,422
...who was building the
Bank of Manhattan tower at 927 feet.

915
01:02:51,593 --> 01:02:55,529
So Van Alen announced
the Chrysler Building at 925 feet...

916
01:02:55,697 --> 01:02:59,724
...and then surreptitiously assembled
the 180-foot mast inside the tower...

917
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,836
...and only revealed it after
the bank tower had been completed...

918
01:03:03,004 --> 01:03:05,700
...giving Van Alen the tallest building
for three months...

919
01:03:05,874 --> 01:03:08,468
...until of course...
- Until the Empire State Building.

920
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:17,644
All right, please give me the name
of Van Alen's former partner.

921
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:21,851
Who is H. Craig Severance?

922
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:29,724
- I find you annoying.
- Yes, I'm sure you do.

923
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:35,960
But it is pretty amazing what dreams
and lots of money can do, isn't it?

924
01:03:36,705 --> 01:03:38,263
Yes, it is.

925
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,776
- And you know you're part of that, George.
- Yes, I am.

926
01:03:43,078 --> 01:03:46,878
All you have to do is use your power
for good instead of evil.

927
01:03:48,316 --> 01:03:49,840
If only I would.

928
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:53,946
Listen...

929
01:03:54,356 --> 01:03:57,985
...I'm very sorry that these last couple
of months have been unbearable for you.

930
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,688
Not at all.
Unbearable would have been bearable.

931
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:06,129
Then I suppose it's a good thing
that your two weeks are almost up.

932
01:04:07,035 --> 01:04:08,559
This is it.

933
01:04:08,737 --> 01:04:12,036
I'll do the Children's League benefit.
I'll make sure June is set up.

934
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:14,505
I'll take a pass at your speech
for the groundbreaking...

935
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:16,701
...and I'll be out of your life forever.

936
01:04:17,045 --> 01:04:18,842
Great.

937
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:21,005
Super.

938
01:04:41,803 --> 01:04:45,034
- Hi.
- Hey, hey.

939
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:49,132
- I have tennis elbow from the other day.
- Oh, yes?

940
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:55,374
- Lucy has tennis forehead. Much worse.
- Oh, no. I still feel terrible about that.

941
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,809
Thank God she looks okay.

942
01:04:57,986 --> 01:05:01,114
Especially with that big benefit
you're all going to tonight.

943
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:03,723
- What was it again?
- It's a benefit...

944
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:07,123
...for the New York Children's League.
Lucy makes us give lots of money...

945
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:10,196
...to help society and get a tax break.
Brilliant.

946
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:12,663
- Sounds exciting.
- It would be almost impossible...

947
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:17,294
...to tell you how boring it is.
Largely because it would be too boring.

948
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:23,606
Well, boring to you might be scintillating
for a girl from Plainview, Wisconsin.

949
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:25,143
See you later.

950
01:05:25,313 --> 01:05:27,110
What about, if you're not busy...

951
01:05:27,515 --> 01:05:30,814
...a bunch of us are going,
do you want to come and be bored?

952
01:05:32,187 --> 01:05:34,519
I'd love to.

953
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:39,092
- All right. See you later.
- Okay.

954
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,530
Oh, good. These need to go to Accounting.

955
01:05:47,702 --> 01:05:50,262
- The loan agreements need to be notarized.
- I got it.

956
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:54,272
- Here's the Zoning Commission reports.
- Now you can start with the appraisals...

957
01:05:54,442 --> 01:05:56,501
Actually,
I don't know how much time I have.

958
01:05:56,678 --> 01:05:59,670
George sort of asked me
to go to the benefit with him tonight.

959
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,640
Great.

960
01:06:03,818 --> 01:06:07,481
I just have to figure out what to wear.
I don't have anything.

961
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:12,793
- "I don't have anything."
- God, she's nice.

962
01:06:16,865 --> 01:06:19,231
No, they're very good muffins.
They just need more fat.

963
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,028
George, sign these
or we default on five different loans.

964
01:06:22,203 --> 01:06:23,898
- Take care.
- Well, hang on. Hang on.

965
01:06:24,072 --> 01:06:26,370
- I need to go over my speech.
- Sorry. I gotta run.

966
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:29,101
We'll pick you up at eight
and go through it in the car.

967
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,245
I asked June to come.
Hope that's all right.

968
01:06:31,412 --> 01:06:34,472
Oh, that's dandy, but I don't need a ride.
Thanks.

969
01:06:41,222 --> 01:06:42,814
- Hello, Howard.
- <i>George...</i>

970
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:45,323
<i>... I just received new estimates</i>
<i>on Island Towers.</i>

971
01:06:45,493 --> 01:06:47,188
<i>Costs are skyrocketing.</i>

972
01:06:47,495 --> 01:06:50,259
<i>It will be cheaper to just knock down</i>
<i>the community center.</i>

973
01:06:50,431 --> 01:06:51,864
What are you talking about?

974
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:54,126
We only got the job because we said
we'd keep it.

975
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,998
- <i>We said we intended to keep the center.</i>
- No wait. You can't...

976
01:06:57,172 --> 01:06:59,538
This is nonsense.
You can't just decide unilaterally.

977
01:06:59,707 --> 01:07:01,004
- I'm coming over.
- <i>George.</i>

978
01:07:01,176 --> 01:07:04,634
<i>I want to take a nap before the benefit.</i>
<i>It's all very simple.</i>

979
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,307
Why can't we just build the towers
over the center?

980
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,677
<i>Because it will eat away our profits.</i>

981
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:12,342
<i>There's to be a groundbreaking ceremony</i>
<i>at Coney Island...</i>

982
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,750
<i>... with our friend Assemblyman Perez.</i>

983
01:07:14,923 --> 01:07:17,414
<i>All I need</i>
<i>is one of your charming speeches.</i>

984
01:07:17,592 --> 01:07:19,219
Well, you're not gonna get one.

985
01:07:19,561 --> 01:07:20,858
I need you there.

986
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:24,157
- I have to consult my schedule.
- No, you won't, George. It's your job.

987
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:28,132
You're the public face of the company.
They don't want to see me.

988
01:07:28,303 --> 01:07:31,329
I can't for the life of me think why not.
You're magnificent.

989
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,503
Look, whatever we lose on this deal,
I'm in for half.

990
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,975
You'll be in for nothing
at the rate you're going.

991
01:07:38,146 --> 01:07:42,412
Expensive divorces, poolside parties
at the hotel for 1000 people...

992
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:46,042
...including fireworks
and a performance by Sting.

993
01:07:46,221 --> 01:07:47,745
That was one special night.

994
01:07:47,922 --> 01:07:51,858
It was Wendy the concierge's farewell bash
and a very good party if I say so myself.

995
01:07:52,627 --> 01:07:55,926
Look, I know you don't have a clue,
but the economy is not what it was.

996
01:07:58,466 --> 01:08:01,799
Everything we've got, all of it, could go.

997
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,197
Faster than you can imagine.

998
01:08:05,173 --> 01:08:07,869
We need this built.

999
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:11,543
You're our closer
and you will help me close this deal...

1000
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:15,205
...or I will fire you
and take all your stock options.

1001
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:18,682
And I can't bear to see you like that,
George.

1002
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:21,754
You will help me close this deal, George,
won't you?

1003
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,923
I'm surprised you have to ask.

1004
01:08:26,794 --> 01:08:29,262
I wasn't really asking.

1005
01:08:31,266 --> 01:08:35,202
- You should have gone with George.
- Well, he asked June.

1006
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:39,773
- Not exclusively. He asked you too.
- He asked me too?

1007
01:08:39,941 --> 01:08:43,001
How many women should a man
take to dinner? Maybe in Utah.

1008
01:08:43,177 --> 01:08:46,078
- So you're gonna go alone?
- Sure, why not?

1009
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,245
Hey, I think it's great.

1010
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,976
I was always too scared
to go anywhere alone.

1011
01:08:51,152 --> 01:08:56,021
Then I got married.
Now I'll never be alone again.

1012
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,633
Check out this situation.
You two kids have fun.

1013
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,471
All right.

1014
01:09:18,413 --> 01:09:21,940
Howard. Helen, how are you?

1015
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,346
Mr. and Mrs. Wade, good evening.

1016
01:09:27,255 --> 01:09:28,779
- I hate these things.
- Ridiculous.

1017
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:31,323
Why can't we just give the money
and be done with it?

1018
01:09:31,659 --> 01:09:33,684
Yes, that'd be fun.
Who wants a drink?

1019
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:35,954
- I'd love some champagne.
- We don't want anything.

1020
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,121
- I'll have a Scotch.
- Great.

1021
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:41,325
I'll be right back
with one of the promotional bottles.

1022
01:09:44,505 --> 01:09:46,405
- Wade.
- Trump.

1023
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:50,372
- I hear Kelson finally dumped you.
- Not exactly, no.

1024
01:09:50,545 --> 01:09:53,912
We came to a mutual understanding that
she couldn't bear me for another second.

1025
01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:55,481
So who's the new chief counsel?

1026
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,346
If she's any good,
I'm gonna steal her away.

1027
01:09:58,853 --> 01:10:01,014
I doubt it. She seems quite Ioyal to me.

1028
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:03,589
- Let me be the judge of that.
- All right.

1029
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:06,124
I'm not intimidated.
I'll even lead you to her.

1030
01:10:06,294 --> 01:10:08,626
She's over there somewhere.

1031
01:11:16,697 --> 01:11:18,665
Good evening.

1032
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:21,032
Good evening.

1033
01:11:23,538 --> 01:11:25,233
Well, you look... I...

1034
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:28,039
I... You...

1035
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:32,043
- I can't wait to hear your speech.
- Yeah.

1036
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,914
No, it's just you look absolutely...

1037
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:37,481
...surprising.

1038
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:42,487
Well, you haven't seen
the whole outfit yet.

1039
01:11:46,394 --> 01:11:50,228
You see, ordinarily that would suit you
extremely well, but...

1040
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,529
Well, tonight you're...

1041
01:12:00,341 --> 01:12:02,104
I'm just...

1042
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,544
- Lucy, hey.
- Hi.

1043
01:12:08,716 --> 01:12:12,777
- Wow. I love your dress.
- Thank you.

1044
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:16,549
- And you look very beautiful.
- No.

1045
01:12:19,327 --> 01:12:23,491
- I'm sorry, was I interrupting something?
- No, no. We were just...

1046
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,333
...going over my speech.

1047
01:12:28,503 --> 01:12:31,495
Right. Work, work, work.

1048
01:12:31,839 --> 01:12:34,364
Howard wants me to revise
the Island Towers proposal...

1049
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:36,635
...now that we're tearing down
the community center.

1050
01:12:36,878 --> 01:12:41,577
- I could really use your help with that.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1051
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,411
George, can I please talk to you
for a second?

1052
01:12:46,587 --> 01:12:50,580
Hang on. They're about to shoot a man
out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream.

1053
01:12:50,758 --> 01:12:52,453
George.

1054
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:02,296
I don't care about Howard.

1055
01:13:06,373 --> 01:13:09,240
No community center. I see. Okay.

1056
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,314
We do give millions to charities.

1057
01:13:17,384 --> 01:13:18,476
So that justifies lying.

1058
01:13:18,652 --> 01:13:21,917
Since when is helping people
and telling the truth mutually exclusive?

1059
01:13:22,089 --> 01:13:24,182
- You promised me.
- Oh, here we go.

1060
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,293
You said you needed me to tell you
when you were being a schmuck.

1061
01:13:27,461 --> 01:13:30,919
It's frankly none of your business, is it?
You don't work here anymore!

1062
01:13:31,098 --> 01:13:34,192
I cannot believe you won't even try
to be the person you could be.

1063
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,960
- This is the person I could be.
- No.

1064
01:13:36,136 --> 01:13:39,162
You think you're second-rate
and there's nothing you can do.

1065
01:13:39,339 --> 01:13:42,934
And I never believed it until right now.
This minute.

1066
01:13:43,677 --> 01:13:46,737
This is the first time in a year
that I really don't like you.

1067
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:52,444
I haven't liked me for longer than that.
And I'm not crazy about you right now.

1068
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:55,144
Why don't you go and be the person
you're supposed to be.

1069
01:13:55,789 --> 01:13:58,815
Oh, good. I see the mature part
of the evening has begun.

1070
01:13:58,992 --> 01:14:01,222
Oh, buzz off, bozo.

1071
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:05,896
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the ice cream is ready.</i>

1072
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,933
<i>Here comes the topping.</i>

1073
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:23,238
George, thanks again.
This was a spectacular evening.

1074
01:14:23,784 --> 01:14:26,947
I can't wait to tell my family who I met.

1075
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,247
Why? Who did you meet?

1076
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,288
You.

1077
01:14:34,528 --> 01:14:37,691
- What?
- The elevator.

1078
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:43,564
- Evening.
- Evening.

1079
01:14:50,811 --> 01:14:52,904
- How's your room, by the way?
- Amazing.

1080
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:59,348
- But I want to pay you back with interest.
- Don't be ridiculous. I don't need interest.

1081
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:04,823
Well, this is me.

1082
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:07,858
So good night.

1083
01:15:08,028 --> 01:15:09,928
Yeah, good night.

1084
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:16,967
- I had a wonderful time.
- Good. I'm very glad about that.

1085
01:15:19,573 --> 01:15:21,973
So good night.

1086
01:15:24,377 --> 01:15:26,368
Yes, good night.

1087
01:15:40,794 --> 01:15:46,232
It's all right. I own the hotel.
Your breakfast is complimentary.

1088
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,005
Gorgeous.

1089
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:06,215
I know it's weird living in a hotel
but it somehow has a very homey feel.

1090
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,645
Would you like something
from the minibar?

1091
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:12,024
Maybe a beer.

1092
01:16:12,259 --> 01:16:13,920
Right.

1093
01:16:22,836 --> 01:16:26,897
Wow, chess. I love chess.

1094
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,903
You know what I love
even more than chess?

1095
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,542
Pokemon?

1096
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:37,082
Strip chess.

1097
01:16:38,752 --> 01:16:41,414
Yes, that is a very good game.

1098
01:16:51,665 --> 01:16:54,099
George?
We need to finish this conversation please...

1099
01:16:54,267 --> 01:16:57,327
- Lucy.
- Oh, June. Hi.

1100
01:16:57,504 --> 01:17:01,463
- Lucy, hi.
- Wow. Wow. Great slip.

1101
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:05,202
- That's a great dress.
- Oh, you know, same one as before.

1102
01:17:05,378 --> 01:17:09,109
All right. Break's over.
I'm gonna capture your bish...

1103
01:17:11,518 --> 01:17:12,951
- Hi.
- Hi.

1104
01:17:21,061 --> 01:17:22,995
We were just playing a little chess.

1105
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:28,190
And doing some laundry.

1106
01:17:28,368 --> 01:17:30,302
Oh, well, that's okay.

1107
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,928
'Cause I was just about to go off
and have some sex myself.

1108
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:36,166
I mean, not by myself...

1109
01:17:36,343 --> 01:17:40,837
...but with somebody. Somebody else.

1110
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:44,584
Oh, you don't know him.
He's in my apartment.

1111
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:46,685
Yeah, in my bed.

1112
01:17:48,521 --> 01:17:50,887
His name is Barry. Yeah.

1113
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:54,151
Barry in my bed. Okay, bye.

1114
01:17:58,665 --> 01:18:00,860
That was embarrassing.

1115
01:18:34,734 --> 01:18:36,258
- Hey.
- Hey.

1116
01:18:36,436 --> 01:18:39,200
- What's wrong?
- Thanks for your shoes.

1117
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:43,137
Hold on, lady. Look at me.
What happened?

1118
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:45,800
- Nothing.
- Something happened.

1119
01:18:45,979 --> 01:18:49,471
I've known you since Brownies,
I've never seen you cry.

1120
01:18:49,649 --> 01:18:52,174
Except when Bush won.

1121
01:18:52,986 --> 01:18:54,954
Which Bush?

1122
01:18:55,121 --> 01:19:00,354
- Both of them. So maybe you cried twice.
- This is a different George.

1123
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,188
I'm sorry.

1124
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:05,024
It's not supposed to be like this.

1125
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:07,632
Maybe it is.

1126
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:13,135
Maybe it's like the philosopher
Sri Yogananda says:

1127
01:19:13,306 --> 01:19:18,938
"Only that which is the other,
gives us fully unto ourselves."

1128
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,544
Look. I had to fight for Tom.
It was the best thing I ever did.

1129
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:25,776
Really?

1130
01:19:26,653 --> 01:19:28,951
Everything okay?

1131
01:19:29,122 --> 01:19:35,118
- Not now. Everything is not about you!
- Okay.

1132
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:00,449
Quiet, everyone. Quiet down, please.

1133
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,315
Thank you.

1134
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:08,418
I have a little poem I wrote for you, Lucy.
If you could just come up here.

1135
01:20:09,062 --> 01:20:10,689
Please.

1136
01:20:18,838 --> 01:20:21,773
- You ready for this?
- Rhyme away.

1137
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:26,801
<i>A rolling stone gathers no moss</i>

1138
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,711
<i>So</i>

1139
01:20:29,516 --> 01:20:33,418
<i>You're leaving</i>
<i>With your antacids and floss</i>

1140
01:20:33,753 --> 01:20:38,952
<i>Our hair perhaps we will toss</i>
<i>But we are at a loss</i>

1141
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:45,086
<i>Because you are the world's best boss</i>

1142
01:20:54,274 --> 01:20:56,674
Well, that was a very nice speech
you just made...

1143
01:20:56,843 --> 01:21:03,214
...and I'm going to really miss everyone
here at Wade.

1144
01:21:05,051 --> 01:21:07,781
There are a million memories
I wouldn't trade...

1145
01:21:07,954 --> 01:21:14,359
...and if you ever get accused of murder,
you can find me at Legal Aid.

1146
01:21:18,898 --> 01:21:21,731
- What was that?
- Well, it was the same thing you just did.

1147
01:21:21,901 --> 01:21:25,530
Bye. Bye. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Nice...

1148
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:26,865
- Bye.
- Bye.

1149
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,099
I'll really miss
all your comprehensive reports.

1150
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:31,004
Me too. Me too.

1151
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:34,271
Lucy. Thank you so much for everything.

1152
01:21:34,781 --> 01:21:37,079
No problem.
Well, good luck with everything.

1153
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:40,219
And I'm sorry about last night.
That was awkward.

1154
01:21:40,453 --> 01:21:45,447
- Oh, not at all. Brian was unbelievable.
- I thought it was Barry.

1155
01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:51,529
Well, Barry was first, and then
it was Brian, and it was just crowded.

1156
01:21:53,132 --> 01:21:55,828
- I almost forgot my stapler.
- Is that...? Oh, God.

1157
01:21:56,002 --> 01:21:57,936
- What?
- Never mind.

1158
01:21:58,104 --> 01:22:00,868
- No, no. What?
- Well, it's just that technically...

1159
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,976
...the stapler belongs to the company.
- That's right.

1160
01:22:05,144 --> 01:22:07,078
But... No, you know what? Whatever.

1161
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:10,444
It's... The stapler just goes way back
with me. And I...

1162
01:22:10,617 --> 01:22:13,245
Well, no, no. You keep it.
It'll be our little secret.

1163
01:22:13,419 --> 01:22:15,478
- Really?
- Yeah.

1164
01:22:15,655 --> 01:22:17,680
Great, thank you. Thank you very much.

1165
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:19,347
I guess I have kind of earned it...

1166
01:22:19,525 --> 01:22:22,289
...working here 18 hours a day,
seven days a week.

1167
01:22:22,462 --> 01:22:25,329
Wow. Guess that makes you a workaholic.

1168
01:22:25,498 --> 01:22:28,228
No, actually, those are the hours
when you work with George.

1169
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:31,328
Well, no. I mean,
I can be a workaholic too.

1170
01:22:31,504 --> 01:22:36,168
That's why I'm vigilant about separating
my personal and professional life.

1171
01:22:36,342 --> 01:22:40,745
Really? Well, I guess that would explain
the late-night meeting in your slip.

1172
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:43,474
- I'm sorry?
- What?

1173
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,675
That is absolutely none of your business.

1174
01:22:45,852 --> 01:22:47,752
My God. Fine.
How much does a stapler run?

1175
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,650
Here, here's $10.

1176
01:22:49,822 --> 01:22:51,289
- Ridiculous.
- It's not your stapler.

1177
01:22:51,457 --> 01:22:53,789
What's the matter with you?
Give me my stapler.

1178
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,427
Look. You didn't pay for it.

1179
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:59,691
- Give me... You have more of these!
- It's not your... Oh, my God.

1180
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,095
- No. No.
- All we're missing is the mud.

1181
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,430
All right. Enough. Enough. Leave.

1182
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:08,005
- She's hurting me!
- Leave, leave. Off, off.

1183
01:23:08,174 --> 01:23:09,903
In here.

1184
01:23:10,076 --> 01:23:12,135
<i>You are dead!</i>

1185
01:23:15,114 --> 01:23:17,912
- What was that?
- Your girlfriend wouldn't give me my stapler.

1186
01:23:18,084 --> 01:23:21,019
- Part of a new office supply strip search.
- Your stapler?

1187
01:23:21,187 --> 01:23:23,382
Are you still knocking down
the community center?

1188
01:23:24,324 --> 01:23:25,882
Listen.

1189
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:30,251
- I know you're upset about last night.
- Still knocking down the community center?

1190
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:33,763
- I've been trying to call you...
- Still knocking down the community center?

1191
01:23:33,933 --> 01:23:37,528
What is wrong with you? Are you
incapable of talking about your own life?

1192
01:23:37,704 --> 01:23:39,729
Still knocking down
the community center?

1193
01:23:39,906 --> 01:23:44,206
All right. Let me remind you.
You came to the hotel.

1194
01:23:44,377 --> 01:23:46,811
I was with June.
We were unusually dressed.

1195
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,471
You must... You must have some feelings.

1196
01:23:56,522 --> 01:23:59,252
I don't have to listen to this.

1197
01:24:00,026 --> 01:24:03,018
You know what, where do you come off?

1198
01:24:03,262 --> 01:24:06,754
Where do you come off? Believe it or not,
I didn't take this job to sleep with you.

1199
01:24:06,933 --> 01:24:09,731
- I took this job for a cause.
- You are a cause!

1200
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:11,995
You make Gandhi
look like a used-car salesman.

1201
01:24:12,171 --> 01:24:15,663
My God. You know what I can't believe?
How easy you are being on yourself.

1202
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:20,279
Why don't we go over this again, okay?
You promised me a community center.

1203
01:24:20,446 --> 01:24:23,074
Yes! I promised, I promised, I promised.
I'm sorry.

1204
01:24:23,249 --> 01:24:25,877
I can't control the economy.
I can't control my brother.

1205
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:30,984
- I think you'll find a lot of people are!
- I'm human!

1206
01:24:35,259 --> 01:24:37,591
None of us can keep up with you.
That's probably why...

1207
01:24:37,762 --> 01:24:39,992
...all those other guys bolted.

1208
01:24:42,066 --> 01:24:44,000
'Cause you're intolerable!

1209
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:48,038
No one wants to live with a saint.
Saints are boring.

1210
01:24:58,315 --> 01:25:01,113
Mr. Wade, your brother wants to see you.

1211
01:25:03,387 --> 01:25:04,979
Right.

1212
01:25:18,302 --> 01:25:20,896
Hi, Mr. Wong?

1213
01:25:21,072 --> 01:25:25,304
Yes, Lucy Kelson.
Yeah, it's been a long time, huh?

1214
01:25:25,476 --> 01:25:27,341
I'm back at my parents' house.

1215
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:31,607
It's kind of fun being in my old bedroom
and in the neighb...

1216
01:25:31,849 --> 01:25:37,185
Sorry. Can I have two number sixes...

1217
01:25:37,354 --> 01:25:41,290
...and a number, a number 12?

1218
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:43,620
Yes, that's for one.

1219
01:25:43,794 --> 01:25:46,092
Always for one.

1220
01:25:46,263 --> 01:25:48,060
Yes. That's it. No.
You know what...

1221
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:52,931
...just throw in a couple egg rolls
and that would be great.

1222
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:04,280
For years, Coney Island has been
trying to attract this kind of development.

1223
01:26:05,516 --> 01:26:10,146
Hopefully, Island Towers
is the start of big things to come.

1224
01:26:10,321 --> 01:26:12,949
And now, it is my honor
to introduce to you...

1225
01:26:13,224 --> 01:26:18,491
...one of the men who made this
all possible, George Wade.

1226
01:26:19,396 --> 01:26:23,059
- You look great.
- Go and earn your money, George.

1227
01:26:28,272 --> 01:26:31,264
- Thanks so much.
- Great.

1228
01:26:31,442 --> 01:26:34,707
Thank you very much, Assemblyman Perez.

1229
01:26:36,447 --> 01:26:38,381
Your mom is teaching today...

1230
01:26:38,549 --> 01:26:41,518
...so we'd better grab a bite to eat
and be on our way.

1231
01:26:41,685 --> 01:26:44,745
We have some protesting to do
at the community center.

1232
01:26:44,922 --> 01:26:46,856
I'm not going.

1233
01:26:47,057 --> 01:26:49,082
- What are you talking about?
- I cannot watch...

1234
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,319
...another building get knocked down.

1235
01:26:51,495 --> 01:26:55,226
Hey. We didn't raise you
to sit on the sidelines.

1236
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:58,732
Ever since you were a little girl,
you fought for what you believed in.

1237
01:26:58,903 --> 01:27:01,497
You were on the White House
Enemies list at 5.

1238
01:27:01,672 --> 01:27:04,698
Dad, I'm not sitting on the sidelines.
I'm going to work.

1239
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:07,002
What's the point?
The man's not gonna listen to me.

1240
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:10,875
Besides, you know, he said
some things to me that were just so...

1241
01:27:13,951 --> 01:27:15,350
True.

1242
01:27:15,753 --> 01:27:18,813
Then you change your tactics,
you change your argument.

1243
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:20,251
You don't give up.

1244
01:27:20,424 --> 01:27:25,452
We didn't give up on civil rights
or equality for women or fair housing.

1245
01:27:25,863 --> 01:27:27,524
Honey.

1246
01:27:27,932 --> 01:27:31,629
As long as people can change,
the world can change.

1247
01:27:31,936 --> 01:27:34,461
Yeah, but what if people can't change?

1248
01:27:38,776 --> 01:27:40,403
Well...

1249
01:27:40,578 --> 01:27:42,603
...let me put it this way.

1250
01:27:43,447 --> 01:27:47,474
I'm sitting here eating a piece
of cheesecake made entirely of soy.

1251
01:27:47,851 --> 01:27:49,284
And I hate it.

1252
01:27:50,354 --> 01:27:52,413
But I'm eating it.

1253
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:04,023
I'm going to work. Bye. Good luck.

1254
01:28:11,675 --> 01:28:13,267
The law is pretty clear on this.

1255
01:28:13,444 --> 01:28:16,902
If the landlord has not kept up
proper maintenance, he cannot evict you.

1256
01:28:17,081 --> 01:28:18,412
We will help you, Mrs. Munez.

1257
01:28:18,582 --> 01:28:22,575
Let me run and get you some forms
that you can fill out, and we'll get started.

1258
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:37,429
Well, hello.

1259
01:28:37,701 --> 01:28:40,898
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

1260
01:28:41,071 --> 01:28:45,098
Polly St. Clair? You interviewed me?
You thought I was having a baby?

1261
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:48,609
Oh, yes. Yes, Polly. Wow.

1262
01:28:48,779 --> 01:28:50,303
So you work here now.

1263
01:28:50,481 --> 01:28:53,712
- Terrific. How are you?
- Pregnant.

1264
01:28:54,718 --> 01:28:57,448
- I'm not falling for that one again.
- No, I'm really pregnant.

1265
01:28:57,621 --> 01:29:00,522
- You can congratulate me now.
- Polly, I was not born yesterday.

1266
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:02,989
I'm pregnant!
You want to see the damn sonogram?

1267
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,094
Mrs. Munez, we have two other cases...

1268
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:06,820
Hi.

1269
01:29:09,967 --> 01:29:12,663
Hi. I'm busy.

1270
01:29:13,237 --> 01:29:15,068
Yes.

1271
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:18,307
I need your advice on one last thing...

1272
01:29:18,475 --> 01:29:20,909
...and then I promise
you will never hear from me again.

1273
01:29:21,078 --> 01:29:24,639
I just delivered the first speech written
entirely by myself since we met...

1274
01:29:24,815 --> 01:29:30,947
...and I think I may have blown it,
so I wanted to ask your thoughts.

1275
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:34,090
Okay. Then I will read it to you.

1276
01:29:34,258 --> 01:29:36,749
"I'd like to welcome everyone
on this special day.

1277
01:29:36,927 --> 01:29:39,293
Island Towers will bring prestige
to the neighborhood...

1278
01:29:39,463 --> 01:29:41,294
...and become part
of Brooklyn's renaissance.

1279
01:29:41,465 --> 01:29:43,695
And we're very pleased
and proud to be here.

1280
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:46,563
Unfortunately,
there is one fly in the ointment.

1281
01:29:46,737 --> 01:29:48,534
You see, I gave my word to someone...

1282
01:29:48,706 --> 01:29:51,675
...that we wouldn't knock down
this building behind me.

1283
01:29:51,842 --> 01:29:55,369
Normally, and those who know me
or were married to me can attest to this...

1284
01:29:55,546 --> 01:29:59,539
...my word wouldn't mean very much.
So why does it this time?

1285
01:29:59,717 --> 01:30:02,584
Well, partly because this building
is an architectural gem...

1286
01:30:02,753 --> 01:30:04,880
...and deserves to be landmarked.

1287
01:30:05,055 --> 01:30:10,891
Partly because people do need a place
to do senior's water ballet and CPR.

1288
01:30:11,061 --> 01:30:13,291
Preferably not together.

1289
01:30:14,398 --> 01:30:19,665
But mainly because this person,
despite being unusually stubborn...

1290
01:30:19,837 --> 01:30:26,242
...and unwilling to compromise
and a very poor dresser, is...

1291
01:30:27,378 --> 01:30:29,243
She's...

1292
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:34,147
...rather like the building
she loves so much.

1293
01:30:34,318 --> 01:30:38,880
A little rough around the edges,
but when you look closely...

1294
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:41,621
...absolutely beautiful.

1295
01:30:44,328 --> 01:30:47,024
And the only one of her kind.

1296
01:30:51,535 --> 01:30:55,232
And even though I've said cruel things
and driven her away...

1297
01:30:55,572 --> 01:30:57,904
...she's become the voice in my head.

1298
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:02,806
And I can't seem to drown her out.

1299
01:31:06,016 --> 01:31:08,883
And I don't want to drown her out.

1300
01:31:12,723 --> 01:31:16,250
So we are going to keep
the community center.

1301
01:31:18,462 --> 01:31:21,329
Because I gave my word to her...

1302
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:27,093
...and because we gave our word
to the community."

1303
01:31:30,941 --> 01:31:33,034
And I didn't sleep with June.

1304
01:31:34,778 --> 01:31:39,306
That's not in the speech, that's just me
letting you know that important fact.

1305
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,152
What do you think?

1306
01:31:53,897 --> 01:31:56,263
I have to get back to work.

1307
01:32:05,008 --> 01:32:06,498
Right.

1308
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:10,237
Right, yes, yes, yes. Sorry to disturb.

1309
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:17,710
Congratulations again, Polly.

1310
01:32:44,181 --> 01:32:48,413
Aside from the split infinitive
that was somewhere in the middle...

1311
01:32:49,586 --> 01:32:52,453
...that speech was actually quite perfect,
wasn't it?

1312
01:32:52,623 --> 01:32:56,559
Yeah. I don't know what the hell
you're still doing sitting here.

1313
01:32:56,727 --> 01:32:59,093
And I don't even like him.

1314
01:33:17,781 --> 01:33:19,476
George!

1315
01:33:42,105 --> 01:33:46,906
George, I just want to say thank you.

1316
01:33:47,344 --> 01:33:49,835
Thank you and I know
I can be harsh and demanding...

1317
01:33:50,013 --> 01:33:53,107
...but I want to try and change
because I believe people can change.

1318
01:33:53,283 --> 01:33:57,379
I can change and not be so demanding
and, you know, like, meet you halfway.

1319
01:33:57,554 --> 01:34:00,614
I just... I know... Things just...

1320
01:34:01,925 --> 01:34:03,722
Once I...

1321
01:34:06,597 --> 01:34:07,757
Lucy...

1322
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:10,931
...I am in love with you.

1323
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:15,902
And I'm in love with you.

1324
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:26,178
Oh, I should just mention
that I have resigned...

1325
01:34:26,683 --> 01:34:29,083
...and am now poor.
- Good.

1326
01:34:29,252 --> 01:34:33,712
When I say poor, I mean we may have to
share a helicopter with another family.

1327
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:35,551
Does that work for you?

1328
01:34:35,726 --> 01:34:39,355
As long as I don't have to work for you,
we will be fine.

1329
01:34:39,529 --> 01:34:41,156
Excellent.

1330
01:34:42,332 --> 01:34:46,200
And now I would very much like
to discuss that whole bobcat-pretzel thing.

1331
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:50,201
Oh, I was just kidding.
I'm allergic to bobcats, actually.

1332
01:34:50,474 --> 01:34:51,873
I'm very sorry to hear that.

1333
01:34:52,809 --> 01:34:57,041
- But I can do the pretzel.
- That's excellent news.

1334
01:35:38,722 --> 01:35:40,451
Hi, Mr. Wong, it's Lucy Kelson.

1335
01:35:40,624 --> 01:35:45,323
I need one number 13,
two number sevens...

1336
01:35:45,495 --> 01:35:48,123
I can't believe how small this apartment is.
It's shocking.

1337
01:35:48,298 --> 01:35:53,827
I need three number eights, no garlic.

1338
01:35:54,004 --> 01:35:56,939
It's good your parents went to the movies.
We'd never have squeezed in.

1339
01:35:57,107 --> 01:36:02,409
I need one number seven and...

1340
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:05,742
I can walk from one side of this apartment
to the other in six seconds.

1341
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:11,479
- Watch this. One...
- And a number 11, please.

1342
01:36:11,655 --> 01:36:14,146
No, actually this is for two.

1343
01:41:03,747 --> 01:41:04,736
