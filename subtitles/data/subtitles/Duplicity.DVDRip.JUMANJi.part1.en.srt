00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,017
So how long
were you gonna keep me waiting?

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,424
Excuse me?

3
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,588
- I'm dying over there.
- Where?

4
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,600
There, by the Ben Franklin
potato salad pavilion.

5
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,364
I'm sorry.
Are we supposed to know each other?

6
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,339
Definitely. I mean, we're supposed to.
We don't, but we should.

7
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,840
- Ray. Ray Koval.
- Theresa Corrado.

8
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,847
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

9
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,440
- Happy Independence Day.
- And to you.

10
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,018
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if it's the
knee or something, but I'm a little confused.

11
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,618
I thought we were checking each other out.

12
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,063
No. Sorry. Maybe you're drunk.

13
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,896
No, no, no.
If I was drunk, I'd be coming on to you.

14
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,026
That's a relief.

15
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,197
If I was drunk,
I'd be saying how amazing you look...

16
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,832
...and how crazy it is
that you're standing here on your own.

17
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,072
Wow. Are you always like this?

18
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:57,206
No. I sometimes sound like this,
but this is definitely different.

19
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,675
- What's so different?
- I don't know.

20
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,089
I guess that's what I came over to find out.

21
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,090
<i>You're kidding, right?
I'm dead serious.</i>

22
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,525
<i>Behind me?
He made the turn with us on 6th.</i>

23
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,393
<i>Hey, if this is some kind of game
you guys play to keep things exciting...</i>

24
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,228
<i>I gotta tell you, it's a little sad.</i>

25
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,962
<i>This is no game, Ray.
This is real.</i>

26
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,299
<i>Like I told you, man,
this is old-school espionage.</i>

27
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,033
<i>Moscow rules. Street spies.</i>

28
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,905
<i>How far behind me?</i>

29
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,877
<i>He's about three meters back.
He must have picked us up downtown.</i>

30
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,413
<i>And you know this guy?</i>

31
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,882
<i>I've seen him around.
He's definitely Burkett & Randle.</i>

32
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,479
<i>I keep telling you, man. These people
take soap and shaving cream very seriously.</i>

33
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,149
So I guess that means we're going to plan B.

34
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,623
<i>Let's do it.</i>

35
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,923
<i>- What's he wearing?
- Navy turtleneck, gray jacket.</i>

36
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,471
That was sweet, man.
It's all good. It's all good.

37
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,973
There's no way this guy is working solo,
so if we want to bust you out...

38
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,443
...we're gonna have to make a little noise
up here at the corner.

39
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,078
<i>You wanna box him out of here
or leapfrog? What do you wanna do?</i>

40
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,144
I still think you're messing with me.

41
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,485
Call it, Ray. Box or leapfrog?

42
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,983
Or maybe you just want to find out
if I'm worth the money.

43
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,086
<i>Come on, man.
- Leapfrog.</i>

44
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,796
Jesus!

45
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,467
Watch where you go. It's New York, okay?

46
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,065
Let me help.

47
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,634
Open the eyes!

48
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,389
<i>- Hey, you there?
What are you doing?</i>

49
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,925
Problem.

50
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,763
<i>I thought you were in position.
- I am. I was.</i>

51
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,364
<i>We're two minutes away.</i>

52
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,933
<i>- We're blown.
- What are you talking about?</i>

53
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,171
Reschedule the meet.

54
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,237
No. No can do.

55
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,576
We're blown. Just walk away.

56
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:15,085
Listen to me. I know what it's like.
New guy on the team, big game...

57
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,553
<i>...you wanna make a good impression.</i>

58
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,723
Hello? Ray?

59
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,000
Remember me?

60
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,502
- Sure. Of course. We...
- Long time, huh?

61
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,773
- Yes!
- Gotcha.

62
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,373
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Just what?

63
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,508
I'm drawing a blank.

64
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,279
- Nice try.
- Excuse me?

65
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,288
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

66
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,018
- How do I know you?
- How do you know me?

67
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,656
Wow! That's tough.
That's a strong play.

68
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,629
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time
thinking what this would be like...

69
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,033
...where we'd be, what
I'd say, what you'd say.

70
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,298
- But I never thought that you'd...
- I'm terribly sorry.

71
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,839
You really want to go this way?

72
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,534
You clearly have me confused
with someone else.

73
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,734
I don't know.

74
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,368
I mean, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

75
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,243
Faces, I'm definitely better.
Faces, I'm like a B, B minus.

76
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,512
Where I'm good, where I really excel,
people I've slept with.

77
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,247
That's been a traditional area of strength
for me.

78
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,381
Look, seriously,
I don't know who you think I am, but...

79
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,049
You charm me, you seduce me,
you screw me...

80
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,594
...then you drug me
and ransack my hotel room.

81
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,927
And how sick is this? You know, the last
thing I remember before I passed out...

82
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,000
...was how much I liked you.

83
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,493
All right. You don't look crazy...

84
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,334
...which is the only reason
why I'm not screaming...

85
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,706
- For a security guard right now, but...
- I can't believe you're going this way.

86
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,713
Wait. Is this a joke?
Is that what it is?

87
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,610
Do you have any idea how far my ass
was hanging out because of you?

88
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,447
Did I win something?

89
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,115
I woke up the next morning,
I went back to the consul.

90
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,885
I practically crawled over glass
to get a copy of the guest list.

91
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,722
I spent the next 24 hours
trying to figure out...

92
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,662
...if you were working for Mossad,
the Syrians or the Russians.

93
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,724
- And which was it?
- Still working for the CIA?

94
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,730
Okay, I think we're done now.

95
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:23,005
American Consulate, Dubai,
you and me, Fourth of July, 2003.

96
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,201
Find someone else to bother.

97
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,437
- Red, white and blue margaritas.
- Stay away from me.

98
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,844
I had a knee brace, you had toe rings.
First toe ring I ever saw, by the way.

99
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,177
You follow me, I'll scream.

100
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,242
I took vacation time
to find you! Five years.

101
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,718
And every time I walked
into an evaluation...

102
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,688
- I'm warning you for the last time.
... I was waiting for them...

103
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,951
...to throw your picture
on the screen and say...

104
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,083
"So, Ray, anything you care to tell us
about Dubai?"

105
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,253
- You are harassing me!
- So who the hell are you?

106
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,292
Oh, no. You?

107
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,099
- You're the drop.
- You're my contact?

108
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,942
You're acting like
I owe you an apology.

109
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,483
Knock yourself out.

110
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,247
You were an assignment. You're a big boy.
You knew what you were doing.

111
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,879
I can see it's really been eating at you.

112
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,915
An Ml6 case officer takes a strange girl
from an embassy party...

113
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,758
...back to his hotel room
where he has an unsecured briefcase...

114
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,321
- Full of Egyptian Air Defense codes.
- Did they tell you to sleep with me?

115
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,162
I needed the codes. I thought the less time
I spent with you, the better.

116
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,067
- Oh, Jesus.
- How did you get on this project?

117
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,470
- And you're the mole.
- And who the hell hired you anyway?

118
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,337
- I can't believe it.
- How did you get this job?

119
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,273
I got news for you, okay?
The day I left Ml6...

120
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,938
I had 15 major companies
begging for my services.

121
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,312
Well, I guess you picked wrong.
But you must be used to that.

122
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,852
- You know, I've got a meeting in 12
minutes. - Where's the drop? Hand it over.

123
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,252
- Forget it. I'm not working with you.
- Excuse me?

124
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,985
You think I'm gonna let you
be my contact officer?

125
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,526
- This is way over your head.
- Over my head?

126
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,926
Lady, I worked Yemen, Athens and Cairo.

127
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,363
I've been promoted and decorated
every place I served.

128
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,933
Tell Duke to send someone else.

129
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,367
Listen. I'm sure you know your way
around a shoe store...

130
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,028
...but I did 12 years in the field.

131
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,868
And how long have you been working
for Equikrom?

132
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,839
- Long enough.
- How long?

133
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,944
Three weeks.

134
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,972
Three whole weeks? Like every day?

135
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,279
Well, I've spent the last 14 months
undercover inside Burkett & Randle.

136
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,189
I'm an Assistant Director
of Counterintelligence. I am all the way in.

137
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,955
So let's get this straight.
I'm the asset here. You're a delivery boy.

138
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,020
And the only thing I'm gonna give you
is a message.

139
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,123
Tell Duke I don't ever wanna see you again.

140
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,305
I run field agents for a living.
There's only two ways to do it.

141
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,396
Either you bring them flowers...

142
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,565
...or you hang them by their heels
out of the window.

143
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,974
Now, maybe you're so used to having
your legs in the air you don't realize it...

144
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,639
...but you're upside down, sister.

145
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,977
I own you.

146
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:49,146
- You've 10 seconds to get your hand off me.
- Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

147
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,183
I like this gig.
I like the money. I like the hours.

148
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,557
So I'm not going anywhere,
and you're gonna get over it...

149
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,357
...because if you ever mention again
that you don't wanna work with me...

150
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,991
...or that we've met before or that you
think someone else might do a better job...

151
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,763
...if I get replaced
for any reason at all...

152
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm gonna call those suckers
over at Burkett & Randle...

153
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:11,768
...and tell them they have an Equikrom spy
in the heart of their security team.

154
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,443
Be a shame to let the last 14 months
go down the drain, wouldn't it?

155
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,887
So where's my package?

156
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,359
Tell Duke this is the one
he's been waiting for.

157
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,959
- You screw this up, I'll ruin your life.
- I thought you tried that already.

158
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,967
You wanna take one last shot
at that apology?

159
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,160
Okay. Thank you.

160
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,652
What'd she say exactly?
I mean, her exact words.

161
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,761
She said, "Tell Duke
this is the one he's been waiting for. "

162
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,635
Do you wanna do it?
- Go ahead.

163
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,810
Easy. Just...
Just, you know, pull it out.

164
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,771
- Slowly. Slowly, slowly.
- Duke.

165
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,609
All right, go ahead.

166
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,312
Pam, Pam, easy, don't tear it.
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, just... Careful.

167
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,982
- For Christ's sake, Duke,
keep your shirt on. - Just...

168
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,322
Do something useful.
Punch up Tully's fingerprints.

169
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,322
Wow. Look at this.

170
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,163
So is this the big one?

171
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,967
- I gotta call Garsik right away.
Yeah.

172
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,673
Come on.
I need a secure line at Equikrom.

173
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,995
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

174
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,880
<i>Houston.
This was over the weekend.</i>

175
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,040
<i>Who are they?</i>

176
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,883
Researchers at the fragrance lab down there,
when they're not dealing ecstasy.

177
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,717
Track it.

178
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,524
West Coast Market Coordinator
of the Floor Wax Division.

179
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,157
Came back from lunch on Friday,
handed in his resignation.

180
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,030
- Unexpected?
- Very.

181
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,662
Three kids in private school,
he just remortgaged his house...

182
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,705
- And the wife has a heart condition.
- All right.

183
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,073
Well, get his financials, phone, e-mail,
and get the wife's prognosis.

184
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,676
Senior V.P., Medical Disposables.
He called in Sunday...

185
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,376
...lost his laptop in the Denver Airport.

186
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,941
Why does this guy look familiar?

187
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,887
He had a briefcase
full of sales projections stolen last year.

188
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,384
- Is this the guy who bought the boat?
- Same guy.

189
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,693
- All right. Get a team up his ass tonight.
- I sent them this morning.

190
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,595
We're in a meeting.

191
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,430
Now? Everyone?

192
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,541
Well, did they say why?

193
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,613
It's Tully. Mr. Tully's coming down.

194
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,948
He wants the entire floor gathered
in five minutes.

195
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,780
<i>Dick, it's just that you have
a very busy schedule today.</i>

196
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,155
Yeah, well, something's come up.

197
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,422
There's the dandruff shampoo
marketing presentation at 3:00.

198
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,930
- Cancel.
- They're in the building.

199
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,022
Make it tomorrow.

200
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,432
The nail polish R&D group from Germany
is at 3:45.

201
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,595
Reschedule.

202
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,605
You've got a premium
diaper teleconference...

203
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,265
- At 4:15.
- Tape it.

204
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,832
The nasal decongestant
rebranding numbers are in.

205
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,139
- They wanted 15 minutes at around...
- Cancel!

206
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,047
And the toothpaste. And the car wax dinner.
Cancel it all.

207
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,979
All right, let's have a look at me.

208
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,630
There should be another vehicle.

209
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,632
Yeah. Change of plans.
You're going with them.

210
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,898
Everybody's going. Let's go, come on.
Get out there and sell it, folks!

211
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,996
Go, go, go! Come on!
Get the hell out of here!

212
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,677
Get out! Leave it running.
Leave it running. I'm driving.

213
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,360
This is starting to look pretty good.

214
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,831
I can't even tell them apart.
Which one is the new one?

215
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,231
Right here.

216
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,230
- This is 16.
- That's a match.

217
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,769
Boris, handwriting?

218
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,111
Hundred percent. It's Howard Tully.

219
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,183
All right.
Burkett & Randle, here we come!

220
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,342
Guys?

221
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,350
Duke? I'm locked out. Again.

222
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,493
Yeah, I'm standing right outside.

223
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,891
Of course it's me!
Who the hell else has this number?

224
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,400
Yeah, okay. Duke, you know, for all
the money that I'm spending on this...

225
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,233
...you could've given me a code
that I can remember.

226
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,363
Sir!

227
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,215
What the hell is this?

228
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,952
<i>Why are we here?</i>

229
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,726
<i>We are here today
because the rules have changed.</i>

230
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,902
<i>We're here because the fabric of integrity
has been so abused and mangled...</i>

231
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:24,066
<i>...that it is little more
than a threadbare memory.</i>

232
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,276
<i>We're here because it's no longer enough
to have the best ideas...</i>

233
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:34,250
...or the best manufacturing, or the
best pipeline to deliver your product.

234
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,823
"We're here today because we find ourselves
in a world where duplicity and theft...

235
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:44,589
"are tested daily as replacements
for innovation and perseverance. "

236
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,829
"Tested daily. " What a bunch of crap.
Can you believe this?

237
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,338
This from a guy who bought a dump
so he could go through our garbage.

238
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,805
<i>I believe the history
of all successful endeavors...</i>

239
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:01,436
<i>...can be reduced to a series
of decisive moments.</i>

240
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,115
"There are moments in the history
of all things...

241
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,673
"where the placement of a single... "

242
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,118
<i>...where the placement of a single molecule
can make the difference...</i>

243
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,679
<i>...between triumph and catastrophe.</i>

244
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,157
I mean, who the hell writes
with a fountain pen anymore?

245
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,093
For Christ's sake.
How fricking pretentious is that?

246
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,859
<i>This room we're in now,
this entire program...</i>

247
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,800
<i>...was created in anticipation
of just such a moment.</i>

248
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,203
<i>You people are the very best at what you do.</i>

249
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:34,641
<i>You were chosen by that standard.
You've been paid and treated accordingly.</i>

250
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:41,181
<i>And you have never been tested
as you are about to be tested.</i>

251
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,551
"Burkett & Randle will be rolling out
a new product...

252
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,560
"in the very near future. "

253
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,187
<i>And while I cannot reveal
the nature of this product...</i>

254
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,600
<i>...believe me when I tell you that simply
by announcing its development...</i>

255
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:04,903
"... B&R will be dramatically repositioned
at the summit of the global marketplace. "

256
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,278
<i>I don't need to explain to anybody
in this room...</i>

257
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,941
<i>...why the scope, the details,
the very existence of this project...</i>

258
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,348
<i>...must be so carefully protected.</i>

259
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,787
<i>I expect your best in days to come...</i>

260
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,750
<i>...and I promise you,
if we stay focused and vigilant...</i>

261
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,124
<i>...we will, all of us...</i>

262
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,865
"... Prosper. "

263
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,866
What the hell does he have over there?

264
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,773
Dick? Dick? Don't go dark on me now.

265
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,269
Dick!

266
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,648
We gotta stay positive. Hey, look around.

267
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,410
This is why we're here.

268
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,115
When you came to me,
that first conversation, this is it.

269
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,623
This is why we built the unit.

270
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,888
- I know what he's doing.
- Dick. Dick!

271
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,062
Look at me.
This is a great team we've got here.

272
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,223
Mmm-hmm.

273
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,325
Yeah. We are so prepped.
We are so ready to deploy.

274
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,496
You say the word,
you unleash the beast, Dick.

275
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,007
- We will tear this thing apart.
- He's just timing the blow, Duke.

276
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:16,069
- No. Wrong. We caught a break here.
- We caught a break? You call this a break?

277
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,917
I got a shareholders' convention
in nine days.

278
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,179
Hey, man, he's not thinking about that.

279
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,583
Oh!

280
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,784
Are you out of your fricking mind?
That is all that he thinks about.

281
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,352
And believe you me, if he has got a knife,
that is when he's gonna use it...

282
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,364
...because that's what I'd do! Yeah.

283
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,493
No, I would wait till he is right in
the middle of a big old standing ovation.

284
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:43,597
I would wait till he is just so overwhelmed
with beloved waves of adoration...

285
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,200
<i>...he couldn't even hear the sound
of his own cojones...</i>

286
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,506
...as they hit the goddamn floor!

287
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,848
Oh, my God, he is gonna crush me.

288
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,155
Tell your people not to make vacation plans.

289
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,460
- They're gonna wanna know why.
- Then they're in the wrong business.

290
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,000
How are we supposed to work it up
if we don't know what we're protecting?

291
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,003
Look, I don't know. Assume it's everything.

292
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:19,004
B&R's mainframe network is a beast.

293
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,569
I mean, we've spent
the last 10 months probing.

294
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,875
We got nowhere.

295
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,916
I mean, the encryption
and system awareness codes...

296
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,817
...are tactically equivalent
to anything we had at the Pentagon.

297
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:36,087
The good news is 200 photocopiers
that B&R purchased last month.

298
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,225
We paid a little visit down to the vendor...

299
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,426
...and we made a few adjustments
to one of the units before it shipped.

300
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,499
Call this the Ghost.

301
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,505
It's not fast, it's not easy,
but this device right here...

302
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,564
...allows us to hijack signal traffic...

303
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,667
...without leaving
any electronic residue behind.

304
00:26:54,045 --> 00:27:00,075
Here. Right now we're hacking a photocopier
in their Human Resources Department.

305
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:05,046
I mean, we're still mapping, but look,
we're tapped into 12 units already.

306
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,914
The B&R Research
and Development Unit in Westchester...

307
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,553
...hasn't brought a major new product
to market since 1997.

308
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,123
In spite of that,
we made it a surveillance priority.

309
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,463
Number one, we graph
the volume of traffic...

310
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,969
...and the quality of vehicles
in that parking lot.

311
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,097
Number two, we track the stock portfolios
and mortgage payments...

312
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,436
...of everybody on site.

313
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,477
And, number three, we monitor
the frequency of Internet shopping...

314
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,547
...and pornography searches
from inside that lab.

315
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:34,051
Stocks are down, porn is up
and there's plenty of free parking.

316
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,144
There's nothing going on here.

317
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,814
We're confident
that whatever this new product is...

318
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,754
...it comes from outside the company.

319
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,224
The moment this meeting breaks up...

320
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:46,093
...we'll be going over every acquisition
B&R has made in the past 18 months.

321
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,631
We'll find it.

322
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,099
This B&R building is very strong
with security.

323
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,666
Is the same for us like the computer.

324
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,003
We are all the time feeling our way
around this building...

325
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,099
...but not getting anywhere.

326
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,646
Then we make a big discovery. Travel
Department is not in the big building.

327
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:09,186
Travel Department is four blocks away
and this building is very different.

328
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,781
- Very simple and very basic.
- Yeah, it's a gold mine, Dick.

329
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,849
They basically handle
all of B&R's commercial travel...

330
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,920
...so every private jet, car, boat, hotel,
housing, everything goes through them.

331
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,026
The boys have got some great ideas
on how to get us on the inside.

332
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,298
Very simple and very basic.

333
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,766
I swear, she was that big.

334
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,430
No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

335
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,699
Don't start that again. Translate that?

336
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,008
- You're always kidding.
- I'm not. I'm a very serious guy.

337
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,577
I'll be right back.

338
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,490
Hi. Remember me?

339
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,289
- Yes, I...
- Gotcha.

340
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,232
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Just what?

341
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,027
- I'm drawing a blank.
- Don't even try it.

342
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,730
- Excuse me?
- Can I make a suggestion?

343
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,468
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

344
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:55,069
- How do I know you?
- How do you know me?

345
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,670
Wow. That's a strong play.

346
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,740
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time
thinking what this would be like...

347
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,376
...where we'd be, what
I'd say, what you'd say...

348
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,045
- But I never thought that you'd...
- I'm sorry. I just...

349
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,213
You really wanna go this way?

350
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,257
Look, you clearly have me confused
with someone else.

351
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,326
I don't know, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

352
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,658
Faces, I'm definitely better.
Faces I'm like a B, B minus.

353
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,493
Where I'm good, where I really excel,
people I've slept with.

354
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,328
That's been a traditional
area of strength for me.

355
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,369
Look, I don't know who
you think I am, but...

356
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,200
You talk me up, seduce me, screw me...

357
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,437
...then you drug me and ransack
my hotel room.

358
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,703
And how sick is this? The last thing
I remember before I passed out...

359
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,870
...was how much I liked you.

360
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,777
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't...

361
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,042
- What? You think this is funny?
- I... No, I...

362
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,744
No, it's not. I'm sorry. It's just...

363
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,082
It's... Seduce you? You?

364
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,917
- You admit it?
- I...

365
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,121
- I just... No, I'm... No, I'm...
- No, you don't get to do this.

366
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,922
- You do not get to laugh about this.
- It's...

367
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,361
- This is unacceptable.
- No, you're right. You're right.

368
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,595
It's not funny. Seriously. Completely.

369
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,762
- And it's not you. It's not you.
- What the hell does that mean?

370
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:58,365
It's tension. Nerves.
Nervous laughter, obviously.

371
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:02,073
Your knee. Wow. All better, huh?

372
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,878
Yeah, with that brace and everything,
you really looked like you were hurting.

373
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,043
My knee is fine. Thanks.

374
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,280
Do you have any idea how far my ass
was hanging out because of you?

375
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,585
- Mmm. I can imagine.
- That's all you say?

376
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,819
And I'm sorry.

377
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:16,951
I can tell.

378
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:21,896
It's... I don't know. The laughter. I
don't know what that's about. It's about...

379
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,334
Nerves. Guilt. Lots of guilt. And regret.

380
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,400
Remorse. Just a lot of things.

381
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,741
I mean, I'm assuming you know
by now that I was...

382
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:38,908
...working for the Agency,
so, yeah, there's that.

383
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,076
- This sucks.
- Yeah.

384
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,619
I mean, we were under
a lot of pressure then.

385
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,951
This is totally unsatisfying.

386
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,758
Well, what did you have in mind?

387
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:53,661
I mean, in terms of vengeance.

388
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,160
Hey.

389
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,036
What's that?

390
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,044
The reckoning.

391
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,084
Bad?

392
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,082
We've been bad.

393
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,682
How bad?

394
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,259
We've been very bad.

395
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,764
We're very good at it.

396
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,936
Worth it?

397
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,044
Very.

398
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,981
Very worth it.

399
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,167
Oh, my God.
What?

400
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,570
It's...

401
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:23,477
It's noon. It's 12:15.
What happened to my wake-up call?

402
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,014
I left a wake-up call.

403
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:29,485
Oh, Jesus! This can't be happening. This
is not the day to not get a wake-up call.

404
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,488
Oh, God! I can't believe I
didn't get my wake-up call.

405
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,785
I had a 10:30 flight.

406
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,794
I'm supposed to be landing
in Geneva right now.

407
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,262
You probably told me all this.
I just don't remember it.

408
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,357
No. I couldn't. It's classified.

409
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,995
Yeah, I was supposed to be in Cairo
two days ago.

410
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,039
- You told me London.
- The point is, I blew it off.

411
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,972
And nobody called this morning?

412
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,637
- You were here.
- I'm a heavy sleeper.

413
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,374
So what are you saying?
I took the call and didn't tell you?

414
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,346
When did you set this up, anyway?

415
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,008
Last night.
Where was I?

416
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,642
In the bath.

417
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,951
- We were in there together.
- When I went for the ice.

418
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,354
While I was waiting?

419
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,119
I can't believe they didn't call.

420
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,684
You snuck out of the tub
to leave a wake-up call!

421
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,856
This is a five-star hotel.
How does that happen?

422
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,298
Welcome to Italy.

423
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:25,206
Look, I told you it was classified.
I shouldn't have to explain this to you.

424
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,142
Well, this beats the hell out of Dubai.

425
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,646
- What?
- I'm still standing, right?

426
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,080
There. See? There it is.

427
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,846
If you're looking
for Egyptian Air Defense codes...

428
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,252
- I'm keeping them in my socks these days.
- See, I knew it.

429
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,187
You'll never get over that, will you?
You couldn't.

430
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,055
I'm afraid that's classified.

431
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,060
- You actually think, what, I'm playing you?
- That's crazy, right?

432
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,596
This felt like an assignment to you?
Three days? All this?

433
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,859
What was the objective? Rug burn?

434
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,392
Who knows, maybe you didn't want me
in Cairo yesterday.

435
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,666
God, that's so sad.

436
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,605
Because that's exactly
what I was just thinking.

437
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,111
That maybe you're playing me,
that you canceled my call.

438
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,945
That this was just some revenge
to get back at me for Dubai.

439
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,551
Then I'm thinking how terrible it is
that I think that way.

440
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,386
Then I realize we both think that way.

441
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,589
Then I'm thinking...

442
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,222
...is that what makes this so worth it?

443
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,091
Is that it?

444
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,438
That I know you're thinking
exactly what I'm thinking?

445
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:35,478
Because then I'm thinking, do we both
think like that because of what we do?

446
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,605
Are we good at what we do
because we think like that?

447
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,048
Everybody thinks like that.
They just don't say it.

448
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:44,144
- Civilians don't think like that.
- Bullshit.

449
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:48,988
- Nobody trusts anybody. We just cop to it.
- Okay. So cop to it.

450
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:52,062
- Me? I think you better go first.
- Why? What am I hiding?

451
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,461
This wasn't an accident, was it?

452
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,660
Being here. Meeting like this.

453
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,499
You came looking for me, didn't you?

454
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,904
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- I'm right, though, aren't I?

455
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,170
Because you went looking for me, right?

456
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,439
But why? Just for this?

457
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,845
- Isn't that enough?
- Not for you.

458
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,243
What are we into, Claire?

459
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,123
Can you imagine living like this?

460
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,454
- How much fun we could have?
- Aren't we in enough trouble?

461
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,853
I mean, having the money.

462
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,991
- Keep going.
- How much do you think we'd need?

463
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,137
- $20 million?
- I was thinking 40.

464
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,336
So what do you have to do
to get $40 million?

465
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,841
Go private.

466
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,713
Be smart.

467
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,615
Get lucky.

468
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,120
How smart?

469
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,852
Smart enough to pick the right partner.

470
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,324
- Private, you mean...
- Corporate.

471
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,727
And lucky?

472
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,065
Be someplace when something's happening.

473
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,466
Be there first, hear it first.

474
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,005
- Something inside.
- Something big.

475
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,565
- But do it up right.
- Set it deep. Take your time.

476
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,201
Know your way out before you go in.

477
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:21,374
- You know what I think?
- I think you like the idea.

478
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:25,319
- I think you missed me.
- I think you canceled my call.

479
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,023
So, we're even.

480
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,165
Yeah, copy that.

481
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,207
Okay, so you hold tight.

482
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,176
No, we're just around the corner from you.

483
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,041
I'll be standing by.

484
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,738
He's moving?
- Yep.

485
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,579
So very simple, very basic, right?

486
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,846
The plan is good. It's up to him.

487
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,048
He's got a great reputation.

488
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,091
Look, Garsik says the sky is falling
in six days.

489
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,789
If you got a better idea, tell me now.

490
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,365
Right. So get to work.

491
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,640
- Oh, my gosh.
- Excuse me.

492
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,982
Look at this. I am so sorry.

493
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,955
Here I am, squeezing around,
making a complete pig of myself.

494
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,922
Look at this. Are you...

495
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,329
I'm fine. Really. It's nothing.

496
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,028
What was it before I got here?

497
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,327
Appletini.

498
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,998
Well, that sounds good. Was it good?

499
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,376
Yes, they're very good. They're great.

500
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,809
We'll have two of those, please.

501
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,045
You coming or going?

502
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,485
Well, I woke up in Knoxville,
I'm supposed to be sleeping in Belgium...

503
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,354
...and here I am in New York
waiting for an Appleteen.

504
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,689
So, I guess I'm just not sure.

505
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,992
- My daddy was from Tennessee.
- You're kidding. Where?

506
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,866
- Western part of the state.
- Where?

507
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:25,665
Just a little town.
It was actually named after our family.

508
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,074
You're not gonna make me guess, are you?

509
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,238
Bofferd.

510
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,071
- Get out of here!
- What?

511
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,582
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No. Not at all.

512
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:38,587
I used to go fishing in Bofferd.
I grew up in Darnum, next county over.

513
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:43,251
Well, that's my name! Bofferd.
Barbara Bofferd. Here, look.

514
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,593
Have a look.

515
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,563
Damn.

516
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,333
Well, it's nice to meet you, Barbara.
I'm Jimmy Tierney.

517
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,896
- You don't seem like a Jimmy.
- Well, actually it's James.

518
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,443
Well, actually, it's Dr. Tierney.
Would you excuse me?

519
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,403
Yeah, did you get them?

520
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,748
Nobody there can help me out?

521
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,251
What, and wait at the airport all night?

522
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,583
That's $26.

523
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,127
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not your fault.
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

524
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,966
Travel problem?

525
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,262
Yep.

526
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,230
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

527
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:32,901
We're opening a clinic in Ethiopia,
and my team's over there waiting for me.

528
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,211
I was supposed to fly to Brussels tonight
and then on to Nairobi...

529
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,716
...but my ticket got scrambled.
So, I got on a flight in the morning...

530
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,876
...but now they're telling me
it's too late to get ticketed now...

531
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,147
...so I'm gonna have to spend the night
at the airport...

532
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,779
...just to make sure I can get on the plane.

533
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,485
Now, all you need is a flight to Brussels
in the morning?

534
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,957
Honey, that's what I do for a living.

535
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,107
We have to be quiet, okay?

536
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,906
No peeking! You're peeking.

537
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,489
I can't believe I'm doing this.

538
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,118
Back up.
I want to see that one more time.

539
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,885
Let's get it all in here.

540
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,687
Passport or permit?
Right there! What does it say?

541
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,022
Wait? Over here, or here?
Read this one.

542
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,152
What's that say?

543
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,355
I mean, why aren't we on three terminals?

544
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,024
- I don't understand why we only have two.
How many eyes do you have?

545
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,725
For Christ's sake, Duke!

546
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,535
- You're getting that to go, right?
- Why?

547
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:14,338
- Didn't you get the text?
- I don't know. I just stepped out.

548
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,812
- Did you read my memo last month?
- Which one?

549
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,979
Vulnerabilities at the travel office.

550
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,080
I don't remember.

551
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,182
See you upstairs.

552
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,590
Okay, so what are we looking at here?
Give me a ballpark figure.

553
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,719
- Around 10, 12 minutes.
- And then what, I get everything?

554
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,661
Six years of travel orders.

555
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,427
- Eight minutes. Eight minutes.
- Great.

556
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,898
All right.

557
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,703
Super job, Ray.

558
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,177
Really. Outstanding.

559
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,091
- Who is this guy?
We're not sure.

560
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,361
Jesus.

561
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,398
Is that the one
where they're on the desk?

562
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,625
Is he an Equikrom agent?

563
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,258
Yeah, if he is, he's new.
We don't have him logged.

564
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,599
We think they're running
some fresh players out there.

565
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,731
Wow. Get this woman over here.

566
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:21,437
I was thinking I should conduct
the interview at the travel office.

567
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,773
Rattle their cages. See if anybody...

568
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,577
No, I want her over here.
And don't tell her a damn thing.

569
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,482
- I was just thinking...
- And Claire's doing the interview.

570
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,749
- But, Ned, I wrote the memo.
- No.

571
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:36,156
I want her to talk to a woman.

572
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,598
Okay, assumption A,
Burkett & Randle has a new product.

573
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,834
Assumption B,
they didn't develop it internally.

574
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,068
I agree.

575
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,772
So, we took every company
B&R bought in the last 18 months.

576
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,576
They made 57 acquisitions.

577
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,743
We tossed out anything where the product
was known or already on the market.

578
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,845
- We ended up with...
- Twenty-eight, the 28 companies.

579
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,116
We can't dig deep on any of them.
We don't have time.

580
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,284
So we're scanning for patterns.

581
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,090
Last night, Dale ran a timeline,
and we found a day last March...

582
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,030
...when B&R bought seven companies
in one afternoon.

583
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,532
- Is that normal?
- No.

584
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,102
So they're hiding something.

585
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:24,262
- What are they hiding?
- I think it's Dunwoody, Georgia.

586
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,936
We just laid the travel office records
over our calendar.

587
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,309
You can't believe
the amount of traffic last summer...

588
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,940
...between New York City
and Dunwoody, Georgia.

589
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,179
Howard Tully made
at least six separate visits...

590
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,948
...none of which were reported
in his official schedule.

591
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,014
So what the hell's down there?

592
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:47,030
Something called Formavale Labs.

593
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,622
I think we need to get the boys down there
right away.

594
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,300
Where's he going?

595
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:23,728
It was the way, when he talked
about the children, you know.

596
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:27,895
Helping the little children
and mending their broken hearts.

597
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:32,772
And I know, I do,
how I should know better, and I'm not...

598
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,605
I'm really not a gullible person.

599
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:38,875
But... But the children
and their little hearts...

600
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:50,592
And... And, yes, I felt special, you know,
that I could help him and the children.

601
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:54,596
And, yes, he was cute, I'll admit it.

602
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:58,532
Everything falling out of his pockets,
and charming.

603
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,727
You know, I mean special.

604
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,400
Special, like there was no one
in the world but me.

605
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,308
Hasn't anyone ever made you feel special?

606
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,246
Maybe for you it happens all the time.

607
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:18,720
Yeah, you probably have someone
making you feel that way all the time.

608
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,381
You know what? I don't even care.

609
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,893
Do whatever you're gonna do.
'Cause you know what?

610
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,485
I loved it!

611
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,757
It was worth it.

612
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,822
It was so very worth it.

613
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,559
It was incredibly worth it.

614
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,881
- Hello?
Hey, it's me.

615
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,052
- You're so early. I just got in.
- I ran.

616
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,634
- It went okay?
- Not a hitch. God, you feel good.

617
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,476
I can't believe you got here so fast.

618
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,007
I'm sorry,
but two months is just too goddamn long.

619
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,751
What? Did you... Did you push
your appointment up? You go in early?

620
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,188
It was fine. There wasn't that much to it.

621
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,886
- You did it, right?
- What?

622
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,723
- You told them.
- Of course.

623
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:09,026
- And you're okay with it?
- I'd better be, right?

624
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,361
How?

625
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,769
How...

626
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,510
How did you do it? You just...

627
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:26,441
- You walked in and what, said, "I quit"?
- Basically.

628
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,417
- They must have tried to talk
you out of it. - Not really, no.

629
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,113
Well, they can't be happy to see you go.
It couldn't have been that easy.

630
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,554
What are you trying to tell me?

631
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,358
- You didn't do it, did you?
- Hang on.

632
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,726
There's no way
that they just let you just walk out.

633
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,857
- Wait.
- You just punched out? Just walked out?

634
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,128
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

635
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,135
- Answer the question.
- Did they ask you to stay?

636
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,966
- You're ducking the question.
- They did, didn't they?

637
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,131
- This is classic.
- They asked you to stay.

638
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,266
- I know this drill, okay.
- Did you quit or not?

639
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,071
Deny everything. Admit nothing.

640
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,306
- Make counter-accusations.
- That's what you're doing.

641
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,541
I asked you how it went and you evaded!

642
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,484
How it went?
I just terminated a 12-year career with Ml6.

643
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,282
I spent an hour
signing non-disclosure forms...

644
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,652
I did a quick outplacement polygraph,
I turned in my credentials...

645
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,588
...and I walked out
on the only job I've ever really had...

646
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,560
...and now, right now,
I'm getting the very distinct impression...

647
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:17,089
...that you changed your mind,
kept your job, and left me out in the cold.

648
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,561
They kind of begged me to stay.

649
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,799
And you don't call
to tell me that this morning?

650
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,635
I couldn't risk it.

651
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,005
You're unbelievable.

652
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,443
- I was completely surprised.
- I don't believe this.

653
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,913
I hope you kept your passports.

654
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,679
What am I supposed to do? I can't go back.

655
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,844
You have to turn in a couple
to make it look good, but...

656
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,444
I am totally cooked.

657
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,821
...we're gonna need decent passports.

658
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,086
What are you talking about?

659
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,592
I took everything I could get my hands on.

660
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,529
After they begged me.

661
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:53,834
You bitch.

662
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,546
Admit it.
You don't trust me, either.

663
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,336
So, the total footprint.

664
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:31,363
That's if you're interested in both buildings,
'cause they're both available right now.

665
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:36,502
It's about 22,000 square feet.
The ventilation, it's zoned.

666
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:42,018
And you've got separate filtration systems
for the lab, office, storage and loading.

667
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,747
- It's lovely and clean.
- Yes, indeed.

668
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,051
The last tenants left the place
in terrific shape. It's just spotless.

669
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,716
What kind of business were they in?

670
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:54,229
Formavale? Damned if I know.
Some kind of biotech.

671
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,357
They took the place, loaded in their gear
and that's about the last we saw of them.

672
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,528
Hell, they used to truck
out their own trash.

673
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,705
Cronin Partiz. Ronnie Partiz.

674
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,244
Dr. Ronald Partiz.

675
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,906
This is 10 years ago up in Albany.

676
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:16,078
He's graduating high school,
15 years old in that picture...

677
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,017
...but he's a smart kid.

678
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,352
He gets a free ride to Cornell.

679
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,516
He finds his way
into the biochemistry department.

680
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,150
Two years later, he's in med school.

681
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,954
<i>He's 18, he's doing research
with some heavy hitters...</i>

682
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,930
<i>...he's getting good evaluations,
he's rolling along.</i>

683
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:35,232
<i>1999, he publishes an article in a magazine
called American Dermatologist.</i>

684
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,035
- About?
- Something about a fungus.

685
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,242
What kind of fungus?

686
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,470
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

687
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,239
<i>Doesn't matter?
Everything matters.</i>

688
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:47,147
He plagiarized it. He stole it.
He got caught immediately.

689
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,220
<i>They bounced him out of Cornell.
He set up shop in his parents' garage...</i>

690
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,382
<i>...started working on
some kind of skin cream.</i>

691
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,084
Yeah, something called...

692
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,592
- What?
Spring Skin.

693
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,596
He tried to sell it to health food stores
in the area up there.

694
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,428
Now, you're sure this is a cream
or was it a lotion?

695
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,628
- Because a lot of people confuse the two.
- I don't know.

696
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:11,469
Well, for Christ's sake, Duke, let's
have that! Let's have that! I mean, if...

697
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,941
If there is even a chance that this guy
is Tully's secret weapon...

698
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,912
...we're gonna need a hell of a lot more
than his goddamn grade point average!

699
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,473
You gotta get me his cream!
Show me the cream!

700
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:25,315
Dick, he went bankrupt overnight.
It was a bust, okay.

701
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:29,188
<i>We don't think the cream
is the answer here.</i>

702
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,261
<i>So, Ronnie Partiz
now goes deep underground.</i>
