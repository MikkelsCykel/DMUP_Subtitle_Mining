1
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:53,901
11:55. Almost midnight.

2
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:57,537
Enough time for one more story.

3
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:02,573
One more story
before 12:00...

4
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:05,052
just to keep us warm.

5
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:13,024
In five minutes,
it will be the 21st of April.

6
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:18,295
One hundred years ago,
on the 21st of April...

7
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:22,235
out on the waters
around Spivey Point...

8
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:27,004
a small clipper ship
drew toward land.

9
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:31,741
Suddenly, out of the night,
the fog rolled in.

10
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,749
For a moment,
they could see nothing...

11
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:37,251
not a foot ahead of them.

12
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:40,983
Then they saw a light.

13
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:46,484
By God, it was a fire
burning on the shore...

14
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:51,056
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist.

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,537
They steered a course
toward the light...

16
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:59,769
but it was a campfire
like this one.

17
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,211
The ship crashed
against the rocks.

18
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:06,544
The hull sheared in two.

19
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:09,551
The mast snapped like a twig...

20
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:14,579
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard.

21
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:18,218
At the bottom of the sea...

22
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,060
lay the ''Elizabeth Dane''
with her crew...

23
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:25,555
their lungs
filled with salt water...

24
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:30,231
their eyes open
and staring into the darkness.

25
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,231
And above,
as suddenly as it had come...

26
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:36,073
the fog lifted...

27
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:38,909
receded
back across the ocean...

28
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:41,609
and never came again.

29
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,915
But it is told
by the fishermen...

30
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:47,922
and their fathers
and grandfathers...

31
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:52,359
that when the fog returns
to Antonio Bay...

32
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:56,353
the men
at the bottom of the sea...

33
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:59,856
out in the water
by Spivey Point...

34
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:04,771
will rise up
and search for the campfire...

35
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:11,303
that led them
to their dark and icy death.

36
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:19,587
Twelve o' clock,
the 21st of April.

37
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:15,703
It's twelve midnight...

38
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,110
and we just started
into the witching hour.

39
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:21,513
This is Stevie Wayne,
on top of the world tonight.

40
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,917
And I'll be here
right up until about 1:00.

41
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,581
I'm all through, Father.

42
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:57,312
Oh, thank you, Bennett.

43
00:04:57,352 --> 00:05:02,085
I won't need you
until four tomorrow, Bennett.

44
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,455
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,695
Would you like something to
keep you warm on the way home?

46
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:10,698
No, thank you.
Father, can I get paid?

47
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:18,770
Why don't you come in at six
instead of four tomorrow?

48
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,968
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,119
Bennett?

50
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,059
It's 59 degrees outside.

51
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:52,828
And let me be the first
to wish Antonio Bay...

52
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,335
a happy birthday.

53
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:57,896
We're one hundred years old
today.

54
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,169
The weatherman's
been trying to spoil it for us.

55
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,301
He says we may be
in for some rain tonight.

56
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:06,542
But from where I'm sitting,
it looks like clear skies.

57
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:09,379
I think the weatherman's
been working too hard.

58
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:11,352
Well, I'll stay here
for another hour...

59
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,684
just to see if he's right.

60
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:16,247
And I'm inviting you
to stay here with me.

61
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:21,556
There's a cutter run aground
over here on the east bay, over.

62
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:27,030
Global 1X5.
It's the ''Lady Belle Pacific.''

63
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,267
Serial number 024KL596. Over.

64
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:33,706
Global 1X5,
the ''Lady Belle Pacific''...

65
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:35,767
is seaworthy, no major damage.

66
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:37,369
Why don't you
send a tow on over here...

67
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:40,404
about a quarter mile
above the Boatel. Over.

68
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,115
This is KAB,
Antonio Bay, California.

69
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,484
Six minutes after midnight.

70
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:47,756
Haven't heard
from the weatherman yet...

71
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:50,264
so I can't say for sure
about that rain...

72
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:54,394
but there's a full moon
and no clouds in the sky.

73
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,394
I'm Stevie Wayne.

74
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,873
And if you don't have anything
to do right now...

75
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:03,901
I'll be here playing music
all through the witching hour.

76
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:09,875
Even if you do
have something to do...

77
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:12,045
keep me turned on for a while...

78
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:14,885
and I'll try my best
to do the same for you.

79
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:16,117
OK!

80
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:40,237
- How far you going?
- Other side of town.

81
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:41,612
That's close enough.

82
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:46,284
- Make it?
- Yeah. Thank you.

83
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,460
Sip?

84
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,990
Thanks.

85
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:09,634
Listen,
I never hitchhiked before.

86
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:11,770
I just really want
to be careful.

87
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,713
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

88
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:16,239
Are you weird?

89
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,445
Yes, I am.

90
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:20,477
Yes, I am weird.

91
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:23,047
You are weird.
Thank God you're weird.

92
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,924
The last one was so normal,
it was disgusting.

93
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,757
He picked me up
in Santa Barbara.

94
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,957
By the time we got to Carmel
he wanted to marry me.

95
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:32,660
Oh, yeah. I thought
you never hitchhiked before.

96
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,796
Not before last week.

97
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,707
You're my...

98
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,301
thirteenth ride.

99
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:46,074
Oh, great. Weird and unlucky.

100
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:48,742
We'll see.

101
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,014
Look out!

102
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:01,256
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

103
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,526
- You're sure?
- I think so.

104
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,123
What the hell was...

105
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,801
It's exactly twelve minutes
after midnight...

106
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:15,707
and this is Stevie Wayne.

107
00:14:15,743 --> 00:14:17,574
Let's get out of here.

108
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:22,647
I'm high tonight in the KAB
lighthouse on Spivey Point.

109
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:25,209
And in case you've forgotten,
it's April 21st...

110
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,483
and a happy birthday
for Antonio Bay.

111
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:30,389
Now, there's a celebration
planned for tonight.

112
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:34,225
So if you're so excited
about it you can't sleep...

113
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:36,856
well, stay up with me...

114
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:42,200
and I'll figure out some way
to keep you occupied.

115
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:43,397
Or not.

116
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,910
- KAB.
- Hi, sweetheart.

117
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:53,106
Hi, Dan. What have you got?

118
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:55,012
Well, I'm just calling
to see if you're lonely...

119
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:56,277
if there's anything
I can do about it.

120
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:58,046
Never lonely, Dan.

121
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:59,348
I thought
you were off work at 8:00.

122
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:01,787
I changed shifts to make it
to the big party tonight.

123
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:02,949
Will you be there?

124
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,449
Until I can talk someone else...

125
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:09,725
into giving up city life
for Antonio Bay, I'm it.

126
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:12,733
- And ''it'' means day and night.
- Too much work.

127
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,735
That's what I get
for owning a station.

128
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:15,861
And if you don't tell me
why you called...

129
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:18,202
in about fifteen seconds,
I'll have to hang up on you.

130
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,707
- Want something to talk about?
- Anything.

131
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:23,142
I've got a position
on a trawler about...

132
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:26,840
fifteen miles out
called the ''Sea Grass.''

133
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:28,439
And I've got
something on my scope...

134
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,383
appears to be a fog bank.

135
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:33,751
It's about 25 miles out,
moving in their direction.

136
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:37,519
Thanks, Dan.
That's worth about ten seconds.

137
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,584
I'm on the air. Bye.

138
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,923
Ahoy, maties.

139
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,834
This is KAB, Antonio Bay.

140
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,738
Stevie Wayne here
beaming a signal across the sea.

141
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:56,005
To the men of the ''Sea Grass,''
fifteen miles out tonight...

142
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:57,409
a warm hello...

143
00:15:57,445 --> 00:16:00,175
and keep a watch out
for that fog bank...

144
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:02,011
heading in from the east.

145
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,517
Now, in the meantime...

146
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:06,179
relax with me
while I play this song...

147
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,849
from the Coupe DeVilles,
dedicated just to you.

148
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,587
Boy, would I like to meet her.

149
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:13,855
I saw her
at a grocery store one day.

150
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,863
- And?
- You would like to meet her.

151
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:18,866
She's crazy.
There's no fog bank out there.

152
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,367
What do you know about her?

153
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,733
- She owns that lighthouse.
- I know that.

154
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,533
Her son plays Little League
with my kid brother.

155
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:25,869
She's a mother?

156
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,534
I thought
you were happily married.

157
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:29,202
Not that happy.

158
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:32,041
No fog bank out there.

159
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,589
There's a fog bank out there.

160
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:46,450
All right. I'm drunk enough.

161
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:48,428
Let's go back.

162
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:50,294
All right, all right.

163
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:56,960
Al, come here.

164
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,303
- Just give him a hand.
- Come here.

165
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,645
What was that?

166
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,408
Come here.

167
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,911
What was that?

168
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:58,192
It's the generator.

169
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,627
Wha... wha...

170
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,002
Al.

171
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:24,949
It's gone.

172
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:26,857
There was just a ship out there.

173
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:28,521
Al, listen.

174
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,690
Nothing.

175
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:32,893
- Listen.
- Who's there?

176
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:46,137
Who is that?

177
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:36,725
Al, it's right beside us.

178
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:43,398
It's big, Al. It's a ship.

179
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:45,200
It's a big ship!

180
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,707
What happened?
Did you get wet?

181
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:12,729
It's 12:43...

182
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,133
and I've got
four in a row for you...

183
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,433
right here on KAB.

184
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,407
Nothing but water, Stevie.

185
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,407
But it sure beats Chicago.

186
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:08,218
KAB.

187
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,951
I like what you said...

188
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:12,289
but for your information,
you lied.

189
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:14,692
The fog bank
has moved due west...

190
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:18,358
and probably
missed the ship entirely.

191
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,230
Well, my gauges must be wrong.

192
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:21,963
I've got a wind blowing
due east.

193
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:24,563
What kind of a fog
blows against the wind?

194
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:27,073
- You got me.
- I'm not so sure I want you.

195
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:28,905
You're just
a voice on the phone.

196
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:32,242
You're a voice on the radio.
We'd make a perfect couple.

197
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:37,274
You let me take you to dinner
tonight, I'll prove it to you.

198
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,218
Sorry, Dan.

199
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:42,484
My idea of perfection
is a voice on the phone.

200
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:45,219
OK, mystery lady.

201
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:47,659
- Good night.
- Good night.

202
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:09,742
Not bad.

203
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,044
I started a week ago
in San Diego...

204
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:17,489
right up the coast,
five drawings a day.

205
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,322
It'll probably take me a month
to get to Vancouver...

206
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,918
and if I can sell them
for five bucks apiece...

207
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:23,260
- I'll be rich.
- Yeah.

208
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,067
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

209
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:30,127
What's your name?

210
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:32,833
- Elizabeth.
- Nick.

211
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:35,603
- Hello, Nick.
- Hi.

212
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,471
Is that where you're from,
San Diego?

213
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:41,913
Wait a minute. You said,
''Can I ask something?''

214
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:44,144
Well, something,
to me, means one thing.

215
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:46,847
- San Diego is two things.
- OK.

216
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:53,582
Pasadena, and a lot of money.

217
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:56,061
Never a chance to do
anything I want to do.

218
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:02,930
What do you want to do?

219
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,064
I don't know.

220
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:09,304
That's OK. Me, neither.

221
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:12,073
I think I got to have this one.
Can I buy it?

222
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:15,406
The drawing's free.

223
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,938
It's 1:00, straight up...

224
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:18,570
the end of the witching hour,
and time for me to sign off.

225
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:27,547
So until tomorrow night,
at 6 P.M...

226
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:29,715
when KAB
comes back on the air...

227
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:32,521
this is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

228
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,461
hoping you have
a nice rest of the night.

229
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,476
Hey, Mom!

230
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:43,747
Mom, come on. Get up.
Look what I found.

231
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:48,421
Andy...I love you...

232
00:26:48,462 --> 00:26:50,896
but sometimes
you're a real pain.

233
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:52,558
Sure, Mom, but look it.

234
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,931
First, it was a gold coin.

235
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:56,732
Then it turned into
this neat piece of wood.

236
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,328
This is one of those times.

237
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:00,067
Look at it, Mom.

238
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:06,246
Good morning, Andrew.

239
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,373
Did you have a nice time
last night?

240
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:11,407
Yeah. Old Mr. Machen
told us ghost stories.

241
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:14,182
Did you thank Mrs. Kobritz
for bringing you home?

242
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:17,520
Yes, ma'am. Mom, can I have
a stomach pounder and a Coke?

243
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:20,959
- After lunch.
- OK.

244
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:22,690
I'm gonna go look
for another one.

245
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,221
Maybe this time
I can get the gold coin.

246
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:51,787
Where the hell is he?

247
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:53,952
Rolled out of here
at 4:15 yesterday.

248
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:56,360
- That's the last I saw of him.
- Al said 7:30, right here.

249
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:58,490
You know Al.
If I were you...

250
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,022
Did you call
the Coast Guard, Hank?

251
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,092
Nick, they probably
got drunk last night.

252
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:05,003
- No, he wouldn't do that.
- He'd do anything.

253
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,303
Al and I got drunk so many times
I can't count them all...

254
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:10,640
but we never got so shitfaced
we couldn't make it back in.

255
00:28:10,678 --> 00:28:12,669
He's too good a sailor
to stay out there all night...

256
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:14,010
and not let somebody know.

257
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:16,881
- You sound like his wife.
- Just his friend.

258
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:18,714
- You worry too much, Nick.
- Yeah.

259
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,184
Where are we going?

260
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:26,192
I'm going to talk Ashcroft
into taking out his boat...

261
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,784
and looking for the ''Sea Grass.''

262
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:29,295
Who's Ashcroft?

263
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,298
Someone who owes me a favor.

264
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:33,300
Can I come along?

265
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:35,802
I thought you had to move on
to Vancouver?

266
00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:37,064
Eventually.

267
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,508
The sheriff
will drive his own car.

268
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:49,345
The mayor and his wife
are to be picked up at 6:45...

269
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:51,374
and brought to the mayor's box.

270
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:53,909
Then we will have speeches
by the mayor...

271
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:55,819
the sheriff, and me.

272
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:58,154
- Do you have my notes?
- Yes, ma'am.

273
00:28:58,192 --> 00:28:59,989
Then we will pass out
the candles...

274
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,790
and begin the procession.

275
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,730
Then I will go home
and pass out.

276
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,960
I'm almost afraid to look.

277
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,262
Well...

278
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:13,139
Not bad. Not bad at all.

279
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,004
A work of art.

280
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:18,170
Sandy, just be civil to me
for another five hours.

281
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:19,804
That's all I ask.

282
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:21,314
Let's see now.

283
00:29:21,348 --> 00:29:23,145
The candles.
Did you order the candles?

284
00:29:23,183 --> 00:29:24,912
What a thought... a candlelight
procession with no candles.

285
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:27,216
All taken care of.

286
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:29,518
And the promotional material...
did you get that to Stevie?

287
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:31,990
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

288
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:34,789
Sandy, you can be a very
annoying person at times...

289
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:36,193
but you do keep me together.

290
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,221
Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

291
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:11,357
...Spivey Point.
As of 1:57 today...

292
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:13,298
the ''Sea Grass''
had not responded...

293
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,233
to radio communication.

294
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,294
The Coast Guard
has begun a sweep...

295
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:19,032
south from Watley...

296
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:20,699
around Arcom Reef...

297
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,902
and should be
in the area of Spivey Point...

298
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:25,411
in approximately one hour.

299
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:28,745
Repeating this bulletin
from the Coast Guard...

300
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:30,750
be on the look out
for the ''Sea Grass''...

301
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:32,581
a thirty-foot trawler...

302
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:37,056
last seen approximately 15 miles
east of Spivey Point.

303
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,081
If you sight this vessel...

304
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:41,822
please notify
the Coast Guard immediately.

305
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:56,942
Nick, can I ask you a question?

306
00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:58,376
Is it always like this?

307
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:01,381
It's always different.

308
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,440
You're worried, aren't you?

309
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:06,851
Yeah. She can get real mean.

310
00:31:06,887 --> 00:31:08,252
There.

311
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:22,468
If I can just get through
the speeches without yawning.

312
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:24,767
- I couldn't sleep last night.
- Too excited?

313
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:27,296
No. Al went out on his boat
last night and didn't come home.

314
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:29,901
- He still isn't back.
- Mrs. Williams!

315
00:31:29,943 --> 00:31:31,376
I called the Coast Guard,
and they said...

316
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:33,538
''Oh, he might have had
engine trouble.''

317
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,741
They said not to worry.

318
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:37,409
He was complaining
about his boat last week.

319
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:38,918
Maybe you ought to go home.

320
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:41,443
That's the last place
I want to go.

321
00:31:41,488 --> 00:31:43,422
My dog started to bark
at 12:00 last night...

322
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:45,425
and didn't stop
until 6:00 this morning.

323
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:46,721
What happened?

324
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,887
He was pointed toward the ocean
and growling.

325
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:50,089
What does that tell you?

326
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,530
My dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water.

327
00:31:52,566 --> 00:31:54,534
I heard the church bells
at midnight...

328
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:56,365
as I started
to drift off to sleep...

329
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:59,099
and my car alarm went off
for absolutely no reason.

330
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:01,699
- Really?
- Woke up the whole block.

331
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:04,438
This town sits around for
100 years and nothing happens...

332
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:06,810
and then one night,
the whole place falls apart.

333
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:12,113
Take this line, too.

334
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:15,747
Al! Tommy! Dick!

335
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:22,952
Cabin and steering house
are empty.

336
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:25,260
Maybe somebody picked them up.

337
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:28,731
There's water in the generator.

338
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:30,930
But the deck is dry as a bone.

339
00:32:57,197 --> 00:32:59,324
There you have it.
My next project...

340
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:02,199
restoration of
the Morgantown Road Cemetery.

341
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:04,465
It's historical.
Our ancestors are buried here.

342
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:07,200
- It'll cost a lot.
- Come on. So?

343
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,037
This town should be proud
of its past.

344
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:10,668
But trying to get
anyone involved...

345
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,145
in community affairs
is like pulling teeth.

346
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,374
Better get
the estimates ready...

347
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:15,881
for the council meeting
next month.

348
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:17,042
Yes, ma'am.

349
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:18,551
Sandy, you're
the only person I know...

350
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,883
who can make ''Yes, ma'am''
sound like ''Screw you.''

351
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:22,183
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:23,348
Now, if we'll just say
a little prayer...

353
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,415
asking that
he not be in his cups.

354
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:33,594
Not a good sign.

355
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:38,830
Father Malone?

356
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:49,111
Another bad sign.

357
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:51,879
You try the study,
and I'll look up front.

358
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:19,707
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams.

359
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:22,442
- Mrs. Williams...
- Are you all right?

360
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:24,575
I have something to show you.

361
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:32,591
''December 9.

362
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:36,528
''Met with Blake this evening
for the first time.

363
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:38,190
''He stood in the shadows...

364
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:42,031
''to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face.

365
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:45,664
''What a vile disease this is.

366
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:49,665
''He is a rich man
with a cursed condition...

367
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,234
''but this does not
prevent him...

368
00:34:51,278 --> 00:34:53,337
''from trying to better
his situation...

369
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,712
''and that of his comrades
at the colony.''

370
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:18,961
Every single gauge is broken.

371
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:23,866
- All the glass is shattered.
- Remind you of something?

372
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,901
- Last night.
- Your truck.

373
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:36,079
Thermometer's broken.

374
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:40,584
The mercury's stuck
at twenty degrees.

375
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:47,864
No water got in here,
but something awful cold did.

376
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:52,031
''December 11.
Blake's proposition is simple.

377
00:35:52,072 --> 00:35:54,506
''He wants to move off
Tanzier Island...

378
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:59,205
''and relocate the entire colony
just north of here.

379
00:35:59,246 --> 00:36:01,237
''He has purchased
a clipper ship...

380
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:06,776
''called the 'Elizabeth Dane.'
with part of his fortune...

381
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,620
''and asks only for permission
to settle here.

382
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:13,854
''I must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion...

383
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:15,953
''toward this poor man...

384
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:18,521
''with my revulsion
at the thought...

385
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:22,001
''of a leper colony
only a mile distant.''

386
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,215
It's rusted to the wall.

387
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,125
It was on.

388
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:57,003
They drank a lot of beer
last night.

389
00:36:57,037 --> 00:36:58,664
Every night.

390
00:36:58,705 --> 00:37:01,003
What's it like?

391
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:04,010
It's always the same.
Room starts spinning...

392
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:05,238
I mean fishing.

393
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:09,842
You fish.

394
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:11,510
The only thing I know
about fishing...

395
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:12,882
is you use a lot of worms.

396
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:16,353
Salt water.

397
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:21,183
She was clean two nights ago.
I checked her out myself.

398
00:37:21,228 --> 00:37:24,561
Now it's as if she's been
turned over in the water.

399
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:30,829
''April 20.
The six of us met tonight.

400
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,839
''From midnight until 1:00...

401
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:36,331
''we planned the death
of Blake and his comrades.

402
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:39,038
''I tell myself
that Blake's gold...

403
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,047
''will allow
the church to be built...

404
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:43,777
''and our small settlement
to become a township...

405
00:37:43,817 --> 00:37:47,048
''but it does not soothe
the horror that I feel...

406
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:50,750
''being an accomplice to murder.''

407
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:57,259
Now what?

408
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:59,356
Wait for the Coast Guard.

409
00:38:04,204 --> 00:38:06,195
I'm sorry.

410
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,501
What for?

411
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,532
Ever since you picked me up,
things have been going wrong.

412
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:12,636
The clock broke, the windows
have been breaking...

413
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,237
the weirdo at the door
last night.

414
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:17,512
- That isn't you.
- I'm not so sure.

415
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,348
Things seem to happen to me.

416
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:21,718
I'm bad luck.

417
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,920
I don't believe in luck,
good or bad.

418
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:30,225
I don't believe
in anything much...

419
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:35,224
Something did happen once.

420
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,038
My father was a fisherman.

421
00:38:40,073 --> 00:38:44,533
He ran a trawler
out of Whitely Reef.

422
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:48,911
One night, late,
he was coming back in.

423
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:52,976
He was out beyond the reef,
out near Spivey Point.

424
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:55,715
He looked to windward...

425
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:59,247
and saw a brig
under shortsail...

426
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,522
heading right for him.

427
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:08,023
And he radioed.
There was no reply.

428
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:12,664
Nothing moved on the deck,
but she held her course.

429
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:17,036
My dad and two of his hands
boarded the brig...

430
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:19,739
the ''Resa Jane.''

431
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:23,180
No one was on board.

432
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:25,184
There was food on the table...

433
00:39:25,218 --> 00:39:27,516
and a hot, steaming
cup of coffee.

434
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:32,184
But underneath, the tin cup
was rusted to the table.

435
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:35,626
And then something caught
my father's eye.

436
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:42,158
It was a gold doubloon
minted in Spain, 1867.

437
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:44,864
My dad picked up the coin,
put it in his breast pocket...

438
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:47,202
of his jacket,
and zippered it up.

439
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,040
He came home,
told us the story.

440
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:55,673
And he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin.

441
00:39:55,715 --> 00:39:57,239
It was gone.

442
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:01,577
I think I'll go
to Vancouver now.

443
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:11,693
''April 21st. The deed is done.

444
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:14,393

445

451
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:37,288
I couldn't read any further.

Your grandfather
had a way with words.

453

Our celebration tonight
is a travesty.

454

We're honoring murderers.

00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:31,030
fabulous 1340 KAB,
Antonio Bay.

477
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:36,793
Father, where did you find this?

478
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:40,533
My grandfather hid his sins
in the walls.

479
00:43:40,573 --> 00:43:43,041
When did you find it?

480
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:46,204
Last night,
just after midnight.

481
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:48,077
What difference does it make?

482
00:43:48,114 --> 00:43:50,947
That's the same time
the rest of the town fell apart.

483
00:43:55,755 --> 00:43:59,054
And the same time
the six conspirators met...

484
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:01,492
one hundred years ago.

485
00:44:01,527 --> 00:44:03,654
It's really getting late.

486
00:44:03,696 --> 00:44:06,392
There's not much we can do
about any of this.

487
00:44:06,432 --> 00:44:10,129
Are you going to give
the benediction tonight, Father?

488
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:13,570
Antonio Bay has a curse on it.

489
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:15,540
Do we take that as a ''no''?

490
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:17,770
Maybe it's just as well.

491
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:23,182
We're leaving now, Father.

492
00:44:23,216 --> 00:44:25,241
Will you be all right?

493
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,256
I'm going to call Dr. Thayden
and ask him to just drop by.

494
00:44:33,293 --> 00:44:36,319
I think you're taking
all of this much too seriously.

495
00:44:36,362 --> 00:44:39,923
We're all cursed,
Mrs. Williams...

496
00:44:39,966 --> 00:44:41,593
all of us.

497
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:59,080
1340 KAB.

498
00:44:59,118 --> 00:45:01,348
Forty-four.

499
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:08,293
The smooth sound.
Fabulous 1340 KAB.

500
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:16,558
Forty-five.

501
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:22,734
From the top of the world,
fabulous 1340 KAB...

502
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:26,336
Antonio Bay, California.

503
00:45:26,379 --> 00:45:27,903
Forty-six.

504
00:45:29,082 --> 00:45:31,550
The smooth sound...

505
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:37,216
Something like
an albatross around the neck...

506
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:39,724
No. More like a millstone...

507
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:42,557
a plumbing stone, by God.

508
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:44,961
Damn them all!

509
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,671
Nine.
Every hour on the hour...

510
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:04,945
KAB news and weather.

511
00:46:04,984 --> 00:46:06,747
Ten.

512
00:46:06,786 --> 00:46:11,883
Every hour on the hour,
KAB news and weather.

513
00:46:14,227 --> 00:46:17,458
End side two, KAB promos.

514
00:46:28,174 --> 00:46:31,701
How can a man drown
and not touch the water?

515
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:34,372
He had water in his lungs...

516
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:38,145
salt water around his mouth,
seaweed in his clothes.

517
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:40,209
Unless...

518
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:44,981
You OK?

519
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:47,891
Did you see his eyes?

520
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,088
Yeah, I saw his eyes.

521
00:46:57,403 --> 00:47:00,236
Andy, the telephone.

522
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:02,207
I got it, Mrs. Kobritz.

523
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:09,512
Andy, where did you get
that piece of driftwood?

524
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:12,143
I told you, Mom.
On the beach this morning.

525
00:47:12,185 --> 00:47:13,675
- Where?
- By the rocks.

526
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:15,118
What was it doing?

527
00:47:15,154 --> 00:47:17,122
First it was a gold coin...

528
00:47:17,156 --> 00:47:19,249
and then it turned
into the wood.

529
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:21,351
Andy, I want you
to stay away from the rocks.

530
00:47:21,394 --> 00:47:22,520
Do you understand?

531
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:24,860
Don't pick up anything else
off the beach.

532
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:26,364
It didn't belong to anybody.

533
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:28,026
I know, honey.
It's all right.

534
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,864
I just don't want you
to pick up anything else...

535
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:31,995
unless you come
and get me first. OK?

536
00:47:32,038 --> 00:47:33,801
OK.

537
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,705
Is Mrs. Kobritz there?

538
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:37,709
She just came in.

539
00:47:37,743 --> 00:47:42,146
OK. I have to start
the broadcast now.

540
00:47:42,181 --> 00:47:44,581
Andy, promise me you won't
leave the house tonight.

541
00:47:44,617 --> 00:47:46,380
Oh, Mom.

542
00:47:46,419 --> 00:47:48,546
Promise me.

543
00:47:48,588 --> 00:47:50,954
Oh, OK.

544
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,151
I love you, Andy.

545
00:47:53,192 --> 00:47:55,524
Me, too, Mom. Bye.

546
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:24,216
Ahoy, maties.

547
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:27,590
This is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

548
00:48:27,627 --> 00:48:32,587
and KAB, Antonio Bay,
California, is on the air.

549
00:48:32,632 --> 00:48:34,930
I've lined up some tunes
to help you celebrate...

550
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:37,800
the 100th birthday
of Antonio Bay.

551
00:48:37,837 --> 00:48:41,739
So let's get down to business.

552
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:05,222
What did your mother want, Andy?

553
00:49:05,264 --> 00:49:06,663
Nothing.

554
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:08,929
It must have been something.

555
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:11,562
Nothing.

556
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:15,040
Mrs. Kobritz,
what are those clouds out there?

557
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:23,644
Evidence of deep
penetrating wounds...

558
00:49:23,683 --> 00:49:25,173
in each ocular orbit...

559
00:49:25,217 --> 00:49:27,685
entering into
the cranial cavity.

560
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,245
Also jagged lacerations
to the face...

561
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:31,950
Do you want to wait out front?

562
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:33,856
I'd rather wait with you.

563
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:35,258
OK.

564
00:49:35,294 --> 00:49:37,285
Thorax has been crushed...

565
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,663
and the lungs
are filled with fluid.

566
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,860
Talk to you a minute?

567
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,203
She gonna be all right?

568
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:53,336
- Did you talk to Simms?
- I got him on the radio.

569
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:55,210
He's coming back
from Bodega Bay.

570
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:56,714
What the hell
happened out there?

571
00:49:56,749 --> 00:49:58,546
There was rust
all over everything.

572
00:49:58,584 --> 00:50:00,279
It was like the boat had been
out there a long time...

573
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,718
taking on water.

574
00:50:01,754 --> 00:50:03,551
He was down below
near the bunks.

575
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:05,887
Nick, his wounds
are covered with algae...

576
00:50:05,925 --> 00:50:07,051
his lungs are full...

577
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:09,118
and there's silt
under his fingernails.

578
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:12,392
I saw Dick Baxter
three days ago in Salinas.

579
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:13,796
Now he's lying in there
on the table...

580
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:16,301
looking like he's been
underwater for a month.

581
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:41,316
- Do you feel that?
- I'll tell you what happens.

582
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,761
- It just got cold in here.
- The water acts like ice.

583
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:58,032
A whole body would take a year
to decompose...

584
00:50:58,077 --> 00:51:00,545
longer if it was down
far enough, cold enough.

585
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:02,376
But he was on the boat.

586
00:51:02,415 --> 00:51:03,814
He was below decks.

587
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:07,842
No. Dick Baxter
died in the ocean.

588
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,896
You remember those three kids
that went diving...

589
00:51:25,938 --> 00:51:28,270
for that old boat off the Point?

590
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:30,400
We got to them,
they'd been down for a week...

591
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:31,569
maybe ten days.

592
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:35,307
I swear to you right now,
he's been down longer.

593
00:52:58,097 --> 00:53:00,463
And while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship...

594
00:53:00,499 --> 00:53:02,797
upon our coast was,
of course...

595
00:53:02,835 --> 00:53:05,861
a tragedy to those
who were on the ship...

596
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:09,204
it still was the catalyst
that brought together...

597
00:53:09,241 --> 00:53:12,301
all of the people
of this wonderful area.

598
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:13,743
They came together...

599
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:17,180
they formed the charter
for Antonio Bay...

600
00:53:17,216 --> 00:53:20,276
the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen...

601
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,913
who sit on my left
and my right tonight.

602
00:53:24,156 --> 00:53:26,954
The Coast Guard's
looking for them.

603
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:29,290
They're going to cover the area
pretty good...

604
00:53:29,328 --> 00:53:33,196
so, really,
all we can do is wait.

605
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:35,393
I understand, Sheriff.

606
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:36,924
Thank you.

607
00:53:38,704 --> 00:53:40,899
I got to go. I'm up next.

608
00:53:44,076 --> 00:53:46,476
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Williams.

609
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:52,916
It's funny,
but all I can think about...

610
00:53:52,952 --> 00:53:56,183
is my silly dog
barking all night...

611
00:53:56,222 --> 00:54:01,216
and me just wishing
Al would come home.

612
00:54:03,896 --> 00:54:07,525
Now, we can't have
the chairlady...

613
00:54:07,566 --> 00:54:10,057
of the birthday celebration
in tears, can we?

614
00:54:10,102 --> 00:54:11,535
I don't think you ought
to go out there.

615
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:15,438
I think that's exactly
what I ought to do.

616
00:54:15,474 --> 00:54:17,704
I appreciate
all your help, Nick.

617
00:54:17,743 --> 00:54:19,074
That's all right.

618
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:39,620
I searched
a long time for this one.

619
00:54:39,665 --> 00:54:42,031
I hope you remember it.

620
00:54:46,438 --> 00:54:48,235
Happy 100th, Antonio Bay.

621
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:51,641
The ceremonies are underway
at Shelby Square.

622
00:54:51,677 --> 00:54:54,578
And we'll have that candlelight
procession in about an hour.

623
00:54:54,613 --> 00:54:58,344
So if you hurry,
you can still make it.

624
00:54:58,384 --> 00:54:59,851
The Coast Guard
dropped me a note.

625
00:54:59,885 --> 00:55:02,945
They found the ''Sea Grass''
earlier this afternoon...

626
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:04,478
but there's no further word...

627
00:55:04,523 --> 00:55:08,357
as to the condition of the ship
or the men on-board.

628
00:55:08,394 --> 00:55:11,727
I'll keep you posted
as the news comes in to me.

629
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:14,597
Hope no one else gets lost
out there in the fog.

630
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:20,395
I'll be right back.

631
00:55:30,082 --> 00:55:31,709
Hello. My name's Nick Castle.

632
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,547
You don't know me,
but I'm one of the men...

633
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:35,485
who found the ''Sea Grass''
this afternoon.

634
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:37,819
I'm sorry.
I don't have any further word.

635
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:40,222
I understand.
That's not what I called about.

636
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:43,990
You just mentioned something
now on the radio about the fog.

637
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:57,333
This is going to sound
a little strange, but...

638
00:55:57,376 --> 00:55:59,276
I saw the fog last night...

639
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:00,835
out in the ocean
in the distance.

640
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:03,677
It was...glowing.

641
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:10,948
What seemed to be happening...

642
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,015
is that the wind
was moving due east...

643
00:56:13,058 --> 00:56:15,356
and the fog
just kept moving west.

644
00:56:15,394 --> 00:56:16,918
I know that sounds
completely crazy.

645
00:56:16,962 --> 00:56:18,395
Right now it doesn't.

646
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,591
Something happened last night.

647
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:22,361
At the same time
that fog was moving in...

648
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:24,392
this whole town went unglued.

649
00:56:24,436 --> 00:56:25,903
Hold on.

650
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:32,366
I've got some more
birthday music for you...

651
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:34,276
and a few other surprises.

652
00:56:34,313 --> 00:56:37,578
Then I'll be ready to check in
with the weatherman.

653
00:56:37,616 --> 00:56:41,074
And the weatherman will be
ready to check in with you.

654
00:56:51,897 --> 00:56:53,865
- Hello?
- I'm still here.

655
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:55,230
There's one other thing.

656
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:57,997
It may have nothing
to do with the ''Sea Grass''.

657
00:56:58,037 --> 00:57:00,096
Anything.

658
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:03,870
My son found a piece
of driftwood this morning.

659
00:57:09,715 --> 00:57:12,946
Hey, Mel. How you doing?

660
00:57:12,985 --> 00:57:16,182
Your girlfriend on the radio
has been talking about you.

661
00:57:16,221 --> 00:57:18,189
I came in tonight
just to keep her happy.

662
00:57:18,223 --> 00:57:19,815
I thought
you were off tonight.

663
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:21,018
I love my job.

664
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,359
You can tell them all
about that big fog bank...

665
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:26,057
moving in
the southeast there.

666
00:57:26,098 --> 00:57:28,692
- Where?
- You'll see it.

667
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:30,702
I'm on my way.
See you tomorrow.

668
00:57:30,736 --> 00:57:32,727
Yeah, Mel. I'll see you.

669
00:57:42,614 --> 00:57:44,138
There you are.

670
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:55,751
I've got to make a run
out to the lighthouse...

671
00:57:55,794 --> 00:57:57,318
at Spivey Point.
Want to come?

672
00:57:57,362 --> 00:57:58,624
- Sure.
- Come on.

673
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:05,768
Hi, sweetheart!

674
00:58:05,804 --> 00:58:07,032
I thought you were celebrating.

675
00:58:07,072 --> 00:58:09,870
I couldn't spend an evening
without you.

676
00:58:09,908 --> 00:58:12,570
I'm up in about thirty seconds.
What's new?

677
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:14,772
Another fog bank.

678
00:58:14,813 --> 00:58:16,246
Where?

679
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:18,545
It's coming in off the ocean
from the southeast.

680
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:20,347
It's heading inland.
It should be here...

681
00:58:20,385 --> 00:58:22,080
at the weather station
in ten minutes.

682
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:24,681
Dan, hold on.

683
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:28,083
I have a special
weather bulletin.

684
00:58:28,127 --> 00:58:29,685
The tri-county
weather station...

685
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:33,095
reports a fog bank moving
southeast along the coast.

686
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:34,827
For whoever's interested...

687
00:58:34,867 --> 00:58:38,200
that's the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

688
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:42,230
Repeating... a fog bank is moving
southwest along the coast...

689
00:58:42,274 --> 00:58:45,402
toward the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

690
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:52,046
Dan, are you still there?

691
00:58:52,084 --> 00:58:54,382
I'm still here.

692
00:58:54,419 --> 00:58:56,444
You sound different tonight...

693
00:58:56,488 --> 00:58:58,513
kind of intense.

694
00:58:58,557 --> 00:59:01,185
I just feel like talking,
that's all.

695
00:59:01,226 --> 00:59:03,524
You told me you didn't like
to talk on the telephone...

696
00:59:03,562 --> 00:59:05,359
because you talked
on the radio all day.

697
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:06,591
Dan, where's the fog now?

698
00:59:06,632 --> 00:59:09,533
It should be
right outside my door now.

699
00:59:12,704 --> 00:59:14,501
Hold on.
I'm going to try something.

700
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:21,272
I can see it.

701
00:59:21,313 --> 00:59:24,043
Now, what is the big deal?

702
00:59:24,082 --> 00:59:26,141
You've seen fog once,
you seen it for life.

703
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:28,210
There's something
different about this fog.

704
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:31,051
It glows.
Can't you see anything yet?

705
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:34,547
Glows? Oh, I get it.

706
00:59:34,593 --> 00:59:36,561
You take something
to keep you going, right?

707
00:59:36,595 --> 00:59:39,257
Does it make you feel
a little weird sometimes?

708
00:59:40,432 --> 00:59:43,230
- Hey.
- What?

709
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:45,236
The lights went out.

710
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:48,569
Everything's going crazy.

711
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:51,007
Barometer's falling,
temperature's dropping.

712
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:53,011
Dan, what is it?

713
00:59:53,045 --> 00:59:54,444
What the hell's that?

714
00:59:54,479 --> 00:59:56,174
Dan, what is it?
What's happening?

715
00:59:56,215 --> 00:59:58,683
What is it?
What's happening?

716
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:01,185
Someone's shining a light
through the window.

717
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:02,517
Dan, listen to me.

718
01:00:02,554 --> 01:00:05,387
Hold on, sweetheart.
I want to check this out.

719
01:00:08,227 --> 01:00:11,355
Dan, stay on the phone!

720
01:00:22,808 --> 01:00:24,708
This has got to be a joke.

721
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:32,206
Someone's at the front door,
sweetheart...

722
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:34,116
playing a stupid joke.

723
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:36,848
And whoever it is...

724
01:00:36,888 --> 01:00:39,186
they ain't gonna like
finding me home.

725
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,021
Dan, stay away from the door!

726
01:00:57,909 --> 01:00:59,206
Anybody here?

727
01:01:02,714 --> 01:01:05,012
Some asshole got drunk
and started taking...

728
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,814
this 100-year-old business
too seriously.

729
01:02:00,772 --> 01:02:04,833
And so all of us living here
in Antonio Bay today...

730
01:02:04,876 --> 01:02:07,003
owe a great debt
of gratitude...

731
01:02:07,045 --> 01:02:09,479
to those men and women
a hundred years ago...

732
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:12,677
who struggled and sacrificed
to make this town grow...

733
01:02:12,718 --> 01:02:14,413
into what it is today.

734
01:02:14,453 --> 01:02:18,913
And it's up to us to keep
their kind of spirit alive.

735
01:02:23,895 --> 01:02:25,123
I have an urgent bulletin.

736
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:28,894
Will Sheriff David Simms please
contact KAB Radio immediately?

737
01:02:28,934 --> 01:02:31,994
The number is 555-2131.

738
01:02:32,037 --> 01:02:33,766
This is an emergency.

739
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:40,275
So we must redouble our efforts,
work together.

740
01:02:40,312 --> 01:02:42,837
We have a vital,
thriving community.

741
01:02:42,881 --> 01:02:45,349
And I say
we have to keep it that way.

742
01:02:48,487 --> 01:02:50,421
This is an emergency.

743
01:02:50,455 --> 01:02:53,913
Sheriff David Simms,
please contact KAB immediately.

744
01:02:53,959 --> 01:02:57,690
555-2131.
This is an emergency.

745
01:03:12,844 --> 01:03:14,038
Sheriff Simms?

746
01:03:20,018 --> 01:03:21,849
And so, as we make our way...

747
01:03:21,887 --> 01:03:23,548
to the presentation
of the statue...

748
01:03:23,588 --> 01:03:25,886
I think we should all
keep in mind...

749
01:03:25,924 --> 01:03:27,516
the significance
of this night...

750
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:29,891
for every citizen
of Antonio Bay.

751
01:04:18,109 --> 01:04:21,875
We should all proceed
over to the statue.

752
01:04:21,913 --> 01:04:23,972
Single file. Don't push.

753
01:04:24,015 --> 01:04:25,607
Take your time.

754
01:04:51,843 --> 01:04:53,811
Start!

755
01:04:53,845 --> 01:04:55,836
Please start!

756
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:01,981
Why did all the lights go out?

757
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:06,957
One of the lines
are probably down, Andy.

758
01:05:06,992 --> 01:05:10,689
They usually take care
of these things right away.

759
01:05:10,729 --> 01:05:13,425
I think it's kind of neat.

760
01:05:40,725 --> 01:05:42,590
What's that now?

761
01:05:59,144 --> 01:06:00,668
Start!

762
01:06:06,418 --> 01:06:08,818
Andy! Andy,
get out of the house!

763
01:06:08,853 --> 01:06:11,185
Mrs. Kobritz, get him
out of the house! Please! Run!

764
01:06:11,222 --> 01:06:14,157
I think maybe we better
close all the windows, Andy.

765
01:06:14,192 --> 01:06:15,887
Are your bedroom windows
closed?

766
01:06:15,927 --> 01:06:17,189
I'll go see.

767
01:06:26,071 --> 01:06:28,505
Someone listen to me!
My son is trapped!

768
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:31,509
887 White Beach Lane!
My son is trapped by the fog!

769
01:06:31,543 --> 01:06:33,841
Andy, get out of the house!
Run!

770
01:06:38,383 --> 01:06:41,409
Wow! Look at that!

771
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:43,216
Are your windows all closed?

772
01:06:43,254 --> 01:06:44,585
Yes, ma'am.

773
01:06:44,623 --> 01:06:46,181
What about
your mother's bedroom?

774
01:06:57,936 --> 01:07:00,996
Please, someone!
My son is trapped!

775
01:07:03,575 --> 01:07:05,475
Andy, run! Run!

776
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,774
Mrs. Kobritz, run!

777
01:07:10,815 --> 01:07:13,613
Andy, I want you
to go to your room.

778
01:07:13,652 --> 01:07:15,210
I think I should stay.

779
01:07:15,253 --> 01:07:17,619
- Right now.
- Yes.

780
01:07:38,677 --> 01:07:39,905
Go to your room.

781
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:41,605
I want to see who it is.

782
01:07:43,014 --> 01:07:45,039
Can't I stay
for two more seconds?

783
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:50,647
OK, I'm going.

784
01:08:04,502 --> 01:08:06,493
Mrs. Kobritz?

785
01:08:16,548 --> 01:08:18,880
Please. My son is trapped!

786
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:22,819
887 White Beach Lane.

787
01:08:22,854 --> 01:08:25,448
Someone get
to 887 White Beach Lane.

788
01:08:38,203 --> 01:08:42,003
My son is trapped!
Get him out of the fog!

789
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,704
Please, someone!

790
01:08:51,983 --> 01:08:53,541
My son is trapped!

791
01:09:02,494 --> 01:09:04,394
Come on!
Get out of there, now!

792
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:15,967
Andy, run! Run!

793
01:09:18,576 --> 01:09:20,441
Come on! Come on.

794
01:09:20,478 --> 01:09:22,241
Go! Go!

795
01:09:34,526 --> 01:09:35,788
Come on!

796
01:09:35,827 --> 01:09:39,092
Don't pop it.
Try to ease it out.

797
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,688
Oh, Jesus.

798
01:09:46,771 --> 01:09:48,329
Come on, baby!

799
01:09:48,373 --> 01:09:51,831
Come on. It'll go.

800
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:53,036
Reverse! Reverse!

801
01:09:53,077 --> 01:09:54,510
Come on!

802
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:03,418
Come on, do it! Do it!

803
01:10:28,379 --> 01:10:30,404
...Stevie Wayne
for the last twenty minutes.

804
01:10:30,615 --> 01:10:32,879
I think it's best
we call it a night here.

805
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,384
Another five or ten minutes...

806
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:36,216
everyone will have
seen the statue.

807
01:10:36,254 --> 01:10:38,722
All right, but let's get them
through as quickly as we can.

808
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:41,224
Probably be a good idea
if you went home, Kathy.

809
01:10:41,259 --> 01:10:42,886
We can close up here.

810
01:10:42,927 --> 01:10:44,224
I should see it through
to the end.

811
01:10:44,262 --> 01:10:46,560
Mrs. Williams,
there's nothing more to do here.

812
01:10:46,598 --> 01:10:48,964
Let me take you home.

813
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,833
A little annoying,
but you're right.

814
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:53,997
- Would you please take me?
- Yes, ma'am.

815
01:10:54,038 --> 01:10:56,700
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

816
01:11:01,446 --> 01:11:03,812
Andy, I don't even know
if you can hear me.

817
01:11:03,848 --> 01:11:05,941
I'm sorry that
I didn't come for you...

818
01:11:05,984 --> 01:11:07,144
that I wasn't there.

819
01:11:08,553 --> 01:11:11,044
Andy, please understand.

820
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:15,724
I have to stay here.

821
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:30,937
The fog is moving inland...

822
01:11:30,975 --> 01:11:32,875
away from the beach...

823
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,414
towards Antonio Bay.

824
01:11:43,388 --> 01:11:45,549
It's over by the armory.

825
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:48,320
I can't remember the name.

826
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,157
No, no...
I think it's Chestnut.

827
01:11:55,934 --> 01:11:58,994
Feel like listening
to some music?

828
01:11:59,037 --> 01:12:01,528
Sure.

829
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:03,437
It's moving faster now.

830
01:12:03,474 --> 01:12:04,964
Up Regent Avenue.

831
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:07,000
Up to the end
of Smallhouse Road.

832
01:12:07,045 --> 01:12:08,478
What is that?

833
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:13,742
It's just hitting
the outskirts of town.

834
01:12:13,785 --> 01:12:15,776
Broad Street.

835
01:12:17,221 --> 01:12:19,712
Clay Street.

836
01:12:46,084 --> 01:12:47,915
It's moving down 10th Street.

837
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:51,410
Get inside and lock your doors.
Close your windows.

838
01:12:51,456 --> 01:12:53,686
There's something in the fog.

839
01:13:00,264 --> 01:13:02,596
If you're on the south side
of town, go north.

840
01:13:02,633 --> 01:13:04,601
Stay away from the fog.

841
01:13:13,011 --> 01:13:15,104
Richardsville Pike
up to Beacon Hill...

842
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:17,512
is the only clear road.

843
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:19,516
Up to the church.

844
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:22,644
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

845
01:13:30,495 --> 01:13:32,929
Now the junction at 101
is cut off.

846
01:13:32,964 --> 01:13:36,422
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

847
01:13:36,467 --> 01:13:38,367
It's the only place
left to go.

848
01:13:38,403 --> 01:13:41,236
Get to the old church
on Beacon Hill.

849
01:13:49,414 --> 01:13:51,211
- It cut us off!
- Where is it?

850
01:13:51,249 --> 01:13:52,978
- Right behind us.
- Quick, inside.

851
01:13:56,454 --> 01:13:58,149
Come on.

852
01:13:58,189 --> 01:13:59,349
Hurry.

853
01:14:01,225 --> 01:14:04,160
Father, is there a basement
or cellar in here?

854
01:14:04,195 --> 01:14:06,220
- We can't hide any longer.
- We have to try!

855
01:14:06,264 --> 01:14:08,198
No matter where we go,
it will find us.

856
01:14:12,637 --> 01:14:14,332
Is there a basement
or cellar here?

857
01:14:14,372 --> 01:14:16,340
There's a study in back.
I'll show you the way.

858
01:14:16,374 --> 01:14:17,807
Come on. Hurry.

859
01:14:17,842 --> 01:14:20,208
Give me that.

860
01:14:49,273 --> 01:14:51,207
The fog is sweeping inland.

861
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:55,543
It's almost like a wall
across the east end of town.

862
01:15:20,138 --> 01:15:22,003
Blake and his men
have come for us.

863
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:23,631
- Who's Blake?
- It's in the journal.

864
01:15:23,674 --> 01:15:24,800
- What journal?
- I don't know.

865
01:15:24,842 --> 01:15:27,140
- We're cursed.
- What are you talking about?

866
01:15:27,178 --> 01:15:30,375
- Where is the journal?
- It's in there.

867
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:37,785
Over by the window?

868
01:15:37,822 --> 01:15:40,848
- It can do us no good now.
- It's all we got.

869
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:42,587
If anything happens,
just lock the door.

870
01:15:42,627 --> 01:15:44,959
Get back. Shut the door.

871
01:16:25,203 --> 01:16:26,397
''Six must die.''

872
01:16:26,437 --> 01:16:27,699
The three men
on the ''Sea Grass''.

873
01:16:27,738 --> 01:16:29,330
And the weatherman is four.

874
01:16:29,373 --> 01:16:30,840
- Mrs. Kobritz.
- Yeah, five.

875
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,342
And one of us makes six.

876
01:16:32,376 --> 01:16:34,003
That's what they want.
They've come back...

877
01:16:34,045 --> 01:16:35,672
for the six
original conspirators.

878
01:16:35,713 --> 01:16:37,146
There must be something
in here!

879
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:38,671
It's me they want.
I am the sixth!

880
01:16:38,716 --> 01:16:39,842
Why would they want you?

881
01:16:39,884 --> 01:16:41,181
Wait, Father.
You didn't read us this.

882
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:43,187
''Were it possible
to raise the dead...

883
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:45,519
''I would return Blake's fortune
to him intact...

884
01:16:45,556 --> 01:16:48,491
''save the money spent
on these walls that hide it.''

885
01:16:48,526 --> 01:16:50,426
''My fellow conspirators
believe...

886
01:16:50,461 --> 01:16:52,452
''that the confiscated fortune
has been stolen...

887
01:16:52,496 --> 01:16:55,124
''from them, when in fact,
I am the thief...

888
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,634
''and God's temple
is the tomb of gold.''

889
01:16:57,668 --> 01:17:01,195
''I am the thief,
and God's temple... ''

890
01:17:03,074 --> 01:17:05,269
Now, wait. Get rid of that.

891
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:09,437
Get out of the way!

892
01:17:30,568 --> 01:17:34,004
- Give me a hand.
- Andy, stay right there.

893
01:17:57,695 --> 01:17:59,390
The gold.

894
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:20,614
He melted down the gold
into this.

895
01:18:24,689 --> 01:18:26,554
Somebody help her!

896
01:18:39,704 --> 01:18:41,467
Don't go in there!

897
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:25,247
Blake, I have your gold.

898
01:19:32,656 --> 01:19:33,816
Blake?

899
01:20:11,896 --> 01:20:13,830
This is your gold, Blake.

900
01:20:13,864 --> 01:20:17,231
My grandfather stole it
from you.

901
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:22,068
I'm the one
who must answer for it.

902
01:20:34,752 --> 01:20:37,744
I'm the sixth conspirator.

903
01:20:39,757 --> 01:20:42,885
I'm Father Malone.

904
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:45,088
Take me.

905
01:21:41,452 --> 01:21:43,249
Father Malone!

906
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:04,291
Look.

907
01:24:14,538 --> 01:24:16,199
It's going away.

908
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:55,612
I don't know what happened
to Antonio Bay tonight.

909
01:24:55,646 --> 01:24:58,979
Something came out of the fog...

910
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:01,917
and tried to destroy us.

911
01:25:01,952 --> 01:25:04,978
In one moment, it vanished.

912
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:08,514
But if this has been
anything but a nightmare...

913
01:25:08,559 --> 01:25:12,427
and if we don't wake up to find
ourselves safe in our beds...

914
01:25:12,463 --> 01:25:16,229
it could come again.

915
01:25:16,266 --> 01:25:19,702
To the ships at sea
who can hear my voice...

916
01:25:19,737 --> 01:25:23,969
look across the water
into the darkness.

917
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,536
Look for the fog.

918
01:25:56,039 --> 01:25:59,167
Why not six, Blake?

919
01:26:01,678 --> 01:26:03,771
Why not me?

920
01:26:04,771 --> 01:26:14,771
