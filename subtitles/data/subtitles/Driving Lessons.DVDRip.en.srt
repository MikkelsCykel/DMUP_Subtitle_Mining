1
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,399
Thank you, Ben.

2
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Tell your mother she's an angel,
cooking for all us oldies.

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,999
When's the driving test?
-This afternoon.

4
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,680
You got a girlfriend yet?

5
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,319
Oh, no, no.
Not yet, no.

6
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Don't forget.
Hand brake, mirror and turn.

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,239
My name is Roger, and I'm your
driving examiner for today.

8
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,079
I'd like you to approach
the next roundabout and
take the first exit.

9
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,239
No, that was the first exit,
please. You're still going round.

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,999
In a moment, I'm going to
strike the dashboard.

11
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,880
When I do, I'd like you to
make an emergency stop.

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,200
Emergency stop, please.

13
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,639
Stop the car.

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
Stop!

15
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,000
Never mind, darling.

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,960
I crashed the car.

17
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,800
Well, you were nervous.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,800
Mum, do you think I should have some
proper lessons with a teacher?

19
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,119
I've been driving for 25 years.
You just need more practice.

20
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,559
Seat belt, please.

21
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,840
* Oh, come to my heart,
Lord Jesus *

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,920
* There is room
in my heart for Thee *

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,520
* Just fill me
with your presence Lord *

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,880
* I want you to be *

25
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,639
* Redeemed *

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,439
Good!

27
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,280
Bye, Sarah.
-Bye, Peter.

28
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,480
Bye. See you next Sunday.
-Bye, guys. See you on Sunday.

29
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,919
See you, Peter.

30
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,919
I know a lot of
the guys teaching Religious
Education at Coventry.

31
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,639
It's a hell of
a competitive course now,

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,080
very new science, 
philosophy, culture.
Very rounded, very sexy.

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,559
Lovely.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,519
Obviously I can't take Ben's exams
for him, but I can...

35
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,719
I can definitely recommend him.

36
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,680
Thank you, Peter.
Isn't that wonderful, Ben?

37
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,080
Thanks.

38
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,440
Ben really knows his Bible.
It's just the academics
he struggles with.

39
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,240
Maths was always my problem.

40
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,039
Ben and maths.
Don't even talk about it.

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,080
Peter was just telling
us about his thoughts
for an International Day,

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,479
with all the different
parish faiths swapping ideas.

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,000
I thought it sounded wonderful.

44
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,319
I'm not sure
Finchley Central's quite ready

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,639
for Peter's particular bra
of evangelism.

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
No need to be sarcastic, Robert.
At least he's trying.

47
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,199
May I offer you some more,
Mr. Finley?

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,399
How is your room, Mr. Fincham?
Did you manage any sleep
this afternoon?

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Ben took his driving test today.
He did very well.

50
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,839
Just a few things to iron out.

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,440
Of course, now we've got
the summer holidays ahead of us,

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,440
we can spend even
more time in the car.

53
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,920
There you are.

54
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,680
How's my grown-up boy?

55
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,759
Your father and I
have been talking.

56
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,960
Now that Mr. Fincham's
staying with us,

57
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,279
it might be thoughtful if we all
contributed a little money

58
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,720
towards getting
him back on his feet.

59
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,160
What do you think?

60
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,559
Who is Mr. Fincham?

61
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,279
Mr. Fincham came to me
asking for shelter.

62
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,960
He'd heard that I
like to help people.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
But how long
is he staying for?

64
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,360
Darling,
he ran over his own wife.

65
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,920
He must take
as long as he needs.

66
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,560
I thought if you
got a summer job,

67
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,159
you might put some of the money
towards helping Mr. Fincham.

68
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
Ask yourselves this question.

69
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,480
How is a person truly free
until they can think
and act for themselves?

70
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,999
God gave us free will
so that we could choose his love.

71
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,319
You see, he wanted us
to understand our commitment,
to be grown-up about it.

72
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,800
If you say to me,
"Am I a Christian?"

73
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,720
I say to you,

74
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,840
"If you strive to do good,
then you're a Christian. "

75
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,079
Hand brake, mirror, turn.

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,040
If you don't seek to
hurt or betray others,

77
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,040
you're a Christian.

78
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,359
If you're true to
yourself and treat others
as you'd have them treat you,

79
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,199
you're a Christian.

80
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:01,760
The more a person
parades their Christianity
for the benefit of others,

81
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
the less I'm inclined to trust

82
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,680
the Christianity
they claim to bring.

83
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,480
God tells us

84
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,840
true faith is
the freedom to choose truth.

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,600
Now, how you express that,

86
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,480
the way, the manner,
the means at your disposal,

87
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,279
these things are of no consequence,
be you Christian or atheist,

88
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,199
unless in your heart

89
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,519
you are true.

90
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,279
Hello?

91
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,520
Fuck you, you little fuckers!

92
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,359
Jesus... fucking Christ!

93
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,200
Come on! You utterly
cunting bastards, cut!

94
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,559
How are you?

95
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,960
You're Ben.

96
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:48,399
Found the house all right?
Marvelous. Shall we stroll?

97
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,799
Now, then, we talked
on the telephone? -Yes.

98
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,200
What did I say?

99
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
You said you needed some help
round the house.

100
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,960
Did I mention camping?

101
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,159
No. You said you
might need an escort.

102
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,359
Yeah, well,
I travel occasionally.

103
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,240
Theatrical engagements.

104
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
I take it you're a Christian?

105
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,640
Excuse me?

106
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:10,480
Well, I make it a policy
always to advertise in Hello Jesus.

107
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,359
As a single woman,
I'm acutely aware

108
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,719
of the dangers
of sexual assault by younger men,

109
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,599
though, sadly, God is no longer
the insurance policy he once was.

110
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,399
Or am I just old-fashioned?
Now, then, a few house rules.

111
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,200
At home, I'm never
Dame Eve, only Evie.

112
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:31,600
Meals are taken in the kitchen,
unless I happen to be entertaining,

113
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,399
in which case I shall 
ask you to serve a few drinks, 
some canapes...

114
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,960
I pay 6p an hour,
which is a pound more than McDonald's

115
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,960
So if that is unsatisfactory
I suggest you go and work for them,

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,120
though how you can
consider such a thing

117
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,240
in all good conscience,
I really don't know.

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,440
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

119
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,279
Sorry...
Monday to Friday, 11:00 to 4:00,

120
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:56,639
and every alternate weekend
lunch included.

121
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,840
Yes or no?

122
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
Um... Yes.

123
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,840
Oh, excellent.

124
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,679
Well, we do seem to be
getting along famously,
don't we, Ben?

125
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,960
Now, I'll show you around.

126
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,439
Hi, Ben.

127
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,399
Hi.

128
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,200
Been swimming?

129
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,559
Um, yeah.

130
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,440
What are you all dressed up for?

131
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,119
I've got a job.

132
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,280
Doing what?

133
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,760
Looking after a lady in Hampstead.

134
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,159
Lucky lady.

135
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,919
So where are you going now, Ben?

136
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
I was just walking.

137
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:47,039
I thought maybe if you were going,
we could, you know, walk.

138
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,439
Okay.

139
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,280
See you.

140
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,760
You know, after last Bible class,
Peter walked me home.

141
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,640
He says he likes
sharing his thoughts with me.

142
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,079
He says there's
an incredible witnessing

143
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,999
going on in
a church in Hackney.

144
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,360
He says he may take
a group of us there next Sunday.

145
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,279
Peter's so great.

146
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,679
Yeah.

147
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
He said this,
like, black priest

148
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,999
has actually flown
over from America

149
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,919
to save the Church
of England from itself.

150
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,840
Can you imagine?

151
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,239
That's just so Pete.

152
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,679
You've got lovely hair.

153
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,880
What?

154
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,040
Sorry.

155
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
I've wrote you a poem.
I've got it here. I could
read it to you, if you like.

156
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,640
It's okay,
you can just give it to me.
I can read it later.

157
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,159
I'd really like
to read it to you.

158
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,880
Really, it's okay.

159
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,599
It's only five lines.

160
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,639
Go on, then. Quickly.

161
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:53,480
* You are the harvest,
God's water and wheat *

162
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,799
* "Birds fly for you, sing for you*

163
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,279
* Each wing a beat
of my heart for you *

164
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,039
* Felt for you, my clay feet *

165
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,919
* I do not sing for you,
do not fly for you *

166
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,759
* I'm not water, I'm not wheat *

167
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,200
* I would be dove,
I would be hawk *

168
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,639
* Your milky breasts,
my strange meat *

169
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,399
What do you think?

170
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm sorry,

171
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
but you're just too weird.

172
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,720
You're walking through the desert.

173
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,520
It's very, very hot.

174
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,880
Walking. Tired.

175
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,320
You're walking and
walking and walking.

176
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,319
And then... Over here.

177
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
You see a eucalyptus tree.

178
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,080
And then

179
00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:00,440
it's Jesus Christ himself,

180
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,840
carrying his loaves and fishes.

181
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,240
Now, everybody,

182
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,159
quickly, quickly, sitting
in the shade of the eucalyptus tree.

183
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,520
Sitting in the shade,
sitting in the shade.

184
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,799
I'm so proud of Ben.

185
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,320
Not only has he found a job
he's found a job
helping a retired actress.

186
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,640
She's not retired.
What's her name again, Ben?

187
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,999
Eve Walton.

188
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,559
She's a dame.

189
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,039
Eve Walton?

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,480
Wasn't she with
the RSC years ago?

191
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,639
Played Ophelia.

192
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,200
I've really no idea.

193
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,640
Haven't heard her
name for a while.

194
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,159
That's not
saying much, is it?

195
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,080
When was the last time
you went to the theater.

196
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,840
We went to the West End
last Christmas.

197
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,759
That was panto.

198
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,599
I'm sure Dame Eve's
never done panto.

199
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,480
We must invite her over, Ben.

200
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,359
Perhaps she can help us out
with The Story of Christ's Miracles.

201
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,880
On second thought, maybe
we should save her for
Peter's International Day.

202
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,879
Give the Muslims
something to think about.

203
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,319
Excuse me.

204
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,759
Who is it?

205
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,559
Ben.

206
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,280
Come in.

207
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,960
Mum thought you might
like some crumble.

208
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,000
What's that one?

209
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,919
A skylark.

210
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,320
Skylark?

211
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,239
It's found mainly in the Highlands
now, I think.

212
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,919
Its call is
a sort of chirruping...

213
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,600
It's not to be confused with
the woodlark, which has a quieter...

214
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,200
Aye.

215
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,639
Oh, you can borrow the book,
if you like.

216
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,440
It's okay.

217
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:08,320
Well, it's on the shelf.
Anytime.

218
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,719
Thanks.

219
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,480
Thanks for the crumble.

220
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,159
God, I loathe gardening.

221
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,480
One beastly patch of grass
and my bloody back's in agony.

222
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,360
And whoever made up 
all these ridiculous Latin names 
should be shot.

223
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,760
Floria Fuckabundee.

224
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,519
As if anyone gives a sixpenny fuck
what the Romans called them.

225
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,399
Stop that bus!

226
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,679
Are these
the best available seats?

227
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,759
I must say I prefer
to sit nearer the front.

228
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,800
I say, I would prefer
to sit nearer the front.

229
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,240
Since nobody appears to be moving,
I suppose we shall have to make do.

230
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,919
Goodness me,
somebody forgot to wash.

231
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,320
Oof!

232
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,639
Lovely London.

233
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,960
Sweetie? Christmas in a lick.

234
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,320
No, thanks.

235
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,560
For a boy of 17, you show
a lamentable lack of curiosity.

236
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,959
No doubt you're suppressed
by your upbringing,

237
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:54,879
but that's hardly enough to explain

238
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,119
what frankly amounts
to little short of social autism.

239
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,240
I shall have to imagine
your curiosity for you.

240
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,159
You're a healthy 17-year-old boy.

241
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,680
You're not, of course,
but you take my point.

242
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,559
You see an attractive woman
living on her own.

243
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,400
You wonder,
"Is she a roaring lesbian?"

244
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,239
Answer, no.

245
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,680
For your information, I've been
married and divorced three times.

246
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:21,039
Once to an actor,
once to an English lord,
and once to a Californian.

247
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,880
All work flings.

248
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,319
My mistake.

249
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,160
You, on the other hand,
might well be gay.

250
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,359
I must introduce you to Dougal,
old agent friend of mine.

251
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,560
Hopelessly queer, of course,
but the old-fashioned type.

252
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,079
Bent gent.

253
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,960
I'm not gay.

254
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:42,960
I beg your pardon?

255
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm not gay.

256
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,160
Not gay, apparently.

257
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,720
Can I help?

258
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,160
I wish to see your equipment.

259
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,119
My equipment?

260
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:06,000
Show me everything you've got.

261
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,560
Wait. Stop.

262
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,839
Ben.

263
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,960
Can you put your
shoulder under my arse?

264
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,799
Always dreamed of camping,
even as a child.

265
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,160
Half in, half out.

266
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
Of course, my parents would
never have dreamt of it.

267
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,920
The lower middle classes
are the worst snobs.

268
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,839
You sound faintly Cockney.

269
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,759
Are you?

270
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,640
No.

271
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,079
No. What are you, really?

272
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,439
I don't know.

273
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,479
I mean, middle class, I suppose.

274
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,400
Nothing to be ashamed of.

275
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:58,839
Middle classes are
the engine room of England.

276
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,719
It's just their
parents I can't stand.

277
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,720
"They flee from me
that sometime did me seek

278
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,039
"With naked foot
stalking in my chamber

279


00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,400
"I have seen them gentle,
tame and meek

280
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:22,200
"That now are wild,
and do not remember

281
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,599
"That sometime
they put themselves in danger

282
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,560
"To take bread at my hand"

283
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,480
Any luck with this one?

284
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Sadly,
your prices are beyond us,

285
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,519
but for your aid and succo
we thank you.

286
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,639
Look, a camping stove.
Come on.

287
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,960
Where on earth have you been?
It's 6:00.

288
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:06,280
I got held up.

289
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,599
Got held up?

290
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
We had a driving lesson at 4:00.

291
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,760
You should have let me know.

292
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
There was nowhere to call from.
If I had a mobile...

293
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,880
Mobiles give you cancer.

294
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,480
Come on. I'll drive.

295
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,440
* If I am alive
this time next year *

296
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,520
Read that.
We'll have a theory lesson.

297
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,880
* Will I have arrived
in time to share *

298
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:01,359
* And mine
is about as good this far *

299
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:13,359
* And I'm still applied
to what you are *

300
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,960
Ben. Where were you
this evening?

301
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,880
We had a driving lesson.

302
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,280
Is that all?

303
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,760
Yes.

304
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,480
Ben, are you asleep?

305
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,359
Whatever happens
behind these walls, Ben,

306
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,799
we're God's ambassadors.

307
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,559
We show the world a smiling face.

308
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,720
Put it away.

309
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,960
Sorry.

310
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,160
You do not touch my things!

311
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,839
I was tidying.

312
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,079
You do not touch my things!

313
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,639
Yes.
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

314
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,680
You tidy around them.

315
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,079
Evie? I've got your shopping.

316
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:15,920
Evie?

317
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,959
Sink.
-Sorry?

318
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,920
Sink.
-Sorry, I...

319
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,120
Sink!

320
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,160
You all right?
-No.

321
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,359
I've got puke in my hair.

322
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,319
Sit me down.

323
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,880
Okay?

324
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
No.

325
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
Sofa.

326
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,759
It's gonna be all right.

327
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,160
Fuck off.

328
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,039
Goody fucking two-shoes.

329
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
No.

330
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,720
Stay. Please.

331
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,040
Just till I go to sleep.

332
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,599
Thank you.

333
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,959
* Give me oil in my lamp
keep me burning *

334
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,640
* Give me oil in my lamp
I pray *

335
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,440
* Give me oil in my lamp
keep me burning *

336
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,199
* Keep me burning
till the break of day *

337
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,519
* Sing hosanna, sing hosanna *

338
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,880
* Sing hosanna
to the King of kings *

339
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,440
* Sing hosanna, sing hosanna *

340
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,960
* Sing hosanna to the King *

341
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,320
Evie.

342
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,720
Quick, quick, come! You'll never
believe what I've just found.

343
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,080
I've come to hand in my notice.
Yes, yes, later.

344
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,479
Come. Close your eyes.
I've got something to show you.

345
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,399
Eyes shut!

346
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,599
Open.

347
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,039
It's a tent.

348
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,559
Not the tent, my books.
My Shakespeares, my Chekhovs.

349
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,999
They were in a crate
in the living room.

350
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,359
You must have moved them when
you were going through my things.

351
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,240
That was one of the reasons...

352
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,040
But nonsense. I thought
I'd lost them forever.

353
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,319
I won't lie to you, Ben.
Lately, I've found myself
a stranger to the Bard.

354
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,719
I had money problems.
My last husband...

355
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,599
Oh, well, be that as it may,

356
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,959
I was obliged to take TV work,

357
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:11,119
a daytime drama series
set amongst wealthy
shipping magnates,

358
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,239
called, rather unimaginatively,
The Shipping Magnates.

359
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,639
I believe they still
run it somewhere on Sky.

360
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,319
No money in it for me, naturally.

361
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,280
I auditioned for Nurse Ratched
in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

362
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,760
You're Coriolanus.
I'm your mother. I disown you.

363
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,039
"This fellow had
a Volscian to his mother,

364
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,839
"his wife is in Corioli
and his child like him by chance.

365
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,119
"Yet give us our dispatch:

366
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,559
"I am hush'd until
our city be a-fire,

367
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,079
"and then
I'll speak a little. "

368
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,560
"My sister, my sister... "

369
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,400
"Oh, my dear orchard,

370
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,799
"my sweet and lovely orchard.

371
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,160
"My life,

372
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,000
"my youth, my happiness,

373
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:19,920
"farewell!

374
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,280
"Farewell!"

375
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,920
"I'll met by moonlight,
proud Titania. "

376
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:31,760
"What, jealous Oberon!

377
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,599
"Fairies, skip hence:
I have forsworn
his bed and company. "

378
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,920
"Tarry, rash wanton:
am I not thy lord?"

379
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:42,359
"Then I must be thy lady. "

380
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,880
"Kill me to-morrow:
let me live to-night!"

381
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,279
"Nay, if you strive... "

382
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,160
"But half an hour!"

383
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,119
"Being done,
there is no pause. "

384
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,440
"But while I say one prayer!"

385
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,319
"'Tis too late. "

386
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,519
Born to it.
Absolutely born to it.

387
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,399
We did Othello at school.

388
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:13,599
It wasn't like...
I mean, it wasn't very good.

389
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,240
The thing is, you don't
understand the jealousy bit

390
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,880
until you've actually
strangled someone yourself.

391
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,319
Ah, there, you see,
the poetry, the pain.

392
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,560
I write poetry.

393
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,759
How intriguing.
May I hear one?

394
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,160
I'm not...
I mean, I don't know
any off by heart.

395
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,079
Another time, perhaps.

396
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,039
Now, then, I was thinking
we could go camping tomorrow.

397
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,240
Somewhere not too far.
Try out the old tent.

398
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,799
Something the matter?

399
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,359
How long would we be away for?

400
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,440
Oh, a day.
Two days at the most.

401
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,320
Hello, there.

402
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:16,559
And what brings you here?

403
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,000
Mmm?

404
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,200
Do you think Mum
will let me go camping?

405
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,919
Camping?

406
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
Why on earth would anyone
want to go camping?

407
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,560
To escape?

408
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,399
He can't possibly.

409
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,959
He's got a dress rehearsal
with the Guides next week.

410
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,320
He's a tree.

411
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,520
A eucalyptus tree.

412
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,359
Plus, he's got Bible club and
his driving lessons to think about.

413
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,839
But I thought you
were teaching him. -Precisely.

414
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,079
Well, surely a few days
is hardly gonna make
any difference...

415
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,800
Robert, you're not the one
trying to run the Girl Guides,
organize a play,

416
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,880
keep house and look after half
the over-70s in Finchley.

417
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,319
Sorry, but what does any
of that have to do with Ben?

418
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,799
I need him here.

419
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,320
Night, Dad.

420
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,279
Night-night, Ben.

421
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,719
I'm sorry about the camping.

422
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,560
Sometimes your
mother can be a little...

423
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,279
Good night, Mr. Fincham.

424
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,999
Bright and early.
That's the ticket.

425
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,480
I'm afraid I can't
come camping with you.
My mother needs me at home.

426
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,079
I see.

427
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,679
Sorry.

428
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,559
Well, never mind. We can just take
a little drive instead.

429
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,720
I take it you drive.

430
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,519
I'm still a learner.

431
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,519
This is wonderful.

432
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,240
This is simply...
Just look at all that green!

433
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,039
Just look at it.

434
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:46,839
It's all so fucking green!

435
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,880
We should probably think
about turning back soon.

436
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,560
Oh, there's bags of time.
It's not even dark yet.

437
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,239
I really do think
we should turn back.

438
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,000
Stop the car!

439
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,760
Stop! Stop!

440
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,920
Good God above,
I am in Elysium!

441
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,119
Drive in!

442
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,839
I see now why the working classes
kept camping a secret.

443
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,599
Sky. Air.

444
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,440
Their little urchins
skedaddling about.

445
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:31,240
Hello, there.

446
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,519
I'm Evie. I've come camping.

447
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,679
Mum!

448
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,800
There.

449
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,119
Very nice.

450
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,520
If you don't mind,
I really think we should
be getting back now.

451
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
My mother was expecting me at 6:00.

452
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,479
I can't possibly leave
until I've eaten campfire food.

453
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,960
I really do have to say,
there's no time left.

454
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,960
There's always time.

455
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,879
Right, that's it.
I'm packing up the tent.

456
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
I beg your pardon?

457
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,599
I'm taking down the tent.
We're leaving.

458
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,800
Car key, please.

459
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,999
Sorry?

460
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,160
Car key.

461
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:19,839
Okay.

462
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,800
Oh, my God.
You've swallowed the key.

463
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,119
What a relief. He swears.

464
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,880
You've swallowed the fucking key!

465
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,999
Better and better.

466
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,719
Choke. Bring it back.
You can't do that!
You have to bring it back!

467
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,039
No, I don't.
-Yes, you do!

468
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,679
No, I don't.

469
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,440
Shit. There's a spare set.
Where's the spare?

470
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Haven't got one.

471
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,360
How could you do that?

472
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,600
Felt like it.

473
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,960
My mother's gonna kill me.

474
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,280
You don't understand.
She said I wasn't to come.
I asked, and she said no.

475
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:10,039
You don't say yes when my mother
says no. You don't do it.

476
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,880
My dear boy,

477
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,800
the key will be back
with us in the morning.

478
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,840
I'm regular as clockwork.

479
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,360
Look, if it makes
you feel any better.

480
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,119
I'll ring your mother and tell her
I went momentarily mad.

481
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,560
No! No.

482
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,199
Whatever you do,
do not ring my mother.

483
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,760
As you wish.

484
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,960
I'll have to call home.

485
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:52,520
Eat first. A soldier fights
better on a full stomach.

486
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,880
Have a drink.

487
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,159
I don't drink.

488
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
Go on.
It'll make you feel better.

489
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,880
No, it won't.

490
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,239
It was a key. I swallowed it.
Frankly, you should be flattered.

491
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,679
Now, I insist
you have a drink.

492
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm underage.

493
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,480
Well, how old are you?

494
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,359
Seventeen and a half.

495
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,760
So young,
and so pedantic.

496
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:25,999
One glass. You can
tell God I forced you.

497
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,800
To poetry.

498
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,639
"'Auschwitz,'
screamed my halting mentor.

499
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,800
"'Remember
your godforsaken lust

500
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,959
"'in their tolled,
heaped-up hell. '

501
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,880
"'But, but,' I urged... "

502
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,320
That's me.

503
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,679
Yeah.

504
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,639
"'But, but,' I urged,

505
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
"'they have passed us,
passed beyond to a better place. '

506
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,439
"'Revenge,' he cries, 'is yours,

507
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:59,039
"'but you are blinded
by your petty sorrow. '

508
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,919
"'Pity me, pity me,' I yelped.

509
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,040
"'Your service is inclusive
of this testing ground, your soul. '"

510
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Then you go back to the narrator.

511
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,440
Mmm-hmm.

512
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,880
"The Church's
palpable texts breathe

513
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,199
"their rich, rich grace
into your heart,

514
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:18,079
"and they are
precious and beautiful,

515
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,400
"and you must never forsake
the thought of God,

516
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,120
"for God is love. "

517
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,760
And you wrote this for...

518
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,639
Sarah. She's a friend.
I haven't sent it yet.

519
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,520
She thought my last
poem was a bit weird.

520
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,959
Yes.

521
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,280
Well, don't hurry your heart.

522
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,160
That was always my mistake.

523
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,400
What do your parents make of Sarah?

524
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,840
Or perhaps you haven't
got that far yet.

525
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,159
To be honest,
I'm not really sure
how she feels about me.

526
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,479
Well, you have
the soul of a poet,

527
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,200
and that, let me tell you,

528
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,679
lasts a great deal longer than looks.

529
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,119
Hello?
Mum?

530
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,479
Ben? Where are you?
I was expecting you at 6:00.

531
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,400
I'm on a campsite.

532
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,319
Evie swallowed the car key,
and now we can't get back
till she poos it out.

533
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,760
Mum? You there?

534
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,199
I'm calling the police.
Where are you?

535
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,639
I don't know.
Don't call the police.
I'm fine, really.

536
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,959
Have you taken a tablet?
Ben, try to think.

537
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:49,360
Did she give you a tablet?
Something for a headache?

538
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,199
I'm fine. I just can't
come back till morning.

539
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,560
Robert, she's kidnapped him!
He's somewhere on a campsite.
He sounds drugged.

540
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,960
Mum, I'm fine, honestly.

541
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,719
Don't move.
I'm on my way.

542
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:01,440
Mum, there's
nothing wrong with me!

543
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,800
I'm stuck on a campsite,
and I can't come back till morning.

544
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,120
Then I'll expect you
whenever you can get back.

545
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,479
Good night, Ben.

546
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,840
Mum?

547
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:19,239
Mum.

548
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:44,959
* And will I be a part
of what you've made

549
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,000
* And I am throwing

550
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,080
* All my thoughts away

551
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:06,479
* And I'm destroying

552
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,520
* Every bet I've made *

553
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:37,920
All well?

554
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,280
Fine.

555
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,999
Don't feel guilty.

556
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,880
Guilt's a wicked ghost.

557
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,640
I'm just going for a stroll.

558
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,000
I'll be down
the road a little way.

559
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,119
So pack the car up
and come out and meet me.

560
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,080
Car key.

561
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,999
Oh, yeah. Right.

562
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,399
Yeah. There we are.

563
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,039
Right.

564
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,639
Your granny said you'd pay.

565
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,839
You could have told me
you weren't going to pay.

566
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,679
That campsite
manager was a very big man.

567
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,760
- If I hadn't had the money...
- I'll pay you back.

568
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:06,840
- That's not the point!
- Oh, for goodness' sake.

569
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,280
Anyone would think
you'd given blood.

570
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,680
I think it's best
I stop working for you.

571
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:14,639
Oh, why? So you can take up
being pompous professionally?

572
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,800
You can pay me what you owe me
when we get back to the house.

573
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,879
I'm not going back.
I have a poetry recital in Edinburgh.

574
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,080
I'm to take part in
a week of readings
at the Literary Festival.

575
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,960
You never said
anything about that.

576
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:27,320
Why should I?

577
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,879
Well, I can't
possibly go to Edinburgh.

578
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,319
It's...
It's all the way up there.

579
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,599
Nonsense. It's just
a few miles on the motorway.

580
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:37,000
I can't. - Well, that really
is most inconvenient.

581
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,920
I'm sorry, I just can't.

582
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,239
Look, I'll drive
you to the station,
and I'll get the train home.

583
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,199
I don't drive.

584
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,719
Oh, shit.

585
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,920
You have a car in your garage.

586
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:59,840
Ex-husband's. The Russian.
Very keen skier.

587
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,079
I'm a learner driver.
I'm strictly forbidden to drive a car

588
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,000
without a qualified
motorist in the vehicle.

589
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,559
Gosh, you really do
know all the rules, don't you?

590
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,039
We're breaking the law!

591
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:19,399
Evie!

592
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,159
Evie?

593
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,040
You okay?

594
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,079
Do you want some water?
I'll...

595
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,159
You all right now?
What's wrong?

596
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:39,600
Other than the fact
that I have an untreatable
condition, nothing.

597
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,480
- What condition?
- What do you care?
You're going home.

598
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,400
Evie, please, tell me.

599
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,999
Sparing you the details,
my tits have
turned into time bombs.

600
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,880
Doctors gave up
treating me last year.

601
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,239
My surgeon says it's the worst
case he's ever seen.

602
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,559
How long have you got?
Did they say?

603
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,320
How long is a piece of hope?

604
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,679
A month?

605
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,079
Three months?

606
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:15,360
A week?

607
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,719
A week?

608
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,360
You're shocked.
You're still so young.

609
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,760
To me a week is a year,
every moment a blessing.

610
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,239
Well,
I expect you'll be wanting
to get back to your mother.

611
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,639
Oh! Where are we off to?

612
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:48,199
Edinburgh.
You've got a recital to give.

613
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,919
* One door opens
another shuts behind

614
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:05,119
* One sun sets
and another sun she rises

615
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,320
* Love comes to you
in old familiar ways

616
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,680
* Love comes to you
in shadows and disguises

617
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,119
* Love may break like
a precious string of pearls

618
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:23,480
* Treasured moments
they roll away and scatter

619
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,599
* Make believe that there's
ice runs through my veins

620
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,679
* Shrug my shoulders
to say it doesn't matter

621
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:34,880
* And they say it was my turn

622
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,000
* They say I had it coming

623
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,120
* They say that's what you earn

624
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,359
* For living through a lie

625
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,400
* If I could have my way
I'd leave it all tomorrow

626
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,639
* There's sorrow if I stay

627
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,839
* I've other fish to fry *

628
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:53,559
Where the hell is Dryden?

629
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:56,119
Pull over.

630
00:45:57,239 --> 00:45:58,840
Wait here.

631
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,519
Jewelry on a woman my age
is frankly rather vulgar.

632
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:20,040
Buy yourself a clean shirt.
You're my assistant now.
Drive on.

633
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:38,280
Miss Walton?

634
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,600
I am she.

635
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
Hello. Welcome to Edinburgh.
I'm Bryony. I'm helping
on the Literary Festival.

636
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:44,559
Did you have a good journey up?

637
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,280
As good as can be expected.
Ben, my assistant, drove me.

638
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,040
I'm afraid we hadn't allow
for an assistant.

639
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,960
No, no.
I'll take care of that.

640
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,959
Okay, follow me.

641
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,879
So if you want to check
yourselves in at the desk,

642
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,440
they should be able to sort
you out with an extra room.

643
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:02,360
Anything else you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

644
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,280
Thank you.

645
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,679
Emma, the woman that booked you in,
she'll try and pop in and say hello.

646
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:08,079
She's a bit run off
her feet at the moment.

647
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,960
And we'll have a taxi at 11:00
to take you to the venue.

648
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,560
I've got to tell you, I'm
a huge fan of your TV show,
The Shipping Magnates.

649
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:20,760
Yes.

650
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,760
You've seen '80s Night on Sky?

651
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,040
No.

652
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,439
I never miss it.
I know all your catchphrases.

653
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,320
"I'm a woman,
Leland, not an oil tanker. "
You're huge on the gay scene.

654
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,719
Am I?

655
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,800
Sorry.

656
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,280
So we'll see you
tomorrow at 11:00, then?

657
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:47,160
Bye for now.

658
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,399
You wanted to see me?

659
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,280
Yes, come in.

660
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:11,119
I thought Dougal
would at least have had

661
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,760
the decency to
meet us at the hotel.

662
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,959
One doesn't ask
much of one's agent.

663
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,280
I need some water.

664
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,280
Thank you.

665
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:38,440
Thank you.

666
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,239
When I asked you
to come with me to Edinburgh,

667
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,559
I may have given the impression

668
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,999
that such things
were a regular occurrence.

669
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,760
The truth is,
I haven't given any sort

670
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,119
of theatrical performance
for many years.

671
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,560
I accepted this offer

672
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:07,800
because I was
flattered to be asked.

673
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:15,559
It now appears
I may have misjudged
the reason for my invitation.

674
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:20,240
What have they asked you to do?

675
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:25,399
I'm to read from
an anthology of love poetry
It's being re-published.

676
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,159
Part of a week of readings
entitled "Forgotten Voices. "

677
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:33,320
Sounds very nice.

678
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,320
I don't suppose you're familiar
with the notion of kitsch.

679
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,040
It's rather popular
in literary circles.

680
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,480
However, what's done is done
We're here now,
and the show must go on.

681
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,239
I'm sure they'd understand
if you didn't wanna go on,

682
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,600
given how little time you have.

683
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:59,639
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I'm going on!

684
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,039
When a woman says
she's not going on,

685
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,359
it doesn't mean she's not going on!

686
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,880
I want to go on.
I'm just nervous, that's all.

687
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:10,520
Sorry.
-Yes, well...

688
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,000
As long as you're there,
I'll be fine.

689
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,159
Of course I'll be there.

690
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,039
It's silly, I know, but I think

691
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,960
if you weren't there with me
I couldn't go on.

692
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,360
You're my poet.

693
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,639
You understand the power of words.

694
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,320
Tomorrow, then.

695
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,280
Tomorrow.

696
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,280
11:00?

697
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,800
11:00.

698
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,280
"I'm a woman, Leland,
not an oil tanker."

699
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,039
Hello. Nice shirt.

700
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,519
Have you stopped slaving yet?

701
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:09,480
Me, too, thank God. I've just shown
my last novelist to his room.

702
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,840
The bugger actually tried to chat
me up. Writers are so fucking vain.

703
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,639
You do speak, don't you?

704
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:21,119
Good.

705
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,760
You fancy a drink?

706
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,040
I should be in bed.

707
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,679
There's a club I sometimes go to.
It's just round the corner.

708
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,000
Great.

709
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,759
Great.

710
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,600
So shall we go?

711
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,479
Yes.

712
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:50,480
Hi.

713
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,560
This way.

714
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,960
Come with me.

715
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:00,880
Sorry.

716
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,080
Jim, the usual, please.

717
00:52:20,479 --> 00:52:22,880
Here. Cheers.

718
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:31,239
What's your old lady so uptight for?

719
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:34,079
She's nervous about tomorrow.

720
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:37,000
Why? She's only
reading a couple of poems.

721
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,320
They probably won't even get to her.

722
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,839
Emma's always booking
far too many people.

723
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:45,000
I think Dame Evie
wouldn't be very happy

724
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:46,800
if she didn't get
the chance to read.

725
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,760
Dame?
She's not a dame, is she?

726
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,159
Yes.

727
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,479
Let's dance.

728
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:04,920
Oh, I'm okay, thanks.

729
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,320
Come on, it'll do you good.

730
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,239
Use your hips!

731
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:21,559
Use your arms.

732
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:24,880
Wiggle your arse.

733
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,440
Come on!

734
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:36,599
Come on, watch me.

735
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:27,360
Hey!

736
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,239
Could you believe how hairy
that guy's back was?

737
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,320
It's only rented.

738
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,280
Anyone who can
afford to buy around here

739
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,679
definitely doesn't
work in publishing.

740
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:54,320
How old are you?

741
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,199
I'm 18 and a half.

742
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,920
Don't mind me asking, but why
are you working for an old lady?

743
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,079
Were there no other jobs?

744
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:08,239
She's my grandmother.

745
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:12,560
Cool. Sorry, I didn't mean
to be rude about it.

746
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,000
It's okay.

747
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,239
Is this your first time?

748
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,199
No.

749
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,119
Sorry. I'm sorry.

750
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,839
Come here, you twit.

751
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,119
Explain, please, the meaning of,
"He is not in his room."

752
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:25,759
Well, his key's at reception
and he's not answering his phone.

753
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,440
Then kindly unlock the door!

754
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:30,400
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid I can't do that.

755
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,400
We're not at liberty to
unlock a client's door
unless there's an emergency.

756
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:36,320
And you don't call this an emergency?

757
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,199
With the greatest
of respect madam, no.

758
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,159
You were saying?

759
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:47,320
What's happening?

760
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,280
My assistant is missing in action.

761
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,800
When you find him, I'll be downstairs
at La Brasserie Ecosse. Thank you.

762
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,079
Can I get you anything else?

763
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:05,480
Another.

764
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,600
Hello.

765
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,760
I made you some tea.
Do you take sugar?

766
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,760
No.

767
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,119
It's okay, I'm not gonna eat you.

768
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,040
I don't have to be
anywhere till after lunch.

769
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:24,880
How about you? Do you fancy
staying in for a bit?

770
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:30,959
I take it that's a no, then.

771
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,800
It's 11:30!
-So?

772
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,280
I promised Evie I'd
be there by 11:00.

773
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,919
She can go on her own, can't she?
-She won't go on without me.

774
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:38,520
You're kidding, right?
-She means it.

775
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,239
I have to be there before she goes
on, or she can't remember her lines.

776
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,760
Ben, she's reading from a book.

777
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:45,840
It makes no difference.
She's completely hopeless
unless I'm in the same room.

778
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:48,039
Isn't that a bit weird?

779
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,360
She's not weird.
She's just nervous.

780
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,639
Relax. She's having you on.

781
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,040
No, she isn't.
I promised her I'd be there.

782
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,959
Once you've made a promise,
you should keep it.

783
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:04,759
I'm sorry.

784
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,400
Ben.

785
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,359
Yes?

786
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,239
You're a lovely guy.

787
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,720
Thank you.
And thank you for having me.

788
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,439
Stop at an offy.
I need a drink.

789
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,519
Miss Walton?
Emma Pagent, Vintage Press.

790
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,799
For a moment there, I thought
we'd lost you to the Scots.

791
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

792
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,320
Vintage Press, in conjunction
with Eternal Spring,

793
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,320
the exfoliating cream that gently
peels away the years,

794
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:26,239
are delighted to
welcome Miss Eve Walton.

795
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,840
I thought I'd
begin today's recital

796
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:41,880
by reading William
Shakespeare's sonnet number 29,

797
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,559
"When in Disgrace with Fortune."

798
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,999
Sorry. Excuse me.

799
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:50,719
Sorry.

800
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,439
The Presbyterian
Hall off Market Street?

801
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,360
Straight on,
second on the right.

802
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,120
I'm sorry. I seem to have...

803
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,080
It's all right.
I know it off by heart.

804
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,119
"When indisgrace
with fortune and men's eyes

805
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,480
"I all alone
beweep my outcast state

806
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,760
"And trouble deaf heaven
with my bootless cries

807
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:30,640
"And look upon myself

808
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:39,639
"And... "

809
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,400
I'm sorry, very sorry.
I know another one.

810
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,120
"Flo, Flo

811
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,999
"I love you so

812
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,840
"I love you in your nightie

813
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:03,639
"When the moonlight
flits across your tits

814
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:07,360
"Oh, Jesus Christ Almighty"

815
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,719
I'm sorry. I don't
know what's the matter.

816
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,959
Ben? Ben, where are you?

817
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,600
Where are you, Ben?

818
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:25,360
It's okay, I'm here.

819
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,280
Where were you?

820
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,200
I got held up.

821
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,119
You promised me.

822
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

823
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,480
Get me out of here.
Okay.

824
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,160
Where are we?

825
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:47,640
On the way to Cheltenham.

826
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:50,960
Cheltenham?

827
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,440
There's another festival there.

828
01:01:53,439 --> 01:01:56,719
But I don't want to
go to another festival.

829
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:59,400
It's all sorted.
I spoke to the lady, Emma What's-it,

830
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:02,119
and explained to her
you only had a week to live.

831
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,960
She was really nice about it.
She booked you a slot

832
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,760
at the Cheltenham
Literary Festival with Martin Amis.

833
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,240
What are you talking about?

834
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,920
I told her. You're not just
some cheap soap star from the '80s.

835
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:15,519
You deserve a better end.

836
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,999
The Cheltenham
Literary Festival with Martin Amis?

837
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,039
Jesus Christ! Turn the car round
at once and take me home.

838
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:22,359
No.

839
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,439
What did you say?

840
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,280
When a woman says
she doesn't wanna go on,

841
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:27,759
that doesn't mean she
doesn't wanna go on.

842
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,960
Young man, let me
make myself quite clear.

843
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,879
Under no circumstances
am I giving another recital.

844
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,120
I have humiliated myself
quite enough already.

845
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,320
Now all I want to do
is go home and shut the door.

846
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,240
You have to climb back on the horse.

847
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,119
What? Climb back on the what?

848
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:43,800
God wants you to do one more
performance before you die.

849
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:44,800
Stop the car.

850
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:46,360
You were upset.
You lost your nerve.

851
01:02:46,399 --> 01:02:48,400
Next time, I'll go
through the pieces with you...

852
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,200
Stop the fucking car!

853
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,200
I will not be bullied,
even by an emotional cripple.

854
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:03,119
I'm not going back.
Then I'll walk.

855
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,559
You can't. You're dying.

856
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,000
I am not dying.

857
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,759
You mustn't be afraid of death.

858
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,719
I am not dying!

859
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,039
God embraces all who believe in him,

860
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,359
for they shall have everlasting life.

861
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,520
I am not dying! I made it up!

862
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,199
I forgive you.

863
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,999
Oh, don't be so fucking pompous.

864
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,440
I made a tit of myself.
I'm going home. End of story.

865
01:03:33,879 --> 01:03:34,800
Evie.

866
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,320
Evie, where do you
think you're going?

867
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,039
Evie, stop. You're in
the middle of nowhere.

868
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,760
Then I will cling to
the edge of somewhere.

869
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:55,280
Evie, please. You're worth too
much to let yourself go.

870
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,199
Bugger off.

871
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,919
You know I'm right.
You can't deny it.

872
01:03:57,919 --> 01:03:59,519
God gave you your
talent for a reason.

873
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,399
There is no God,
you hopeless little cretin.

874
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,879
God forgives you for that, too.

875
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,320
Let's get one
thing clear, sonny boy.

876
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,439
I do the forgiving, not God.

877
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:13,239
That's a terrible thing to say.

878
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:15,160
Oh, don't get biblical on me,
you pompous fuck.

879
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:16,800
You never read
the bloody thing anyway.

880
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:19,039
- I read my Bible every night!
- Liar!

881
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,240
Liar?
You're telling me I'm a liar?

882
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,680
I've never met anyone
who lied so much in all my life.

883
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:24,999
You make up whole
people out of thin air.

884
01:04:25,479 --> 01:04:27,120
You said you'd be there
at 11:00 and you weren't!

885
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:28,760
You make up conversations.
You make up money.

886
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,199
The one time I really needed you
and you let me down!

887
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:33,080
The one time!

888
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,440
Who were you with
that was so bloody important

889
01:04:35,479 --> 01:04:37,840
you couldn't even
be bothered to show up?

890
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:39,759
Who was it?

891
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,359
Bryony.

892
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:15,879
Take me home.

893
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,719
We can look for
a campsite on the way.

894
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,999
I'm sorry.

895
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,400
Come and look.

896
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,000
Evie?

897
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,399
Mmm?

898
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:06,239
Do you know that picture
I found on your desk?

899
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,079
Was that your baby?

900
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,399
What happened?

901
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:24,199
He died of meningitis
when he was two.

902
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,479
What was his name?

903
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,719
Thomas Oliver Walton. Tom.

904
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,360
He had
a particular way of speaking.

905
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:46,760
When he was proud of something,
he used to miss words out.

906
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,079
Like once when we were
trying to catch a bus.

907
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,960
He was holding my hand,
shouting, "I running. "

908
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,199
Life is confusing.

909
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:08,440
Just when we think it's all over,
it throws a view like this at us

910
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:11,800
and we don't know where we are.

911
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,319
Shall I bring in the things?

912
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:26,279
Tomorrow.
I'm going to rest now.

913
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,319
I tricked you into going all
that way, and you didn't want to go.

914
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,159
I'm sorry.

915
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,119
I had a brilliant time, really.

916
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,399
Tomorrow, then.

917
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,479
You don't have to tell me
what happened. I know already.

918
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:21,320
Some people are wicked,
and that's all there is to it.

919
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:22,920
She isn't wicked.

920
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,079
She's an actress!

921
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:29,239
I think that says enough.

922
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:33,760
Of course, I blame myself

923
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,239
for suggesting we try and do
something kind for Mr. Fincham.

924
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:39,160
This is the thanks I get.

925
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,640
My child on drugs, probably abused.

926
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,680
I wasn't abused.
I had a really good time.

927
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,159
When you went with that actress,

928
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,920
you left God's house.

929
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:58,319
While there is breath in my body,
you will not leave it again.

930
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:00,680
Look at me when
I'm talking to you!

931
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:08,359
She needs me. She's my friend.

932
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:16,199
I could never
betray you, Ben.

933
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,479
Don't betray me.
Don't be a betrayer.

934
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,079
You may have noticed
that Mr. Fincham has started
dressing in my clothes.

935
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,720
We must assume that
this is part of his recovery.

936
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:15,840
Evie, it's me, Ben.
I can't make it today.

937
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:21,119
My mum... Anyway, I'll try
and get there tomorrow.

938
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,000
Ben. I have to go now.

939
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,999
Sway.

940
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,920
* Town to town

941
01:12:26,959 --> 01:12:27,919
* Broadcast to each house,
they drop your name

942
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:29,359
Sway.

943
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:34,760
* But no one knows your face

944
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:38,720
* Billboards quoting things
you'd never say

945
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,640
* You hang your head and pray

946
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:50,039
* For Jesusland

947
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,319
* Jesusland *

948
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:56,359
Down.

949
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,520
And one, two, three, up.

950
01:13:11,479 --> 01:13:14,319
Hello. May I help you?

951
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,119
How do you do?
I'm Dame Eve Walton.

952
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,800
I was wondering
if Ben was in, by any chance.

953
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,520
I'm afraid he's out.

954
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,199
Oh, I'm sorry.

955
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:29,120
Would you mind
telling him I called?

956
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,040
Only he left a message,
but I haven't heard from him.

957
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:36,239
I'm so sorry.

958
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,719
He has no wish
to work for you anymore.

959
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:46,080
I see. Did he say why?

960
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:48,399
He's found
something more appropriate.

961
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,720
More appropriate?

962
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:54,520
Is that all?

963
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,959
Yes. I'm sorry. Yes.

964
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:03,040
Please give him
my very best wishes.

965
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,439
Thank you so much for calling.
Goodbye.

966
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:29,239
Ben, what would I do without you?

967
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:48,479
First positions, please.
Quick as you can. Quick as you can.

968
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,080
Look at them. I'd like to see
Dame Evie do better.

969
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:00,959
The way she looks, I'd say she was
lucky to get a soap opera.

970
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,879
What do you mean?
You've never met her.

971
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,039
Mum,
did she come looking for me?

972
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:25,560
On a hot afternoon in
the hills of Galilee,

973
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,720
a hungry crowd is gathering
in the shade of a eucalyptus tree,

974
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,760
when all of a sudden,

975
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:38,799
Jesus Christ, the son of God,
comes strolling towards them.

976
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,719
We're hungry.
... they cry.

977
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,080
Where can we get food?

978
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:46,920
Showing them his
loaves and fishes,

979
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,560
Jesus smiles and says...

980
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,400
Come unto me, all ye that are heavy
lade and I will refresh you.

981
01:16:00,999 --> 01:16:02,000
Ben?

982
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:09,960
* Well, Jesus was a man
who traveled through the land

983
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:12,120
* A hard working man and brave

984
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,279
* Well, he said to the rich

985
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,600
* Now
give your money to the poor

986
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,200
* So they lay
Jesus Christ in his grave

987
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,880
* Hah-le, hallelujah

988
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:27,560
* Hah-le, hallelujah

989
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,759
* Hah-le, hallelujah

990
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,439
* They lay
Jesus Christ is his grave

991
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,760
* Hah-le, hallelujah

992
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:42,520
* They lay
Jesus Christ in his grave

993
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:48,760
Evie? It's me, Ben.

994
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,159
I've only got a few minutes.
I'm in that play at the church hall.

995
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:56,479
I just want you to know,
Mum never told me you called.

996
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:03,240
Evie, I know you're in there.
Please answer the door.

997
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:10,000
Evie, I need to talk to you.

998
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:13,399
I only stayed away 'cause
I was scared what my mum would do.

999
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,959
Evie! I need you!
You're my best friend.

1000
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,119
Don't make me go back there,
not like this.

1001
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:28,399
Evie?

1002
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:40,840
You silly cow.

1003
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:45,720
Hold on, dear. Bloody hell.

1004
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,600
I'm coming! Hang on.

1005
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,560
Don't give up! I'm on my way!

1006
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,560
Taxi!

1007
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,359
Saint Luke's Church Hall, Finchley.

1008
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:11,600
And now, as the final chapter
of our story unfolds,

1009
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,079
we watch God's angels

1010
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:18,439
surrounding the stone that lies
across the mouth of the cave

1011
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,679
in preparation for
the greatest miracle of all,

1012
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:31,520
Christ's resurrection.

1013
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,079
How much is that, dear?

1014
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:06,959
...rolling, rolling, rolling.

1015
01:19:09,759 --> 01:19:14,359
Then, as the heavy boulder
slips to one side,

1016
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:18,799
Christ steps into the light
and God the Father cries...

1017
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:21,920
I've come for my boy!

1018
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:23,679
Shit.

1019
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,000
God as a woman.
That's so beautiful.

1020
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:32,799
Thank you.

1021
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,200
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1022
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,160
Oh, thank you.

1023
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:42,680
You are too kind.

1024
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:46,319
Start the finale!
The finale! Go!

1025
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,520
My friends, my friends!

1026
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,399
The time has come
for God's son
to say farewell.

1027
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:01,720
Summer's lease has
all too short a date

1028
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,600
and the leaves on the trees,
they are a-stirring.

1029
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,560
Yes, Lord!

1030
01:20:07,959 --> 01:20:08,719
Yes, Lord!

1031
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:09,999
Yes, Lord!

1032
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:13,199
When in disgrace with fortune
and men's eyes,

1033
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:18,039
lift yourself up
and shout to the skies,

1034
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:22,839
"No, no, I don't
wanna be a tree no more!

1035
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:23,760
"No... "

1036
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:24,880
No!

1037
01:20:24,919 --> 01:20:28,239
"... I'm gonna be a man. "

1038
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:29,600
Good news, Lord!

1039
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,760
Yes, sister.
Ain't it good news?

1040
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:34,840
Oh, Lord, good news!

1041
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,160
Yes, yes, yes.

1042
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:43,000
No roots to dig
me in the ground!

1043
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:48,000
No branches
to catch my crown!

1044
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:54,080
I am the son of man,

1045
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,519
ain't nobody holding me down!

1046
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,560
Thanks for coming.

1047
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,960
You stuck by me,
I'll stick by you.

1048
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,560
Thank you, thank you.
Hallelujah! Don't touch my clothes.

1049
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,640
Stop her.
What do you want me to do?

1050
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:11,720
For Christ's sake!

1051
01:21:11,759 --> 01:21:14,319
Thank you, thank you.
No, no autographs. Thank you.

1052
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:25,439
Ben Marshall,
come back here at once!

1053
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:34,079
Time to go home.

1054
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
Ben-Ben?

1055
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,439
I'm not your Ben-Ben.

1056
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:40,760
Don't be silly, my love.

1057
01:21:40,799 --> 01:21:42,399
And I'm not your love.

1058
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,000
Ben, stop now, please.

1059
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,760
No, I won't stop.

1060
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,640
I'm gonna go on and on
until everybody knows

1061
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,319
just what it's like
to live in your life.

1062
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:51,320
Ben. "Be good, be nice. "

1063
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:54,040
And all the bloody time,
you're driving round
in Dad's car having sex...

1064
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:55,520
Ben!

1065
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:00,600
Mr. Fincham?

1066
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,479
Laura, darling!

1067
01:22:13,239 --> 01:22:16,239
Dear Ben, I do hope when you
read this letter,

1068
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:20,079
your mother finds herself
on the road to recovery.

1069
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,479
In the circumstances,

1070
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,359
I quite understand that
you will feel it inappropriate
to work for me anymore.

1071
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,239
Besides,
you are your own man now.

1072
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,760
Do remember, however odd it all gets,
this is only the denouement.

1073
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,600
The end is up to you.

1074
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,479
To wit,
I leave you with this quote,

1075
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:46,159
penned by my dear friend
William Shakespeare:

1076
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,919
"When the shit hits the fan,
get a tent. "

1077
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:55,439
Ben. Come, talk to me.

1078
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:01,640
How are you?

1079
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,720
The doctor said
the only reason I survived

1080
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,840
is because I drive an economy car.

1081
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,479
God truly is a friend to the thrifty.

1082
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,280
Mum, please.

1083
01:23:15,319 --> 01:23:17,720
There's something
else I need to tell you.

1084
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:23,560
Your father and I have been talking.

1085
01:23:26,839 --> 01:23:29,560
I've prayed to God, and I hear him.

1086
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:32,599
He's telling me to get a divorce.

1087
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,240
Ben?

1088
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,479
Hiya.

1089
01:23:41,839 --> 01:23:43,039
Hi.

1090
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:45,359
I'm next in the prayer chain.

1091
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,359
Are you all right, Ben?

1092
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:50,319
Fine.

1093
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,800
We all know about your mum and Peter.

1094
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,439
If it's God's will...

1095
01:24:01,999 --> 01:24:04,920
You're very angry, aren't you?

1096
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,760
Don't be.
You're still God's gift.

1097
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:13,279
Every day God gives us is a gift.

1098
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:16,439
That's why we call it the present.

1099
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:18,800
Fuck off, Sarah.

1100
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:23,399
- What did you say?
- I said 'Fuck off'.

1101
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:42,720
Ben?

1102
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:45,880
What are you doing?

1103
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:49,799
You saw your mother?

1104
01:24:50,279 --> 01:24:53,120
Peter's taking her to
Cornwall to convalesce.

1105
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,680
She said I should
visit them sometime.

1106
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:04,799
I think it's better this way.

1107
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,759
How can you say that?

1108
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,880
After all the shit she put you
through, how can you say that to me?

1109
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,680
You're my dad. You're meant
to stand up for yourself.
You should've divorced her!

1110
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:16,840
You should've told her
to bloody well fuck off.

1111
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:17,800
I did.

1112
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,999
It was me who
asked for the divorce.

1113
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,800
Ben, I know this is hard for you to understand,

1114
01:25:28,839 --> 01:25:32,160
but when I made my vows to your
mother, I meant what I said,

1115
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:36,399
and though it may seem like very
little, I have tried
to be true to my word.

1116
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:42,199
You should've talked to me.
I'd have understood.

1117
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:46,239
I'm a poet. I understand
the power of words.

1118
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,560
Yes.

1119
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:13,920
I think I may move
out here for a while.

1120
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,520
Good idea.
Get a bit of space.

1121
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,520
You know, it's a while
since I've been camping.

1122
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,999
Dad?

1123
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,279
I saw a skylark in Scotland.

1124
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:31,279
Really? Do you know, I've never
seen one. Did it sing?

1125
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:32,800
Just like you said.

1126
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:34,719
Wonderful.

1127
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,640
It was.

1128
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,760
I do love you, Ben.
Very much.

1129
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:51,159
I love you, too, Dad.

1130
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:56,399
Yes. Good. Yeah, that's good.

1131
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:08,239
Blast you.
Oh, for goodness' sake...

1132
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,239
Come on!

1133
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,840
You blunt little bastards, cut!

1134
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,840
Ben!

1135
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:21,680
I wasn't sure I was
going to see you again.

1136
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:23,600
I've been a bit busy.

1137
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,959
Good.

1138
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,239
I can't stay. I'm on my lunch break.
I've got a job in a bookshop.

1139
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,399
Books. Very apropos.

1140
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:36,079
I'm living on my own now,
in the garden.

1141
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:39,640
Excellent. And your parents?

1142
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:41,720
They're my parents.

1143
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,760
Yes.

1144
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:48,520
So, any plans?

1145
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:51,880
I'm thinking of going to college.

1146
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,319
Where?
- Edinburgh.

1147
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,040
To study...

1148
01:27:55,079 --> 01:27:56,199
English.

1149
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,440
English! Good choice.

1150
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,399
I wrote you something.

1151
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,679
I'm still experimenting
with free verse.

1152
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,959
Free verse.

1153
01:28:07,919 --> 01:28:08,880
Ah.

1154
01:28:09,879 --> 01:28:12,600
"Some mysteries
I will never understand

1155
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,359
"The way the Earth
rotates around the sun

1156
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:17,719
"three minutes
short of every day

1157
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,760
"Or the way the dead are gone

1158
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,760
"Like putting down the phone
or turning a corner

1159
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:24,919
"The future

1160
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:26,680
"That's another whopper

1161
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:31,560
"We can never know
what we can never know

1162
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,919
"Except that whoever you a
and whoever I am

1163
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:37,959
"You made it all right to be me"

1164
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,359
It's not Shakespeare.

1165
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:46,239
No, dear, but it's lovely,
and it's you.

1166
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,439
Bye, then.

1167
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,120
Goodbye, Ben.

01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,239

1178
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:46,640

get up this morning

1179
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:51,920

1183
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,920
* On top of the old oak tree

1184
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:32,000
* Everywhere I look

1185
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:36,080

1186
01:32:36,119 --> 01:32:39,439
