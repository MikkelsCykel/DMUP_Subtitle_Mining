00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:17,589
--our five-day forecast.
Next up, the tree girl from Elkerton.

2
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,042
After living in a tree for a year,...

3
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:23,095
...Rianna "Hummingbird" Holmes
comes down.

4
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:27,089
Unlike Julia Hill,
Holmes' forest was leveled...

5
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:30,595
... though she saved
a giant redwood tree.

6
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:32,349
How are you?

7
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:37,440
I wanna thank everyone who
sent food and letters of support.

8
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:41,946
And the mentally handicapped child
who sent me these poems.

9
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:44,398
She read my poems.

10
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,359
Thank you.

11
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:22,610
Dimples!

12
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:25,312
Come on in the house!

13
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,783
Morning, Mrs. De La Rosa.
Dimples got out again.

14
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:33,371
I let him out.

15
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:37,206
You have a good day now.

16
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:42,209
I am a warrior.

17
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,204
I am a warrior.

18
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:46,540
On your left!

19
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,388
Well, boys and girls...

20
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:52,974
...this is the most important room
in the station.

21
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,142
...this is the most important room
in the station.

22
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:55,476
...this is the most important room
in the station.

23
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:55,977
The police evidence room.

24
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,478
The police evidence room.

25
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,354
-It's where I work.
-Are you a policeman?

26
00:02:58,354 --> 00:02:59,981
-It's where I work.
-Are you a policeman?

27
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:04,482
Evidence file clerks
work closely with real policemen.

28
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,234
So you're not a real policeman.

29
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:12,734
As soon as I pass the obstacle course,
I'll be a real policeman.

30
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,737
Yeah, okay, pal.

31
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,614
Evidence is arranged
by case number.

32
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,454
We're almost as tall as you.

33
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,919
This field trip sucks.

34
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:28,543
I might have candy somewhere.

35
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:33,549
-Look, everyone. Marijuana.
-You're not allowed to touch that.

36
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,009
That's police evidence.

37
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:38,592
Are you going to arrest us?
You're not a real cop.

38
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:41,217
Guys, that's really....

39
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,225
I got him!

40
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,690
Mange!

41
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:53,401
What is going on in here?

42
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,446
Let me see that.

43
00:03:58,286 --> 00:03:59,365
Thanks, sarge.

44
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,614
Right there.
You're missing an " R."

45
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:06,824
Outstanding.

46
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:09,584
Now...

47
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:13,921
...who wants a ride
with a real police officer?

48
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:20,550
-Marvin, what happened to you?
-Kids.

49
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,678
How did kids
embarrass you like that?

50
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,439
I'm gonna do it this time, Dad.

51
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,357
I'll be a real policeman,
like you were.

52
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,860
I'll make you so proud of me.

53
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,904
I'm not gonna be a loser anymore.

54
00:04:44,163 --> 00:04:45,539
Give me that!

55
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:53,166
-Stretch it!
-It won't go any further.

56
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,836
Back up. Let me try.
Come on, Marvin!

57
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:02,546
Maybe this year
you won't pee your pants.

58
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:04,344
Good one, sarge.

59
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,972
Don't worry.
Nobody else remembers.

60
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:14,979
Listen up.

61
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:17,898
You have four minutes to complete...

62
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:21,570
...the endurance portion
of your examination.

63
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:25,447
I have personally
designed this course...

64
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:30,157
...to simulate actual conditions
one might encounter...

65
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:31,868
...in the field.

66
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:33,459
Good luck.

67
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:43,636
Take a good look at that ass.
You'll follow it all day.

68
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,762
Ready! Set!

69
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,638
Go, Marvin, go! Go, Marvin, go!

70
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,312
Go, go, Marvin! You go!

71
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,767
Marvin, take her!

72
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,649
Kiss it!

73
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:16,997
Oh, okay.

74
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,008
How does this simulate the field?

75
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,630
Come on now, Marvin! You go!

76
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:40,997
Marvin, you okay?

77
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:43,532
At least you didn't pee your pants.

78
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,208
Maybe we should wait
until everyone leaves.

79
00:07:57,556 --> 00:08:00,225
Pop quiz. Pop quiz.
Who's this?

80
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,779
That's four times in a row.

81
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:15,902
Refills?

82
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,236
Thank you.

83
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:27,615
You see that shit?
She poured my beer first.

84
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:29,248
-So?
-So?

85
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:31,537
It's because I'm black.

86
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,624
Maybe she's just being nice.

87
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,213
-Now we're getting to it.
-What?

88
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:39,261
What y'all call nice,
I call reverse racism.

89
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:41,588
Be overly nice to the black man.

90
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:44,178
Make up for his ancestors
being taken...

91
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:48,853
...crammed by the hundreds into
leaky boats like human tuna fish...

92
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:54,140
...and if they didn't die, they'd
go into show biz to make a living.

93
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,353
Now she's going to pour my beer first?

94
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,070
That won't make up for 400 years
of injustice. Not today.

95
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,407
I wish I was black.

96
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:06,241
I'd have my onion rings by now.

97
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:10,115
I got to go take a whizzer.

98
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,968
-Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.
-No, I'm--

99
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,474
I didn't know anybody was in here.

100
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,308
There's a line in the ladies' room....

101
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:37,681
Wait.

102
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,988
You're Rianna " Hummingbird" Holmes.

103
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:44,731
I think it's great what you did,
saving that tree.

104
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:48,657
Even though they leveled
all the other trees.

105
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,864
Glad to see you're doing your part.

106
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:59,331
I'm sorry. I'm wasting trees.

107
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:04,084
They should get one of those...

108
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:07,344
...blowjobby things.

109
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:13,468
I mean, hand jobbys.
I mean, hand blowers.

110
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,058
I wrote you a poem.

111
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:26,856
Working out and
a protein diet is not enough.

112
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:30,614
You need a high-potency,
high-mineral, mega-amino...

113
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:32,908
...bodybuilding supplement.

114
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:38,115
Nothing legally will give you that,
except Badger Milk.

115
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,420
A badger can lift 20 times its
body weight. Can you do that?

116
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:48,920
Our potent supplement is made up
of 25% real badger milk.

117
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,718
If you call now, you'll get...

118
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:55,008
... two cartons of Badger Milk
for the price of one.

119
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:59,602
Check out the pecs on Yolanda.
That is pure badger milk.

120
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,772
-Could you cover for me a minute?
-No problem.

121
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:13,323
Everyone else is down
at the softball game.

122
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:18,534
There's a softball game today?

123
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:58,526
Freeze, puke! Put down that VCR!
Put it down!

124
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,075
Oh, you bought it, did you?

125
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,780
Oh, you have a receipt, do you?

126
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,129
My mistake.

127
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,964
I'm new on the force.

128
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,904
-Police department.
-Tam's Restaurant. I'm being robbed.

129
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,156
That's terrible.
I go there all the time.

130
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:43,279
-You have the best orange bean cake.
-Thank you.

131
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:47,623
-The chili peppers give it a kick.
-They're shooting at me!

132
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,955
Hold on. I'll get some help.

133
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,131
Officers needed.
I got a 2-1 1 robbery in progress.

134
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:00,800
Outstanding.

135
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,755
Officers needed. Hello!

136
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:06,392
Can you sit tight
till I reach somebody?

137
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:18,062
Got a 2-1 1 in progress.
I'm in pursuit. Hello?

138
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:20,066
2-1 1 in progress.

139
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,758
That wasn't so bad.

140
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,016
-Thanks.
-Not at all.

141
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:35,923
Dimples, you okay?

142
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:54,062
The Badger Milk girl.
She seems nice.

143
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,967
Now, that's good badger milk.

144
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,640
-Fatty.
-I gotta go.

145
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:25,650
Where the hell have you been?

146
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,027
Last night I got a call.

147
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:31,448
2-1 1 . Robbery in progress,
Tam's Restaurant.

148
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:33,694
It was over a week ago.

149
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,577
You've been missing for 8 days.

150
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:38,415
-What?
-I covered for you.

151
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,534
I said you're an unreliable drunk
who disappears for days.

152
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,497
So I think you're okay.

153
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:48,335
-Thanks a lot.
-Are you all right?

154
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:50,840
Do you want a doctor?

155
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:53,799
No, l....

156
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,057
I feel great.

157
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,403
On your left.

158
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:08,904
Sure, pass the old guy!
Big man!

159
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:09,654
Sure, pass the old guy!
Big man!

160
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:11,813
Sure, pass the old guy!
Big man!

161
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,242
How's it going?

162
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:16,656
What?

163
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:26,121
Eat shit.

164
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,588
Come on! Come on!

165
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:35,924
Come on!

166
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:37,632
Come on, boy! Come on!

167
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,350
Oh, easy...

168
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,403
...easy.

169
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:56,817
Slow down.

170
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:05,200
Show me how you do that.

171
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,952
I wish I knew.

172
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,750
-I'm Marvin.
-I'm Rianna.

173
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,583
I know.
I met you in the men's room.

174
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,503
Oh, yeah. The fart guy.

175
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:22,223
So, are all these dogs yours?

176
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,717
I volunteer at a pet shelter.

177
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,301
-That's great.
-Yeah, it's pretty cool.

178
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,557
I'm with different animals and...

179
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,395
...this time,
I have a roof over my head.

180
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,189
Something wrong?

181
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,195
No. Nothing's wrong. Why?

182
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,007
-Nice catch.
-Thank you.

183
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:07,180
Come by the shelter. You could
play Frisbee with the dogs.

184
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,017
I'd like that.

185
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,433
Bye.

186
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,225
I'm sorry.

187
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,700
I gotta talk to you.

188
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,663
You smoke?

189
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,530
I don't. It's illegal in airports.

190
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,244
I want to show you
how bad it's gotten. Watch.

191
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:48,260
See? Nobody says anything
because I'm black.

192
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:53,010
Bend the rules for the black guy.
Let him smoke because he's black.

193
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:56,097
Because old blues musicians
never got royalties...

194
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:59,896
...and played one-night gigs
to pay for whores...

195
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:03,062
...now I can smoke
anywhere I want to.

196
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:05,729
Something weird happened to me.

197
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:09,281
Something weird happened to me too.
I'm supervisor.

198
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:12,405
-That's great.
-Is it? I've been here 1 6 days.

199
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:16,909
That Filipino's been here 5 years.

200
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:21,413
-Know why I'm supervisor?
-Because you're black?

201
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:24,162
No. Because that bitch is dumb.

202
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:31,378
Excuse me, sir.
I'm in a hurry.

203
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:35,429
Not until I check you with my wand.
Arms out.

204
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:39,391
I ordered the stuff
and I think it's working.

205
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:41,681
Physically, there's--

206
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,689
That's odd.

207
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:49,732
You smell that?

208
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,325
-It's this way.
-What is?

209
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,157
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

210
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:10,584
What, are you crazy?
Let go of my leg.

211
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:11,880
Get off me!

212
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,925
He's got drugs. Check him.

213
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:23,434
What are you saying?
This guy's clean.

214
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:26,019
-You see?
-You can go.

215
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:28,567
No, wait.

216
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,587
I hope he's on our flight.

217
00:23:58,012 --> 00:24:00,503
I don't know whose that is.

218
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:06,721
It's pure heroin.

219
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:08,764
You're good. What's your name?

220
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,144
Mange.

221
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,733
Marvin Mange.

222
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:15,102
You'll be hearing from us.

223
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:27,114
Chief Wilson,
what happened at the airport?

224
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:32,077
The drugs were found
by the newest member on our force:

225
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:33,623
Marvin Mange.

226
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:39,755
Here to take you through the arrest
is Sergeant Doug Sisk.

227
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,465
Thank you, sir.

228
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:44,388
Ladies and gentlemen...

229
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,303
...the suspect flew in from Columbia--

230
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,967
I have a question for Officer Mange.

231
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:53,894
Can you smell things
in people's butts?

232
00:24:57,986 --> 00:24:59,065
I guess so.

233
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,521
And things not in people's butts?

234
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,109
Like things in people's
pants pockets or wallets?

235
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:07,738
Officer Mange.

236
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:11,821
I'm from the Free Press.
What's up my butt?

237
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,618
Sir, I'd rather not.

238
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:16,579
Come on.
What's up there?

239
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:19,668
Car keys.

240
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,962
-He's good.
-Over here!

241
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:25,668
-No more questions.
-What about me?

242
00:25:26,347 --> 00:25:28,802
Over here, Officer Mange, please.

243
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:40,897
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

244
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:43,352
I don't wanna guess
what's up your butt.

245
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,231
No, it's not that.

246
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:48,157
You see, I released you...

247
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:51,819
...to see if you could function
normally in society...

248
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:56,830
...but now you attract attention.
I just can't take the chance.

249
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:59,871
-What do you mean?
-I found you.

250
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:03,620
I put you back together.

251
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:08,344
Don't you remember the animals?

252
00:26:14,851 --> 00:26:16,226
No!

253
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:19,188
How do you explain
your sense of smell...

254
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:23,774
...your ability to run fast,
or jump 1 0 feet in the air?

255
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:30,404
It's the badger milk.
I ordered it from TV.

256
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:33,237
I need you to come with me.

257
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:36,864
You're crazy.

258
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:39,613
I'm not going anywhere with you.

259
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,426
Sorry about the dart.

260
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:51,440
You'll find everything you need here.
Water, food...

261
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,149
...a place to work out.

262
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,237
Where am l?

263
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,116
You were born here. Sort of.

264
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,201
When I found you,
you were nearly dead...

265
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,749
...and the only way to save you
was my procedure:

266
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:14,005
-Radical trans-species-ectomy.
-What's that mean?

267
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:16,373
I put animal parts in you.

268
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,467
You put wild animals inside me?

269
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,428
I wish.
I don't have that kind of money.

270
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:26,599
The animals I used...

271
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,851
...were abandoned by a circus or
from the private zoo of a pop star.

272
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:34,313
There's Mr. Giggles.

273
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:38,655
He really misses the pop star.

274
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:41,896
I'm not allowed to say who.

275
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:02,961
Your life is here with me now.

276
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:11,260
Look, doc...

277
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:14,474
...l appreciate you saving me.

278
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:17,482
Thank you. I think.

279
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:21,899
But what you did with the animals
is working for me.

280
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:26,523
I'll just go on with my life.

281
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:32,320
Your human side may not
be able to control it.

282
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,950
I have to go.

283
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,958
I have to try it.

284
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:42,212
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.

285
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:51,927
Mange!

286
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:56,676
Sit.

287
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,772
Listen up, shit stains.

288
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:04,277
I don't know how you worked
that trick out of the guy's ass.

289
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:06,232
I don't.

290
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,196
But I'm watching you.

291
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:14,032
The fact of the matter is,
you're not a full-fledged cop yet.

292
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:15,867
You're not. Okay?

293
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:21,075
And until you pass your 30-day
probation, you belong to me.

294
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:28,165
I'll throw you out so quick,
your head will spin.

295
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:30,750
All the best.

296
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,109
Don't be ashamed, son.

297
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,107
I've eaten out of the garbage before.

298
00:31:58,845 --> 00:32:00,470
Yeah.

299
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:04,927
This baby's nailed down tight.
Not going anywhere.

300
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:25,905
One minute, okay?

301
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:27,914
I'll be back.

302
00:33:07,494 --> 00:33:09,617
He was trying to get out.

303
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:14,664
You'll want to get
a cover for this.

304
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,706
Yeah, maybe. Come on back.
I'll show you the animals.

305
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,918
This is Molly.
She's a young turkey vulture.

306
00:33:26,596 --> 00:33:28,054
Hey, baby.

307
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:33,471
Her parents were killed by a hunter,
and it's hard to get her to eat.

308
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,851
I'm worried she won't make it.

309
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:50,202
She just misses her mom, that's all.

310
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:52,783
She doesn't eat whole worms.

311
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,058
That was really amazing.

312
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:24,106
So? What do you think?

313
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:27,394
It's all right. He's nice.

314
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:30,561
There are a lot of animals in here.

315
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:33,451
Yeah, I know.
It's a little crowded.

316
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:37,949
I don't have the heart
to turn any away.

317
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:42,375
But it's cool.
We're like one big happy family.

318
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:52,299
This is Henry, the orangutan.
He's very affectionate.

319
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:58,930
He really likes people,
but not other monkeys.

320
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:03,177
We have a lot of exotic birds.

321
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,389
Macaws and...

322
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:08,188
...my friend Cosmo's a parrot.

323
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:15,778
You are a good boy.

324
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:24,655
Parrots are one of the smartest
animals.

325
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,283
-Really?
-You want food?

326
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:31,625
They have the intelligence
of a 5-year-old child.

327
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,667
A 5-year-old?

328
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:36,001
People think parrots just mimic...

329
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:38,710
...but they have thoughts
of their own.

330
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,390
Some have a vocabulary
of up to 200 words.

331
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,601
Cosmo has about 1 50 words.

332
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:50,473
That's incredible.
I didn't know any of that.

333
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:51,979
Hi, there.

334
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:56,234
I get along better
with animals than people.

335
00:35:56,447 --> 00:36:00,610
Animals are simple, honest.
Know what I mean?

336
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,582
I guess I like people better.

337
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,631
With animals,
I feel like I'm one of them.

338
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,334
Easy, boy.

339
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,424
Do you ever feel that way?

340
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,430
It's crazy.

341
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,920
Crazy.

342
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,638
Calm down. What's the matter
with you guys?

343
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:38,316
Let me ask a serious question.

344
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:42,776
Do you ever have trouble with
control?

345
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:44,356
Yes.

346
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,946
First you have to admit
there's a problem.

347
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:50,998
You have to say,
" I am a porn addict."

348
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,366
Not that kind of control.

349
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,710
I've been having these...

350
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:59,877
-...animal urges.
-Me too.

351
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:03,875
I got a video on the mating
rituals of the hippo.

352
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:14,304
He was trying to take my meat.

353
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:58,145
Hey, doc. Dr. Wilder.

354
00:37:58,355 --> 00:37:59,635
Hey, doc!

355
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:05,569
There you go.
Tummy's all gone now.

356
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:11,105
How's my boy?
I knew you'd come home.

357
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:13,778
I'm not coming home.

358
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:22,455
Stop it!
You're not helping.

359
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:24,419
-Sorry.
-Look, doc...

360
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,674
...this control thing's
a lot harder than I thought.

361
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,381
Hold on.

362
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:36,965
This might help.
Here. Here.

363
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:46,139
I woke up in a butcher shop.
I have no idea how I got there.

364
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:47,604
Oh, I see.

365
00:38:56,577 --> 00:39:00,823
The other day, I ate out of
a garbage can.

366
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:04,117
I bit someone, and then...

367
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:07,244
...l made love to a mailbox.

368
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:15,875
Your subconscious
is reverting to a primal state.

369
00:39:17,346 --> 00:39:20,513
That's why I wanted you to stay here.

370
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:25,926
I was so sad when you left.
I thought we could be buddies.

371
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:28,230
I even gave you a name.

372
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:31,399
Snowball.

373
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:36,773
I already have a name.

374
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,611
Oh, Snowball already has a name.

375
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:42,026
Who's a good boy, then?

376
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:43,823
I'm a good boy.

377
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,452
I'm a--
This is serious!

378
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,038
I'm turning into an animal here!

379
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:51,242
All right.

380
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:56,664
Four turkeys, a dozen lamb shanks,
two salmon, my pet rabbit....

381
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:59,838
Oh, Charlie. One ham hock.

382
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:09,176
You see?

383
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:14,022
You didn't want the biscuit
because you satisfied your hunger.

384
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,868
Now that I have
your attention, listen.

385
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:27,611
You must anticipate your instincts...

386
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:31,828
...satisfy your animal urges
before they take over.

387
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:36,296
Hunger is your biggest challenge.
There's also your sex drive.

388
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:41,298
If you like,
I could help you with that.

389
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:43,219
That's all right.

390
00:40:44,263 --> 00:40:45,461
I'm good.

391
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:49,266
Okay. No.

392
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:08,528
I gotta go.

393
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,833
There are a few things
bothering me here.

394
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:26,959
I don't know how you got to the
butcher shop break-in...

395
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:29,088
...but let me guarantee you this.

396
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:34,388
You better not try to show me up
with any of your super-cop bullshit.

397
00:41:34,602 --> 00:41:35,931
Not at all, sir.

398
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:40,306
You got one week of probation left.

399
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:42,559
And I'm gonna be all over you.

400
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,279
Say hello to your new partner.

401
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,620
What's all that shit?

402
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:06,415
Supplies.
I want to be prepared for anything.

403
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:08,670
Of course you do.

404
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,133
Hey, pigs.

405
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,690
Get the hell out of here.
It's our neighbourhood.

406
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,840
You're just a regular badass.

407
00:42:58,015 --> 00:43:02,677
-When did you notice it was missing?
-This morning, about 5:30.

408
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:05,350
I parked the tractor right here.

409
00:43:05,564 --> 00:43:07,272
Now it's gone.

410
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:10,900
-Is that your goat?
-Yeah, that's Nellie.

411
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:16,732
-She's in heat, huh?
-Yeah.

412
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:22,110
That's why I got her separated from
the other animals. They can't resist.

413
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:23,955
Makes sense.

414
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,703
-Makes a lot of sense.
-Mange, shut up.

415
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:31,671
-These tracks are still fresh?
-They are.

416
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,752
Where were your farm hands
during the crime?

417
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:38,632
I'm gonna check out
something over here.

418
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:56,982
How's it going?

419
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:00,439
My name's Marvin.

420
00:44:02,785 --> 00:44:04,493
You got it going on.

421
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:18,877
Have you noticed anything
abnormal in the area?

422
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,348
All right now, Marvin.

423
00:44:28,017 --> 00:44:29,512
Control, Marvin.

424
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:31,639
Control.

425
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:41,646
Oh, sweetie. Yes.
You make me laugh.

426
00:44:59,506 --> 00:45:01,130
So soft.

427
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,129
I'll find those men who--

428
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:14,133
Oh, my.

429
00:45:14,895 --> 00:45:16,271
Watch this, Mange.

430
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:18,681
The professor is in.

431
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:21,734
Take out your pen and take notes.

432
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,195
Hey, guys.

433
00:45:24,947 --> 00:45:26,227
Ma'am.

434
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:31,487
I should give you a ticket
for being too darn cute.

435
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:33,109
Tell you what.

436
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,113
I'll settle for taking you out
Saturday night.

437
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,624
Maybe another time.

438
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,708
I already have a date.

439
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:45,833
With Marvin.

440
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:49,176
Right, Marvin?

441
00:45:53,307 --> 00:45:54,386
Yeah.

442
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,470
I forgot. I'm picking her up at...

443
00:45:58,854 --> 00:46:00,431
...8:00?

444
00:46:01,356 --> 00:46:04,143
Dinner and a...walk.

445
00:46:05,152 --> 00:46:06,610
I'll see you then.

446
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:13,570
A walk. I know.
We'll walk to the women's store...

447
00:46:13,785 --> 00:46:16,904
...for a blouse to go with
the metre maid outfit...

448
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:19,743
...you'll wear for your new job!

449
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:21,452
Get in the car!

450
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:25,294
This is the mayor's
annual charity event.

451
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:27,793
Keep a low profile. Got it?

452
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,333
-Got it.
-How are my teeth?

453
00:46:31,593 --> 00:46:33,171
-Great.
-Good.

454
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:51,358
That's far enough, shit stains. Don't
go near the mayor or his guests.

455
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:53,231
I'll be a good boy.

456
00:46:53,531 --> 00:46:56,104
And for God's sake,
keep your shirt on.

457
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:10,462
I'd like to thank everyone
for the success of this fundraiser.

458
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:13,792
The fire department
will love their new equipment.

459
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:15,918
Outstanding, Mr. Mayor.

460
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:19,710
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetheart.

461
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:22,551
Where are you off to?

462
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:24,345
-Keep an eye on him.
-Yes, sir.

463
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:27,478
That is one handsome
little fella you got.

464
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:30,016
Bacon-wrapped shrimp?

465
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,981
Thank you.

466
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:15,606
I am so sorry, Mr. Mayor.

467
00:48:15,818 --> 00:48:19,151
-Are you that drug-sniffing cop?
-Yes, sir.

468
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:32,373
It's a fur ball.

469
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:37,036
This officer's on probation.
He obviously failed.

470
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:39,746
He's off the force as of now.

471
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:43,593
Do you hear that?

472
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:20,875
You all right?

473
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,122
You scared your old man.

474
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:50,355
Chief...

475
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:53,327
...this is one fine cop here.

476
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:55,445
Yes, it is.

477
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,964
Hey, listen up! A toast.

478
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:15,465
The newest cop on the force, baby!

479
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,010
To Mange!

480
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:18,600
Go, Aqua Man.

481
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:21,184
-Nice job.
-Outstanding.

482
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:24,065
You're all right, man.
Right there.

483
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:26,943
You really heard that kid drowning?

484
00:50:27,151 --> 00:50:28,610
-Yeah.
-All right.

485
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:30,978
Then what am I saying now?

486
00:50:34,116 --> 00:50:36,524
You were born with one testicle.

487
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,866
You keep that shit to yourself.

488
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:44,500
I'm worried about
my date with the tree girl.

489
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,663
-I don't know if it'll work.
-Is she a man?

490
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:51,959
-You met in the men's room.
-No--

491
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:54,756
I have to tell you guys something.

492
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,383
I got into a terrible car crash.

493
00:50:57,597 --> 00:51:01,677
Some scientist put me
together with animal parts.

494
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,973
Now I can't control my sexual urges.

495
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:09,727
If you don't want to hang out
because I'm black, tell me.

496
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,561
Yeah.

497
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:47,427
I hope you like vegetarian.

498
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:49,437
I love it.

499
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:51,599
Look at her.

500
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:58,273
And look at the disaster she's with.
They make it so easy for us.

501
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:10,153
-Thanks for helping me with Sisk.
-No, it was no problem.

502
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,958
-I wasn't sure if you meant it.
-Of course I did.

503
00:52:23,595 --> 00:52:28,257
So, how are the animals doing
over at the shelter?

504
00:52:29,184 --> 00:52:34,605
I feel bad about the lack of space,
so I've brought some animals home.

505
00:52:34,814 --> 00:52:37,484
-Maybe I'm crazy.
-I don't think so.

506
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:40,106
I think you're pretty amazing.

507
00:52:41,362 --> 00:52:43,900
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

508
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:53,998
There's something about you
I can't figure it out.

509
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:59,201
How is your grilled eggplant?

510
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:02,375
-Nice, huh?
-Yes, it's lovely. Thank you.

511
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,797
You are the lovely one.

512
00:53:07,888 --> 00:53:10,046
-The bathroom?
-Next to the bar.

513
00:53:10,265 --> 00:53:12,637
Thank you.
Excuse me for a second.

514
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,457
Do you smell that?

515
00:53:46,758 --> 00:53:49,213
It's kind of musty.

516
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:52,504
Asparagus, next table.

517
00:53:57,518 --> 00:53:59,427
Oh, you have a little....

518
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:02,562
I'll get it.

519
00:54:13,492 --> 00:54:16,493
That's either the nicest thing
that's happened...

520
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:18,738
...or the grossest.

521
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:32,379
-Will you excuse me?
-Of course.

522
00:54:53,113 --> 00:54:54,655
Sorry.

523
00:54:54,865 --> 00:54:57,534
-I ordered us some sorbet.
-Great.

524
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:10,171
Will you excuse me again, please?

525
00:55:11,005 --> 00:55:12,036
Okay.

526
00:55:22,808 --> 00:55:24,219
There you go.

527
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:26,391
Oh, thank you.

528
00:55:27,646 --> 00:55:30,267
That's such a beautiful
necklace you have.

529
00:55:30,482 --> 00:55:31,561
Thanks.

530
00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:33,150
Did you get that in ltaly?

531
00:55:33,401 --> 00:55:36,022
-Yes, in Florence.
-I am from Firenze.

532
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:37,352
Piazza della Signoria?

533
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:41,074
My family lives there.

534
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:44,320
Stay with them.
I'll give you my number.

535
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,998
Call me.

536
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:56,038
I'm gonna have a smoke.

537
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:17,024
-What happened to that waiter?
-He was done with his shift.

538
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:21,279
-Thanks for the walk.
-Thanks for dinner. It was great.

539
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:27,194
So, can I invite you in?

540
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:34,575
It's a perfect evening,
I'd hate to ruin it by attacking you.

541
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:36,911
Well, that's honest.

542
00:56:37,671 --> 00:56:41,419
So I guess this is good night.

543
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,179
Good night.

544
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,401
Tomorrow we're releasing Molly,
the turkey vulture.

545
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,737
You should come by.

546
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,863
I wouldn't miss it.

547
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:09,074
Okay. Good night.

548
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:05,002
I've never seen anything like it.

549
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:10,383
There was blood, guts everywhere.

550
00:58:11,927 --> 00:58:14,632
There was nothing left of that cow.

551
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:19,636
It even ate most of the hooves.

552
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:25,096
I'm telling you, chief, there's
some kind of a beast out there.

553
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:30,107
All the other cows are
too afraid to eat or shit.

554
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,486
And they ain't got nothing else.

555
00:58:34,282 --> 00:58:36,737
I'll have an officer drive you home.

556
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:40,990
And all I want you to do
is just take care of your cows.

557
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:42,616
Okay.

558
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:47,418
I'll put on a puppet show.
Maybe that'll calm them down.

559
00:58:48,837 --> 00:58:51,755
Can I see you in my office
for a minute?

560
00:58:53,008 --> 00:58:57,717
That was Bob Harris.
A couple of his cows got torn up.

561
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:01,594
Looks to me like
one of those satanic rituals.

562
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:07,387
Do you worship the Dark Lord?

563
00:59:08,898 --> 00:59:10,357
No, sir.

564
00:59:18,908 --> 00:59:20,153
Help yourself.

565
00:59:25,122 --> 00:59:28,657
Bob saw a man
running away from the scene.

566
00:59:29,293 --> 00:59:31,415
We made a composite...

567
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:34,412
...from his description.

568
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,554
Do you recall...

569
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:48,225
...where you were last night
between midnight and 5 AM?

570
00:59:48,728 --> 00:59:50,601
I was sleeping, sir.

571
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:55,391
Do you have anyone who can
corroborate that?

572
00:59:55,901 --> 00:59:57,064
No, sir.

573
00:59:57,528 --> 01:00:00,813
Can you explain why that drawing...

574
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:03,818
...looks like you, Marvin?

575
01:00:06,078 --> 01:00:09,411
I'm gonna ask
you to go on paid leave...

576
01:00:09,664 --> 01:00:12,416
...until we figure this thing out.

577
01:00:13,585 --> 01:00:18,792
I'm also going to have to ask
you to teach me how you do that.

578
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,686
Sorry, Dad.

579
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:06,717
Is that a beaver dam?

580
01:01:20,982 --> 01:01:23,390
What's happening to you?

581
01:01:26,029 --> 01:01:27,737
Look, you have to go.

582
01:01:29,907 --> 01:01:31,651
You can trust me.

583
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:42,332
Only an animal would do that.

584
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:44,952
There must be another explanation.

585
01:01:51,928 --> 01:01:56,839
I know you and you wouldn't hurt
anyone or anything.

586
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:02,646
It's getting late.

587
01:02:03,523 --> 01:02:05,978
You can't stay here much longer.

588
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:08,649
I'm not going anywhere.

589
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,032
You're not dangerous.

590
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:19,069
I'll stay here tonight
to prove it to you.

591
01:02:28,463 --> 01:02:30,171
It's not safe.

592
01:02:31,049 --> 01:02:32,377
At night...

593
01:02:32,717 --> 01:02:34,544
...l lose control.

594
01:02:42,268 --> 01:02:44,308
What are you doing?

595
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:46,855
I have no idea.

596
01:03:00,035 --> 01:03:01,992
Knock it off.

597
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:11,419
If you're going to stay here...

598
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:14,793
-...at least tie me up.
-What?

599
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:19,751
Oh, no.

600
01:03:19,971 --> 01:03:21,844
I want you to tie me up.

601
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:26,977
So that I won't hurt anybody.

602
01:04:02,553 --> 01:04:04,213
My handcuffs.

603
01:04:05,764 --> 01:04:08,136
You looked so uncomfortable.

604
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,468
When did you take them off?

605
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:12,644
I don't remember.

606
01:04:12,854 --> 01:04:15,392
You wore them for a while, and...

607
01:04:15,732 --> 01:04:18,188
...then I wore them for a while.

608
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:21,025
You are an animal.

609
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:22,566
I am?

610
01:04:22,947 --> 01:04:24,228
Awesome.

611
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:32,362
Marvin, go.

612
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:35,666
This is Wilson! Last night,
a hunter was attacked!

613
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:39,247
Mange! We know about the barn!

614
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,711
You got to get out!

615
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:45,175
-Marvin, get out!
-The freak show's over.

616
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:49,086
Freeze!

617
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:15,078
Super-cop Marvin Mange
turned fugitive.

618
01:05:15,289 --> 01:05:17,696
He assaulted a bird hunter...

619
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,538
...and attacked two cows.

620
01:05:20,752 --> 01:05:23,041
The suspect is dangerous...

621
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:28,249
...and Chief Wilson assembled
a task force of his finest officers.

622
01:05:29,177 --> 01:05:30,588
Ladies and gentlemen...

623
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:34,754
...our suspect is not human.

624
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:37,761
He's at home in the bush.

625
01:05:39,896 --> 01:05:41,390
Shoot to kill.

626
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:45,435
Any questions?

627
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:49,150
I got a question.
When do we light our torches?

628
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:52,280
-When it gets dark.
-Ah, I see.

629
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,273
Another question.

630
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:59,990
Suppose, hypothetically,
a guy had already lit his torch.

631
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:04,785
I mean, it'd be cool
if he could just keep it lit, huh?

632
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,248
Excellent. Excellent.

633
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,841
-If there's no more questions--
-I got another one!

634
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:17,631
If one part of the mob gets separated
from another part...

635
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:21,300
...is there a place to get together?
A secret place?

636
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,555
They could reunite,
and we'd be a big mob again.

637
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,226
Stay with the mob.

638
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,815
Stay with the mob.

639
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:30,810
I got another question.

640
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:34,858
Doesn't this guy deserve a fair trial?

641
01:06:35,073 --> 01:06:36,354
You, back of the mob.

642
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,659
What? This is my spot.
I came early.

643
01:06:39,869 --> 01:06:41,661
Okay, out of the mob!

644
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:44,327
Ah, this mob blows.

645
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,041
Let's go.

646
01:06:48,753 --> 01:06:50,212
Come on, come on!

647
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,641
-What are you doing here?
-Picking apples?

648
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:19,155
With a dart gun?

649
01:07:19,908 --> 01:07:22,315
I made a terrible mistake...

650
01:07:22,535 --> 01:07:25,405
...and now I must correct it.

651
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,284
There's something else out here.
Isn't there?

652
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:33,868
It was the same experimental
procedure as yours.

653
01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:37,170
I don't understand what went wrong.

654
01:07:37,383 --> 01:07:40,253
We have to catch it
before it's too late.

655
01:07:41,136 --> 01:07:42,879
Until then...

656
01:07:44,306 --> 01:07:46,548
...we are all in danger.

657
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,311
This is why black people don't camp.

658
01:07:51,563 --> 01:07:55,097
I could have something
crawl up my ass at home.

659
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,355
I have to eat.

660
01:07:58,569 --> 01:08:02,104
Start carrying Power Bars,
because this is bullshit.

661
01:08:02,823 --> 01:08:04,567
Sorry, Miles.

662
01:08:09,288 --> 01:08:10,568
I have to eat.

663
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:19,876
Oh, my God. You scared me.

664
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,711
You shouldn't be out here.

665
01:08:23,093 --> 01:08:26,378
There's a crazy man-beast
in the woods.

666
01:08:33,144 --> 01:08:37,936
Go! Go! You're the only one
that can stop it now.

667
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:51,036
On your left! On your left!

668
01:09:34,744 --> 01:09:36,322
I love berries.

669
01:09:38,623 --> 01:09:40,117
Are you done yet?

670
01:09:49,008 --> 01:09:50,835
You're mine! You like that?

671
01:09:51,052 --> 01:09:52,843
Come on, baby! Mange!

672
01:10:06,691 --> 01:10:08,020
What?! What?!

673
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:34,498
Oh, no.

674
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:52,031
Come on. I got you.

675
01:11:56,963 --> 01:11:58,291
Reach for it.

676
01:12:18,984 --> 01:12:20,644
Why did you save me?

677
01:12:22,112 --> 01:12:23,606
Like I told you...

678
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:26,740
...l'm not an animal.

679
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,002
I can't take that chance.

680
01:13:01,942 --> 01:13:03,056
You.

681
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:14,739
The hunter wanted my turkey vulture.
I had to scare him.

682
01:13:16,205 --> 01:13:18,874
I guess we have the same doctor.

683
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:26,039
I hope this doesn't
change anything between us.

684
01:13:30,135 --> 01:13:32,840
So that's why you have six nipples.

685
01:13:37,225 --> 01:13:39,550
The damn tree girl is the beast.

686
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:58,743
Two beasts kissing. That's hot.

687
01:14:01,624 --> 01:14:02,868
There it is!

688
01:14:05,794 --> 01:14:07,039
Kill the beast!

689
01:14:09,256 --> 01:14:12,043
Take your dirty claws off her!

690
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:17,466
It's time to die, man-beast!

691
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:24,429
You can do it!
Cut his freaking balls off!

692
01:14:24,645 --> 01:14:25,974
I'm not a beast!

693
01:14:28,441 --> 01:14:29,769
I'm not a beast!

694
01:14:29,984 --> 01:14:32,273
Then who is the beast?

695
01:14:32,486 --> 01:14:33,945
Kill the beast!

696
01:14:36,949 --> 01:14:39,155
All right! All right!

697
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:40,945
It's me!

698
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,327
I was not expecting that.
Were you?

699
01:14:45,374 --> 01:14:46,868
I am the beast.

700
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:51,078
I ate the cow,
and I mauled the hunter.

701
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:54,169
So do what you got to do.

702
01:14:58,469 --> 01:14:59,798
Well...

703
01:15:00,054 --> 01:15:02,213
...we can let it go this time.

704
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,554
-Yeah, it's no big deal.
-What?

705
01:15:06,519 --> 01:15:09,804
I won't be part of a mob
to kill a black guy.

706
01:15:10,189 --> 01:15:12,395
Move it out, people.
It's over.

707
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:14,682
Come on.

708
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,102
These pantyhose are killing me.

709
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:19,278
Come on. All of you.

710
01:15:22,492 --> 01:15:25,161
Let the beast go free
because he's black.

711
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:27,991
Can't kill the black beast.
That's racist.

712
01:15:28,415 --> 01:15:29,909
Way to go, buddy.

713
01:15:31,459 --> 01:15:33,665
What is the matter with you people?!

714
01:15:39,342 --> 01:15:42,177
Come on, guys! Time for dinner!

715
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:55,685
I wonder who they'll take after.

716
01:15:57,442 --> 01:16:01,025
I got a feeling they'll
take after their dad.

717
01:16:01,905 --> 01:16:03,613
It could fall out.

718
01:16:04,282 --> 01:16:07,947
Thank you dearly
for this most prestigious award.

719
01:16:08,161 --> 01:16:09,952
Winning this Nobel Prize...

720
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:12,998
... validates a lifetime of hard work.

721
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:16,369
But I really owe it all
to one special person.

722
01:16:16,585 --> 01:16:18,329
And that person...

723
01:16:18,963 --> 01:16:21,204
... is my fiancee, Yolanda.

724
01:16:22,508 --> 01:16:24,666
It's the Badger Milk girl.

725
01:16:30,515 --> 01:16:33,386
I guess there is someone
for everybody.

726
01:16:33,977 --> 01:16:37,595
Even if you make them
out of animal parts.

727
01:16:38,148 --> 01:16:39,523
You think so?

728
01:16:48,783 --> 01:16:51,902
What? What?
I'm just looking.

729
01:16:52,902 --> 01:17:02,902
