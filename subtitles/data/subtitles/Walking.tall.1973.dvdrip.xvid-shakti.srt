00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,576
Hey there!

2
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,258
Grandma!

3
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,048
Dwana! Oh, how
you've grown!

4
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,100
Grandpa! Grandpa!

5
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,118
Mikey!

6
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,067
Grandpa!

7
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,146
Oh, Dwana,
how are you?

8
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:10,190
Grandma! How are you?

9
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,195
Oh, that's my boy.

10
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,031
How are you?
You...

11
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,149
Pauline.

12
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,202
Grandpa. Oh.

13
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,040
Papa! How are you?

14
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,592
Hey, you're looking good.

15
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,879
Grandpa, we're getting
a house that doesn't move!

16
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,747
A regular house
with a solid foundation.

17
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,097
Where?

18
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,383
Well, right around
here somewhere

19
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,635
if you think you
can tolerate us.

20
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,637
Oh, Pauline, is it true?

21
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,838
It is, Grandma

22
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,533
Are you trying to tell me
that you've given up wresting?

23
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:48,728
Yes, Grandpa, Buford the Bull is
officially retired.

24
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,145
Oh, Son,
that makes me so happy.

25
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,399
Pauline, I'll bet you had
something to do with this.

26
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,236
Mmm-mmm. It was Buford's
decision as always.

27
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,572
I just agreed immediately.

28
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,777
It was a one-way street
leading nowhere, Dad.

29
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,279
It was organized dishonesty.

30
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,246
It was a system.

31
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,282
You know, you win
when they let you win,

32
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,748
you climb the ladder
when they let you,

33
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,251
you breathe when they feel like
giving you air.

34
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,872
I just got fed up with other people
running my life their way.

35
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,333
Buford, it's all over now.
Don't relive it.

36
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:20,725
It weren't worth it.
Yeah, you're right.

37
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,762
Now, see what you did
with your fool questions?

38
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,264
They've come home.

39
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,599
Nothing else is important.

40
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,136
Oh, don't worry, Mama. I'm not
gonna fight with anybody anymore.

41
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,352
Buford's word.

42
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:32,889
By God,
this calls for a drink

43
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,641
With you, just about everything
calls for a drink.

44
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,894
Oh, well, anytime a man's son
returns to his senses,

45
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,529
it's celebrating time.

46
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,364
I wanna go see the cows.

47
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,830
That's for first graders.

48
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,817
I wanna see Dad's
solid gold football.

49
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,845
My granddaddy gave me
this gun when I was 9 years old.

50
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,989
And when you're 9 years old, Mike,
we just might talk about it.

51
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,025
Gee, I'm almost nine.

52
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,412
Grandma's making
cookies downstairs.

53
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,413
I get the bowl!

54
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,914
I get the scraper!

55
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,703
Thank you.

56
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,706
Nothing wrong with guns,
in the right hands.

57
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,455
You wondering
why you ever left this place?

58
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:18,327
We all make mistakes.

59
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:21,295
Of course,
the smart fella,

60
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,332
he don't make
the same mistake twice.

61
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,135
Now you take
Parker Forsythe.

62
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,530
You remember Parker?

63
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:30,890
He had 300 acres.

64
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,394
Only trouble was, he never did
learn that gasoline

65
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,397
and white lightning
just don't mix.

66
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:38,863
God reminded him one night,

67
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,403
right up there where state highway
meets Route 7...

68
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:46,189
Now old Parker's
allotted land is

69
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,160
back on the open market.
$6,000 down.

70
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:53,196
House, nice house,
almost new.

71
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:54,697
Furnished.

72
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,333
Got two catfish ponds on it.

73
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:02,229
The state even has
a timber lease.

74
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:05,091
Now if a fellow was
to get a partner,

75
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,763
and the partner had
some logging gear.

76
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,100
Dad, what time did you tell the
bank we'd come look at the place?

77
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,138
That does call for a drink.

78
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,973
Yeah.

79
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,201
There it is!

80
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,374
Oh, Buford

81
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,595
Look, I see them coming up!
Do you?

82
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,267
The first thing we do

83
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,771
is sell the trailer so we won't
ever be tempted.

84
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,738
Knew you were
gonna say that.

85
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,525
That's why I sold
it this morning.

86
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,729
For me?
No, it's for us.

87
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,533
Oh, Buford! Oh.

88
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,538
I might just cry. Oh!

89
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,180
Watch the steps.

90
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:33,189
Honey, here's the deed and
the mortgage to your home.

91
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,190
You happy?

92
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,612
Buford! It's Lutie

93
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:40,912
Oh.

94
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,413
It's Lutie McVeigh!

95
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,450
He played end on our
football team. Remember, Mama?

96
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:45,918
I sure do.

97
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,259
Are you crazy, Lutie?

98
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,796
He drives them all fast
and he's never caught,

99
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:58,881
but he's always
good for laughs.

100
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,349
He's gonna stop.

101
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,350
Yeah.

102
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,140
Grandma and I have
a lot of shopping to do.

103
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,607
You'd just be in the way.

104
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,143
Take your time.
I'll go home with her.

105
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,453
You sure?
Positive.

106
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,694
Come on, Grandma.

107
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:16,197
One thing, Buford.
What?

108
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:19,735
If you look around town,
you might see some changes

109
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,703
But pay them no mind.

110
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,740
They've got nothin
g to do with us.

111
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,242
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,296
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

113
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,263
"The old Forsythe place,"
they said.

114
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,300
"Nonsense," I said.
"Buford Pusser," they said.

115
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,267
"Must be another
Buford Pusser," I said.

116
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,804
"Nobody's gonna tame that
wild bull dog. " No, sir.

117
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,805
Hey, Lutie!

118
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,772
Why, a man would have to be
crazy to give up

119
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,809
all them faraway places with them
strange-sounding dames.

120
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:44,775
You didn't, did you?

121
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,812
Afraid I did.
I come home to roost.

122
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,814
The old lady,
and a pretty one she is,

123
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,083
kinda leaned on you, huh?

124
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:51,317
Settle down, grow roots.

125
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,819
Her daddy ain't gonna have
no more fun, she said.

126
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,655
Now, come on, you can level
with old Lutie.

127
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,121
Nah, it ain't
nothing like that.

128
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,659
I just got tired of being a
trained animal in somebody else's circus.

129
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,825
Hey, come on,
let's get a beer.

130
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,361
Only refused
a drink once in my life

131
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,863
and that was offered
over the telephone.

132
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,364
Hey, remember Amy Dalton?
Yeah.

133
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,966
She's got seven kids now.

134
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,534
Two by her own husband.

135
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,505
Grady Coker,
he's deputy sheriff,

136
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,064
in case you want
a ticket fixed.

137
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,124
Where we going,
Chuck and Babe's?

138
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:16,590
Man, you really are
out of touch.

139
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,344
Why, that place is nothing
but an old museum.

140
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,810
Strictly senior citizens.

141
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,348
Why, they even play
checkers on the bar.

142
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,349
Buford, we're a big city.

143
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,643
We got our own sin, gambling,
crime, vice, 24 hours a day.

144
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:29,438
A man like you'd feel right
at home. Come on, let's go!

145
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,366
Look, Buford, look!

146
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:43,784
How about that, huh?

147
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,336
A shopping center
for sinners.

148
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,016
You can lay a bet or a broad
or a base for a three-day drunk.

149
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:52,661
Brought more business to town
than anything since the cotton gin.

150
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,330
Mabel, how are you, baby?

151
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,297
How are you?

152
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,135
Come on, let's go.
Come on, go, go!

153
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,195
Oasis for the weary traveler.

154
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,162
Home for the wicked.

155
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,908
Soothing balm
for the frustrated husband.

156
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:33,584
And some of the gals
even give trading stamps

157
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,339
to keep the old lady from waking up
the kids when you come home.

158
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:40,843
Sodom and Gomorrah,here comes
Buford, the Wild Bull!

159
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,678
No holds barred.

160
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:05,034
Mercy, mercy,
look at the motor on that!

161
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,750
Wanna break training, gents?

162
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,752
Just slightly.
Couple of beers.

163
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,786
Hiya, Lutie!

164
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,072
Hi, Margie Ann

165
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:44,340
Hello, baby!

166
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,574
What is this?

167
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,359
Tarzan?

168
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,612
Superman?

169
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:52,830
Or King Kong?

170
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,667
This here's
my bodyguard, Buford.

171
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,336
There's enough here
for three of us.

172
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,123
Only if he gets
group rates, Margie Ann.

173
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,125
Bozo,
these girls are tinder dry

174
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,126
Wet them down!

175
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,629
What's the matter, honey?
Come on, come on.

176
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:09,131
Come here, baby!
Oh, Lord!

177
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,296
A beer

178
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,797
That's on me, Bozo!

179
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,799
You got a light?

180
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,301
I don't smoke.

181
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,582
Looking's for free

182
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,419
What I mean is,
looking don't cost nothing.

183
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,289
Settle down, girls,
and drink your pacifiers.

184
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:24,755
I'll tell you when.

185
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,291
Now for the next
stop on our tour.

186
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,793
Bozo,
get the girls another drink.

187
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,297
Come on, Buford.
Come on, come on!

188
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,173
Ain't this something?

189
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,710
Watch me build this
into a big bundle!

190
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,215
Give me $10

191
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,718
There you go.

192
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,839
Once more.

193
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,708
That's it.
That's it, that's it.

194
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:26,935
Come on, come on.
Let it go!

195
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,695
Come on, come on!

196
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,955
Let's go! Come on, come on,
come on.

197
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,711
I sure could use $50
until we get back to town.

198
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,013
Come on, don't worry!

199
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,931
All right.
You're my partner.

200
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,433
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on.

201
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:58,934
Just a second.

202
00:16:58,969 --> 00:16:59,900
Come on!

203
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,187
That's good. That's good.

204
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,189
Pit call.

205
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,693
There you go.

206
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:28,547
Four. Four's the number.
Hard way open.

207
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,014
Place your bets, gentlemen.

208
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,650
Lady Luck is
spreading her legs.

209
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,217
Oh, that's all I gotta do.

210
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,753
Bring them out, hard way.
Hard way.

211
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,255
Hard way.
Hard way, you're on.

212
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,756
Two and two.

213
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,728
Oh, baby!
Ah, yeah, come on four!

214
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,781
Your point's 13.

215
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,268
You're not rolling, wise guy.

216
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,269
My money is!

217
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,737
Get the money
you lost, Lutie.

218
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,322
Give me my
thirty-five dollars.

219
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:54,606
Now, just a minute

220
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,910
Look out, Buford!

221
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,700
...three!

222
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,770
Let me have him!

223
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,617
All right, Augie, show this
bastard who runs things around here.

224
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,699
You should've called
a seamstress.

225
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,202
Took some 200
stitches in him.

226
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,375
Three years in
the Marine Corps,

227
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,343
five years in the ring.

228
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,606
He has to come home
to get half killed.

229
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,834
Ordinary man wouldn't have
made it through.

230
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:07,052
Where... Where can I wash up?

231
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,057
Pauline, did he mention
where it happened?

232
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,370
Some place called
the Lucky Spot.

233
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:20,147
I'd laugh if it
weren't so awful.

234
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:23,185
Pretty... Pretty obvious he was
all liquored up.

235
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,903
Dead drunk, huh, Doc?

236
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,871
Not obvious at all

237
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,742
The important thing to you
should be who did it to him?

238
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,660
Yeah, Thurman.

239
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,197
Who throwed him in
that ravine to die

240
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:37,741
And where's his
station wagon, huh

241
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:39,750
I'm looking into that,
Mr. Pusser.

242
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,787
Yeah, well, let's hope
you don't look into it

243
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:43,706
like you been
looking into all the other

244
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:45,555
funny things going
on in this county.

245
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,095
Now, Carl, you know that men
just naturally gotta let off steam.

246
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,928
I try and keep it in bounds.

247
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,966
You better be remembering
one thing before election time.

248
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,735
People in this county
give you that badge,

249
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,470
and they can damn well
take it away from you!

250
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,605
Grandpa.

251
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,442
Not like you to
threaten a man, Carl.

252
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:05,444
He speaks for
more than himself.

253
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,459
Lunch time.

254
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,444
Pauline.
Hello.

255
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,482
Buford,
you feeling a bit better?

256
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,950
Yeah, physically, Grady.

257
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,655
I can't find tire nor bolt
of your station wagon, Buford.

258
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,657
Neither can the state police.

259
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:53,658
It can't just vanish.

260
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,527
Oh, it happens
all the time.

261
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,494
Professionals,
most likely.

262
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,198
They repaint them, file off
the numbers, you know.

263
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,205
Say, as far as that fracas
you got into over at the Lucky Spot,

264
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,342
I can't find a single witness
that saw it your way.

265
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:11,426
We got Lutie.

266
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,548
Now, Buford,
you know Lutie.

267
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,515
Crazy Lutie McVeigh!

268
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,637
Can't tell where the truth ends off
and the tall stories begins.

269
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,639
Nobody takes him serious.

270
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:26,189
I do.

271
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,977
Well, if that's your
whole case, you got none.

272
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:30,527
Look, I got
a chest full of stitches!

273
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,198
Well, if that's all, count
your blessings and drop the case.

274
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,699
Like hell I will!

275
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,957
Your funeral.

276
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:45,008
Thurman,

277
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,379
Thurman, I've known you
since I was a kid.

278
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,713
I always thought
you walked tall.

279
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,334
Looks like you done learned
how to crawl!

280
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,802
Buford, you've got stitches,
remember?

281
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:58,221
How can I forget?
Hey, Grady, what about you

282
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,842
You just gonna let them throw me
in a hole and bury me?

283
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,345
Well, what am I supposed
to do, Buford?

284
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,312
He deals the cards.

285
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:07,891
I just play the hand I get.

286
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:11,474
Go find yourself
another game.

287
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:15,023
Grady!
Get over here and fast!

288
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:17,025
Oh, there it is again.

289
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,026
What?

290
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:19,993
The system.

291
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:22,530
You gotta live my way
or you don't live.

292
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,816
It's just like a clock

293
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:34,853
Every time we get started,

294
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,547
that damn boy in
that beat-up truck

295
00:27:37,582 --> 00:27:39,741
of his comes around
looking for a job.

296
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:09,203
Obra?

297
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,271
Buford!

298
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,023
Hey! You really filled out

299
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,274
Yeah, well, you did, too.

300
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,776
We made a great tag team, huh?

301
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,860
Well, maybe we still can.

302
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,047
Can you use
a man and his truck?

303
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:21,199
I'm used to hard
work and low pay.

304
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,618
Well.

305
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,623
Can you get your
load in good shape?

306
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:30,123
Yeah, sure I can.

307
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:33,411
Well, we need men, and the pay's
the same for everybody.

308
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,011
You're on! Thanks.

309
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,464
Hey, I'll go tell the boss.

310
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,668
Pa!

311
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:44,672
Pa, you got
something against Obra?

312
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,676
I knowed him
since he was a pickaninny.

313
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:51,138
Hired his old daddy many times.

314
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:53,370
That doesn't
tell me anything.

315
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,532
Well, he got educated,
you see?

316
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,571
Then he come down with a raging case
of that new social disease

317
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:01,357
Black Power.

318
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:03,073
Is that all?

319
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,574
Now look,
hold on just a minute.

320
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,612
I believe in equality
just as much as anybody.

321
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:11,081
But I don't want it
forced on me, see?

322
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,619
Gonna be a lot of fun
working with the two of you.

323
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,471
Come on, man, give me a break,
will you? Slow down!

324
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:34,973
You say you want a job, huh?

325
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:36,441
Yeah!

326
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,446
That's lunch!

327
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,452
Oh!

328
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,628
Touchdown!

329
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:04,636
You know, if you push
that wood any faster, man,

330
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:06,137
I'm gonna need six arms.

331
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,140
You can take it.
I got faith in you

332
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,142
Yeah.

333
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,146
Walk softly and
carry a big stick, huh?

334
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,651
You planning on
trying that somewhere?

335
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:21,795
I was thinking about it.

336
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,905
When I get well enough.

337
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,575
How does it feel to be part of
the oppressed minority?

338
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,579
Well, that's something
you ought to know about.

339
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:32,330
Any suggestions?

340
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,797
Yep.

341
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,834
Do not beat your head
against the wall

342
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,412
cause it'll
probably fall on you.

343
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:40,955
Two, lone wolves
are easy prey.

344
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:43,958
Organize.
There's strength in unity.

345
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,462
And, three,
you are a damn fool, Buford,

346
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,848
for trying to do
what I know you're going to.

347
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,703
Margie Ann, lie down,
I wanna talk to you.

348
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,808
Hey, Bozo,
don't give me no crap!

349
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,933
Help me get this bum up.

350
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,463
What's up, Bozo?

351
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,677
Bozo!

352
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,073
Look, I'm, I'm just
the bookkeeper.

353
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,492
I didn't have
anything to do with it

354
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,494
Here's a receipt.

355
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,962
$3,630 you owe me.

356
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:11,999
3,300 for my station wagon,

357
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,966
280 for my and Lutie's money,

358
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:16,587
and about $50 for
the doctor's bill.

359
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:19,173
You sign it,
you give me my money.

360
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:27,014
No, just the $3,630
you owe me.

361
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:33,688
Sign it.

362
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,425
Mister,
your hands are shaking.

363
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,378
If you miss,
you'll never shoot again.

364
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,308
Pull.

365
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:17,398
Pull.

366
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,038
Pull.

367
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,974
Buford, you're under arrest.

368
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,440
What for?

369
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,511
Assault and battery
and armed robbery.

370
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,399
That dog moves, shoot him.

371
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:54,902
Shep, sit. Sit! Stay!

372
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,821
Cuff him.

373
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,358
Buford, I don't understand.

374
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:02,241
What happened?

375
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:03,744
He knocked over
the Lucky Spot.

376
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:04,710
I'll be all right, Pauline.

377
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,030
Just tell Daddy to
get me bail money.

378
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,867
My daddy wouldn't
rob anybody!

379
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,040
Looks like violence
runs in your family.

380
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,905
$50,000 for bail?

381
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,943
They don't set that much in
this state for premeditated murder!

382
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:38,661
What is this about only one day
to prepare for trial?

383
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,699
You're ignorant of the law, Pusser.
You refused to hire counsel,

384
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,203
so suffer the consequences
of your foolishness.

385
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:47,154
Do you have any
idea what you face?

386
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:51,158
Sure. Frame-up?

387
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,978
A possible sentence
of 30 years.

388
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,762
Now, whether
you want it or not,

389
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,300
I'm gonna give you the benefit of
my legal wisdom.

390
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:00,716
Don't go to trial.

391
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,254
Plead guilty to
the assault charge.

392
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,221
Make financial restitution,

393
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,342
and I'll personally consider
some kind of lesser sentence.

394
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:11,194
How much lesser?

395
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,397
I'll work that out
with Sheriff Thurman.

396
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:21,072
In that case, I'll take my chances
with the McNairy County jury.

397
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:22,607
You're a damn fool, Buford!

398
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,862
But then we've already
established that, haven't we?

399
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:29,864
All right, take him back.

400
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:59,977
People of the State of Tennessee
v. Buford Pusser.

401
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:02,780
Honorable Judge
R. W. Clarke presiding

402
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,700
Against my advice,
the defendant

403
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:09,168
desires to act as
his own counsel.

404
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,989
Therefore he cannot claim
a mistrial on that basis.

405
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:20,414
Will the defendant
please challenge the jury?

406
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,300
It's fine with me.

407
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,303
The prosecutor
may challenge.

408
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,342
If it please the court, the jury
is satisfactory with the state.

409
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,399
They just fished Lutie McVeigh
and his car out of the river.

410
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,943
Then you may call
your first witness.

411
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,995
Call Buel Jaggers.

412
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,165
Buel Jaggers.

413
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,281
Go on, Mr. Pusser.

414
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,372
This morning my only witness,
Lutie McVeigh,

415
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:35,873
he was fished
out of the river.

416
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,841
Well, they've had their say.

417
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:43,664
Seems like they've had that kind
of say around here for too long.

418
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:45,666
Look, I had to stand
up for myself alone.

419
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,944
And I didn't go in to rob any
gambling house with just a stick.

420
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:51,722
I went in there to remind them
that somewhere in this world,

421
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,924
there's still a little
law and order left.

422
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,427
To let them know
in the only kind of terms

423
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:58,394
that their kind
understand is

424
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,431
that they can't buy,
bribe or threaten

425
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,767
their way out of
what they did to me!

426
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,769
They did this!

427
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,773
Oh, now hold it!
You're out of order!

428
00:40:08,808 --> 00:40:09,905
You're out of order!

429
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,624
Stop it right now!
Stop it!

430
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,492
Your Honor,
the state objects to it.

431
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:16,030
You let them do this to me
and get away with it,

432
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:17,757
then you give me
the eternal right to do

433
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,450
the same damn thing
to any one of you!

434
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:20,451
You're out of order, sir!

435
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:21,752
And put on your shirt!

436
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:37,718
They've only been out
less than five minutes.

437
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,908
Mr. Foreman, have the jurors
reached a verdict?

438
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,046
Not guilty.

439
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,346
Congratulations, Buford.
Keep up the good work.

440
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,229
Thank you.
Hey, Buford!

441
00:41:23,264 --> 00:41:26,232
Congratulations.
Buford. Hey!

442
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,769
Man, you really know
how to play the crowd.

443
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,323
You had that
jury ready to walk

444
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:34,325
barefoot over
hot coals for you.

445
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,246
That's something
they'd never do for him.

446
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,714
Hey, Buford.

447
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,752
Buford, why don't you try
this job on for size?

448
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,760
No, Buford, no!

449
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,728
We'll go someplace else.

450
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,765
Find a decent
town to live in.

451
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,049
Where?

452
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,516
And how?

453
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,553
Everything we've got's
sunk in this place.

454
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,940
Besides, I never turned tail
and run from nobody.

455
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:07,022
I'm not gonna start
with these people.

456
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,060
Is your pride worth the safety
of those children?

457
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,777
Of all of us?

458
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:12,778
Okay, then you leave.

459
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,315
You go to your mama's
and you take the kids

460
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,616
and you come
back when it's okay.

461
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:18,083
I don't want to leave you.

462
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,121
And I don't want you
to run for sheriff.

463
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,625
"No more fighting,
" you said.

464
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,126
You gave your word.

465
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,978
Wild Bull Buford's word.

466
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,295
On that you can bank.

467
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,131
I didn't know this
was gonna happen.

468
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,098
Oh, well, you're turning this

469
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,253
into some kind of senseless
life and death grudge fight.

470
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:37,755
It's not senseless, Pauline.

471
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,256
Listen to me.

472
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,258
Pauline,

473
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,644
this is my home.

474
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,111
You made it yours.

475
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,649
And you want me and you and the
kids just to go run, hide,

476
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,150
afraid to come home?

477
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,153
Just for a little while.

478
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,522
Only until all this
violence blows over.

479
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:57,524
It's not gonna
blow over by itself.

480
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,026
Now somebody's got
to huff and puff.

481
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:01,028
Oh, Buford, grow up.

482
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,368
Dad,

483
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,422
what do you think
my chances are?

484
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,424
Fair. Fair.

485
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,426
I'll tell you something,
though, Buford.

486
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,946
You run against
these people and lose,

487
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:21,432
you're gonna be
worse off than before.

488
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:22,898
'Cause you'll
never find anyone

489
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,802
to stand up against
them for you again.

490
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,770
Not ever.

491
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:36,447
Then we'll leave.
Only then.

492
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,790
Yeah, yeah

493
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,759
Punish me

494
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,596
Oh, make me feel the pain

495
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:58,636
So I'll know not to ever
do you wrong again

496
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:01,088
Come on, punish me

497
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:05,300
Make me crawl back
to your world

498
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:09,013
But don't go and find
another girl

499
00:44:09,048 --> 00:44:11,480
Oh, no, no, baby

500
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,652
I said I just couldn't
stand it now

501
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:17,154
Take my life into your hands

502
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:19,121
Come on, punish me

503
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,574
Oh, but don't
take your love away

504
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:27,614
'Cause I couldn't make it
another single day

505
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:30,082
Come on, punish me

506
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:33,620
Make me crawl back
to your world

507
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:37,124
But don't go and find
another girl

508
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:40,392
Oh, come on, baby

509
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,430
Do what you want with me

510
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:46,433
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

511
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,900
Great.

512
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,937
Don't forget to vote.

513
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:56,825
? Since you caught me,
feel so ashamed

514
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:02,032
? I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be down on my knees

515
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:06,737
? Begging you,
please, baby, please

516
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,704
? Won't you punish me?

517
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,707
? Oh, just
take out your revenge

518
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:16,747
? So I'll know not to ever
do you wrong again

519
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:19,131
? Come on, punish me

520
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:22,351
? Make me crawl back
to your world

521
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,890
? But don't go and find
another girl?

522
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:28,392
Hey, Buford.

523
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:34,373
How'd you like a nice,
plush job as my deputy?

524
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:38,652
No brains required,
just brute animal force.

525
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,271
I ain't that desperate.

526
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,455
You will be, boy.

527
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,367
You sure as hell will be.

528
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,244
The day after elections.

529
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,586
Last chance, Buford.

530
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,589
If you can't lick them,
join them.

531
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,304
Now, Grady,
that's what I call

532
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,272
a pure case of
reckless driving.

533
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,310
That boy has got no respect
for law and order.

534
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:22,778
Hey, Al, let him go!

535
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,315
God damn it, Grady, you act like
you're gonna vote for him!

536
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,318
Now get in or I'll
dock you a day's pay!

537
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,816
We'll get him!

538
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:04,655
We'll get him, Grady, and
we'll nail his ass to the cross!

539
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,872
"Pusser for Sheriff. "

540
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,520
Now I got the bastard!

541
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,308
Hold it!

542
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,707
Damn it, Grady, that's more money
than you can make

543
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:12,759
in 20 years as a deputy.

544
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,727
And all you gotta
do is testify that

545
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,799
Buford deliberately
ran you off the road.

546
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:21,301
That's murder
and the end of him.

547
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:26,606
I'll think it over.

548
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,609
Don't give us
that crap, Grady.

549
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:31,278
You'll do it or else!

550
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,152
I'd be dead if it
weren't for Buford.

551
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:02,843
Christ, can you ever
figure people?

552
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:07,097
Well, looks like our only
chance now is to elect a corpse

553
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:10,851
and gamble on getting our own man
appointed in his place.

554
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:14,820
We got only one
week before election.

555
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:18,358
We'll get us some big billboards,
radio, TV spots,

556
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:20,360
and call in all
favors owed us.

557
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:23,864
I swore that bastard
would have took a hot stove.

558
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:25,831
You're right, Callie.

559
00:51:25,866 --> 00:51:27,868
We gotta throw everything
we can lay our hands on

560
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:29,334
behind our dead sheriff.

561
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:32,372
Another 10,
20,000 should do it.

562
00:51:32,873 --> 00:51:35,125
My people just ain't got
that kind of money.

563
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,377
I ain't got but two girls
working for me

564
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:39,379
and I can't carry any more freight.

565
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,849
You pay your end, Hassie,
or get your ass out!

566
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:48,889
For God's sakes, Jaggers,
lay off the local suckers.

567
00:51:48,924 --> 00:51:50,891
Wouldn't it be a hell of a lot
easier, Callie,

568
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:53,859
just to run that yokel
out of town?

569
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:56,396
Next time you meet up
with him, Jaggers,

570
00:51:56,431 --> 00:51:57,898
you have my permission.

571
00:51:57,933 --> 00:51:58,732
Oh!

572
00:52:22,255 --> 00:52:25,058
Hey, Buford! Hey! Hey!

573
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:30,395
We won! We won!

574
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,516
Yeah, congratulations!

575
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,984
Where's Grandma?
Back there.

576
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,322
Hey, Mama! What they
got you arrested for, Mama?

577
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,290
Buford!

578
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,077
I won it, Ma! I won it.

579
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,436
Morning.

580
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:13,473
All right, there's two rules,
and that's all.

581
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:16,107
But don't ever forget them.

582
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:19,145
Number one,
we enforce the law equally.

583
00:53:20,647 --> 00:53:22,649
Number two,
any man who takes a bribe

584
00:53:23,149 --> 00:53:25,318
is gonna get his head
knocked off by me.

585
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,572
Now Grady's gonna show me
the territory.

586
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:31,790
This is 201 to 501.

587
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:35,328
201 to 501,
come in if you read me.

588
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:39,833
That's for you, Sheriff, 501.

589
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:44,386
501. Who are you?

590
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,923
This is Sheriff Tanner
over in Alcorn, Mississippi.

591
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,925
Welcome to
the shooting gallery.

592
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,810
First morning on the job,
I hate to give you a big one,

593
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,312
but we got
a multiple death case

594
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,314
over here that
should interest you.

595
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,650
I'll be there in an hour,
Sheriff Tanner.

596
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:59,019
No rush.
We got them on ice. Over.

597
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,996
A civil rights picnic, all young,
in their early twenties.

598
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:13,016
We got a dozen more
over at County Hospital.

599
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:16,002
All of them drinking
poisoned white lightning.

600
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,893
This here is Sheriff Pusser
from McNairy County.

601
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,930
Now tell the man where you
picked up that lot of moonshine,

602
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:28,396
and don't you lie.

603
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,399
From Willie Rae's bar
over near Salem.

604
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,937
Okay, thank you, Sheriff.
We'll take care of it. Grady.

605
00:54:33,972 --> 00:54:35,403
Thanks, Sheriff.

606
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,940
Now get him out of here.

607
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,429
Good morning, Sheriff!
Obra.

608
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,716
My, my, my.
You sure do look the part.

609
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:05,610
Hey, look, Obra,
your friend Willie Rae

610
00:55:05,645 --> 00:55:07,470
runs a still back
up here somewhere.

611
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,172
You know where it is?

612
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,645
You are some
kind of quick study.

613
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,848
You got the talk,
the official manner,

614
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:20,982
and the coldness
down just like that.

615
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,984
Look, I just came
from the morgue at Alcorn.

616
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,521
They got eight dead niggers
stretched out over there,

617
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,523
all dead from
poisoned rotgut whiskey

618
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:28,490
made somewhere
up around here!

619
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,494
Let's not waste any time playing
these dumb word games.

620
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,368
Buford, don't you
talk to me like that.

621
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,838
You've been running around
all this county all the time

622
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:47,210
shooting your mouth off about
how you want to help your people.

623
00:55:47,245 --> 00:55:49,713
Well, I'm trying to
give you a chance.

624
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,230
You know that last sheriff,

625
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,266
he wouldn't have given a damn
about those eight bodies,

626
00:55:53,301 --> 00:55:55,233
they weren't
his favorite color.

627
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,270
I care, and whether
you help me or not,

628
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:59,773
I'm gonna do
something about it.

629
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,149
All right.

630
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,129
About seven miles
from here up in them hills,

631
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,131
near an old logging road.

632
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,133
Some boys from Arkansas.

633
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,636
I can show you.

634
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,138
Thank you.

635
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,642
I got something for you.

636
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,646
You got a new job.

637
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,614
You're Deputy Sheriff,
McNairy County.

638
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,652
Oh, no. Buford, now you've
been away for too long.

639
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:47,153
That just isn't done down here.

640
00:56:47,188 --> 00:56:49,120
Is that right?

641
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,658
Well, it's okay for you to set up a
poor, white-trash ex-wrestler for sheriff,

642
00:56:51,693 --> 00:56:53,660
but it's not good enough
for you, huh?

643
00:58:11,437 --> 00:58:12,939
You're all under arrest.

644
00:58:12,974 --> 00:58:13,940
Stay where you are.

645
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,588
Whose truck's this?

646
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:35,345
Jesus! Who
the hell's the son of a...

647
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,114
This truck is
hereby confiscated

648
00:58:37,149 --> 00:58:38,848
for carrying
unlicensed liquor.

649
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:39,849
Whose car is this?

650
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,851
I don't know.
Never saw it before.

651
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,363
Well, whoever it belongs to,
they lost it now.

652
00:58:53,398 --> 00:58:55,382
Oh, I forgot
to tell you, Augie,

653
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:57,367
Willie Rae,
you're under arrest.

654
00:58:57,402 --> 00:58:59,369
Manslaughter. Eight counts.

655
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,206
I'll radio in and get
some deputies out here.

656
00:59:03,241 --> 00:59:04,290
Take care of
this truck and car.

657
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,292
Don't lose anybody.

658
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,913
Sit down!

659
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,300
That's right, yeah, put your
hands over your heads.

660
00:59:14,335 --> 00:59:15,802
Come on!

661
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,222
Sit down, Willie Rae.

662
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,224
You showed him up here,
didn't you, boy?

663
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,727
Sure hope you do
try something, Augie.

664
00:59:27,013 --> 00:59:28,980
If you live long enough,

665
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:32,769
you're gonna wish this day
never happened, smart ass!

666
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,774
Sit down, smart ass!

667
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,075
Sit down!

668
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,886
Sheriff Pusser,the court orders
you to set the prisoners free.

669
01:00:08,388 --> 01:00:09,889
You don't mean that, Judge.

670
01:00:09,924 --> 01:00:11,391
I do and I'm so ordering you.

671
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:13,524
Why?

672
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:14,861
Because you acted improperly.

673
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:16,729
You failed to get
search and seizure warrants

674
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,330
before you invaded
their privacy.

675
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,367
You failed to inform them
at the time of their arrest,

676
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,987
of their legal
rights to counsel,

677
01:00:24,022 --> 01:00:26,537
to silence,
to access to a telephone.

678
01:00:26,572 --> 01:00:29,540
These people were responsible
for eight deaths, Judge.

679
01:00:29,575 --> 01:00:32,629
You can't just let them go because
of some little technicalities.

680
01:00:32,664 --> 01:00:35,632
The United States Supreme Court
does not consider them

681
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:37,634
little technicalities,
Sheriff Pusser.

682
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,385
They are the law of the land.

683
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,922
There's more to upholding the law
than swinging a big stick

684
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:44,474
and kicking down doors.

685
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,977
Now you set them free,
or I'll hold you in contempt,

686
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:49,228
which I do anyway.

687
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,853
Remove those handcuffs.

688
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,058
Buford, there's a man,

689
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,595
Mr. Witter from Nashville
was here looking for you.

690
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,598
He's up there now,
talking to Judge Clarke.

691
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,103
Mr. Witter.

692
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,325
Sheriff, this is John Witter.

693
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,046
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, Sheriff.

694
01:01:40,081 --> 01:01:42,732
Judge Clarke's been
telling me all about you.

695
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,867
Well, that shouldn't
have taken him long.

696
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,154
I wonder if I can
talk to you in private?

697
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,460
I think it'd be
better in your office.

698
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,462
Oh, well, this is it.

699
01:02:25,264 --> 01:02:27,266
Pusser,
you're a local sheriff.

700
01:02:28,267 --> 01:02:30,269
A brand new one at that.

701
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,238
Now, maybe nobody
told you,

702
01:02:34,273 --> 01:02:38,861
but this is a lot more than
just a local operation.

703
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:42,614
I mean, there are some important
people involved,

704
01:02:42,649 --> 01:02:46,010
all the way up to the capital
and beyond, believe me.

705
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:49,371
Well, the only important people
to me are down there.

706
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:52,208
They built the county.
They have to live in it.

707
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:54,960
You know,
one of the first things

708
01:02:54,995 --> 01:02:56,212
you gotta learn
to do in this life

709
01:02:56,247 --> 01:02:58,423
is to take care of number one.

710
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,488
If you don't,
nobody else will.

711
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:02,518
You don't have to
commit any sins.

712
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:03,984
All you've gotta
do is let those

713
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,737
who want to pay
for their fun, do it.

714
01:03:06,772 --> 01:03:09,775
I got nothing against
a little drink, a little fun,

715
01:03:10,276 --> 01:03:13,244
but the law of the land
shouldn't be for sale.

716
01:03:13,279 --> 01:03:15,781
Now if you let those people
that run those joints have an inch,

717
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:17,081
they'll steal
the whole state.

718
01:03:17,116 --> 01:03:19,618
And it looks like they've already
got a leg up on it.

719
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:24,490
Well, I suggest you think it over
for a day or two.

720
01:03:25,991 --> 01:03:28,494
Why don't you come
on up to Nashville

721
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:29,995
and you meet
some of the fellas.

722
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,962
You'll like them.

723
01:03:31,997 --> 01:03:34,124
You'll find
them very generous.

724
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:36,217
Well, I already
thought it over,

725
01:03:36,252 --> 01:03:37,920
long before I went after
this job, Mr. Witter.

726
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,421
So I heard.

727
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:45,811
You know, ideals and realities
are very far apart.

728
01:03:48,264 --> 01:03:50,698
One day you're
gonna see that, son.

729
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:54,737
And if you don't,
someone's gonna point it out to you.

730
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:56,021
Clearly.

731
01:03:57,022 --> 01:03:59,491
You already have.
Thank you.

732
01:04:04,663 --> 01:04:07,666
Enjoy yourselves, boys,
these are two of the best.

733
01:04:14,173 --> 01:04:16,175
Here comes that big stick.

734
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:23,132
Hi, Luan,
I see you moved your trailer.

735
01:04:26,135 --> 01:04:28,637
And I see
you're still looking.

736
01:04:35,611 --> 01:04:39,615
Hi, Callie.
Hello, Prentiss.

737
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,948
You know, Callie,

738
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:43,986
you've got one of the sexiest
track teams I've ever seen.

739
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:47,489
What's the record between
here and the trailer, huh?

740
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:49,491
Hmm?

741
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:02,504
Hey, Callie,
wanna open the storeroom?

742
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:04,506
The one with
the illegal liquor?

743
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:09,929
Prentiss, open the storeroom
for the sheriff.

744
01:05:09,964 --> 01:05:11,979
Leave those there.

745
01:05:12,014 --> 01:05:13,432
Put those
against the back wall.

746
01:05:16,518 --> 01:05:18,019
All right,
if he won't buy off,

747
01:05:18,054 --> 01:05:19,486
let's kill
the son of a bitch.

748
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:22,191
You know what Witter said.
"Go easy. "

749
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:24,693
The Nashville papers are
playing up that big stick of his

750
01:05:25,194 --> 01:05:27,294
like he was Sir
Lancelot or somebody.

751
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:31,200
We ought to take Sir Lancelot's
big stick and shove it up his ass!

752
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:35,954
We ought to do
what we're told to do.

753
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:38,672
Find some way to
teach him a lesson.

754
01:05:38,707 --> 01:05:41,844
Then maybe Witter can talk
some sense into him.

755
01:05:41,879 --> 01:05:44,346
You teach him
your kind of lesson.

756
01:05:44,847 --> 01:05:46,849
I got a couple boys in Alabama
who'll teach him something

757
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:48,467
he won't live to remember.

758
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:55,474
Craps.

759
01:05:57,443 --> 01:06:02,413
? Made a mistake
long time ago

760
01:06:02,448 --> 01:06:05,951
? 'Cause I wanted to see
the lights of the city

761
01:06:07,953 --> 01:06:12,057
? The big town called me
and I just had to go

762
01:06:12,092 --> 01:06:16,161
? But a fire behind the lights
is not too pretty

763
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,212
? Hey, hey, hey

764
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:23,502
? 'Cause I'm coming home
on the very next train, yes

765
01:06:23,537 --> 01:06:28,757
? I'm coming home
and I'll never leave again?

766
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:34,313
This is the third time today
you've rousted me over.

767
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:36,815
Why the hell you working
to hurt me, brother?

768
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,282
I'm not working to
hurt you, Willie Rae.

769
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:40,986
I just wanna make sure
nobody else gets hurt.

770
01:06:42,488 --> 01:06:45,491
Is that another way of saying
you wanna make a deal?

771
01:06:46,492 --> 01:06:47,242
Okay.

772
01:06:48,744 --> 01:06:50,746
I'm just a little deputy,
Willie Rae.

773
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:53,032
I don't have authority
to make deals.

774
01:07:07,129 --> 01:07:08,595
Well, now,

775
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,599
we saw your car
parked outside,

776
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:16,138
and we thought we'd come in to say
hello to our new deputy.

777
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,607
Hey, fellas,
would you look

778
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:25,612
at the solid gold badge
this here boogie's wearing

779
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:31,653
Obra, Obra, now that you've got
yourself a steady job, you gonna,

780
01:07:31,688 --> 01:07:34,507
you gonna buy us
all a beer, huh?

781
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:37,291
Hold on.
Come over here, would you?

782
01:07:37,326 --> 01:07:39,328
Now why don't you get
the hell out of the way

783
01:07:39,363 --> 01:07:41,830
and let some men do
some drinking, huh?

784
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:44,298
Now, look, oh,
I was talking to you, boy.

785
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:47,836
You gotta show some more respect
for your betters, huh?

786
01:07:55,344 --> 01:07:56,645
Six beers!

787
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,652
I said give us six beers!

788
01:08:11,577 --> 01:08:14,913
Calling 501, 501.

789
01:08:15,414 --> 01:08:18,200
This is patrol car number three
calling Sheriff's car 501.

790
01:08:20,536 --> 01:08:23,005
Calling 501, 501!

791
01:08:24,506 --> 01:08:26,091
501, that's you, Obra?

792
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:27,558
Yeah, Buford.

793
01:08:27,593 --> 01:08:29,059
Look, I'm down
at Willie Rae's,

794
01:08:29,094 --> 01:08:30,779
and there's six
troublemakers down here.

795
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:32,915
Do you wanna come down
and pick them up?

796
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,017
No, you pick them up,
I haven't eaten yet.

797
01:08:35,052 --> 01:08:36,518
But they're
white men, Buford.

798
01:08:37,019 --> 01:08:38,303
Arno Purdy and
that bunch, you know?

799
01:08:41,023 --> 01:08:42,975
Buford,
did you hear what I said?

800
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,441
I said they're white men!

801
01:08:44,476 --> 01:08:46,478
Obra, now you're a deputy sheriff
for McNairy County,

802
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:47,479
not a shoeshine boy!

803
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:48,780
If they're out of line,
pick them up!

804
01:09:05,297 --> 01:09:07,299
Let me tell you
about Saturday night.

805
01:09:07,334 --> 01:09:09,001
I was down at this place.

806
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:10,603
And if you ever do...

807
01:09:10,638 --> 01:09:12,171
You're under arrest.

808
01:09:40,332 --> 01:09:42,618
Don't make me
have to kill you!

809
01:09:55,964 --> 01:09:58,967
Well, now,that wasn't so hard now,
was it?

810
01:09:59,002 --> 01:10:00,969
No, not from where
you were sitting.

811
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:04,056
Hi, Arno.
How's it hanging?

812
01:10:18,403 --> 01:10:19,905
$10 or ten days.

813
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:35,837
You take your life
in your hands for $10.

814
01:10:36,338 --> 01:10:38,590
It's not the fine
that's important.

815
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,985
It's the principle
of the thing.

816
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,310
You got public respect, Obra.

817
01:10:43,345 --> 01:10:46,848
Come over to my house tonight
with public respect.

818
01:10:46,883 --> 01:10:47,683
Watch the bonfire.

819
01:11:08,954 --> 01:11:11,757
I've been thinking
this whole thing over.

820
01:11:13,759 --> 01:11:16,762
Well, no use lying.

821
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:21,933
I got drunk, and I made
a fool out of myself.

822
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:25,937
I had no business
being at Willie Rae's.

823
01:11:29,391 --> 01:11:30,892
Obra, I...

824
01:11:32,394 --> 01:11:34,396
I want you to know that...

825
01:11:35,897 --> 01:11:37,366
I want you to know
I'm damn sorry.

826
01:11:41,486 --> 01:11:43,488
Believe me,
I mean it, Sheriff.

827
01:11:44,489 --> 01:11:45,240
I am.

828
01:11:52,297 --> 01:11:53,632
Here's 20 bucks.

829
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:57,502
For the shirt.

830
01:12:00,505 --> 01:12:01,723
Best I can do.

831
01:12:04,259 --> 01:12:06,845
Don't you just hate
somebody like that?

832
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,979
What do you mean?

833
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,483
Well, he ruined our bonfire.

834
01:12:17,906 --> 01:12:20,025
That fight yesterday
was for real.

835
01:12:20,525 --> 01:12:24,029
Obra could have been killed,
and all you did was levy a $10 fine.

836
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:25,447
My prerogative.

837
01:12:25,947 --> 01:12:27,765
You run the streets,
I run the courts.

838
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,693
If I bring them in
, you let them go,

839
01:12:29,728 --> 01:12:32,158
the whole thing just
becomes a big joke.

840
01:12:32,193 --> 01:12:34,575
And I don't care to
trade lies for lives.

841
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:36,958
From now on,
I want maximum penalties.

842
01:12:36,993 --> 01:12:38,460
You want? You want?

843
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,462
Why,
you self-appointed dictator!

844
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:42,464
All you know is
force and violence.

845
01:12:42,964 --> 01:12:45,450
You don't understand
the simplest things about the law.

846
01:12:45,485 --> 01:12:47,936
I understand the difference
between a poor, honest judge

847
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:49,638
and a rich, dishonest one.

848
01:12:53,525 --> 01:12:56,027
Tomorrow morning I'll learn
what's in this criminal code book

849
01:12:56,062 --> 01:12:58,495
word for word.

850
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,490
And what you
gotta worry about, Your Honor,

851
01:13:00,525 --> 01:13:02,451
is what part of this
I can use against you.

852
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:28,226
What the hell's going on here?

853
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:30,193
Oh, I read the book,
Your Honor,

854
01:13:30,228 --> 01:13:33,231
and it clearly
states on Page 53, paragraph six,

855
01:13:33,266 --> 01:13:35,150
that the sheriff has
the right to assign

856
01:13:35,185 --> 01:13:37,068
courtrooms and
judges' chambers.

857
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:38,570
In view of your
past judgments,

858
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:40,906
I thought you'd feel
more at home here.

859
01:13:40,941 --> 01:13:43,074
You have your own
choice of seats.

860
01:13:45,744 --> 01:13:47,245
Of course,
there's no telephone yet,

861
01:13:47,746 --> 01:13:49,748
but you won't
need one today.

862
01:13:50,248 --> 01:13:52,250
Here's a list
of search and seizure warrants

863
01:13:52,285 --> 01:13:54,661
that I want by 3:00 today.

864
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:57,003
I'll have your lunch sent in.

865
01:13:57,038 --> 01:13:59,541
Oh, and by the way,
if any word of these warrants,

866
01:13:59,576 --> 01:14:01,508
excuse the expression,
leaks out,

867
01:14:01,543 --> 01:14:03,929
well, your distinguished
career is over.

868
01:14:04,429 --> 01:14:06,897
Page 92, section four.

869
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:10,802
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned!

870
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:25,248
Okay,
the preliminaries are over.

871
01:14:25,283 --> 01:14:27,118
We now all know each other,
we know the problem.

872
01:14:28,453 --> 01:14:29,454
I was elected
sheriff on one issue,

873
01:14:29,955 --> 01:14:31,456
that I bust every joint
in the whole county.

874
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:34,124
And we're gonna
start tomorrow.

875
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:37,162
First off,
I don't want any car, truck,

876
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:38,622
or driver that
even looks like

877
01:14:38,657 --> 01:14:40,048
a moonshiner to
move on our roads.

878
01:14:40,549 --> 01:14:43,426
Lonnie, you and Chris,
you handle Highways 45 and 64.

879
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:46,269
Okay, and I hear
there's four new stills operating.

880
01:14:46,304 --> 01:14:49,808
Two of them up
near Big Mill Road, one in Donald Springs,

881
01:14:49,843 --> 01:14:52,310
and one back up
in Pepper Hill.

882
01:14:52,345 --> 01:14:53,745
Grady, that's your job.

883
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,146
Knock them all flat.

884
01:14:55,647 --> 01:14:57,113
Alone?

885
01:14:57,148 --> 01:14:59,150
Well, now if you was to look
over your shoulders,

886
01:14:59,185 --> 01:15:01,152
it's just likely
you might see me

887
01:15:01,653 --> 01:15:03,989
and four or
five other loggers a-standing there.

888
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:08,410
Okay, the rest of us wait until
the illegal liquor's flowing.

889
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:10,662
The girls are making
their trailer runs,

890
01:15:10,697 --> 01:15:12,414
and the suckers are
crowding the tables.

891
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:14,664
And then we hit
fast and hard.

892
01:15:14,699 --> 01:15:18,335
Obra, you're in charge
of the east half.

893
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:20,872
Virgil, I want you to make
the west half run.

894
01:15:21,373 --> 01:15:22,839
Big job.

895
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:24,543
Well, you're a big man.

896
01:15:25,043 --> 01:15:26,545
This whole thing rests
on one element.

897
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:28,847
Surprise.

898
01:15:55,824 --> 01:15:58,827
? Nobody knows

899
01:15:58,862 --> 01:16:01,830
? The trouble?

900
01:16:06,384 --> 01:16:08,303
I know. We heard.

901
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:15,810
They knew.
God damn it, they knew!

902
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:17,812
Somebody tipped them.

903
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:19,779
We'll try again.
Tomorrow night.

904
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:21,816
No, not till we find out
who and why.

905
01:16:22,317 --> 01:16:25,285
The why is simple, money.

906
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,323
Well, if I find him,
he won't live to spend it.

907
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:31,826
Well, I'm going home.

908
01:16:31,861 --> 01:16:33,793
Good night, Grady.

909
01:16:33,828 --> 01:16:35,830
Good night, Buford.
Go slow.

910
01:16:36,831 --> 01:16:38,333
Take care.

911
01:17:11,733 --> 01:17:12,651
Look here, you dumb...

912
01:17:28,049 --> 01:17:30,051
All right, just what the hell
do you think you're doing, huh?

913
01:17:52,991 --> 01:17:54,492
We can't get
him on the radio.

914
01:17:54,527 --> 01:17:56,459
Every car is out.

915
01:17:56,494 --> 01:17:57,745
He was going straight home.

916
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,962
Well, have they checked 22?

917
01:17:58,997 --> 01:18:00,130
Sometimes he comes
home that way.

918
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:02,167
I'll double back.
I'm going with you

919
01:18:17,515 --> 01:18:18,516
Oh!

920
01:18:21,803 --> 01:18:23,304
Oh.

921
01:18:23,805 --> 01:18:24,806
Honey.

922
01:18:26,808 --> 01:18:28,309
Oh, Buford.

923
01:18:30,278 --> 01:18:31,813
This is 505, emergency!

924
01:18:32,313 --> 01:18:34,257
You get me an ambulance
out to Highway 22

925
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,201
near the old Carlson place.
Double quick.

926
01:18:38,703 --> 01:18:41,706
I'm all right. Don't cry.

927
01:18:54,636 --> 01:18:56,102
What's that for?

928
01:18:56,137 --> 01:18:57,472
Oh, just something
to make you relax.

929
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:00,975
Help you get
your strength back.

930
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:03,812
I don't wanna relax.

931
01:19:06,264 --> 01:19:07,766
You're going to.

932
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:13,236
And while you're doing it,

933
01:19:13,271 --> 01:19:14,773
try to think of
a new profession.

934
01:19:17,192 --> 01:19:19,327
You're not very
good at this one.

935
01:19:19,828 --> 01:19:21,696
I'm learning.

936
01:19:22,197 --> 01:19:22,947
Doc, I'm learning.

937
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,951
Just made a mistake.

938
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:30,872
Tried to fight clean.

939
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,882
Okay, thank you very much.

940
01:19:40,917 --> 01:19:42,383
I appreciate that.

941
01:19:48,389 --> 01:19:49,891
A man just doesn't know
how many friends he's got

942
01:19:50,391 --> 01:19:51,276
until he's flat on his back.

943
01:19:53,228 --> 01:19:54,529
Or how many people
are glad that he is?

944
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:59,415
See, Grady,
see these stacks of cards?

945
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:02,954
There's even one over there
from Augie McCullough.

946
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:05,371
I didn't know he could write.

947
01:20:05,406 --> 01:20:08,409
Yeah, I got these chocolates
from all the girls,

948
01:20:08,444 --> 01:20:10,411
and Tennessee sipping whiskey
from Callie,

949
01:20:10,912 --> 01:20:12,413
and these dollar cigars
from Willie Rae.

950
01:20:12,914 --> 01:20:14,415
Look at that.
This is from the Lucky Spot.

951
01:20:16,918 --> 01:20:18,169
Rolls seven every time.

952
01:20:20,555 --> 01:20:22,056
You see these flowers?

953
01:20:22,091 --> 01:20:23,523
You see this big bunch?

954
01:20:23,558 --> 01:20:26,060
You know where
that come from?

955
01:20:26,095 --> 01:20:28,563
Nashville.
Mr. Witter, no less.

956
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:32,708
Grady, grab yourself
a big handful of cigars.

957
01:20:32,743 --> 01:20:35,353
Pauline, get him
a couple of those bottles

958
01:20:35,388 --> 01:20:37,322
and mix him up
a big highball, huh?

959
01:20:37,822 --> 01:20:39,657
No, thanks,
I don't want anything!

960
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:42,110
Why not?

961
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:47,080
Grady,
it's the fruit of our labor.

962
01:20:47,115 --> 01:20:50,535
You're afraid you're gonna get
corrupted again.

963
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,620
Are you going on the take,
Buford?

964
01:20:54,122 --> 01:20:55,456
I sure am.

965
01:20:56,374 --> 01:20:57,675
Well, in that case...

966
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:01,596
Yes, sir, Grady.

967
01:21:02,096 --> 01:21:05,216
I'm gonna take
and take and take!

968
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:11,556
Till they ain't
got nothing to give but blood!

969
01:21:12,056 --> 01:21:14,559
And I'm gonna take that
one drop at a time.

970
01:21:19,063 --> 01:21:21,149
And I'm gonna start
with that informer.

971
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,450
You know who he is?

972
01:21:24,485 --> 01:21:26,953
Yeah, a little bird
just told me.

973
01:21:26,988 --> 01:21:30,957
I'm gonna go after him
with my bare hands.

974
01:21:30,992 --> 01:21:33,328
Grady, we could have had
the whole county in one night

975
01:21:33,363 --> 01:21:35,246
if he hadn't...

976
01:21:44,756 --> 01:21:47,724
I don't know, Grady.

977
01:21:47,759 --> 01:21:50,762
He's been like that
ever since the shooting.

978
01:21:52,263 --> 01:21:55,767
Smoking their cigars,
drinking their whiskey,

979
01:21:55,802 --> 01:21:57,734
smelling the flowers.

980
01:21:57,769 --> 01:22:00,021
Just reminding himself
how much he hates them,

981
01:22:00,056 --> 01:22:02,238
and then he works himself up
into that rage.

982
01:22:02,273 --> 01:22:04,942
Well, Pauline, he seems
like he's earned the right.

983
01:22:04,977 --> 01:22:07,612
But it's gone beyond reason.
It's a kind of madness.

984
01:22:08,112 --> 01:22:09,614
Well, maybe that's gonna
be what's required,

985
01:22:10,114 --> 01:22:12,116
a kind of madness
to clean out that snake pit.

986
01:22:12,617 --> 01:22:14,502
That and this.

987
01:22:14,537 --> 01:22:15,837
No!

988
01:22:16,788 --> 01:22:18,790
You heard him, Pauline.

989
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:20,792
He said "bare hands. "

990
01:22:22,293 --> 01:22:24,844
They are no match for guns.

991
01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:27,181
Grady, you know how
I feel about them.

992
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:29,050
Mmm-hmm.

993
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:32,769
So does Buford,

994
01:22:32,804 --> 01:22:35,807
well, he's just never gonna put
one on unless you say,

995
01:22:35,842 --> 01:22:37,273
"It's all right. "

996
01:22:37,308 --> 01:22:40,276
Well, you're just
gonna have to decide.

997
01:22:40,311 --> 01:22:44,315
If you wanna spend your
old age with your fear,

998
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:46,317
or with your husband.

999
01:23:13,644 --> 01:23:16,230
I see we all had a nice,
long vacation with pay.

1000
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:20,199
Now we're gonna
go back to the war.

1001
01:23:20,234 --> 01:23:22,570
We're gonna take up
exactly where we left off,

1002
01:23:22,605 --> 01:23:24,072
only this time we're
not gonna separate.

1003
01:23:24,572 --> 01:23:28,159
We're gonna hit them as a team,
everywhere in force.

1004
01:23:28,194 --> 01:23:29,160
Any questions?

1005
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:31,279
I'd like to call home
to tell them I'll be late.

1006
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:33,514
No calls,
no radio communications

1007
01:23:33,549 --> 01:23:35,249
and nobody gets
out of my sight.

1008
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,251
Okay,
we'll start with the stills.

1009
01:23:37,752 --> 01:23:38,703
Follow me.

1010
01:23:48,546 --> 01:23:50,013
Virgil?
Hmm?

1011
01:23:50,048 --> 01:23:52,050
I don't like the way the dynamite
charges are wired.

1012
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:54,052
They don't look
right to me.

1013
01:23:54,552 --> 01:23:55,518
I don't see nothing
wrong with them.

1014
01:23:55,553 --> 01:23:58,556
Well, you're new at this.
Come on, let's go check them.

1015
01:24:02,693 --> 01:24:04,195
Virgil?

1016
01:24:05,696 --> 01:24:06,614
Hey?

1017
01:24:07,115 --> 01:24:08,116
No!

1018
01:24:12,203 --> 01:24:13,621
Buford,
what's wrong with you?

1019
01:24:19,127 --> 01:24:20,912
No! Don't!

1020
01:24:36,677 --> 01:24:37,977
Buford, no!

1021
01:24:38,012 --> 01:24:40,982
Get away from me!
I know what I'm doing!

1022
01:24:41,017 --> 01:24:43,185
Buford,
don't, for God's sake!

1023
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,353
No, Buford, don't do it!
Don't!

1024
01:24:45,388 --> 01:24:46,487
Tell them, Virgil.

1025
01:24:46,522 --> 01:24:48,489
Don't... No.

1026
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:52,959
No, Buford, don't do it!
Don't!

1027
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,745
Don't run, Virgil,
you'll never make it.

1028
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,412
Don't do it!

1029
01:24:56,447 --> 01:24:57,949
For God's sake!
All right, tell them, Virgil.

1030
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,415
No.

1031
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:00,952
Tell everybody
who tipped them off!

1032
01:25:01,953 --> 01:25:03,252
Tell them, Virgil!

1033
01:25:03,287 --> 01:25:05,289
Tell them how they knew
I took the back way home at night.

1034
01:25:05,324 --> 01:25:07,208
No, Buford, don't.
You tell them!

1035
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:10,176
Okay!

1036
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:12,004
Okay, it was me, okay?

1037
01:25:12,039 --> 01:25:13,798
But they made me do it.

1038
01:25:14,298 --> 01:25:15,925
Get down on
your knees, Virgil.

1039
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,552
I didn't do it!
Get on your knees!

1040
01:25:17,587 --> 01:25:18,684
Oh, no, Buford.

1041
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,055
That's cold-blooded murderer,
you can't do it.

1042
01:25:21,472 --> 01:25:23,207
Buford, Buford, don't!

1043
01:25:23,242 --> 01:25:25,235
Come on, Virgil. Crawl.

1044
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:27,193
Oh, no, Buford, no!

1045
01:25:27,228 --> 01:25:29,563
Okay, Virgil, crawl to me!

1046
01:25:29,598 --> 01:25:31,749
Crawl over here! Faster!

1047
01:25:31,784 --> 01:25:33,901
You ain't got much time!

1048
01:25:33,936 --> 01:25:35,418
Come on, faster.

1049
01:25:35,453 --> 01:25:36,869
You ain't got
much time, Virgil!

1050
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:38,406
Virgil, crawl,
you ain't got much time.

1051
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:40,074
Buford, don't!
Faster!

1052
01:25:50,251 --> 01:25:50,968
Stand up.

1053
01:25:55,473 --> 01:25:56,340
Get up!

1054
01:26:26,837 --> 01:26:28,339
You walk home.

1055
01:26:34,178 --> 01:26:35,680
Git!

1056
01:26:51,946 --> 01:26:52,947
Stick them up.
Outside.

1057
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:54,914
Stick them up.

1058
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:56,951
You're under arrest.

1059
01:26:59,453 --> 01:27:00,920
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

1060
01:27:00,955 --> 01:27:02,957
All right, Callie, let's go
for a walk. Come on.

1061
01:27:02,992 --> 01:27:04,959
I wanna talk to you.
Get your hands off her!

1062
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:10,164
All right, come on,
come on, come on!

1063
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:15,970
All right, Callie, you got the key.
Open it up.

1064
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,436
You got a warrant?

1065
01:27:17,471 --> 01:27:18,973
Yeah, I keep it in my shoe.

1066
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:27,515
Get them in.
Get them all. Come on.

1067
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,987
He knew exactly where everything
was and when to hit.

1068
01:27:35,022 --> 01:27:37,858
I tell you, he's got someone
down here working from the inside.

1069
01:27:37,893 --> 01:27:40,361
Yeah, but not from my group.

1070
01:27:40,396 --> 01:27:41,961
My people are solid.

1071
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:45,499
Oh, your people
are real solid!

1072
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,967
Like that bunch
you sent over from Alabama?

1073
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:50,871
Couldn't even put him away
when they were two feet from him.

1074
01:27:50,906 --> 01:27:52,838
That really
started something.

1075
01:27:52,873 --> 01:27:55,209
What the hell help
you and Prentiss been?

1076
01:27:55,244 --> 01:27:56,210
Those tramps and
that pimp of yours

1077
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:58,713
have been robbing everybody passed
through town.

1078
01:27:58,748 --> 01:27:59,714
You better get off it, Augie.

1079
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:04,518
You run your store.
I'll run mine.

1080
01:28:06,937 --> 01:28:09,440
I talked to
Witter this morning.

1081
01:28:09,475 --> 01:28:11,907
He said to put him away.

1082
01:28:11,942 --> 01:28:13,444
Believe me, I'll take care
of that son of a bitch.

1083
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:15,411
I don't care what it costs.

1084
01:28:15,446 --> 01:28:17,448
And I wanna.
tell you something

1085
01:28:19,367 --> 01:28:21,834
I've operated down
here for 20 years.

1086
01:28:21,869 --> 01:28:24,253
Before you was even
one of the girls, Callie.

1087
01:28:24,288 --> 01:28:26,991
Now you get this straight,
you're not running my show.

1088
01:28:27,026 --> 01:28:28,457
If I want to do any killing,

1089
01:28:28,492 --> 01:28:31,495
I'll do it without
a board meeting!

1090
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:33,262
Count me out.

1091
01:28:33,297 --> 01:28:35,299
Augie...
Lay off, Jaggers!

1092
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:38,803
Why do you wanna bring in
an outsider to do a job

1093
01:28:38,838 --> 01:28:41,270
I've done half a dozen times?

1094
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:43,891
You also did four years
for the last one.

1095
01:28:44,392 --> 01:28:46,394
But the guy's still dead.

1096
01:28:55,569 --> 01:28:56,070
Pa!

1097
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,777
Just stay now.

1098
01:29:37,812 --> 01:29:40,314
Everybody just stay with me.
All right?

1099
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:43,150
Buford?

1100
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:48,754
Dad!

1101
01:29:48,789 --> 01:29:52,293
They killed Shep! Oh!

1102
01:29:53,577 --> 01:29:54,543
It's all right.

1103
01:29:54,578 --> 01:29:57,081
Mama, they killed Shep!

1104
01:30:24,775 --> 01:30:27,278
Buford? Geez, I've been
trying to reach you for over an hour.

1105
01:30:27,313 --> 01:30:30,281
Listen, Prentiss has Margie Ann
in Callie's trailer.

1106
01:30:30,316 --> 01:30:32,283
She used to be
one of Grady's playmates,

1107
01:30:32,318 --> 01:30:33,802
so they figure
she's your informer.

1108
01:30:33,837 --> 01:30:35,286
You gotta get over
there quick, Buford.

1109
01:30:35,413 --> 01:30:36,454
Please!

1110
01:31:18,078 --> 01:31:20,748
Go ahead!
Give me an excuse! Go on!

1111
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:23,968
Sit!

1112
01:31:39,316 --> 01:31:40,818
Stay!

1113
01:31:55,332 --> 01:31:57,299
Get up, pretty boy.

1114
01:31:57,334 --> 01:32:00,838
Come on, get up.
Come on, get up!

1115
01:32:00,873 --> 01:32:02,423
Let's go. Come on!

1116
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:09,930
Mister, you got
a right to a phone call.

1117
01:32:12,433 --> 01:32:14,435
You hear me, mister?

1118
01:32:14,935 --> 01:32:15,901
Stop that!

1119
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:18,247
You got a right to
make one phone call.

1120
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:20,558
You bastard,
you're gonna kill him!

1121
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,563
You got a right not to make
a statement without a lawyer.

1122
01:32:25,598 --> 01:32:26,612
Stop it!

1123
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:28,649
Buford!
I'll get you for this.

1124
01:32:28,684 --> 01:32:29,783
Come on up.

1125
01:32:33,287 --> 01:32:35,789
You're under arrest
for white slavery,

1126
01:32:35,824 --> 01:32:38,534
for assault and battery,
for kidnapping

1127
01:32:38,569 --> 01:32:41,245
and any other
goddamn thing I think of!

1128
01:32:43,163 --> 01:32:47,668
Get up. Get up. Get up!

1129
01:32:47,703 --> 01:32:49,169
Come on, Callie!

1130
01:33:05,519 --> 01:33:06,937
It's payday.

1131
01:33:07,438 --> 01:33:09,023
Payday?

1132
01:33:13,527 --> 01:33:15,162
A gift from me to you.

1133
01:33:18,949 --> 01:33:20,451
All warrants and
charges against you

1134
01:33:20,951 --> 01:33:22,536
have been taken
off the books.

1135
01:33:26,674 --> 01:33:29,677
Luan, I don't know why you
risked your life to help me,

1136
01:33:29,712 --> 01:33:31,629
but I appreciate it.

1137
01:33:32,129 --> 01:33:34,597
Let's just say
I have a soft spot

1138
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:38,636
for big, strong,
good-looking ex-Marines.

1139
01:33:39,637 --> 01:33:41,639
My husband would
have been an ex,

1140
01:33:42,139 --> 01:33:44,224
but he didn't
live through Vietnam.

1141
01:33:48,228 --> 01:33:49,480
I'm sorry.

1142
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:55,618
Luan, you gotta
get out of town now.

1143
01:33:55,653 --> 01:33:57,571
You gotta go far away
and get a new job...

1144
01:33:57,606 --> 01:33:59,073
Not that kind of job.

1145
01:33:59,108 --> 01:34:00,074
With what?

1146
01:34:04,244 --> 01:34:06,438
Special funds account.

1147
01:34:06,473 --> 01:34:08,597
From your piggy bank?

1148
01:34:08,632 --> 01:34:11,969
No, it's from the dice table
at the Lucky Spot.

1149
01:34:14,805 --> 01:34:16,724
I wish I could
do more, but...

1150
01:34:16,759 --> 01:34:19,191
So do I,

1151
01:34:19,226 --> 01:34:23,480
but then you wouldn't be the kind
of man that you are, would you?

1152
01:34:42,616 --> 01:34:45,619
I think I better take you
to the bus station.

1153
01:34:47,121 --> 01:34:48,122
Thanks.

1154
01:35:11,445 --> 01:35:13,338
Michael, put it down.

1155
01:35:13,373 --> 01:35:14,953
Wonder what it is.

1156
01:35:14,988 --> 01:35:16,533
Yes, I wonder.

1157
01:35:21,038 --> 01:35:23,540
Merry Christmas.

1158
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:26,543
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1159
01:35:26,578 --> 01:35:28,829
Look in the basket!

1160
01:35:28,864 --> 01:35:31,046
Grandma! A little dog!

1161
01:35:31,081 --> 01:35:33,584
Yeah.
Santa Claus bring this, huh?

1162
01:35:35,085 --> 01:35:37,070
Yeah, what do you know?

1163
01:35:37,105 --> 01:35:38,973
Oh, thank you, Grandma.

1164
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,841
You're very welcome.

1165
01:35:41,675 --> 01:35:43,177
Son, go out in the car.

1166
01:35:43,677 --> 01:35:44,678
Bring in
the turkey and the pies.

1167
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:48,182
And, mind you, be sure you keep
the turkey covered.

1168
01:35:48,217 --> 01:35:50,184
Oh, my darling.
Oh, darling.

1169
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:52,186
Merry Christmas!

1170
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:53,152
Oh!

1171
01:35:53,187 --> 01:35:54,188
Do you like it?

1172
01:35:54,688 --> 01:35:56,155
Beautiful.

1173
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:58,492
It only took us two days.

1174
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,502
Merry Christmas! Hi.

1175
01:36:12,506 --> 01:36:14,473
Hi, George.

1176
01:36:14,508 --> 01:36:16,460
The place is swinging tonight.
Sure is.

1177
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:17,961
Hey, where's Prentiss?

1178
01:36:17,996 --> 01:36:18,927
Oh, he's still in the can.

1179
01:36:18,962 --> 01:36:20,464
They're holding
him without bail.

1180
01:36:20,499 --> 01:36:22,466
Oh, that's too bad.

1181
01:36:30,474 --> 01:36:33,226
Ho, ho, ho, and a Merry Christmas,
Callie.

1182
01:36:33,261 --> 01:36:35,979
This watch was made
for a woman like you

1183
01:36:36,014 --> 01:36:38,447
with elegance and good taste.

1184
01:36:38,482 --> 01:36:42,786
Haven't you heard, Sheldon,
we're in the middle of a depression.

1185
01:36:42,821 --> 01:36:45,370
Everybody needs
a good watch, Callie.

1186
01:36:45,405 --> 01:36:48,909
All it's good for is to remind me
I'm sitting here on my ass

1187
01:36:48,944 --> 01:36:51,378
losing money
every time it ticks.

1188
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,883
And I'm getting
goddamned mad about it.

1189
01:36:58,385 --> 01:36:59,968
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1190
01:37:00,003 --> 01:37:02,506
George, set them up on me,
will you?

1191
01:37:03,006 --> 01:37:05,008
I'll be sitting over there.

1192
01:37:05,043 --> 01:37:07,010
Girls, drinks are on Sheldon.

1193
01:37:07,045 --> 01:37:08,512
Merry Christmas.

1194
01:37:09,012 --> 01:37:11,014
Cindy, how are you?

1195
01:37:12,516 --> 01:37:14,476
I got some
beautiful things here.

1196
01:37:14,511 --> 01:37:16,436
I can show you
a beautiful watch.

1197
01:37:18,438 --> 01:37:19,356
George.

1198
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:56,610
Buford, I've got a Mr. Sheldon Levine
down here, jewelry salesman.

1199
01:37:56,645 --> 01:37:59,005
He claims some
$60,000 in jewelry

1200
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,365
was heisted from
the trunk of his car

1201
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,700
over at the Pine Ridge Club.

1202
01:38:03,735 --> 01:38:05,202
Okay, I'll meet you.

1203
01:38:08,705 --> 01:38:11,875
Don't open
the presents till I get back.

1204
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:14,343
Oh, Buford,
not Christmas Eve.

1205
01:38:14,378 --> 01:38:17,247
Oh,it's just a little burglary.
It won't take long. Come on.

1206
01:38:17,748 --> 01:38:20,133
I'll be right back
. Don't worry, Mama.

1207
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:05,262
Yeah,
keep them coming, George.

1208
01:39:07,264 --> 01:39:09,216
Merry Christmas, Callie!

1209
01:39:09,716 --> 01:39:11,885
Santa Claus is on his way.

1210
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:20,394
Merry Christmas, Suzanne.
Merry Christmas, George.

1211
01:39:20,429 --> 01:39:21,895
What do you want, honey?
It's from the house.

1212
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:23,647
Something strong.

1213
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,581
Merry Christmas.

1214
01:39:41,616 --> 01:39:42,547
Yeah.

1215
01:39:42,582 --> 01:39:43,548
Sheriff Pusser.

1216
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:45,635
Sheldon Levine, sir.

1217
01:41:16,259 --> 01:41:17,761
I heard.

1218
01:41:24,267 --> 01:41:25,769
Merry Christmas.

1219
01:42:48,768 --> 01:42:50,869
Mike caught a fish already.

1220
01:42:50,904 --> 01:42:52,906
He always gets
everything first.

1221
01:42:52,941 --> 01:42:55,408
Patience, honey.
Patience.

1222
01:43:01,665 --> 01:43:06,670
We could have a lot more days like this
if you weren't the sheriff.

1223
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:10,173
Well, maybe in a small way
my being sheriff lets

1224
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:12,125
a lot of people
have days like this.

1225
01:43:12,626 --> 01:43:13,627
Small way?

1226
01:43:15,629 --> 01:43:18,597
You gambled your life.

1227
01:43:18,632 --> 01:43:21,801
And no one has come
to say thank you.

1228
01:43:21,836 --> 01:43:23,768
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

1229
01:43:23,803 --> 01:43:25,805
Maybe nobody really
does give a damn.

1230
01:43:28,308 --> 01:43:30,752
You know,
I'm beginning to realize this job's

1231
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,196
a lot more important
than I first thought.

1232
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,202
I'm proud of you, Buford.

1233
01:43:41,705 --> 01:43:43,790
And I'm not so
scared anymore.

1234
01:44:01,641 --> 01:44:03,643
I'm gonna drown them kids.

1235
01:44:03,678 --> 01:44:05,645
Buford, come on, don't!

1236
01:44:12,736 --> 01:44:14,237
Hello.

1237
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,241
Who's this?

1238
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:31,720
Ellie Mae,
this is the sheriff.

1239
01:44:31,755 --> 01:44:35,258
You have any idea where that call
came from just now?

1240
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:39,045
How many parties
on that line?

1241
01:44:41,047 --> 01:44:42,549
Thank you.

1242
01:44:47,771 --> 01:44:49,189
Who was that?

1243
01:44:53,193 --> 01:44:57,162
Oh. A party line
down at Donald Springs.

1244
01:44:57,197 --> 01:45:01,201
Some neighbor overheard of a plan
to set up a new still.

1245
01:45:01,236 --> 01:45:04,029
I gotta go down and read
the riot act to them.

1246
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:06,823
It's gonna be a lot of work
tearing it down.

1247
01:45:07,324 --> 01:45:08,325
You go back to sleep.

1248
01:45:15,332 --> 01:45:16,833
Buford, I'm going with you.

1249
01:45:16,868 --> 01:45:18,335
What'd you say?

1250
01:45:19,336 --> 01:45:20,302
I'm wide awake.

1251
01:45:20,337 --> 01:45:22,137
Grandma gets up early.

1252
01:45:22,172 --> 01:45:24,606
She'll take care of the kids.

1253
01:45:24,641 --> 01:45:27,927
I think it's time I found out how
my husband earns his living.

1254
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,022
I'm hurrying!

1255
01:45:40,523 --> 01:45:43,026
You're like a breath of spring.

1256
01:45:57,957 --> 01:45:59,208
It's probably
just a false alarm.

1257
01:45:59,243 --> 01:46:00,460
We'll probably
end up just taking

1258
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,927
a nice, long,
early morning drive.

1259
01:46:02,962 --> 01:46:06,466
Good, you can buy me breakfast
on the way back.

1260
01:46:16,893 --> 01:46:19,896
Oh, Buford,
it's such a beautiful day!

1261
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:24,617
Hey, thank you
for taking me along.

1262
01:46:27,237 --> 01:46:29,489
Come here,
I wanna talk to yo u a second.

1263
01:46:29,524 --> 01:46:32,492
No, you're driving.
Come here.

1264
01:46:32,527 --> 01:46:34,461
I know where I'm going.

1265
01:46:45,388 --> 01:46:47,390
Come here, I want to give you a kiss.
No!

1266
01:46:47,425 --> 01:46:48,975
Give me a good kiss.
Come on.

1267
01:47:22,926 --> 01:47:24,427
Pauline?

1268
01:47:24,928 --> 01:47:26,895
501, it's an emergency!

1269
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:28,897
Yeah, Buford, Grady here.

1270
01:47:28,932 --> 01:47:30,934
Better get me an ambulance
about half a mile up Pike Creek Road

1271
01:47:31,434 --> 01:47:32,400
past the church.

1272
01:47:32,435 --> 01:47:34,687
Hurry up, it's an emergency!
I'm out in a field.

1273
01:47:34,722 --> 01:47:36,139
We're coming, Buford!

1274
01:47:36,174 --> 01:47:37,140
Pauline.

1275
01:47:39,142 --> 01:47:40,143
Pauline.

1276
01:47:51,154 --> 01:47:55,658
Oh, please, God, no! No.

1277
01:47:55,693 --> 01:47:57,953
Pauline, Pauline.

1278
01:47:57,988 --> 01:48:00,213
Don't let her die!

1279
01:48:03,216 --> 01:48:05,502
Pauline...

1280
01:49:00,139 --> 01:49:01,641
Keep that road clear!

1281
01:49:02,141 --> 01:49:03,793
Keep it clear!
Get that traffic back!

1282
01:49:03,828 --> 01:49:05,445
Hold the traffic!
Hold the traffic!

1283
01:49:05,945 --> 01:49:07,028
Hold the traffic down there!

1284
01:49:07,063 --> 01:49:10,366
For the love of God, get that
stretcher over here now, quick!

1285
01:50:58,174 --> 01:51:02,178
Obra, come on, let it go!

1286
01:51:05,765 --> 01:51:08,768
Dr. Ward, go to 561 west.

1287
01:51:09,769 --> 01:51:12,155
Dr. Ward, 561 west, please.

1288
01:51:25,585 --> 01:51:27,218
- Get out!
- Wait a minute.

1289
01:51:27,253 --> 01:51:29,021
Get out of here!
Keep those people out!

1290
01:51:29,056 --> 01:51:30,790
Let's go. Step back.
Move over, please.

1291
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:32,291
Let's go.

1292
01:51:36,295 --> 01:51:40,466
Grady, the governor has turned over
his entire investigating staff

1293
01:51:40,501 --> 01:51:42,969
to work on this case.
Shall we start?

1294
01:51:43,469 --> 01:51:46,472
You're all a little late,
aren't you?

1295
01:51:48,975 --> 01:51:51,978
I'll take you out
to where he was ambushed.

1296
01:53:23,653 --> 01:53:27,156
We picked up over
125 shells on the road.

1297
01:53:27,191 --> 01:53:29,292
How many men
were in the cars?

1298
01:53:33,212 --> 01:53:35,715
Surely you recognized one
or two of them.

1299
01:53:38,551 --> 01:53:40,970
Everybody in the capital
isn't on the take.

1300
01:53:41,971 --> 01:53:43,472
We only want to help.

1301
01:53:45,474 --> 01:53:47,176
Don't you trust us?

1302
01:54:02,325 --> 01:54:04,527
Do you know who
they are, Buford?

1303
01:56:52,661 --> 01:56:53,662
Dad.

1304
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,382
Mike...

1305
01:58:41,604 --> 01:58:43,606
Big stick.

1306
01:59:21,143 --> 01:59:22,645
Here you go.

1307
02:01:20,796 --> 02:01:24,683
Come on, Buford,
let's get on back to the hospital.

1308
02:01:26,468 --> 02:01:28,018
Please.

1309
02:01:28,053 --> 02:01:30,556
We'll get
the rest of them, Buford.

1310
02:01:32,057 --> 02:01:33,774
Every last one of them.

1311
02:01:33,809 --> 02:01:37,146
I swear we will, Buford.
Come on.

1312
02:02:33,168 --> 02:02:39,041
The world's begun
to look her age

1313
02:02:39,541 --> 02:02:44,546
I'll tell you why
she's lined and gray

1314
02:02:44,581 --> 02:02:50,135
We read of hate
on every page

1315
02:02:50,636 --> 02:02:55,524
Then turn our backs
and walk away

1316
02:02:56,358 --> 02:03:01,822
Why can't we stand

1317
02:03:01,857 --> 02:03:07,286
Joined hand to hand?

1318
02:03:07,786 --> 02:03:13,458
It's time to care

1319
02:03:13,493 --> 02:03:18,898
We dare not wait

1320
02:03:18,933 --> 02:03:24,053
And watch too long

1321
02:03:24,088 --> 02:03:29,174
Become too late

1322
02:03:29,675 --> 02:03:35,122
There's so much
hatred all around

1323
02:03:35,157 --> 02:03:40,534
Let's end it now
or it will roam

1324
02:03:40,569 --> 02:03:46,191
There's lots of heroes
in the ground

1325
02:03:46,226 --> 02:03:52,281
But not enough
are in the home

1326
02:03:52,316 --> 02:03:57,912
Let's start again

1327
02:03:57,947 --> 02:04:03,981
Don't say, "Amen"

1328
02:04:04,016 --> 02:04:10,015
Open your eyes

1329
02:04:10,516 --> 02:04:15,354
And lift your head

1330
02:04:15,389 --> 02:04:20,626
Let's help to right

1331
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:26,265
The wrongs we bred

1332
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:31,587
Let us pray loudly

1333
02:04:31,622 --> 02:04:37,226
Let us live proudly

1334
02:04:37,261 --> 02:04:43,491
And soon we'll all

1335
02:04:43,526 --> 02:04:49,721
Be walking tall

1336
02:04:50,721 --> 02:05:00,721
