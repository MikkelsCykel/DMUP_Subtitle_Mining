164
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,037
You live with that guy?

165
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,540
- Yeah. We only just moved in.

166
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,458
- How do you like it?

167
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,709
- I like it.

168
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,879
My husband's not so sure.

169
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,465
- What's your major?

170
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,384
- Accounting.

171
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,969
- Ah.

172
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,137
- I always thought
I'd do something in music.

173
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,722
I took lessons as a kid.

174
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,934
But got to earn a living,
you know?

175
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,853
- People don't earn a living
with music?

176
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,401
- I'm just looking
for a part-time job

177
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,735
to help with tuition.

178
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,822
I'm a serious person,
and I'm very hardworking.

179
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,907
I could do anything.

180
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,826
- What do you play?

181
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,454
- I play piano,
but we don't have one right now,

182
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,916
so I'm actually learning guitar.

183
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,668
- Cool.

184
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,837
Well, start when you want.

185
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,005
- Really?

186
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,299
- Hey, it's not my hotel.
What do I care?

187
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,387
- Thank you.

188
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,265
- So I see this very pretty girl
comin' out of 213.

189
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,434
- Yeah. Shana.
Married.

190
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,768
- Right, Shana.

191
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,478
How'd you know that?

192
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,772
- Little early for whiskey,
don't you think?

193
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,566
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

194
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,651
- I've spoken with her
a couple times in the hallway.

195
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,111
They just moved in.

196
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,697
- Anyhow, I see her
saying good-bye to the guy,

197
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,698
the husband.

198
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,866
- Yeah?

199
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,284
- Next thing I know,
she's on the bus.

200
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,411
Then she's at the hotel,
wanting a job.

201
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,830
- I suppose you think that's all
just coincidence, right?

202
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,250
- Well, yeah, Chris.
Why else would I be telling you?

203
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,169
What else would it be?

204
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,588
- Why can't you just accept
that things have meaning, Gavin?

205
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,715
- [Scoffs]
Meaning.

206
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,592
What possible meaning
could that have?

207
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,968
- Connections.
Destiny.

208
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,596
- She's married.

209
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,056
Where's the destiny in that?

210
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,891
- Why do you always
have to be so rational?

211
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,684
- Why is it wrong
to be rational?

212
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,063
- Okay, we're gonna get
into a fight.

213
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,398
- So how was your week?

214
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,985
- Full of light.
- Fuck off.

215

[Knock at door]

216

Both:
Hi.

- Hey.

218
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,826
- My wife tells me
you're her new boss.

219
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,994
- Yeah.

220
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,871
Well, sort of.

221
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,581

How's it goin'?

This is Chris.

Both:
Hi.

227

- How are you, Shana?

- I'm good, thank you.

229

- You guys want to come in
for a beer, sandwich?

230
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,680
- Uh, no, thank you.

231
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,515
Actually, we wanted
to invite you guys

232

over for dinner
some night.

233
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,518
- Great.
Any night but Fridays.

234
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,228
- How about Wednesday?

235
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,605
- Good.
- Sure. Why not?

236
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,731
Can you email directions?

237
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,486
- 7:00?

238
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,031
- Fine.
Lookin' forward to it.

239
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,325

Reservations: Selena,

248
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,763
the most inhospitable

Probably responsible for 50%
of the empty rooms in the hotel.

Right, Selena?

252
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,938

We all feel much safer
knowing he's asleep in here.

257
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,075
So I don't have any room service
slots available yet,

258
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,952
but you can do
some housekeeping shifts,

259
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,746
and then I'll switch you over.

260
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,330
I'll assign you your own floor.

261
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,874
That way, I can tell
from the complaints

262
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,251
if it's you
who's screwing things up.

Consuela, this is Shana.

That's very nice of you.

- So what's your sacred object
gonna be?

297

- Um, a teddy bear.

298

- Wow, that's pretty radical,
Shana.

299
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,664
Harper's going
in a whole different direction-

300
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,792
- It's more complicated
than you think.

301
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,293
It's a good essay.

302
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,630
- Oh, I'm sure it is.

303
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,054
- Maybe you could critique it.

304
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,597
You're good at that, right?

305
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,936
- So who else
is gonna get lubed?

306

- We don't drink.

307
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,188
- Oh.

308
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,399

- Uh, no, thanks.

311
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,279
I'll take a water, though.

312
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,573
- Glass of water, Shana.

313
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,584
- So what do you do, Joe?

314
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,627
- I work at the oil refinery.

315

And you?

317
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,718
- I'm in TV.
I'm an editor.

318
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,386
Yeah, right now,
I'm working on a show

319
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,054
about the long-term
psychological effects

320
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,598
of disaster.

321
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,099
- Okay.

322
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,809
- Oh.

323
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,232
- So you guys want to watch
the game here tonight?

324
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,568
- Oh, no,
thank you.

325
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,403
- No?
You don't like baseball?

326
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,907
- It's okay, I guess.

327
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,825

- What are you doing back?

496
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,470

- Yeah.

whose kids they are!

Sorry about the other night.

You can hate me
for that instead.

that God might not exist?

- Okay.
Philosophy, Wednesday night.

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,209
- Sure.

555
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,849
- So how's the gay lifestyle
treating you?

556
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,726
- Fine.

557
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,478
How's the hetero lifestyle
treating you?

558
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,190
- You ever been married?

559
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,567
- Yeah.

560
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,777
But something tells me
the problems I had

561
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,612
are not the problems
you're having.

562
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,115
- What do you think
the problems I'm having are?

563
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,077
- Appreciating
someone's kindness

564
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,289
isn't necessarily the same thing
as being in love.

565
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,294
- Man, you have a big mouth.

566
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,381
- Sorry.

567
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,680
- Have you ever seen
a happy marriage?

568
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,849
I mean, really happy?

569
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,601
- I have to say,

570
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,437
for the first few years of my
marriage, I was very happy.

571
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,356
- And what happened?

572
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,109
- And then she left me.

573
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,195
- When was this?

574
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,072
- Two years ago.

575
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,742
- Boy, you sure take your time
to recover, don't you?

576
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,622
- You know what, Shana?
You're right.

577
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,582
Way too long.

578
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,542
But if you do
the charitable thing here

579
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,128
and start having sex with me
on a regular basis,

580
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,297
pretty sure
I'd start healing right away.

581
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,594
You have a very sexy mouth.

582
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,766
- A very sexy married mouth.

583
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,562
- That's right.
I forgot.

584
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,823
You see, the trick,
I figured,

585
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,158
having been on the receiving end
of such a thing,

586
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,327
was just to open the door.

587
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,539
After that, if she had
the slightest interest,

588
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:30,335
well, next time
her husband's cold to her,

589
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,462
couple of thoughts blow in.

590
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:37,425
Pretty soon, what blows in
is more than just nice.

591
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,219
It's perfect.

592
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,762
I mean, why wouldn't it be?

593
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,015
It's in her head.

594
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,477
She thinks, "What's the harm
in just thinking about this

595
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,938
if it makes me feel good?"

596
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,024
And then it's,
"Well, what's the harm

597
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,819
in just thinking about this
and coming?"

598
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,824
And so she comes.

599
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,828
Well, that takes care of that.

600
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,413
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

601
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,876
- What a relief.
Never again.

602
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,294
- The cantaloupe looks great.

603
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,713
- Trouble is,
a connection's been made.

604
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,215
She remembers it vividly.

605
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:21,720
I kissed her lips.
I was inside her.

606
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,264
Maybe I even said I loved her.

607
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,726
- Hey.
- Hi.

608
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:33,565
- So look what we got
from a single remark.

609
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,234
Now we add in something else.

610
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,278
Look, I'm embarrassed.

611
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,406
What I said the other day
was totally out of line.

612
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,700
I'm really sorry, okay?

613
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,536
- It's okay.

614
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,205
- It's not, really.

615
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,040
I've never done that before
with an employee,

616
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,709
and I won't do it again, okay?

617
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,464
- You're forgiven.

618
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,549
- Abandonment-

619
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,676
clearly a big issue for her.

620
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,470
"What, I haven't even had
the guy for real,

621
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,223
and now he's slamming the door
in my face?"

622
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,897
I know.

623
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:18,068
But don't hate me yet,
trust me.

624
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,362
I got mine coming.

625
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,492
- Now, let me ask you.

626
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,868
You ever look around

627
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,996
and the world just seems
empty to you?

628
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,166
- Oh, yeah.

629
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,376
- Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe

630
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,086
it's because
you don't have God in your life?

631
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,005
- No.

632
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,465
- Never?

633
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,303
- Look, Joe, when I was a kid,

634
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,972
I totally believed in God.

635
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,307
But, you know, you grow up.

636
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,643
Well, I did.

637
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,686
I looked around.

638
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,104
I said,
"Santa Claus: No evidence.

639
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,648
"The tooth fairy: No evidence.

640
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,733
"God, the same thing:

641
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,193
No evidence."

642
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,028
And then you think,

643
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,321
"Hmm.

644
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,658
I wonder if I really need
all these imaginary friends."

645
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,662
- So you think God's
just a pleasant thing?

646
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,498
Like it's easier
to believe than not?

647
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,334
- Well, easier for you, clearly.

648
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,044
- No, Gavin, faith is hard.

649
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,505
God tests you
time and time again.

650
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,757
Sometimes He even demands
that you die for Him.

651
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,551
You think that's easy?

652
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,344
- For people of faith, sure.

653
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,554
That's the problem.

654
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,056
Like, I could never fly
a jet into a building.

655
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,641
But those 9/11 guys could

656
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,977
'cause they had faith
in an afterlife,

657
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,646
not to mention 72 virgins,

658
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:41,151
though why anyone would want
virgins, I don't know.

659
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,409
- What did God do to you
to make you so angry at Him?

660
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,871
Look at the world
that He created,

661
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,831
all the beauty.

662
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,459
- Wars and plagues
and genocides

663
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,128
and earthquakes and tidal waves.

664
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,048
And then,
after all that suffering,

665
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,091
what does your God do next?

666
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,053
He sends most of us to hell.

667
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,013
- Well, not if you've
been born again.

668
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,766
- Right, the old
baptismal Jacuzzi.

669
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,392
- You have to accept
Jesus Christ

670
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,852
as your Lord and Savior.

671
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,355
That is your only
entrance requirement.

672
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,940
- Okay, so the Hebes,
the Hindus,

673
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,818
the Muslims, the atheists,
the Buddhists,

674
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,403
all damned, right?

675
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,322
- They have to accept
Jesus Christ.

676
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,365
- And the Catholics,

677
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,451
'cause they're not
born again, right?

678
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,702
- Right.

679
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,746
- Face it, man,
it's kind of crazy.

680
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,830
- No, it's not crazy.

681
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,249
God gives us free will
for that purpose.

682
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,293
Otherwise,
we would just be puppets.

683
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,087
Life would be...

684
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,006
Life would be meaningless.

685
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,759
That's the beauty
of eternal salvation.

686
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,929
You see, anyone can go
to heaven or hell,

687
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,056
because anyone can be saved.

688
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,058
It's your choice.

689
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,852
- Unless you're a kid in China
who gets hit by a bus

690
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,813
and never even heard
of this getting saved deal.

691
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,439
Where's his choice?

692
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,732
- Well, that's why
it's so important

693
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,402
to spread the gospel,
try and save people.

694
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,113
- I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh.

695
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,573
I just find this kind
of fundamentalism incredible.

696
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,617
I mean, all of you,

697
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,537
totally convinced
you know exactly who God is

698
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,164
and exactly how He wants
to be worshipped

699
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,126
and all without a lick
of evidence He even exists.

700
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,168
- [Iaughs]

701
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,462
- No wonder
there are so many holy wars.

702
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,881
Without evidence, how else
would you win this argument

703
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,758
except by killing each other?

704
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,432
- See, I see evidence
in all kinds of things.

705
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,474
- So do they.

706
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,725
And sooner or later,

707
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,437
one of these guys
who hears God in his head

708
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,981
is gonna get ahold
of weapons of mass destruction,

709
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,442
and then,
when it's way too late,

710
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,402
we're finally
gonna ask ourselves,

711
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,113
"Why, after thousands of years
of bloodshed,

712
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,490
"didn't we at least try
to do away

713
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,617
"with this insane concept
of faith

714
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,037
before it fucking killed us?"

715
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,622
- You know,
maybe I'm just coming at this

716
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,875
from a different angle.

717
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,294
- And what angle would that be?

718
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,172
- Well, it's not abstract to me.

719
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,339
I go to the hospital,

720
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,843
and I visit
sick children, right?

721
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,513
Two days ago, I was
at the bedside of a dying child.

722
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,183
His mother and father
were killed in an auto accident.

723
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,809
He's about to pass as well.

724
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,979
And he asks me
if heaven really exists.

725
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,774
I say, "Yes, it does.

726
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,194
It's where Mommy and Daddy are."

727
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,281
About an hour or so later,
he dies

728
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,241
with a smile on his face.

729
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,163
So what would you have said
in my place-

730
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,000
"Sorry, kid,
no evidence"?

731
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,920
- No.

732
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,173
I probably would have told him
exactly the same lie you did.

733
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,551
But, Joe,
I'll tell you one thing

734
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,929
I damned sure
wouldn't have said,

735
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,305
and that's, "I'm sorry kid.

736
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,517
You're going to hell
if you haven't been baptized."

737
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:04,395
- Lord, forgive this man for his
hard heart and his blasphemy.

738
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,731
I think he has suffered
much more than he knows,

739
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,858
and he needs your love
and support now more than ever-

740
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:09,901
- No!

741
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,985
Joe, I'm sorry,

742
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,779
but you don't know
a damned thing about me,

743
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,198
and I don't need your help
or your salvation

744
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,326
or any other fucking bullshit
you may have to offer.

745
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,662
- Don't swear
in front of my wife!

746
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,206
- Gavin,
I think you should leave.

747
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,049
- With pleasure.

748
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,430
- Why can't you
leave people alone?

749
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,100
- Don't you dare
talk to me.

750
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,393
You get out of my sight.

751
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,448
- What the hell are you doing,
Chris?

752
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,867
- It's blessed water
from the temple.

753
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,121
- And how much
did you pay for that?

754
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,624
- I'm not going to tell you.

755
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,085
- I'm surrounded by imbeciles.

756
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,464
- Hi, I'm Frank.

757
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,134
I met Chris at temple.

758
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,594
- Hmm.

759
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:31,816
Hey.

760
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,485
- Can we meet
where we met before?

761
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,114
- Sure.

762
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,953
- When I was 18,
I got into drugs

763
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,414
and then into harder drugs,

764
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,542
and then I couldn't
afford them anymore.

765
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,503
And then I met a pimp.

766
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,172
And one night,
he sent me to see this john

767
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,175
who liked to do it in church.

768
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,635
But what he didn't tell me

769
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,971
was that the guy liked to beat
the girl when he was done.

770
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,852
I woke up in the morning,
and I couldn't even walk.

771
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,146
I didn't know what to do.

772
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,106
So I started to crawl
towards the altar

773
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,568
to see if there was something
I could steal.

774
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,278
But I didn't realize
it was Sunday morning,

775
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,697
and I got caught.

776
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,867
That was the day I met Joe.

777
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,746
And he took me to the hospital,
and he stayed with me.

778
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,209
If it weren't for him,

779
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:35,421
I don't think I'd be alive
right now.

780
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,299
He was the first man
who ever saw

781
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,511
something better in me
than what I was.

782
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,350
Joe takes care of me.

783
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,357
- You don't need anyone
to take care of you, Shana.

784
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,237
You're a strong,
intelligent woman.

785
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,156
- Yeah.

786
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,702
Will you do me a favor
and stay away from my husband?

787
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,372
Please?

788
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,710
- I'll do whatever you want.

789
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,925
- Believe it or not,
you actually got through to him.

790
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,719
- Really?

791
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,847
- He's decided we need
to be more evangelical.

792
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,516
We're going to a new church.

793
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:33,187
They do missionary work
in Uganda.

794
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,440
- What else?

795
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,234
- They're against smoking
and drinking,

796
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,111
immodest dress for women,

797
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,779
and secular music.

798
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,742
- Pfft.
Jesus Christ.

799
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,285
Restrings your guitar one day,

800
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,829
stops you from playing it
the next.

801
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,290
- You're so flippant,
aren't you?

802
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,958
You have no idea

803
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,626
what it's like
to lose everything

804
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,630
and to try and put it all
back together again.

805
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,798
- Actually, Shana-

806
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,176
- You don't know
what it's like for me and Joe.

807
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,765
- [Sighs]
I'm sorry.

808
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,811
I really didn't mean
to cause you problems.

809
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,229
I'm a fuckin' moron.

810
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:19,525
- Not even a little smirk,

- Who's the father?

1137
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:30,256
- She wanted the kids to look
as much like me as possible.

1138
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,720
I got a younger brother, man.

1139
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,852
Look, I'm sorry,
Gavin,

1140
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,313
but please don't make my day
any worse than it already is.

1141
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,858
Why don't you just
come on in here?

1142
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,526
- Believe me,

1143
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,029
if I could, I would.

1144
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,574
- Hollis.

1145
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,909
- Excuse me.

1146
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,327
- Spoke to the roommate, Chris.

1147
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,746
He says he thinks Joe's capable
ofjust about anything.

1148
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,080
Shana never made it to school.

1149
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,207
Joe never showed up for work.

1150
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,583
I've been trying both
their numbers.

1151
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:06,834
I got nothing.

1152
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,419
- Please, keep calling them.
- All right.

1153
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,755
How's he doin'?

1154
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,424
- Do I think he might do it?

1155
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,468
I think he could.

1156
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:19,096
- All right.
Are you good?

1157
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:22,016
- I'm having a rough day.

1158
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:25,144
[Both speaking indistinctly]

1159
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,414
Hey, forgive me.

1160
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,460
- Look man, the point is,
you got kids,

1161
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:52,046
even if it wasn't exactly
how you wanted.

1162
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:59,387
- Let's just go on
with your story, okay?

1163
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:06,727
- Okay.

1164
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:10,439
We decided to tell Joe
the truth.

1165
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,692
But Shana wanted to speak
to the pastor first

1166
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:15,278
'cause she was so scared
he'd kill himself.

1167
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,748
- I know I haven't been
an exciting lover for you.

1168
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:31,877
I know that I have been
too dominating

1169
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:36,465
in a way
that wasn't interesting.

1170
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,093
But I wasn't always like this.

1171
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,473
I know how bad things are.

1172
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,060
I just want one night.

1173
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:52,189
Borrow an apartment.
Go to a hotel.

1174
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:56,402
A night away from
what we're supposed to be,

1175
01:16:56,528 --> 01:17:00,156
a night to prove I can
make you happy that way.

1176
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:05,953
Don't I at least deserve that?

1177
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,497
- I have to get out of this
the right way.

1178
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,166
I owe him so much.

1179
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,168
- I know.

1180
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:15,421
I know, and I know
I have no right, but...

1181
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,676
- We only have to get through
a couple more days, okay?

1182
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:22,970
Okay?

1183
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:26,515
- Okay.

1184
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,351
- I should go.

1185
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,602
I'm doing the night shift,

1186
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,604
and then I'm gonna go see
the pastor in the morning.

1187
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,855
- Come by after.

1188
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,690
Let me know how it went.

1189
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,911
- I love you.

1190
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:18,526
- Crescent Riverview.

1191
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,903
- Hi.
I'd like a room, please.

1192
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,322
- When would it be for?

1193
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:24,865
- Tonight, if you've got one.

1194
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,772
Come on in.

1195
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,576
Would you mind if we talked?

1196
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:12,079
- Oh-
- Please, it's important.

1197
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,422
Sit down.

1198
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:33,976
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Gavin?

1199
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,352
- No.

1200
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:38,147
- There are two differences.

1201
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:41,275
First of all, you don't see
the world as it is.

1202
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:44,320
This world
is a disgusting place.

1203
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,489
I know this because I've seen
some of the worst

1204
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,115
it has to offer.

1205
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:52,995
- I find that hard to believe.

1206
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,372
- Did you know
I was married before?

1207
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,335
- No, I didn't know that, Joe.

1208
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,795
- Mm-hmm.

1209
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,381
A lovely wife,

1210
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:07,676
two beautiful children,

1211
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,178
great home.

1212
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,515
But I couldn't stay home,
because I was drawn to sin.

1213
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,308
I'd go out for a drink,
and five hours later,

1214
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:15,684
I'd be coked out of my head

1215
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,479
and in a booth in a porno shop,
or I'd get a hooker,

1216
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:20,981
or I'd go-go gambling,

1217
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:23,943
or pretty much whatever
you can imagine, I did.

1218
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:27,196
And I lost it all.

1219
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,825
My wife left me.

1220
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,284
She caught diseases from me.

1221
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,621
I lost my job.

1222
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:38,374
I lost my children.

1223
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,085
But even still, I couldn't stop.

1224
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:45,047
I mean, so what do you think
that is?

1225
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,675
You think
I'm, like, a sex addict

1226
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:52,888
or a junkie
or a gambling addict,

1227
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:53,931
alcoholic?

1228
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:55,057
What?

1229
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,644
- I don't know, Joe.

1230
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,687
I have no idea.

1231
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:02,273
- The answer
is none of the above.

1232
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:05,109
I just had to have sensation.

1233
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:10,781
I had to feel alive,
because inside, I was dying.

1234
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:13,993
Spiritually, right?
I was lost.

1235
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:22,668
See, I was, you know,
half an inch from death

1236
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:25,087
when Jesus came to me.

1237
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,338
I was.

1238
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:29,508
I was lying in the gutter
and got up,

1239
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:35,014
stumbled into a church,
and I was born again.

1240
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:37,641
I was saved.

1241
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:41,270
I was a new man.

1242
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:45,608
The joy-the relief, really...

1243

[sniffles]

1244
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,321
You have no idea how that feels.

1245
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:55,117
About a year later,

1246
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:59,330
the Lord, having given me
so much already,

1247
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:03,125
He gave me Shana.

1248
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,670
He brought her into the church.

1249
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:09,965
And the moment that I saw her,

1250
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:14,053
I knew that I loved her.

1251
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:18,140
Then we were married
in His sight,

1252
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:21,101
in His house.

1253
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,937
And loving her was the-

1254
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:30,778
It was such a pure love.

1255
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:36,492
Until two nights ago.

1256
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,995
When you were...

1257
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:43,248
fucking her in your kitchen,

1258
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,835
I was outside the door,
listening.

1259
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:51,423
And I thought
of smashing down that door

1260
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:54,218
and killing you both.

1261
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:55,260
[Sniffles]

1262
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,763
But I just ran away.

1263
01:22:57,889 --> 01:22:58,931
I ran away, and I did things

1264
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,684
that I have not done
in a long time.

1265
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,520
And when I came home,
she was asleep in there.

1266
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:09,483
And I watched her lying there.

1267
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,735
And she was smiling.

1268
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,704
It's hard when we lose
someone we love,

1269
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:22,830
isn't it?

1270
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,084
- Yes, it is.

1271
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:31,005
- So I came in here,

1272
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:34,258
and I opened up the Bible.

1273
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:39,722
And I read Psalm 23.

1274
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:43,684
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1275
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,270
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

1276
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,897
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1277
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:54,319
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

1278
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,698
And I took this gun,
and I put it right here.

1279
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,535
Now...

1280
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,831
You think I'm still here
because I was afraid?

1281
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,125
- I don't know, Joe.

1282
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,127
- No.

1283
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:13,922
I have no fear, Gavin.

1284
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,800
You ever been
totally without fear?

1285
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:18,677
- No.

1286
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:24,850
- That's the second difference
between us.

1287
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:26,935
I have the courage
to die for my beliefs

1288
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:30,731
because I know where I'm going.

1289
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,108
You have the courage
to die for your beliefs?

1290
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,280
- I guess so, you know,
if I had to.

1291
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:41,742
- I don't think you do.

1292
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,079
But I figured out

1293
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:48,165
I was the last person
that should die.

1294
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,501
- Joe.

Read the marked passage.

1297
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,691
- "The man
that committeth adultery

1298
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:19,905
"with another man's wife,

1299
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:23,659
the adulterer and the adulteress
shall surely be put to death."

1300
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,748
But, Joe,
what about the New Testament?

1301
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,917
Doesn't Jesus say
about an adulteress,

1302
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:34,419
"He who is without sin
amongst you,

1303
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,004
let him cast a stone at her?"

1304
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,340
- That's right, and no one did,

1305
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:42,261
because no one was without sin.

1306
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:43,929
And Jesus said to the woman,

1307
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:46,223
"Neither do I condemn thee.

1308
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:48,392
Now go and sin no more."

1309
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:49,726
- Right.

1310
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:57,484
- Are you prepared
to sin no more?

Is Shana?

1312

I am washed, sanctified,
and justified.

1313

And if I say
I'm gonna do something,

See, I've decided I'm more

Take the staircase
all the way up to the top.

On the roof,
you'll find a utility shed.

You get on the ledge

capable of killing her?
