1
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,129
Da, Nadia.

2
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,644
- Lonya?
- Da?

3
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,914
Yuri!

4
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,233
Alexi.

5
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:47,746
MIR?

6
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,542
MIR? MIR!

7
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,115
Alexi!

8
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:48,242
Captain, winds gusting to 110. If they
get to 130, we're verging category five.

9
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:57,376
Put her back into the wind, Woods.

10
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,754
Forty-five degrees down swell.

11
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:48,510
Captain, the barge
is taking on water.

12
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,138
Captain!

13
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,725
I've got eyes,
for Christ's sakes.

14
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,605
I've seen her through worse than this,
so calm down and stand your station.

15
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,524
Woods!

16
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:08,697
Forty-five degrees the swell.

17
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,958
Green water!

18
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,043
Steve! Engine room!

19
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,671
Richie, the door's jammed.
I can't get in!

20
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:09,883
Damn! If water stalls the engine,
man, we're history.

21
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,099
- Hiko, take the torch and cut the door.
- Yeah, yeah!

22
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:23,355
- I'm goin' up top.
Hiko, let me help you with that.

23
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,911
Captain, recommend new course heading:
2-2-9 degrees magnetic.

24
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,373
Captain? Captain.

25
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:45,419
Once we're in the eye,
we'll have calm seas for two hours.

26
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,088
We can make repairs,
steady the barge.

27
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,757
Skipper, should I head for the eye?

28
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,844
What the hell is goin' on up here?

29
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,805
Captain, the engine room
is taking on water.

30
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,934
Then pump it out, mister.
You're the bloody engineer.

31
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:06,064
We can't get in. The bulkhead
took a hit, and the door's wedged tight.

32
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,817
Hiko's cuttin' it now.

33
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,528
Jesus Christ, the barge!

34
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:23,165
- We gotta cut that damn thing loose!
- That's not an option, Mr. Baker.

35
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,628
Skipper, should I head for the breach?
I need an answer now. I'm losin' her.

36
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:33,967
- Winds 125, Captain!
- Captain, take a look!

37
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:38,305
That barge goes down,
we go down with it!

38
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,725
Well, that's a chance I'll take.

39
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,399
I'm cuttin' it loose.

40
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,611
Stay away from that door, mister.

41
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:59,201
I mean, what's so precious
about your goddamn cargo, Captain?

42
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:03,038
The cargo is mine.

43
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:08,001
I've leveraged everything
I own against it.

44
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,838
And it's not insured.

45
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,299
Christ, what's the matter
with those people?

46
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:19,471
So I go out that door, you shoot me?
I stay here, we're all dead!

47
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,403
Get the tank!
Hold the tank!

48
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:23,619
Let me tell you something.

49
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,788
You ever put a gun
in my face again-

50
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,291
And you'll what?

51
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,380
You figure it out.

52
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,571
Sir, what about Foster's idea?

53
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,742
I can reach the eye.

54
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:11,185
I've let you down, lad.

55
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:15,189
The water's coming in
faster than it's going out.

56
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:19,693
I can't believe we were stupid enough
to sign on with that guy again.

57
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:25,240
Maricon, ese got a gun on you, man.
I would've decked that son of a bitch.

58
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:31,371
He had us pullin' 500 tons of lumber
and steel, uninsured, in a typhoon,

59
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,875
a hundred miles
from any normal shipping lane.

60
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:41,173
And Woods tells me Foster got tossed out
of the Navy for striking a superior officer.

61
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,593
- Hey, Hiko.
- Comin' through.

62
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,180
I'll tell you one thing, Stevie.
It's the last time we make a move...

63
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:53,685
- for percentage of cargo instead of a salary.
- Damn straight. Damn straight.

64
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,564
- I told you it was a bad idea.
- My idea? It was your idea.

65
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,192
It was your idea.
What are you talking about?

66
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,949
How is it?

67
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,244
- It's bad.
- Define bad.

68
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,580
- We're sinking.
- That's bad.

69
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:21,296
So does anyone
have any suggestions?

70
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,175
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Hello, mayday. Come back, please.

71
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,762
- We got about four days of supplies.
- What is this?

72
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:33,183
That's food and that's water.

73
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,936
Put that back, okay?
We're gonna distribute-

74
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,691
Fifty-mile range. Piece of junk.

75
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,199
Hey, you buy this shit?

76
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:53,412
Wait, wait, wait!
I'm picking up a contact.

77
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,582
There might be another ship
in the eye with us.

78
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:08,552
Twelve miles out.
Speed: zero knots.

79
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:13,182
- It's dead in the water, but it's really big.
- Let's hail it, Foster.

80
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:18,687
Ahoy, vessel, latitude 29 degrees south,
longitude 1-7-9 degrees east.

81
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,942
This is the Sea Star. We are 12 miles
northwest of your position.

82
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,945
Come back.

83
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,783
So where the hell
is the captain?

84
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,074
I'm busy.

85
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,827
Skipper,
there's a ship in the eye with us.

86
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,871
Dead in the water,
about 12 miles out.

87
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,585
Dead in the water?

88
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,549
I'll be there in a minute.

89
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,354
Dead in the water.

90
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,669
Captain?

91
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,172
Dead ahead, 300 yards.

92
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,634
Hail it, Woods.

93
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,139
Unidentified vessel,
this is the Sea Star...

94
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,684
approaching from the northwest,
300 yards out.

95
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,396
Dead ahead, 300 yards.

96
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,701
Unidentified vessel,
this is the Sea Star...

97
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,954
approaching from the northwest,
300 yards out.

98
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,540
Please come back. Over.

99
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:47,503
- You see anything?
- Nope. Not a thing.

100
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,058
That ain't ours, brother.

101
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,623
Unidentified vessel,
this is the Sea Star...

102
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,501
approaching from the northwest,
200 yards out.

103
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,087
Come back. Over.

104
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:41,181
This is the Sea Star
approaching from the northwest.

105
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,851
Is anybody there? Over.

106
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,564
She looks Russian.

107
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:08,959
"The Academic Vladislav Volkov,
missile and satellite tracking ship.

108
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:15,215
45,000 tons full gross,
642 feet, two steam turbines.

109
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,553
Ship's complement: 300.
Armament: none. "

110
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:23,432
She's fitted for scientific
purposes. Their biggest.

111
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:29,605
"Forty-two labs, five machine shops
outfitted with advanced robotics.

112
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:33,233
Three parabolic dishes can maintain
simultaneous communication...

113
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,820
with several spacecraft. "

114
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:41,283
Ahoy, the Vladislav Volkov!

115
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,622
I'm the captain of the Sea Star.

116
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,249
Is there anyone aboard?

117
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:56,924
Ahoy! Baker.

118
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:00,677
Break out the shotguns,
the flashlights and the walkies.

119
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:04,014
- We're goin' aboard.
- Shit.

120
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,872
Jesus Christ.
This is kind of stupid, Stevie.

121
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,458
Shh. Come on.

122
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,630
Very stupid.

123
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:11,373
Stevie.
This is very stupid, what we're doing.

124
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,349
Stevie. Stevie!

125
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:33,770
Those are bullet holes, Stevie.

126
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:38,317
Shit, I don't like this at all, man.
This is bullshit.

127
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,870
Ahoy, the bridge!

128
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,004
Anyone aboard?

129
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,630
The bridge is deserted.

130
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:11,201
What the hell
happened in here?

131
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,361
What a mess.

132
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:53,785
- Looks like somebody
powered it down, Captain.

133
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:02,169
Captain? Captain,
do you see anything?

134
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:06,673
You'll be the first to know, Woods.

135
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:11,553
- What do you think? Pirates?
- Russian Mafia, probably.

136
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,642
Pipe down. Check the radio.

137
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,897
It's smashed.

138
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:41,708
These logs are worthless,
unless somebody reads Russian.

139
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:47,714
That storm wall is 16 miles due east.
Captain, you've got an hour and a half.

140
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,718
He's, uh, thinking, Foster.

141
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:55,097
You know, something
you were paid to do?

142
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:02,563
You thinking
what I'm thinking? Huh?

143
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:06,316
What?

144
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,362
Salvage? Salvage, baby.

145
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:15,450
You all signed on for a percentage.

146
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:19,663
But you never figured
I'd bring you this, did you?

147
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,916
A ship abandoned
in international waters.

148
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,587
Maritime law says
she's a derelict.

149
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,634
All we have to do is tow her to safety,
slap a salvage lien on her,

150
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:39,808
and the Russian government has to pay us
100/0 of her value to get her back.

151
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:43,103
Richie, put a number
on her for me.

152
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,732
Well, let's see. There's
three parabolic satellite dishes.

153
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,693
One of them's
kind of fucked up.

154
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:56,200
Forty-two labs all primed with,
uh, state-of-the-art stuff.

155
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:59,661
Let's see. We're talking...

156
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,498
two hundred?

157
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:10,797
- Three hundred million?
- $300 million.

158
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,473
That's what's comin' our way.

159
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:23,227
The opportunity of a lifetime
if we play our cards right.

160
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,854
That's what, about 30 grand apiece?

161
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:30,817
- Three hundred G's apiece.
- Three hundred G's!

162
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,028
That's at one percent?

163
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,907
I'm willing to change all that,

164
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,369
cut you in for ten percent.

165
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,997
That's $3 million each.

166
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:47,042
What do you think of that?

167
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:51,380
What do you think?

168
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:54,842
- Is it legal?
- Totally.

169
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,386
Totally legal.

170
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:03,892
- Shit. I'm in if you're in, jefe.
- Hey, I'm good.

171
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:10,023
What about you, Foster?

172
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,944
- Oh, Foster, please! Come on!
- What?

173
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:19,032
- Come on! It's easy money!
- There's no such thing as easy money, Squeaky.

174
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,785
I'll take that as a yes, Foster.

175
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,414
Baker, find the ship's generator.
We need power to the bridge.

176
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:30,043
See if you can get the main engines
running. Squeaky, you go with him. Richie?

177
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,714
Throw a line down to the tug. We're gonna
have to turn this ship into the wind.

178
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:37,426
Foster, can you see if you can get some
of this navigational equipment started?

179
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,554
Captain. My father was an admiral.

180
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,724
I know a little something
about maritime law.

181
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,518
If there's anybody alive on this ship,
you can't claim her.

182
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:50,856
- Then let's not find anyone alive.
- What does that mean?

183
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:57,404
Just that. I hope
we don't find anyone alive.

184
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,992
Woods, come back to me.

185
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:06,997
We're gonna need to turn
the ship into the wind.

186
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:17,007
It just doesn't add up. You know?

187
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:23,263
Russian vessel, middle of nowhere,
dead in the water, crew vanished?

188
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:28,393
- I mean, why would they abandon ship?
- I don't know.

189
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:31,480
And another thing. Who the hell
do you think we can trust here?

190
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,483
We're talkin' about an awful lot
of goddamn money, right?

191
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:40,113
Listen, the only two guys that we can
trust is just you and me, Stevie. That's it.

192
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:43,450
I wouldn't take a check
from the captain.

193
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:49,498
Woods is wound up so tight, you couldn't
pull a pin out of his ass with a tractor.

194
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,169
And Hiko is like-

195
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,590
I don't understand
what the hell Hiko is.

196
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:09,184
Richie's crazy like a fox, Stevie.

197
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:12,479
But, you know, I think
he just might be there for us.

198
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,734
And Foster's good.

199
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,697
"Good"?

200
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,908
What do you mean by "good"?

201
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:28,328
I mean she's solid, on the level.

202
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,290
What'd you think I meant?

203
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:34,293
Sounds like you think she's hot.

204
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:37,713
Course I think she's hot. Don't you?

205
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,599
- Right here, Steve. Right here.
- Got it?

206
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,268
Yep.

207
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,229
Yeah, that's it.

208
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,857
- Aw, shit.
- No go?

209
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,443
Nope.

210
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,365
- What's wrong with this thing?
- Here's your problem right here.

211
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:10,746
Looks like somebody trashed
the control panel. Oh, yeah.

212
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,415
These three relays are unplugged.

213
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:17,085
Let's hustle, Squeak. We got
no power to the rudder in a typhoon,

214
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,672
- we're screwed.
- I'm hustling, all right?

215
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:26,428
Okay.

216
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,020
- Go?
- Give it a shot.

217
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:09,555
- That's more like it.
- Captain?

218
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,474
I'm on my way, Woods.

219
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:20,899
What the hell is that?

220
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:26,530
Good job, Baker.
You lit us up like a pinball machine!

221
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,510
Tell you something.
We're gonna be rich.

222
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,180
You're gonna be a rich man, Hiko!

223
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:01,064
Captain?

224
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:11,658
Somebody's running this.

225
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:15,162
Looks like it's running itself.

226
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,081
Computers don't run themselves.

227
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:25,631
I don't know much about computers,
but that's an anchor.

228
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:44,441
Emergency on top deck! Emergency on
top deck! Anchor went down on the tug!

229
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,787
Baker, did you copy that?

230
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:00,707
We need you up here-
Oh, Jesus.

231
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:05,921
- Baker, we need you on deck now!
- Already on my way.

232
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,882
- Hey, Squeak, you catch that?
- What the hell happened?

233
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,718
You just sit tight. Any sign of trouble,
you don't be a cowboy.

234
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:17,182
- I'm not gonna, but d-don't leave me
here for too long. - Stay on your radio.

235
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,367
Woods!

236
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,245
Tell you what.
I'm gonna go get some help.

237
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,706
Woods!

238
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:45,586
I can't swim!

239
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:48,255
Woods!

240
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:54,386
Get back here, goddamn cocksucker!

241
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,349
Hiko! Hiko!

242
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,935
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone!

243
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,896
Shit.

244
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,737
Steve!

245
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:17,284
Steve!

246
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:31,840
I got you.

247
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,480
No, that anchor
didn't just drop by itself. No.

248
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:50,275
- Somebody else is on this ship.
- I hear that.

249
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,861
Oh, God.

250
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,823
- I'll be all right.
- Not without stitches, you won't.

251
00:35:55,948 --> 00:36:01,203
Lift up. Lift up!

252
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,914
What are you lookin' at?

253
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,583
Hey! It could've been me!

254
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:15,509
Stevie, what's goin' on up there, man?

255
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,303
We lost the tug, Squeak.

256
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:21,932
- She's gone.
- That sucks.

257
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,643
- How we doin' down there, huh?
- I'm doin' fine.

258
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,230
This whole thing is automated.
It runs by itself.

259
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,858
Negative, negative.
We got somebody else on board.

260
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:34,987
Repeat. We got somebody else on board.
That's who sank the tug.

261
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:39,408
Now, I want you to bolt the engine room
door shut. You understand me?

262
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:43,203
I copy that.
And hurry up, will you?

263
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:46,290
Listen, I think we should
split up into two groups.

264
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:50,085
- Root 'em out.
- I agree. I just have to fix his leg.

265
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,756
Hold your horses, mister.
I'm still captain here.

266
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:59,469
You left this on the bridge.

267
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:05,350
You were captain of the Sea Star.
She just sank, right?

268
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,145
I'm ranking officer.

269
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:13,108
Listen to me, Baker.

270
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:19,907
For $30 million I'm willing to overlook
all that's come between us.

271
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,828
How about you?

272
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:34,296
- Good man. Richie!
- Yeah.

273
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,508
Take Woods.
Go to the engine room.

274
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,135
- Shit.
- Back up Squeaky.

275
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:47,434
We're gonna take Hiko, get him to
a sick bay. Gonna get that leg fixed.

276
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,604
- Stay away, Woods.
- Go with him, Woods.

277
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:53,815
Let me tell you something. You get me
killed, I'm gonna kick your ass.

278
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:57,945
Now, take my shit.
Let's go.

279
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,047
- Wait up for us, Foster.
- All right.

280
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,721
It'll be down that corridor.

281
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:36,650
Where's this go, Richie?

282
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:41,113
It goes down. Come on.

283
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:26,241
Hello?

284
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:49,139
Hello? Listen,
I'm a friend. All right?

285
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,518
I'm Cuban. I'm not American.

286
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,814
Anybody in there?

287
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:10,285
Hello?

288
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,762
Weapons locker.

289
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:15,517
What the hell is this all about?

290
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:22,858
Bingo.

291
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:30,407
Put him up here.
Come on, Hiko.

292
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,993
All right. Tighten that down.

293
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:36,705
Yeah.

294
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:52,095
- All right. This is gonna hurt.
- It's all right. Just get on with it.

295
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:02,397
- You have a high pain threshold.
- Yeah, I usually do it myself.

296
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:07,277
No, really.

297
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:11,698
Hey, Hiko.
Some dry clothes.

298
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:16,245
- Yeah, thanks.
- Oh, man.

299
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:19,206
All right. Here we go.

300
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:23,418
Ah, come on, Richie.
Isn't that enough guns? Damn.

301
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:27,422
Woods, let me tell you three things.
You can never be too rich,

302
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:31,176
too thin or too well-armed.

303
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:34,096
Yeah, let's go.

304
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:38,225
Oh, man.

305
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:45,107
Get the green bag.

306
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:48,986
Green bag? Oh, man.

307
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:53,991
Goddamn, I'm carrying too much.
I got a bad latissimus, Richie.

308
00:42:56,368 --> 00:43:01,081
I'm tellin' you, Richie. My back
isn't gonna let me do this anymore.

309
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:05,586
I can't deal with it.
I get hung up on everything.

310
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:12,926
I'm tellin' you,
I'm gonna get rid of some of this crap.

311
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:20,475
Hey, Woods,
what do you make of this?

312
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,687
I have no idea.

313
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:38,452
Tactical short-range
surface-to-air.

314
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:41,121
This is beautiful, man.

315
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,999
Oh, I'm thrilled.
Can we go now?

316
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:47,628
- In a minute. Look around, man.
- Damn!

317
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:57,679
Hello, Mr. Cable.

318
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:04,144
- Hey, Woods. Look at this.
- What?

319
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:11,860
It looks like some kind
of ejection seat or escape vehicle.

320
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:19,243
Oh, launch buttons. Cool.

321
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:24,456
- Richie.
- Yeah.

322
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:27,084
Look at these doors, man.

323
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:40,514
That's an awful lot
of blood, Richie.

324
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:47,354
- Now can we go?
- Yeah, yeah.

325
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:52,276
- Oh, Foster.
- Yeah?

326
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,945
What are you gonna do
with your three million?

327
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,074
I don't have it yet.

328
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,661
What about you, Hiko?

329
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:06,915
Uh, three million?
Probably open a school.

330
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:10,294
A school? For what?

331
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:13,338
Uh, Kura Kaupapa.
It would be choice.

332
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:17,843
- Lots of little kids reading, writing, learning Maori.
- That's sweet.

333
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:21,805
Yeah, it's a dream thing.

334
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:27,603
- How about you, Baker?
- Oh, I don't know.

335
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:33,442
Always loved the sea.
Probably buy an island.

336
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,946
Oh, yeah?
Does it have a beach?

337
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:43,035
Beautiful white sand.
Hammock, sailboat.

338
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:46,330
- What about a house?
- How about a villa?

339
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:50,959
Thatched roof,
overlooking a lagoon.

340
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:52,961
It sounds nice.

341
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:55,797
Yes, lovely.
When you two gettin' married?

342
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:59,885
- Hey!
- Gee! Take it easy, mate!

343
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,596
No, you take it easy, mate.

344
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:19,279
Aah! Get off my leg!

345
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,157
Geez!

346
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,725
Is she dead?

347
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:55,607
No.

348
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,908
What's this shit, Richie?

349
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:09,746
Somebody doesn't
like electricity, Woodsy.

350
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:12,416
Come on.

351
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:17,713
Well, it looks like somebody
tried to rewire the ship.

352
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,302
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

353
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:28,807
- So that's done.
- What's all this weird stuff in her bag?

354
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,897
She's got videotapes,
cigarettes. What's this? Hair spray?

355
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,317
Hey, watch out! Watch out, watch out!
Thermite grenades.

356
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:42,279
- What?
- Thermite.

357
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:46,950
One of those things blows, burn a hole
right through the deck. Be careful.

358
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:51,997
- Be careful, really careful.
- What's she trying to do? Sink the ship?

359
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:55,834
- Squeaky, talk to me.
- How does it feel?

360
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:59,254
- It's good. Thanks.
- Are you gonna be able to walk?

361
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:02,591
Yeah. I-I'll be okay.

362
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,597
Squeak, que pasa, buddy?

363
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:13,602
Where the hell are you, man?

364
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:17,356
Shit.

365
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:21,360
Richie, Woods, come back.

366
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:24,238
Steve, this ship's got a missile rome.

367
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:26,949
I don't give a damn about any missiles!

368
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:30,536
I left Squeaky in the engine room and he's
not answering, so get the hell down there.

369
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:36,416
- Yeah, yeah. We hear you.
- We've got a crew member up here who just unloaded an Uzi on us,

370
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,294
- so you better watch your ass.
- Yeah, copy that.

371
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:46,134
- I'm goin' to the engine room.
- We'll see you on the bridge.

372
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,180
Steve? Watch your back.

373
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:18,417
Hey, Woods, you comprehend
this Cyrillic crap?

374
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,422
It's like chicken scratches to me.

375
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:28,051
Oh! Richie, Richie, help me!

376
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:41,148
Here, Woods.

377
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:49,031
Oh!

378
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:52,117
That thing smells
like dog shit, Richie.

379
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:54,786
Ugh! What is it?

380
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:59,791
It's robotic, Woodsy.
High-tech robotics.

381
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:08,258
Where'd you learn how to sew?

382
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:11,303
- My grandfather.
- Yeah?

383
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:21,522
It's all right. It's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

384
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:27,319
Power. Turn off the power.
Shut down the ship.

385
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:30,489
- You're all in danger.
- What's she going on about?

386
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:33,283
I don't know.
I don't know.

387
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,461
Captain, please.

388
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:48,966
What's your name?

389
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:58,267
What's happened on this ship?
Where're the rest of your crew?

390
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:02,396
- Dead.
- Dead?

391
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,065
Good.

392
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:09,486
You must turn off the power.
It needs power to move through the ship.

393
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:15,159
What... needs... power?

394
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:20,831
- It. From the MIR.
- The MIR space station?

395
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:23,250
- Yes.
- She's a fruitcake.

396
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:27,671
- Come on, Captain.
- She's a nutter, which is perfect.

397
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:33,927
Hiko, come on!

398
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:38,116
Drop it.

399
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:44,331
Drop it!

400
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:55,926
- It's okay.
- You don't understand.

401
00:52:56,009 --> 00:53:00,264
Look. I'm not gonna hurt you.

402
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:10,816
My name's Kelly Foster.
I'm a navigator.

403
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:14,778
I'm Nadia.

404
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:18,282
Nadia Vinogradova,
Chief Science Officer.

405
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:25,164
Nadia, what happened?
Where's your crew?

406
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:30,586
I told you.
Dead or deserted.

407
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,381
Three hundred crew members are gone?

408
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:38,010
What happened?

409
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:43,140
Eight days ago, during a transmission
from the MIR space station,

410
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:46,476
something came onto the ship.

411
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,398
We thought our transmitters and receivers
were malfunctioning, so we shut them down.

412
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:57,821
It took control
of computers, scanned all information.

413
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:03,118
Language, encyclopedias,
medical data. It was learning.

414
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:06,830
Learning what?

415
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:09,416
How to kill us.

416
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,341
My captain, Alexi, and me
were the last to survive.

417
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:21,553
We cut their cables,
smashed them-

418
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:24,431
Wait a minute.
You just said "them. "

419
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:29,812
Before you said "it. "
Who's "them"?

420
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:34,483
Mm. Machine.
Uh, machines.

421
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:40,030
Machines. Ah.

422
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:46,286
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I-I know. I-

423
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,081
- Foster?
- Yeah, I'm in here.

424
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:58,298
It's okay. Nobody's going to hurt you.
It's okay. It's okay.

425
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:05,347
She's nuts.

426
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,225
But something scared
the hell out of her.

427
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:14,064
I say we get her
up to the bridge. Hiko.

428
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:16,316
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me the flashlight.

429
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:19,903
You're gonna be okay. It's okay.
We're gonna get you something to eat.

430
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:25,033
Come on. Come on.
Watch your head. It's okay.

431
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:30,539
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

432
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:33,625
- Go!
- No!

433
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:39,715
- You got her? Okay, go.
- I'm not a threat!

434
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,136
I'm not a threat!

435
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:50,726
I used to go turkey huntin',
you know, with my dad.

436
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:54,897
- It beats the shit outta this, man.
- Shh.

437
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,524
You hear that?

438
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:01,445
It sounds like
somebody's working down there.

439
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,407
What- uh-

440
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:13,582
Hey! Anybody in here?

441
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:17,920
Shh! Quiet, man. Be quiet.

442
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:23,509
Stay down.
There might be somebody.

443
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:29,973
- Hey, Woodsy, there's
another one of those things, man.

444
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:43,904
Let's go, man!

445
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:46,532
- Shh.
- I'm outta here.

446
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,214
Richie, Woods,
where the hell are you two?

447
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:08,637
Hey, Steve, listen. There's
a machine shop down here with, uh,

448
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,685
- state-of-the-art robotics. - I already told
you twice to get your asses to the engine room!

449
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:20,357
- You hear me?
- Yeah, yeah.

450
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,943
We're comin'.

451
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:56,852
Come on, Woodsy.

452
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:10,782
I'm not-
I'm not comin'.

453
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:38,977
Hey, little buddy.

454
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:51,990
- Richie, let's go.
- Hey, hey, Woodsy. Did the other one bother you?

455
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:54,743
Huh? No, it didn't.

456
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:09,925
Richie.

457
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,845
Richie?

458
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:21,061
Hey!

459
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:24,189
Goddamn, Richie!

460
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,842
I'm sick of this!

461
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:03,312
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is Richie. There's another Russian down here.

462
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:07,274
The son of a bitch shot at us!
And Woods is hurt.

463
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:10,194
- So watch your ass. You copy?
- Copy that. How is he?

464
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,032
Just tell him it's bad. Ow!

465
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:19,328
- Bad!
- He'll live, but he ain't in a good mood, man.

466
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:23,832
Just get him to the damn engine room.
And no more sightseeing, all right?

467
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,919
Yeah. Copy, copy, copy.
All right.

468
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:30,339
Get up. Get up.

469
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:43,268
Squeaky? Squeak?

470
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:51,610
Holy shit. What the hell?

471
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:54,530
Oh, my God.

472
01:00:54,613 --> 01:00:58,367
Jesus Christ! Squeak?

473
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:04,623
Squeak? Open up!

474
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:11,672
- Don't shoot! It's us!
- Where the hell have you two been?

475
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:14,258
Back from your holiday?

476
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:22,808
- Jesus Christ. Woods, you're a mess.
- Thank you.

477
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:28,564
- You said a Russian did this?
- No, a machine did that with a nail gun.

478
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:32,609
Yeah, that's right. You're not
gonna believe it till you see it.

479
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:35,737
There's some really weird shit
goin' down on this ship, man.

480
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:39,616
- Weird ain't the word.
- I'm in need of some proper medical attention.

481
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:44,079
- Shut the fuck up!
- I don't belong on this ship.

482
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:47,624
- Somebody just welded the engine room door shut.
- It's welded?

483
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:51,003
- Squeaky's still missing.
- Weird.

484
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:54,381
R- Richie?

485
01:01:54,464 --> 01:02:00,220
Richie, it's that smell again.

486
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,355
- Squeak?
- Hey, Squeaky!

487
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:14,067
- Squeak, man.
- Is that you?

488
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:18,489
Shit!

489
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,877
- Go!
- That bastard shot at us!

490
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:46,391
You're all going to die.

491
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:49,311
You hear that, Foster?

492
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:54,399
We're all going to die,
because there are aliens on this ship.

493
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:57,903
That's all the grounds I need.

494
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:06,203
One of my men is missing.
And I want some answers!

495
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:10,290
And no more
of this Twilight Zone stuff.

496
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:15,420
I don't know anything
about your man.

497
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:21,260
Rubbish.
I'm gonna give you five seconds,

498
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,887
and then I'm gonna
blow your brains out.

499
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:28,392
- One- - She couldn't
possibly know where Squeaky is.

500
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:35,315
- She was hiding in sick bay.
- She knows. She dropped an anchor on my tug.

501
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:37,901
She fired at us. Two.

502
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:40,904
Captain!
Hiko, come on!

503
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:45,492
- That anchor nearly killed me. I'm not feeling too sympathetic.
- Me neither.

504
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:51,290
- Three.
- Shoot me. I don't care. Just shut down the power to the ship.

505
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:01,133
Captain, she's not gonna
tell you what you wanna hear.

506
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:06,054
Hey, Captain. I'd like to hear
what she has to say about this.

507
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:09,725
Up here on the chart table, Richie.

508
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:15,063
Fake bastard!

509
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,984
What the bloody hell is that?

510
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:21,987
It beats the hell out of us.

511
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:26,033
It's Alexi, my captain.

512
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:30,579
Hell, whatever it is,
it tried to kill us.

513
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:40,464
Squeaky's still AWOL, and somebody
welded the engine room door shut.

514
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:43,759
We're not alone here.

515
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:46,386
She's got another friend down there.

516
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,181
Can someone explain
what the hell is goin' on?

517
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:56,605
Finish your story, Nadia.

518
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:03,111
The energy that came
from the MIR...

519
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:08,325
infested all of the ship's
electrical systems.

520
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:12,412
Mainframe computer,
the labs, the machine shops.

521
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:17,376
It activated fire extinguishers.

522
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:20,504
Sixty-seven died
from halon gas poisoning.

523
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,549
Quarter of the crew.

524
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:30,055
It cut us off from machine shops
and started building.

525
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:34,268
The little ones first-
the gatherers.

526
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:38,188
Yeah. We saw a whole room full of them.
That's what nailed Woods.

527
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:45,195
Then came something...
more dangerous.

528
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:51,326
Half man, half machine.

529
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:55,956
A biomechanism. Engineering
beyond our comprehensions.

530
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:02,880
The rest of the crew deserted,
taking their chances in the sea.

531
01:06:02,963 --> 01:06:07,426
Only Alexi and me stayed,
cutting cables.

532
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:11,096
What does cutting cables
have to do with it?

533
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:19,021
The machines are controlled by
the electrical energy in the computer.

534
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:23,942
If we can cut their source
of power, they'll die.

535
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:28,530
We cut these to get him here.
What the hell are you talking about?

536
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:33,911
What is this thing that's
inside the computer, huh?

537
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:37,623
It's a life-form
unlike anything we know.

538
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:42,085
Not cellular but electrical in nature.
Extremely intelligent.

539
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:45,005
You mean it's like
lightning that can think.

540
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:48,717
It has no form, no shape,
but it's giving itself what it lacks.

541
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:53,055
It's creating
a new life-form...

542
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:55,808
using parts of the ship and crew.

543
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:02,147
Blood is still pumping
through this brain.

544
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:04,775
There's been
no decomposition at all.

545
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:14,535
Yeah. Here, right here.
See? There's...

546
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:19,581
some kind of coil or self-contained
power supply built right into it.

547
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:22,417
Amazing.

548
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:27,297
This brain is still alive.

549
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:31,802
Hello?

550
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:36,223
Stop fucking around
with the damn thing, Richie!

551
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:38,851
I'm just looking at it, Steve.

552
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:59,663
Alexi?

553
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:20,934
Touch it again,
I'll cut your hands off.

554
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:23,812
I can respect that.

555
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:32,446
It's still Alexi.
It's Alexi.

556
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:38,118
Rubbish! You're listening
to a pile of Russian rubbish.

557
01:08:38,202 --> 01:08:44,041
And I for one won't listen
to any more of it. There's no alien.

558
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:46,752
Something their government cooked up.

559
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:52,925
It all went wrong, didn't it? You're afraid
the rest of the world's gonna find out about it.

560
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:57,930
Dr. Igor Fuckin' Frankenstein there.

561
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:09,149
Alexi was no medical experiment.

562
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:13,779
- He was my husband.
- Rubbish.

563
01:09:13,904 --> 01:09:19,618
Could someone please come and take
a look at the nails in my shoulder?

564
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:24,790
Woods, stop whining!

565
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:29,211
Ow! God! Ow!

566
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:44,143
Oh, my God. Captain!

567
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:53,152
Brace yourselves!

568
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:20,387
We gotta turn her into the wind!

569
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:29,104
The steering doesn't answer.

570
01:10:34,526 --> 01:10:37,154
We could steer the ship
from the engine room.

571
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:40,824
- I thought you said the door was welded.
- We'll cut the damn door.

572
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:45,787
Right. Bring her.
I wanna keep her in my sight.

573
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:08,644
I gotta get off this ship.

574
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:34,670
- All clear?
- Clear.

575
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:42,970
Did you feel that?

576
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:54,857
The ship's turning.

577
01:11:58,235 --> 01:12:02,698
We just turned 20 degrees into the wind.
The ship's steering itself.

578
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:09,413
- Ships don't steer themselves.
- She's altered her course.

579
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:18,463
- Let's go. Come on.
- Engine room's one deck down.

580
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:22,217
What the hell was that?

581
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:25,429
- Could be Squeak.
- I don't care who it is!

582
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:28,390
I said it could be Squeak!

583
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:32,978
Steve.

584
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,522
Jesus Christ.

585
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:47,159
- Careful, Richie.
- Yeah.

586
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:51,205
It's too weird, man.
You can't open that door.

587
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:55,083
- What is it, Steve?
- I don't know. What you got, Richie?

588
01:12:55,167 --> 01:13:00,839
- I don't know. It could be Squeaky.
- Let me see. Let me see!

589
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:04,801
What the hell is that?

590
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:10,766
- Open the door! - Steve!
- Don't open the damn door!

591
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:29,076
Squeak?

592
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:32,329
Steve.

593
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:41,129
Steve!

594
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:49,721
Richie! God, Richie, help me,
for God's sake! Richie!

595
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:55,018
Shit!

596
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:04,194
Richie!

597
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:12,327
Steve!

598
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:16,206
- Out this side!
- Go! Go! Go!

599
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,959
- Come on. This way!
- Steve.

600
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:21,670
Come on!

601
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:30,846
- Where are we?
- Communications room.

602
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:35,517
Good! I'm callin' for help.

603
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:40,647
- Did you trash this?
- We destroyed every transmitter on the ship.

604
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:00,083
- You didn't smash this one. Mayday, mayday, mayday!
- Don't!

605
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:06,131
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

606
01:15:06,256 --> 01:15:12,554
No one else is gonna claim salvage
on this vessel but us.

607
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:18,602
You're no longer in charge.

608
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,528
Come here!

609
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:50,801
- What do they want from us?
- It wants to kill us.

610
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:55,973
- No, they want something.
- It wants to mutilate us just like it did Woods.

611
01:15:56,056 --> 01:16:00,686
Did you see Squeaky?
That thing wants something from us.

612
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:05,607
Why don't we talk to it? It's in
the computer. We could talk to it.

613
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:10,320
- What?
- Talk to it! It's in the computer.

614
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:16,160
What the hell?
What do I do? What do I do?

615
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:19,246
Nadia, please help me.
I need English, please.

616
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:29,214
"Who are you?"

617
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:37,014
I am aware.

618
01:16:39,057 --> 01:16:43,729
Is that it? Is it?
Is it the thing?

619
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:47,316
"We mean you no harm. "

620
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:53,113
Life-form analysis complete.
Species is destructive,

621
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:59,369
invasive, noxious,
harmful to the body of the whole.

622
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:01,997
- "What species?"
- Man.

623
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:10,339
You are virus.

624
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:14,218
Great. Just great.

625
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:18,388
It thinks we're germs.

626
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:22,309
"What do you want from us?"

627
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:27,022
Viscous neurological transmitters,

628
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:32,110
oxygenated tissues,
Aponeurus Superiorus Papelbrai.

629
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:35,113
"Superior-"
What the hell is that?

630
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:38,784
- It's part of an optic nerve.
- What?

631
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:42,996
Spare parts.

632
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,833
It wants us for spare parts.

633
01:17:57,469 --> 01:18:00,055
- It must be destroyed.
- How?

634
01:18:00,139 --> 01:18:02,683
- You said it was electrical, like lightning.
- Yes.

635
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,644
- What happens when lightning hits water?
- It grounds out!

636
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:10,941
That's right. It grounds out, dissipates
and dies. That means we can kill this thing.

637
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:15,362
- We have to sink the ship to do that.
- It's in the computer.

638
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,907
- Where's the mainframe?
- D deck. One deck below.

639
01:18:18,991 --> 01:18:22,870
She's right. We gotta get to the
computer if we're gonna kill this thing.

640
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:26,915
We gotta get
the hell outta here first.

641
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,795
You people want a way out of here?
Huh? I'll show you a way outta here.

642
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:39,428
Steve.

643
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:49,980
Spare parts, my ass, man.
That ain't gonna happen to me.

644
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:54,526
I ain't goin' up against those things,
man. You people can do what you want.

645
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:57,112
- I'm outta here.
- Get down!

646
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:05,370
You're crazy!

647
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:09,458
Who's gonna carry my shit?
Who's gonna carry my shit?

648
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:18,175
- He's gone postal, man.
- Come on. Let's go!

649
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:21,929
Steve.

650
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:30,354
- You coming?
- You hit a superior officer, Foster.

651
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:35,776
You punched me!
You're crazy!

652
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:40,322
- Fuck you!
- You're all gonna get yourselves killed!

653
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:32,124
Wanna talk to me, do ya?

654
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:48,682
I knew you did.

655
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:56,523
"Everton...

656
01:20:56,607 --> 01:21:01,695
is the dominant life-form.

657
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:08,160
I am Everton. "

658
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:23,175
"I will help you...

659
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:27,137
bring this ship to port.

660
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:31,099
New Zealand,

661
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:33,727
Australia,

662
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:37,439
anywhere you want. "

663
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:46,615
"Workroom 14."

664
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:04,508
It's not gettin' me.

665
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:17,729
My brain is not becoming
some hard drive...

666
01:22:17,813 --> 01:22:22,693
for some biomechanoid, alien mother-

667
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:55,058
Oh, I can use this.
This is a good part.

668
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:18,540
That door down there leads
to the main computer room.

669
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:25,047
I thought you said this was
gonna be well protected.

670
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,674
Hiko.

671
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,733
- It's gone.
- Gone where?

672
01:23:56,703 --> 01:24:00,374
Fuckin' thing moved itself.

673
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:53,635
Robert Everton, Captain, the Sea Star.

674
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:00,684
Thank you.

675
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:17,636
Th-They're planning to sink the ship.

676
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:22,933
Of course, you know that, don't you?

677
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:42,661
It's pretty amazing,
what with no head and all.

678
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:56,300
Woods.

679
01:26:57,885 --> 01:27:01,638
Twenty-five years,
him and me-

680
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:06,393
together.

681
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:13,233
Are you Everton?

682
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:21,116
Are you the dominant life-form?

683
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:26,079
How can I be of assistance to you?

684
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:31,835
Help me to survive.

685
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:42,638
It's welded.
We just came through here.

686
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:45,307
We've been set up.

687
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,893
- This way.
- Let's go!

688
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:54,650
Six years in the navy
as a weapons specialist.

689
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:58,070
I graduated top of my class.

690
01:27:58,153 --> 01:28:02,950
I'm gettin' out. I got a plan.

691
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:07,204
It thinks it's smarter than me?
It's gonna get a surprise.

692
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:16,338
- Where we going?
- The storage room. We can get out through here.

693
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:26,598
- Ow! It's welded. What's down there? Nadia!
- Dead end.

694
01:28:26,682 --> 01:28:30,561
Steve, I need something
to pry this. Hurry!

695
01:28:50,164 --> 01:28:53,917
Steve!

696
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:59,506
Hiko! Steve, over here!

697
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,676
Hiko!

698
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:07,306
Hiko!

699
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:11,810
- Hiko, come on! Move!
- Hiko!

700
01:29:16,523 --> 01:29:21,653
Let's go, go, go, go!

701
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:40,088
Nadia, which way?

702
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:45,177
- The antenna control room. We'll be safe there.
- Okay. Steve!

703
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:49,515
Right behind you!
Go! Just keep moving!

704
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:09,868
You stay close, Foster.

705
01:30:33,058 --> 01:30:37,146
Keep going, Hiko! Keep going!

706
01:30:50,909 --> 01:30:53,996
Hiko!

707
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:58,750
Help me, Hiko!

708
01:30:58,834 --> 01:31:03,172
- Foster, hang on!
- Hiko!

709
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:11,013
Come on, come on!
Take my hand! Come on!

710
01:31:13,599 --> 01:31:17,227
I got ya!

711
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:19,813
Come on!

712
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:24,651
Steve!

713
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:38,415
Hiko!

714
01:31:52,304 --> 01:31:58,393
- Hiko!
- Foster, come on!

715
01:31:58,477 --> 01:32:01,688
He's gone. Keep moving!

716
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:31,385
Maybe he made it
to another part of the ship.

717
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,597
Not a chance.

718
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:23,395
Just a little good-bye gift.

719
01:33:30,903 --> 01:33:35,199
We gotta find out
where it's taking us. Steve!

720
01:33:37,242 --> 01:33:40,078
Give me a hand.

721
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:50,631
We need a light.

722
01:33:56,512 --> 01:33:59,932
We're headed here on this vector.

723
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:03,644
North-northwest.
Lord Howe Island?

724
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:10,192
- Lord Howe? Why? There's nothin' there.
- There is.

725
01:34:10,275 --> 01:34:14,530
There is a British intelligence station
there. They have digital linkups...

726
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:17,741
to all the military and commercial
satellites in the Southern Hemisphere.

727
01:34:17,825 --> 01:34:23,163
If it gets into the transoceanic
Pacific cable, it could go anywhere.

728
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:28,377
This is the vessel Norfolk to
the vessel at 29 south, 79 east.

729
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:34,091
Received a mayday at 0800 hours.
We have you on radar.

730
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:36,760
Richie's mayday got through!

731
01:34:36,844 --> 01:34:42,057
If you are receiving but cannot
transmit, please respond by signal flare.

732
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:46,687
- We need a flare gun!
- No, no! If anything, we need to warn them away.

733
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:51,233
- Why?
- Because this thing is isolated on the ship, Steve.

734
01:34:51,316 --> 01:34:54,778
- We can't let another ship near us.
- Right.

735
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:09,209
We gotta sink this ship.

736
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:12,212
How?

737
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:19,261
Flood the hold with fuel
and detonate it.

738
01:35:22,014 --> 01:35:24,558
Let's do it.

739
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:50,626
Jesus Christ.

740
01:35:53,796 --> 01:35:56,381
Foster, get back!

741
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:19,279
You don't recognize me.
What's wrong?

742
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:44,930
I'm still your captain, Foster.
You must treat me with respect.

743
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:02,281
We know where you're going.

744
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:05,200
I know you do.

745
01:37:05,284 --> 01:37:09,580
There's a whole world
waiting out there.

746
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:19,047
Steve! Foster! Grenade!

747
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:28,223
Get down!

748
01:38:07,429 --> 01:38:12,976
Through your captain, it knows what
we are planning. We must hurry. Come on.

749
01:38:47,678 --> 01:38:50,222
Come on.

750
01:38:57,563 --> 01:39:03,652
- Good. Okay.
- So, which way?

751
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:11,034
Oh, God! Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me!

752
01:39:13,203 --> 01:39:16,165
- Put the gun down.
- Richie, man, it's us!

753
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:20,043
- How do I know that?
- Put it down, Mason.

754
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:23,922
We're gonna blow the ship.
You come with us, all right?

755
01:39:24,006 --> 01:39:27,885
I got my own plan.

756
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:30,596
What the hell are you
talking about?

757
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:36,560
Richie, don't be a fool! Richie!

758
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:40,314
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

759
01:40:12,805 --> 01:40:17,184
That should do it.

760
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,704
Checkmate.

761
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:40,749
I gave us 15 minutes.

762
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:43,585
- Let's go.
- We should warn Richie.

763
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:48,132
Richie, Richie, if you can hear me,
we're leaving the ship.

764
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:51,844
Richie!

765
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:16,465
English.

766
01:44:18,592 --> 01:44:22,554
- Do you speak English?
- Fuck you.

767
01:44:22,638 --> 01:44:28,685
- English. Where is the detonator?
- I don't remember.

768
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:34,358
The detonator-

769
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:38,028
where is it?

770
01:45:32,624 --> 01:45:35,127
Cut her down.

771
01:45:50,767 --> 01:45:56,857
- Steve, buddy, you okay?
Huh? I got ya.

772
01:46:01,737 --> 01:46:05,699
We gotta go. We gotta go.

773
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:17,586
Steve! Richie!

774
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:28,263
Come on, Foster.

775
01:46:28,347 --> 01:46:33,769
- Richie!
- Foster, this way, this way.

776
01:47:06,093 --> 01:47:08,554
It's not coming.

777
01:47:22,901 --> 01:47:27,197
Foster, Foster, look.

778
01:47:27,322 --> 01:47:31,076
Survival suits.
Maybe we have a chance.

779
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:33,996
Put it on. Put it on.

780
01:47:40,544 --> 01:47:43,046
Richie!

781
01:48:03,817 --> 01:48:06,570
Oh, my God.

782
01:48:06,653 --> 01:48:10,115
Richie?

783
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:12,910
Oh, man.

784
01:48:14,328 --> 01:48:18,373
We thought
you bailed on us, bro.

785
01:48:18,457 --> 01:48:21,877
We thought
you weren't comin' back.

786
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,505
Shows you how smart I am.

787
01:48:29,927 --> 01:48:37,392
Hey, Steve. Now, there's still
a way to get off this ship.

788
01:48:37,518 --> 01:48:42,064
- What?
- But you gotta get to the missile room.

789
01:48:42,147 --> 01:48:49,154
- Missile room?
- You'll understand when you get there.

790
01:48:51,406 --> 01:48:53,951
Steve-

791
01:48:57,412 --> 01:49:04,044
Mason! Mason? Shit.

792
01:49:32,823 --> 01:49:36,952
Nadia, stop! Nadia!

793
01:49:39,037 --> 01:49:43,333
- There's no time!
- I'm not leaving, not until I know it's dead.

794
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:47,254
- The ship's gonna blow any second.
- I've got to make sure.

795
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:50,299
- Nadia, it's suicide!
- I don't care!

796
01:49:50,382 --> 01:49:52,926
Nadia!

797
01:50:08,859 --> 01:50:11,320
Checkmate.

798
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:19,995
Foster. Foster,
get to the upper deck.

799
01:50:20,078 --> 01:50:24,208
Get off the ship. You have
to tell people what has happened here.

800
01:50:24,291 --> 01:50:28,504
- No. No.
- Yes, go. Go!

801
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:47,523
Are there more of those devices
aboard this ship?

802
01:50:50,442 --> 01:50:53,153
Just one more.

803
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:58,283
No!

804
01:52:03,474 --> 01:52:06,268
No!

805
01:52:06,351 --> 01:52:09,480
It's me, Baker. It's me!

806
01:52:09,563 --> 01:52:14,234
It's okay.

807
01:52:19,907 --> 01:52:22,493
- Come on. We're gonna get outta here.
- No, I can't.

808
01:52:22,618 --> 01:52:27,706
I don't wanna hear it! You don't have
a choice! Get the hell up! Let's go!

809
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:39,843
Come on!

810
01:52:51,313 --> 01:52:56,318
- Where are we?
- The missile bay. Check that door.

811
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:03,951
It's blocked.

812
01:53:04,034 --> 01:53:09,623
Foster, look at this!
It's a rocket motor!

813
01:53:25,722 --> 01:53:28,225
Looks like some sort of ejection seat.

814
01:53:36,233 --> 01:53:40,362
- Come on. Let's go! Get in!
- No. No!

815
01:53:40,445 --> 01:53:43,782
- No, I'm not going without you!
- Just get in!

816
01:53:43,866 --> 01:53:46,410
- No!
- There's no time!

817
01:53:46,493 --> 01:53:52,249
Richie rigged this for one, okay?

818
01:53:52,332 --> 01:53:54,835
And you're it.

819
01:54:15,022 --> 01:54:19,318
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on, damn it!

820
01:54:29,953 --> 01:54:33,624
- Foster, go!
- Not without you.

821
01:56:02,212 --> 01:56:04,798
That's one hell of a flare.

822
01:57:20,541 --> 01:57:22,960
Hiko!

823
01:57:37,641 --> 01:57:42,312
Foster, it's all right.

824
01:57:42,396 --> 01:57:48,235
It's okay, you hear me?
We made it.

825
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:50,863
Come on.

826
01:57:52,656 --> 01:57:57,453
All right?
We made it.
