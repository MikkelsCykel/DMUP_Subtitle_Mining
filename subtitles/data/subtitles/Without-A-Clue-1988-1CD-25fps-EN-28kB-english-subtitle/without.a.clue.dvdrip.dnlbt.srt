1
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,032
I told ya.

2
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,041
A quick tunnel job,
then up the stairs,

3
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:26,456
as pretty as you please.

4
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:41,048
That's worth over
ten thousand pounds.

5
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:44,212
- We're gonna be rich!
- Not this time, gentlemen.

6
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:46,836
Sherlock Holmes!

7
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:51,661
Watson?

8
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:55,377
Right you are, Holmes.

9
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,022
Run, Archie,
or we'll swing for it!

10
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,046
Don't let those ruffians escape!

11
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:17,103
I am Inspector Lestrade.
You are under...

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,720
There's no escape, my friend.

13
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,508
This will be a pleasure.

14
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:50,258
- Well done, Watson.
- Are you all right, Holmes?

15
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:51,635
Quite.

16
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:54,549
Which is more than I can say
for John Clay,

17
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,298
one of London's
least notorious thieves.

18
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,293
Inspector! I have your man.

19
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,900
Come on.

20
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:08,780
Well, Mr. Holmes...

21
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:12,596
...I don't know how,
but you've done it again.

22
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,604
Thank you.
That's high praise indeed,

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,710
coming from such a workmanlike
detective as yourself.

24
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:24,211
And now, if you have
nothing further to add,

25
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,539
I hereby declare this case...

26
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,784
...closed.

27
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,295
Good! We got kippers
for breakfast.

28
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,057
Just a minute.

29
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:47,854
You idiot!

30
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,267
What?

31
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,740
Confound you!

32
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,193
What... what did I say?

33
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,471
What did I say wrong?

34
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,836
I did everything you said,
exactly as you said it.

35
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,268
All right, what did I do?

36
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:27,374
You're not going
to tell me, are you?

37
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:31,247
All right.
You want to know what's wrong?

38
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,347
- I said I did, didn't I?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

39
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,167
Don't declare a case is closed...

40
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,121
Just a minute.
My public awaits.

41
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,803
...until I say it's closed!

42
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,394
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. Holmes!

43
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,832
- May we have a word?
- Certainly.

44
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:50,377
How did you know somebody was
tunneling into the Royal Gallery?

45
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:52,236
That was very interesting.

46
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:55,021
There was fresh dirt
in the building next door.

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,811
Fresh dirt...

48
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,854
Would you like
to elaborate on that?

49
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:03,655
It was an elementary deduction
based on the clues at hand.

50
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:07,274
But didn't Scotland Yard see
the very same clues?

51
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:10,443
I see and observe.

52
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,519
Isn't that rather redundant?

53
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,238
Describe the front of this building.

54
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:25,355
Without looking,
describe the front of this house.

55
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:28,358
Well, it's brick...

56
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:31,333
...it's got black railings, I think,

57
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,262
and windows.

58
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:37,322
- How many windows?
- How many?

59
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,422
I don't know.

60
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:45,033
Quite so. He sees,
but he does not observe.

61
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:47,754
Whereas I see and observe,

62
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:50,670
and thus bring many
notorious blackguards to justice.

63
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,425
Hear, hear!

64
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,943
Did I put that reporter in his place?

65
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,573
Just for the record...

66
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:05,704
...how many windows are there
in the front of this building?

67
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:07,749
I haven't the foggiest idea.

68
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,701
There are fifteen windows,
you fool!

69
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,853
Fifteen!

70
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:19,526
Not only that...

71
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:25,324
Not only that, but the reporter
you just embarrassed...

72
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,389
he knows how to type,
is somewhat nearsighted,

73
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:30,665
and recently returned
from a holiday.

74
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:34,953
"And how do you
know that, Watson?"

75
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:37,193
Elementary.
From the creases on his wrist

76
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:38,854
where a typist
presses against the table.

77
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,822
Do you think this is
a good likeness of me?

78
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,237
Wonderful story,
by the way,

79
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:50,275
but on page two,
you have me admitting a mistake.

80
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:52,552
A writer must write
of which he knows.

81
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,303
Do you think
that's really necessary?

82
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:58,601
I mean, tarnishing the image
and all that?

83
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,130
Hello.

84
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,571
What have we here?

85
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,130
Something's afoot.

86
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:20,873
How many times have I told you
to stay away from my experiments?

87
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,490
Something wrong?

88
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,147
I seem to spend an increasing
amount of my precious time

89
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,180
correcting your blunders,
both private and public!

90
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,739
I see. It's the Clay case.

91
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:39,461
You still in a snit over that?

92
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,938
Well, if you want my opinion...

93
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,582
I beg your pardon?
Opinion, did you say?

94
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:48,066
Oh, my God.
Not that speech again.

95
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:50,527
May I remind you,
for your information, sir,

96
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,904
that your opinions are my opinions.

97
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,661
Oh, piffle.

98
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,577
I created the character
of Sherlock Holmes,

99
00:07:57,642 --> 00:08:00,162
and hired you
merely to play the part...

100
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:01,859
snatching you from the gutter.

101
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,647
Hardly the gutter, old boy.

102
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,812
After all, I was once
an actor of note.

103
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:11,525
Whose last play ran a total
of one-half of one performance.

104
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:14,881
I'll have you know
Shadow of Death

105
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,961
with Reginald Kincaid

106
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:20,678
was a towering work,
decades ahead of its time.

107
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,680
Lesson number two.
Advanced Bowing.

108
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:28,511
My only regret was that it ended
before the climactic third-act duel.

109
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:31,204
Too bad you didn't have
a chance to see it.

110
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:34,088
I've no use for
theatrical swordplay.

111
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:37,220
All I ask is that
you obey a few simple rules,

112
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:38,728
not the least of which is,

113
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:41,314
a case is not closed
until I say it's closed.

114
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:45,345
I think you underestimate
my own native deductive abilities.

115
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,904
Do you hear those footsteps?

116
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,245
I'd say this was a woman
about five-feet-five,

117
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:52,417
weight about
twelve-and-a-half stone,

118
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,211
age fifty-four. Voilà.

119
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:01,857
Blown yourself up again?

120
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:05,441
It's for you...
your Baker Street Irregulars.

121
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,072
Hello, boys.

122
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:09,511
Wiggins, give it back.

123
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,925
Just tryin' to earn a living.

124
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:15,682
We heard you was
looking for us, Doctor.

125
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,822
Yes, there's been some trouble

126
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,189
concerning the break-in
at the Royal Gallery.

127
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,629
What?

128
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:30,176
We heard that Mr. Holmes
declared the case closed.

129
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:32,866
That will prove,
after some creative writing,

130
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:35,390
to be merely a ruse
on Mr. Holmes's part.

131
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:39,292
Something's not right...
John Clay does not deal in works of art.

132
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:42,433
I need you boys to have a look around...
eyes sharp, ears quick.

133
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:45,535
A copper apiece for your trouble,
and a shilling for what you learn.

134
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,060
We'll do our best, won't we, lads?

135
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,883
Don't let us keep you, boys.
Come on... out.

136
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,477
Don't worry about a thing.

137
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,135
We know how much you could use
some real assistance.

138
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,294
You're making a laughingstock
of me. How can I be...

139
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:04,707
How can I be expected
to maintain a character

140
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:07,043
when you belittle me
in front of those hooligans?

141
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,565
Are we talking of the same man
who once declared

142
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,328
that the late Colonel Howard

143
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:14,594
had been bludgeoned to death
by a blunt "excrement"?

144
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:17,411
Is it my fault
you have such poor handwriting?

145
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,779
Anyway, it was just a little mistake.

146
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:21,634
He's been at it again.

147
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,929
- I never liked that woman.
- Come in, Mrs. Hudson.

148
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,532
I found it under a loose board
in the stairwell.

149
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:30,588
Thank you.

150
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:36,640
An occasional libation
enables me to stiffen my resolve.

151
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,229
Your resolve
should be pickled by now.

152
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:42,083
I don't believe that either of you
realize what pressure I'm under!

153
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,866
Do you know what it's like
to commit to memory

154
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,266
a never-ending list
of clues and deductions

155
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:50,179
to be parroted back
to Lestrade and reporters?

156
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:52,797
Blood stains on a toothpick?
Cigar ash?

157
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,722
New soil in the garden next door?

158
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,478
Endless twaddle!

159
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:58,173
Twaddle!

160
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:01,506
Are you referring to
the systematic gathering of evidence

161
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:03,993
and the logical deductions
based thereon?

162
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:05,562
I am referring to twaddle!

163
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,569
You would be well served

164
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:11,939
to include fewer of these dreary details
in future chronicles,

165
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,208
and place greater emphasis on me.

166
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:17,505
I am, after all, the one
the public really cares about.

167
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,998
Would you be so kind as to
excuse us for a moment?

168
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:29,560
Careful, Watson!
Remember your blood pressure!

169
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,659
And good riddance to bad rubbish,
I must say.

170
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:39,329
Am I to understand
that you are giving me notice?

171
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:42,297
Let's just say that
the curtain has come down

172
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:45,020
on yet another
miserable performance.

173
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:47,831
Right.

174
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:53,655
I was once a figment
of your imagination.

175
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,214
But now, Sherlock Holmes
belongs to the whole world.

176
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:10,912
At last we're free
of that ungrateful baggage!

177
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:14,425
From now on, things are gonna be
much more pleasant around here.

178
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:19,224
An actor?!

179
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:23,264
Nothing the matter,
nothing at all.

180
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,435
Back to work.

181
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,676
Hold my calls.

182
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:34,778
We'll start at the beginning...

183
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,535
...shall we?

184
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,641
It was about nine years ago.

185
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:42,463
One of my patients was
a Scotland Yard inspector

186
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,895
investigating
the Paxton murder case.

187
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,935
I gave him the name
of the murderer,

188
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:49,658
but gave credit to
a nonexistent detective.

189
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,532
At the time,
I was hoping for an appointment

190
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:56,948
to the staff of a rather conservative
medical college.

191
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,292
I knew that they'd
frown on my little...

192
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,629
- Hobby?
- Exactly.

193
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:03,932
Well, I didn't get the appointment.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Instead, what I got was
a quite unanticipated public demand

195
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,533
to meet this Sherlock Holmes.

196
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:13,147
So you hired this Reginald Kincaid.

197
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,557
He was an actor.

198
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:17,657
Unfortunately, he was also
a gambler, a womanizer,

199
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,320
and a drunkard.

200
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:22,653
John, you have jeopardized
the integrity of English literature.

201
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,370
Still, I should have known.

202
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,733
He was always borrowing
large sums of money off me

203
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,101
and never paying me back.

204
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,629
The cad.

205
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:35,102
Don't worry.
We deducted it from your royalties.

206
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:39,034
- Who else knows of this?
- No one.

207
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,971
Except Mrs. Hudson
and the Irregulars.

208
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,656
But it's time now for the public
to learn the truth.

209
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,187
The truth?

210
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,042
Certainly.

211
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,339
No one will want to
read of that twit again.

212
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,941
His popularity will plummet.

213
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:56,218
They'll be desperate
for my new creation.

214
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:57,911
What new creation?

215
00:13:58,014 --> 00:13:59,574
John Watson, the Crime Doctor!

216
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:03,416
I could have it ready
for your very next issue.

217
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,135
Sit down, John.

218
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,678
People buy the Strand magazine

219
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,401
expecting to read a story
in which Sherlock Holmes

220
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,692
solves the case,
not the Crime Surgeon.

221
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:22,902
Crime Doctor.

222
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:25,723
Crime Doctor, Crime Surgeon,
Crime Dentist...

223
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,611
who cares, really?

224
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:28,954
Let's face it, John,

225
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:31,442
Sherlock Holmes is worth
a fortune to the magazine.

226
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,076
You're stuck with him.

227
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,973
Norman, I'll write what I want.
There's nothing you can do.

228
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,539
The devil there isn't.

229
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:44,850
You can't go in there!

230
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:45,872
What is this?

231
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:49,559
Sorry, Doctor, but we found something.
Down by the docks.

232
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,154
- Excellent!
- Hello, ducks.

233
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:53,235
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

234
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:54,584
Do you work here?

235
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:56,724
Watson, I'm warning you...

236
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,829
it's Sherlock Holmes, or we'll
sue you for everything you're worth!

237
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,769
And I mean everything!

238
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:07,734
Anyone seen my watch?

239
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:14,039
- There it is.
- Camden Paper Mill.

240
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,726
Burned about four this morning.

241
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:19,698
- Same time as the Clay robbery.
- On the button.

242
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:22,106
Good lad!
Now we're getting somewhere.

243
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,731
Let's take a look around.

244
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,778
Went up like a torch, they say.

245
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:29,942
Well, it's full of wood pulp
and paper, you see?

246
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:34,260
I'm sorry, sir.
No one's allowed in this area.

247
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:37,080
Quite all right, I assure you.
I'm Dr. John Watson.

248
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:38,969
Nobody's sick here.

249
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,206
You don't understand.

250
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,257
- John Watson.
- The Crime Doctor.

251
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,679
That's right.
John Watson, the Crime Doctor.

252
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:53,102
Crime Doctor?
Never heard of him.

253
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:56,374
Though your name
sounds a bit familiar.

254
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:58,998
All right.

255
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,619
I am Dr. John Watson...

256
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,504
...author of
the Sherlock Holmes mysteries.

257
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,287
The Sherlock Holmes?

258
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:18,510
Me and the wife has read
every one of his stories.

259
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,920
All right.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

260
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:25,425
I'm sorry, I still can't let you in.
Strict orders about that, I'm afraid.

261
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:29,720
But Mr. Holmes...
did he send you here?

262
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,241
He certainly did not!

263
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:38,037
Well, perhaps the next time
you should check with him first.

264
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:40,144
Save yourself a trip.

265
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,534
You try and fight crime in this city,

266
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,251
and all you hear about
is Sherlock Holmes!

267
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,135
"What's he like?
When will you see him next?"

268
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,534
Never, that's when! Never!

269
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,966
Doctor, dear,
keep your voice down.

270
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:58,577
- Why should I?
- Because you have visitors.

271
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:01,495
Inspector Lestrade
and a Lord Smithwick.

272
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,790
Of the Treasury?

273
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,930
Gentlemen, won't you come up?

274
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,676
Oh, yes, thank you very much.
Mr. Holmes is in, is he?

275
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:29,329
Dr. Watson will see you,

276
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:33,108
although he is quite busy
with his scholarly pursuits.

277
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:39,600
Gentlemen.

278
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,605
Good afternoon, Inspector.

279
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,116
This is Lord Smithwick,

280
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,832
Her Majesty's
Chancellor of the Exchequer.

281
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:52,046
My pleasure, sir.

282
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:54,484
His Lordship
wishes to see Mr. Holmes.

283
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,135
I'm sorry to say
he's not here at the moment.

284
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,857
Oh, how disappointing!

285
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:02,315
As I said before,
I really don't think

286
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:05,237
Mr. Holmes's involvement
in this case is necessary.

287
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,756
- I quite agree.
- You do?

288
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:10,764
However, the Crime Doctor
is at your disposal.

289
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:12,812
Who the deuce
is the Crime Doctor?

290
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,925
What?

291
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,891
Most amusing, but this is a matter
of the gravest urgency.

292
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,069
When do you expect Mr. Holmes?

293
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,490
Not for a while.
He's out of town.

294
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,834
Good afternoon.

295
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:28,210
Well...

296
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:30,987
...too bad.

297
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:34,378
I'm sure we'll be able to get along
quite well without Mr. Holmes.

298
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:35,729
Wait!

299
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:38,218
Today's Friday, isn't it?

300
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,234
Of course it is. Silly me.

301
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,763
Holmes is supposed
to be back tonight.

302
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,842
How fortunate.

303
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:48,243
Very well. We shall return
at seven tonight.

304
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,063
Come along, Inspector.

305
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,822
Till then, gentlemen.

306
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:55,633
- We've made this trip for nothing.
- I must ask you once again...

307
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,363
Where did you get that hat?

308
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,948
Where did you get that tile?

309
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,110
Isn't it a knobby one?
It's just the proper style

310
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,402
I would like to have one
just the same as that

311
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,507
Where'er I go,
they shout Hello!

312
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,750
And where'd you get that hat?

313
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,648
Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that tile?

314
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,031
Good evening.

315
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,816
Have you seen Peter Bright?
He's disappeared.

316
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:26,639
Hello, Connie.

317
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:31,886
All right...

318
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:34,833
Who did it?

319
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:39,216
Come on... which one of ya
pinched me?

320
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:41,550
- Pinched, you say?
- That's right.

321
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:45,000
May I be of... some assistance?

322
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:49,420
The name is Holmes...
Sherlock Holmes.

323
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:55,048
Constance Peyton, sir.
Pleased to meet ya.

324
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,430
Charmed.

325
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:59,051
Now, let's see...

326
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:02,951
By careful observation
of the patrons of these premises,

327
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:06,221
I have been able to deduce the identity

328
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,875
of the fiend who pinched you.

329
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:12,104
Me. Did it again!

330
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,896
- Thank you, my good man.
- Thank you, sir.

331
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,232
I'll make this brief.

332
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,079
I'll make this brief.

333
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:34,350
I'll need to see some money.
It's been five days now.

334
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:37,416
- Now, see here, my good man...
- Go ahead, sir, it's on me.

335
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,015
Thank you, sir.

336
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,414
- How are things?
- Couldn't be better.

337
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,428
Good health.

338
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:49,543
I'll meke this braif.

339
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,365
I'll make this brief...
I want you to come back.

340
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,951
Like I predicted... you need me.

341
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,485
I do not need you.

342
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:58,631
Then what are you here for?
I didn't call for you.

343
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:01,070
All right, I need you...
for this one blasted time.

344
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,397
One time, and that's all?
You're gonna have to do better than that.

345
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,146
Don't push me.
You've already run out of money.

346
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:09,452
This is because you lack
the necessary skills

347
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,860
to gain decent employment.

348
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,889
Wrong, Watson.

349
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:18,156
I have been honing my ability
of elementary deduction

350
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:20,110
to a razor's edge... observe.

351
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,865
Excuse me, sir.

352
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:24,040
How are things
on the subcontinent?

353
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,539
I beg your pardon?

354
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:28,070
You are a reporter just back
from India, are you not?

355
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:31,757
I'm a barrister, and I've never
been to India in my life.

356
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,638
- But you do read the Times.
- Of course.

357
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:36,132
There you have it.

358
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:37,517
My card.

359
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,386
I'll ask you just once more.
Are you coming with me or not?

360
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:48,585
I would rather waltz naked
through the fires of hell.

361
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:50,694
I can see coming here was a mistake.

362
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:54,442
Excellent deduction.
Keep up the good work.

363
00:21:59,022 --> 00:22:02,055
Gentlemen.
And what can I do for you?

364
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:04,524
A mystery to be solved?

365
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,050
You might say that.

366
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,808
There's a little matter
of a gambling debt.

367
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:12,040
The mystery is
why you ain't paid it.

368
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:16,102
Gentlemen, you are dealing
with Sherlock Holmes,

369
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:18,890
a man of honor and character
beyond reproach.

370
00:22:18,957 --> 00:22:20,299
There he is!

371
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:22,732
That's the bloke
who pinched me bum!

372
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,290
Pardon me! Pardon me!

373
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,015
Excuse me, luv.

374
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:43,178
- Didn't I say seven o'clock?
- Forgive me for being late.

375
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:45,894
Is Mr. Holmes with you?

376
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:50,501
Well, actually, Lord Smithwick,

377
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:53,321
a short time ago
I received a wire from Holmes

378
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:55,623
instructing me to
take down the details

379
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:59,914
and begin the investigation...
without him, as it were.

380
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,150
- What?
- Believe it or not,

381
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:04,673
I am every bit Holmes's equal
as a detective.

382
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:10,282
I happen to know that you
recently recovered from an illness,

383
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:13,990
that you smoke a pipe...
probably rosewood...

384
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,066
and you spent time in China.

385
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:18,594
This is no time for parlor games.

386
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,252
This is a matter for professionals.

387
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,291
You gotta help me!
There's two big men...

388
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,817
You're back!
So good to see you!

389
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,665
Isn't this a clever disguise?
A drunken lout... very realistic.

390
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,472
This woman said
I pinched her bottom...

391
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,742
Pinched her bum! Ha ha!

392
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,513
Gentlemen... Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

393
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,843
It's good to see the department
is letting you out at night again.

394
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:05,055
Trouble at the Exchequer?

395
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:06,721
Well, to be honest...

396
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:09,313
Wait... how did you know?

397
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,741
The same way that I can tell
you've recently recovered

398
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,322
from an illness, smoke a pipe...
probably rosewood...

399
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:18,630
- and have spent some time in...
- China.

400
00:24:18,697 --> 00:24:21,217
Amazing!

401
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,816
Thank you.

402
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:27,745
Before we start,
perhaps a little sherry?

403
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:30,403
I wish we could,

404
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:32,360
but the matter which brings me here

405
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:35,937
involves the fate
of the entire Empire.

406
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,310
I see. Perhaps a whiskey, then?

407
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:40,545
Perhaps later.

408
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,884
Tell me the details,
and omit nothing.

409
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:46,115
- Watson, pay close attention.
- Do you know what these are?

410
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,841
- I do.
- So do I.

411
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:50,530
Plates for the Bank of England's
five pound note.

412
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,803
- Undoubtedly.
- Or very good imitations.

413
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,432
- Precisely.
- Exactly.

414
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:55,451
Indeed.

415
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,015
That's cleared that up.
How about that whiskey?

416
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,024
- May I?
- I suppose so.

417
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,841
Just two nights ago,
these clever forgeries

418
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:10,496
were exchanged
for the genuine plates.

419
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,534
If the real plates are in the hands
of some foreign power...

420
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,549
Or someone even
more treacherous,

421
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:18,502
the kingdom could find itself
awash in counterfeit notes.

422
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:22,211
And I don't have to tell you
what that would mean.

423
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,236
Yes, you do.

424
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:30,948
It would mean, quite simply,
economic ruin for England.

425
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:34,015
Nobody would know
which five pound notes were real

426
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,330
and which weren't.

427
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,694
Gentlemen, I accept this case.

428
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,534
My fee will be five hundred pounds...

429
00:25:45,637 --> 00:25:47,360
payable in ten pound notes.

430
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:50,015
Good evening.

431
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:57,562
We can all rest
a little easier now, Inspector.

432
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,198
Drive on, my good man.

433
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:01,440
I don't suppose it would
make any difference

434
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:05,218
if I said I have grave doubts
about Mr. Holmes.

435
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:06,713
I must confess,

436
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:10,619
I feel a bit prouder
knowing Sherlock Holmes is British.

437
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,666
Do you suppose
he took the case, Professor?

438
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:22,370
Watson?

439
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:28,094
My dear boy,
how could he resist?

440
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:30,882
This is working out
so very well.

441
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:32,257
Driver.

442
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,295
Gentlemen... I am here.

443
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,916
Mr. Holmes, at last!

444
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:02,462
Welcome to
Her Majesty's Royal Mint.

445
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:06,240
This is one of my
long-time employees, Mister...

446
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:08,249
- Hadlers, sir.
- Hadlers, yes.

447
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:11,290
Inspector Lestrade was
inquiring about the vaults.

448
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,909
It's my guess that it's an inside job
by someone with a key.

449
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:19,103
You have a key,
don't you, Hadlers?

450
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:21,762
Me? No!

451
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,761
Inspector, please.
Mr. Holmes will take over now.

452
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,623
It's quite all right.

453
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,217
As a matter of fact, Lestrade,

454
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,396
- you can be of some help.
- Of course.

455
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:33,532
Hold my coat.
It's hot in here.

456
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:40,574
So this is where
the printing plates are kept.

457
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:45,817
Very interesting...

458
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:53,409
No harm done.

459
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:58,011
Tell me, how many people
have access to this vault?

460
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,804
Three persons only...

461
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,622
myself, the Commissioner
for Seals and Engravings,

462
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:05,406
and the printing supervisor,
Peter Giles.

463
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,961
I should like to speak
to this, uh, third person.

464
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:10,454
He didn't turn up
for work this morning.

465
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:14,300
We've already done
some checking on this Giles.

466
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:17,664
He is a widower,
with one child named Leslie.

467
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,998
I've seen her
once or twice, myself.

468
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,799
A very pretty girl,
in an unusual sort of way.

469
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:27,734
- Pretty?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite.

470
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:30,775
Watson, make a note of that.

471
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,197
Though Mr. Giles himself
seemed slightly uncomfortable

472
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:37,174
when I complimented him
on her appearance.

473
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:42,997
Surely you can't believe
that Peter Giles was involved!

474
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,820
The man's worked here
for over thirty years,

475
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:48,953
and he was very religious, too.
Wouldn't you say so, uh...

476
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:50,168
Hadlers, sir.

477
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:52,661
Oh, yes. He was always
quoting from the Psalms.

478
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:55,866
The Psalms...
one of my favorite books.

479
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,268
The... Bible, wasn't it?

480
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:03,966
I suppose you'll
want to speak to this Peter Giles.

481
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:06,933
I've never been one
for religious talk, myself.

482
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:10,870
On the other hand,
no leads must be overlooked.

483
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,437
You can rest assured,
your Lordship,

484
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:15,893
we shall be investigating
the daughter, as well.

485
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,519
I must be going.

486
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,583
Come here! You ninny,
what are you doing over there?

487
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:24,989
Amazing fellow, really.

488
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,323
All right, now go! Go!

489
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,172
Open this door!

490
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:36,628
Giles, open the door.
It's Sherlock Holmes.

491
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:39,674
Stand back, I'll break it down.

492
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,276
Half a tick, Mr. Holmes.

493
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,912
You can't go walking into
someone's residence,

494
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,468
pokin' about
their personal possessions,

495
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:02,580
disturbin' their privacy.

496
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:07,349
That's for Scotland Yard.

497
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:11,644
Anybody home?

498
00:30:14,717 --> 00:30:16,179
Nobody home.

499
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:18,805
- You're treading on the mat.
- Sorry.

500
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,282
Nice, tidy little place.

501
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:25,397
- A French postcard.
- Really?

502
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:27,225
I knew a chap
who collected these once.

503
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,365
He had this wonderful one
of two women...

504
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,846
- Oh. It's just the Eiffel Tower.
- Quite a bit of correspondence there.

505
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:36,468
I'd say Giles hadn't been home
for several days.

506
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:39,961
Anything of interest
in that card?

507
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:42,995
It says, "Having a gay time here,
but need a holiday.

508
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:45,270
Will see you on Monday. L."

509
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,983
I wonder who that can be?

510
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:51,636
"L"... is that an old friend?
A secret lover?

511
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:53,943
It's my guess
it's his daughter Leslie.

512
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:56,051
I'll wager you're right.

513
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:01,208
That's right...
let him deduce everything.

514
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:04,655
When Lestrade returns,
go about your sleuthing routine.

515
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,039
The full treatment?

516
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:09,368
Whatever it takes to keep him occupied
while I look around.

517
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:12,915
It would appear as if Mr. Giles
has taken a holiday.

518
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:15,255
I expected no less.

519
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:20,308
If you'll allow me.

520
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:32,696
- Very interesting up here.
- Excuse me.

521
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:51,376
My word.

522
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:55,471
Don't touch that!

523
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,233
There may be fingerprints.

524
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:04,436
The book of Psalms...

525
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:09,080
As I anticipated... the Bible.

526
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:12,886
All starting to fit together
rather neatly, I'd say.

527
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,265
Stay with me, Lestrade.

528
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,262
Investigating crime calls for
the searching out of patterns.

529
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:33,328
Now, take the patterns
in this carpet.

530
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,695
Rosettes and what appears
to be cherubs.

531
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,679
Is that a cherub?

532
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:45,427
What have you there?

533
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,218
Oh, this.

534
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:49,359
I just found this
in the fireplace.

535
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,918
Careful. Might be evidence.

536
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:53,420
Really?

537
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:57,238
"E-R-M-E-R-E."

538
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,955
What do you make of it?

539
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:05,586
Are you blind, Lestrade?
Tell him, Watson.

540
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:08,173
Correct me if I'm wrong,

541
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,767
but this piece of paper
is part of a map.

542
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:13,492
A location.

543
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,398
Emere...

544
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,667
Cashmere...

545
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,220
Windermere!
Lake Windermere!

546
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:28,660
Brilliant!

547
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:31,628
The lake district
is a perfect place to hide.

548
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:33,906
Nobody goes there
this time of year.

549
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:35,697
We'll wire Windermere

550
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,285
and see if Giles
has made his appearance yet.

551
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:40,910
And don't you worry, Mr. Holmes...

552
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:44,361
we'll have this case
wrapped up in no time.

553
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,357
Unique, actually.

554
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:52,331
- So much for the great detective!
- Very creative, Watson.

555
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,666
Something that would never
have occurred to the likes of me.

556
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,831
Imagine...
a Sherlock Holmes adventure

557
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,283
in which Lestrade
solves the bloody case!

558
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:04,974
Calm yourself.

559
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:08,394
There's a healthy chunk of mystery
yet to be solved.

560
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:10,410
It's to Windermere for us,

561
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,256
where, I assure you,
the game is still afoot.

562
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,028
Where, I assure you,
the game is still afoot.

563
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,250
"As was his habit,
Sherlock Holmes

564
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:33,323
sat in the railway carriage,
lost in thought."

565
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,166
You must be a millionaire...

566
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,203
Are you Sherlock Holmes?

567
00:34:48,307 --> 00:34:51,024
I am indeed, madam.
Would you like my autograph?

568
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,394
You put me old man in jail,
you did!

569
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:59,979
"From these moments
of quiet, intense reflection

570
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,162
"would inevitably spring

571
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:05,457
some new insight."

572
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:07,759
Stop it, you silly girl!

573
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:10,061
Go on back!

574
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,903
Sorry about that.

575
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:26,800
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

576
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:29,198
Right.

577
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:31,754
I'm gonna think, too.

578
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:39,913
What shall we think about?

579
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,327
Allow me to introduce myself.

580
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,295
I am the Right Honorable
Gerald Fitzwalter Johnson,

581
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,894
Lord Mayor.

582
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:26,511
This is my daughter Christabel.

583
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:29,641
Hello, Mr. Holmes.

584
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:32,778
We're enthusiastic readers
of your articles in the Strand.

585
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:36,643
My daughter, in particular,
reads each one several times.

586
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,266
Don't even think about it.

587
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,636
I believe we have
something for you.

588
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:46,980
A man matching Mr. Giles's
description arrived two nights ago.

589
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:51,910
This is Andrews,
a dock worker here on the lake.

590
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:53,892
He remembers the man
quite well.

591
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:57,065
Andrews, this is Mr. Holmes,
come to our fair community

592
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,785
to investigate a matter
of great importance.

593
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:01,829
You may begin, Mr. Holmes.

594
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:11,077
What makes you remember
this man so clearly, Mr. Andrews?

595
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:15,911
- I remember this man...
- Your hat.

596
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,525
I remember this man so clearly

597
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:22,762
because he was carrying
a brown leather suitcase.

598
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,336
The suitcase was fastened to his wrist
with a pair of silver handcuffs.

599
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:29,227
It was very heavy,

600
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:31,944
and he commented on the weight
several times.

601
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:36,234
- He asked Donald Ayers...
- A local boatman.

602
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:39,978
...a local boatman,
to transport him across the lake

603
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:42,826
to a cottage he had rented.

604
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:53,057
Make a note of that.

605
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,387
I'm sure Holmes would
like to speak to this boatman,

606
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,922
Donald Ayers.

607
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,403
Yes, indeed.

608
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:14,502
The thing of it is,
no one has seen the fellow

609
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:17,474
or the man with the suitcase
since that night.

610
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:19,752
You mean they've gone missing?

611
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,398
My theory,
if you'll permit me, is this...

612
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,890
the storm may have done
both of them in.

613
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:28,779
- They went out in a storm?
- Watson, please.

614
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:32,163
They went out in a storm?

615
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,262
The lake can get very rough
at this time of the year.

616
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:42,851
Here we are, our finest hotel...
the Shakespeare Arms.

617
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:50,917
We're all so proud to have you here.

618
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:53,834
The duke's absolutely
beside himself.

619
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:56,452
- The duke?
- Uh, the d-o-g.

620
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:02,339
- Sherlock Holmes and Doctor...?
- John Watson.

621
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:06,402
Now, if you'll just follow me,

622
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:09,288
I'll have your luggage
taken upstairs.

623
00:39:09,354 --> 00:39:11,776
Stay down, now!
Sit, boy, sit!

624
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,909
Now, then, Dukie,
you stay down here

625
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,150
while I take the gentlemen upstairs.

626
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,370
He's taken quite a fancy to you.

627
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:24,711
He doesn't like everybody,
you know.

628
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:29,856
Fetch!

629
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:33,855
What he likes is the summer,

630
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:36,100
with all them ramblers!

631
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:43,550
The King Lear Room...
the finest we've got.

632
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:50,150
Yours is upstairs, Doctor.

633
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:53,216
Be careful of the carpet...
the mice have been at it.

634
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:56,136
We call this the Hamlet Room,

635
00:39:56,201 --> 00:40:00,227
and it does have
a lovely view of the lake.

636
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,846
Now, if you'll excuse me, Doctor...

637
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,341
Watson.

638
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:10,020
I'll just go and see
if Mr. Holmes is all right.

639
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:44,325
Would you mind
swapping rooms with me?

640
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,724
I once played King Lear,
and, quite frankly,

641
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,303
that room would
revive memories of rotten fruit.

642
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:52,479
One room's the same
as another to me.

643
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,760
Thank you.

644
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:01,566
What a dreary place this is.

645
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:04,987
Excuse me, but you are
Sherlock Holmes, aren't you?

646
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,273
That depends.

647
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:09,244
Do you have a relative
who was recently sent to prison?

648
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,292
Me? Why, no.

649
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:14,081
Yes, then. I am Sherlock Holmes.

650
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,466
We could all consider it an honor
if you'd have a drink with us.

651
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,068
A drink.

652
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:22,428
I was just saying to my good friend
Dr. Watson here

653
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:25,153
what a lovely village this is.

654
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:37,668
I'll have a double whiskey.

655
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:40,067
Just to ward off
the chill of the evening.

656
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,948
A double whiskey
for Mr. Holmes, please.

657
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:46,275
A toast... to the greatest detective
in all the world.

658
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,055
Thank you, gentlemen.
I am touched.

659
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,947
I can vouch for that.

660
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:53,249
You remind me of someone
I once encountered

661
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:56,546
during the curious affair
of the Manchurian Mambo.

662
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:58,335
Could I have a word?

663
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,254
I believe that was
the Manchurian Mamba.

664
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:06,364
Mamba, mambo...
what's the difference?

665
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:08,924
Very little, other than
one is a deadly poisonous snake,

666
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:12,127
and the other is
a rather festive Caribbean dance.

667
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:17,597
It was a night just like any other,
when someone knocked at the door.

668
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,515
I opened it,
and there were these Manchurians

669
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,362
doing this rather festive
Caribbean dance.

670
00:42:23,428 --> 00:42:26,657
Manchurian Mambo...

671
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:28,545
Steady, Watson.

672
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:32,284
Just get through it
one more time,

673
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:34,493
then you're rid of the fellow.

674
00:42:34,562 --> 00:42:36,667
What a pleasant thought.

675
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,606
I feel much better.

676
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:42,103
Quite euphoric!

677
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:44,415
...as the snake struck at me,

678
00:42:44,514 --> 00:42:46,424
I danced out of the way.

679
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,010
And if it hadn't been
for my flawless footwork,

680
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:53,180
I'd be standing here
a dead man today.

681
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:57,755
What about another drink?

682
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:02,780
I have to be up early tomorrow,
and I need all my wits about me.

683
00:43:04,354 --> 00:43:05,915
Perhaps just one more.

684
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:17,176
Holmes, sweet Holmes.

685
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,970
You're not the Hound
of the Baskervilles, you know.

686
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:50,717
Fresh air... that's what I need.

687
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:02,998
That's better.

688
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:18,005
Help!

689
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:25,815
Help me!

690
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,703
Watson, wake up!

691
00:44:34,398 --> 00:44:37,529
Help!

692
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,702
My God!

693
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:45,621
Hang on, I'm coming!

694
00:44:47,262 --> 00:44:48,855
Hang on, here I am!

695
00:44:48,926 --> 00:44:50,552
Quickly!

696
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,531
Give me your hand.

697
00:44:52,638 --> 00:44:54,493
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here.

698
00:44:55,742 --> 00:44:57,084
Well done.

699
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,117
Pull, quickly!
Pull harder!

700
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:04,061
Don't let go!

701
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,221
Well done.

702
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,589
Jolly good.

703
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:10,643
Oh, shit!

704
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:17,367
Fascinating... this railing appears
to have been cut by someone.

705
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:18,485
Get him off!

706
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:34,618
Good morning, gentlemen.

707
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:39,990
This is the cottage Giles leased
from a company in London.

708
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:41,849
Allow me to show you the way.

709
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,731
Mr. Mayor, don't move!

710
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:47,098
Not until Mr. Holmes
has had a chance

711
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,368
to inspect the area for clues.

712
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:51,770
By God, I've trained you well, Watson.

713
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:54,771
Now follow me closely.

714
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:03,734
- What am I looking for?
- Footprints.

715
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:07,065
Right.

716
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:10,198
- Have I found any yet?
- No, not yet.

717
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,657
Let me know when I do.

718
00:46:22,652 --> 00:46:25,401
Hello? Anyone at home?

719
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:39,026
If Giles was headed here...

720
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:41,944
...it's obvious he never arrived.

721
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:47,634
They've found Donald Ayers.

722
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:50,031
Who?

723
00:46:54,554 --> 00:46:56,790
Dreadful!

724
00:46:56,858 --> 00:46:59,062
Stand back, lads.
Leave it to me.

725
00:47:01,242 --> 00:47:03,282
Constable, please.

726
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:05,394
Not until Mr. Holmes
has had a chance

727
00:47:05,498 --> 00:47:07,865
to investigate the body for clues.

728
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,780
Yes...

729
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:32,751
...it is my opinion
that he is dead.

730
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:34,743
He's a genius!

731
00:47:40,888 --> 00:47:42,132
Thank you.

732
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,883
Here you are.
Two first-class tickets to London.

733
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,286
Well, Mr. Holmes, any theories?

734
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:58,254
Indeed. Obviously Giles and Ayers
were caught in a storm

735
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:00,335
too far from the shore
to swim for it.

736
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:03,255
And with that heavy suitcase
attached to his wrist,

737
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,781
and the lake being so deep...

738
00:48:04,887 --> 00:48:07,091
Quite. Pulled the poor wretch
to the bottom.

739
00:48:08,023 --> 00:48:09,911
Struggling futilely,

740
00:48:10,008 --> 00:48:12,113
flailing desperately

741
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:16,853
as the cold, black water
sealed his fate forever.

742
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,207
Well, it's certainly been a laugh.

743
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,741
Thank you very much.

744
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,717
We must be off.
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mayor.

745
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,068
The same, Doctor.

746
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,326
Now... now...

747
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,692
We know for a fact
that Giles was on the boat.

748
00:48:40,758 --> 00:48:42,962
No, we don't.

749
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,939
Oh.

750
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,210
Well, we do know for a fact
that Giles arrived at Windermere.

751
00:48:48,278 --> 00:48:50,067
No, he didn't.

752
00:48:50,134 --> 00:48:53,712
He didn't?
I thought he did.

753
00:48:56,821 --> 00:48:59,091
Well, we really know that Giles

754
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:01,875
was behind the theft
of the printing plates.

755
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,918
No, he wasn't.

756
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:08,333
Fine.

757
00:49:09,174 --> 00:49:11,378
Just trying to get things straight.

758
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,608
Tell me something...

759
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:17,296
is there anything
we do know for a fact?

760
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:18,293
Yes.

761
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:20,301
What?

762
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:23,178
That without a doubt

763
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:27,027
there is an evil mastermind
behind all of this.

764
00:49:29,493 --> 00:49:32,656
Professor Moriarty?!

765
00:49:32,724 --> 00:49:34,896
Oh, for God's sake.

766
00:49:34,965 --> 00:49:38,226
You didn't tell me that
homicidal maniac was involved in this!

767
00:49:38,293 --> 00:49:40,748
Because I knew
you'd behave this way.

768
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,852
Bravo! Another triumph
for deductive reasoning!

769
00:49:43,957 --> 00:49:46,160
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

770
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:47,308
Pardon me.

771
00:49:47,412 --> 00:49:50,095
Wasn't I the one he tried
to kill last night?

772
00:49:50,164 --> 00:49:51,822
Merely a technicality.

773
00:49:51,891 --> 00:49:54,347
- Maybe for you, mate.
- Think, man...

774
00:49:54,419 --> 00:49:57,289
Who was supposed to sleep
in that room?

775
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,755
That's true... you were!

776
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,846
Moriarty knows I'm the only match
for his evil genius.

777
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:07,218
Are you sure he's not
trying to kill me?

778
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:10,131
Of course not.
He knows you're an idiot.

779
00:50:12,979 --> 00:50:14,354
Thank God.

780
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:30,957
Whoa, there. Steady.

781
00:50:31,826 --> 00:50:33,255
Stand. Here you are, miss.

782
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:42,256
Thank you.

783
00:50:42,322 --> 00:50:44,558
It's all very nice, miss.

784
00:50:46,258 --> 00:50:47,185
Miss Leslie Giles?

785
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,152
Yes?

786
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:52,625
Dr. John Watson, at your service.

787
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,795
And this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

788
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:02,408
But what do you want with me?

789
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:05,100
The government suspects
that your father has stolen

790
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,439
the printing plates
for the five pound note.

791
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:08,815
What?

792
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:11,751
They also believe he is at
the bottom of Lake Windermere,

793
00:51:11,825 --> 00:51:13,964
drowned like a rat.

794
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,897
Father...

795
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:25,263
- Get some water, please.
- Of course.

796
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:28,965
Father...

797
00:51:33,872 --> 00:51:36,076
Sorry for the fright, Miss Giles.

798
00:51:36,144 --> 00:51:39,013
Unfortunately, you fainted
before Holmes could add

799
00:51:39,088 --> 00:51:42,285
that he personally believes your father
not only innocent, but alive.

800
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:43,813
Really?

801
00:51:43,888 --> 00:51:47,052
Holmes believes
your father has been abducted.

802
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,349
Abducted! By whom?

803
00:51:50,448 --> 00:51:52,171
Abductors.

804
00:51:53,807 --> 00:51:56,458
You see, Miss Giles,

805
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:59,398
your father was described to us
as fanatically neat...

806
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:03,083
a fact confirmed by
the immaculateness of this very place.

807
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:05,640
I took the opportunity
to have a look around,

808
00:52:05,712 --> 00:52:07,883
and it is extremely tidy.

809
00:52:10,191 --> 00:52:12,460
One must ask, therefore,

810
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:16,870
why such a compulsively neat man
would leave an unmade bed,

811
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:20,140
unless he was snatched
from that very bed.

812
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:21,255
Oh, dear God.

813
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,905
Then a man posing as your father
was sent to Windermere

814
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:26,948
where a mock drowning
was staged,

815
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:29,901
unfortunately costing the life
of an innocent boatman named Ayers,

816
00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:31,395
forcibly drowned.

817
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,510
- Murdered.
- Why?

818
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:38,473
Why, you ask.

819
00:52:40,142 --> 00:52:42,116
Because...

820
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,848
Fill in the details.

821
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:47,333
Because someone
wanted us to believe

822
00:52:47,406 --> 00:52:50,440
that your father
and the printing plates

823
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,332
were lost at the bottom of the lake.

824
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,942
Thus Scotland Yard and that poor,
misguided fool Lestrade

825
00:52:56,046 --> 00:52:58,697
would foolishly believe
that the case was closed,

826
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:00,675
leaving the true villain free

827
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:03,913
to wreak havoc with
the economy of the Empire.

828
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:09,484
All quite... elementary.

829
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:17,962
Let me go!

830
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:26,186
Have courage!

831
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:30,055
You're not getting away
that easy!

832
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,158
Put me down!

833
00:53:33,228 --> 00:53:35,301
You don't know
who you're dealing with!

834
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:37,160
My name is Sherlock Holmes!

835
00:53:52,043 --> 00:53:53,418
Look out!

836
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,322
Sorry about this, Miss Giles.

837
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,659
Sorry about this, Miss Giles.

838
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:07,306
- Hurry!
- My bleeding shoe!

839
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:11,555
- They're gone.
- I know. I chased them away.

840
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,929
You brave, brave man.

841
00:54:13,996 --> 00:54:17,924
Danger is my trade...
but not yours.

842
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:20,516
It's unsafe for you
to sleep alone tonight...

843
00:54:20,587 --> 00:54:22,016
...unattended.

844
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,294
Yes, we insist
you stay with us.

845
00:54:24,363 --> 00:54:27,711
- But surely I'd be an imposition.
- Think nothing of it, my dear.

846
00:54:27,786 --> 00:54:30,950
Indeed, Holmes will be working
all night anyway,

847
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,905
so you can have his room.

848
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:41,729
Interesting... of Italian manufacture.

849
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:43,230
What?

850
00:54:43,306 --> 00:54:45,761
This shoe... brand-new.

851
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:47,939
Yes, very interesting.

852
00:54:49,226 --> 00:54:52,423
Do you think... do you think
she's ready for bed yet?

853
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,919
And if I'm not mistaken,

854
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:57,157
caked with mud mainly found
in the vicinity of the Thames.

855
00:54:57,225 --> 00:55:00,225
The Thames, yes.
Poor girl.

856
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,719
Poor, beautiful girl.

857
00:55:03,753 --> 00:55:05,793
Some sleep would do her good.

858
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:10,600
I can picture her lying there,
her eyes closed, gently breathing.

859
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:15,167
Her breasts heaving...

860
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:20,066
...as her supple,
nubile young body...

861
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:24,231
...caresses the cool,
limpid sheets...

862
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:26,685
Yes, the Thames it is.

863
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,342
Near Southwark...
interesting, isn't it?

864
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,098
To say the least.

865
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,193
Why would common ruffians
be wearing imported shoes?

866
00:55:36,296 --> 00:55:38,630
Not secondhand, mind you,
but brand-new.

867
00:55:44,072 --> 00:55:46,341
- What was that?
- What?

868
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:49,316
If it's not one thing...

869
00:55:50,536 --> 00:55:52,707
Oh, I'm sorry.

870
00:55:52,776 --> 00:55:55,361
I suppose I must be
still rather nervous.

871
00:55:55,431 --> 00:55:58,628
You may rest easy.
No one will disturb you tonight.

872
00:55:58,696 --> 00:56:01,347
- Isn't that so?
- Quite.

873
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:05,091
- Good night.
- Good night.

874
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:47,712
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were still asleep.

875
00:56:47,782 --> 00:56:51,229
Sleep? Who can sleep
when there's work to be done?

876
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:55,553
- Dr. Watson seems to have gone out.
- Really?

877
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:57,345
I wonder where.

878
00:56:58,854 --> 00:57:00,544
Who knows?

879
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:04,191
He has very little patience
with detective work.

880
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,077
Often becomes quite bored.

881
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:12,287
Your job must be very difficult.

882
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:15,356
One does get rather... tense.

883
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:17,021
I can imagine.

884
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:19,491
The hardest thing...

885
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:23,994
...is to find ways
to relieve that tension.

886
00:57:28,484 --> 00:57:30,393
So, you play the violin.

887
00:57:32,868 --> 00:57:35,235
Only if worst comes to worst.

888
00:57:36,388 --> 00:57:39,105
Well, I really don't
want to add to that tension,

889
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,823
so I think I'd better go
and finish getting dressed.

890
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:43,963
No, please, I assure you...

891
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:49,407
An occasional break
is quite refreshing.

892
00:57:49,476 --> 00:57:51,842
My mind thrives on diversity.

893
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:54,776
What? What?

894
00:57:54,852 --> 00:57:57,056
How many times have I
got to tell you to knock?

895
00:57:57,124 --> 00:57:59,066
Have you no respect
for people's privacy?

896
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:03,610
Right! You've gone
quite far enough,

897
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:06,367
overstepping the bounds
of propriety.

898
00:58:06,435 --> 00:58:09,185
Come along, my dear.
You'll be much safer with me.

899
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:12,099
- We'll have tea downstairs.
- Now, there's a good idea.

900
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:13,820
You have visitors.

901
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:16,989
Such carryings-on,
and in the middle of the day.

902
00:58:17,091 --> 00:58:20,865
This is a respectable
Presbyterian house, I assure you!

903
00:58:20,963 --> 00:58:23,067
Take no notice.
The woman drinks a bit.

904
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:24,283
Come in, welcome.

905
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,425
Good morning.

906
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:29,215
I've informed Lord Smithwick
of the findings in Windermere.

907
00:58:29,282 --> 00:58:31,456
Though the case did not
turn out as we hoped,

908
00:58:31,522 --> 00:58:35,297
Her Majesty did insist on
rewarding you for your efforts.

909
00:58:35,362 --> 00:58:38,875
Who am I to go against
the wishes of the Queen?

910
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:43,456
Stunning, isn't it?

911
00:58:44,642 --> 00:58:46,332
I'm overwhelmed.

912
00:58:46,434 --> 00:58:49,052
Pity you had to go
all the way to Windermere

913
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:50,976
merely to confirm my theories.

914
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:54,336
Think nothing of it.
If I hadn't gone to Windermere,

915
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:57,051
I could not have
confirmed my theories...

916
00:58:57,121 --> 00:59:00,983
namely, that your theories
are completely wrong.

917
00:59:01,057 --> 00:59:03,196
- What's that?
- This is utter nonsense.

918
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:06,582
He refuses to accept that
I solved this case before he did.

919
00:59:06,657 --> 00:59:11,229
Giles is dead, the plates lost,
case closed.

920
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:15,575
Neither Giles nor the plates were ever
in Windermere... case open.

921
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:17,209
- Really?
- What?

922
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:24,597
Well, gentlemen, I see Holmes
has taken you into his confidence.

923
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:27,413
Did he also tell you

924
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:30,357
that we expect to conclude
this case within three days?

925
00:59:31,456 --> 00:59:35,231
I'll let you fill in the details, Holmes.

926
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:40,763
Let me assure you,
Lord Smithwick,

927
00:59:40,832 --> 00:59:44,792
that come... Friday,
you shall have your plates.

928
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:47,547
You must succeed

929
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:50,932
before news of the theft leaks out

930
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,066
and causes widespread panic
throughout the Empire!

931
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:56,063
Steady, sir.

932
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:01,530
That is exactly why the Empire
now more than ever

933
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,080
needs all of us
to remain calm and composed.

934
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:09,046
You're right, of course.
We must remain composed.

935
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,388
- Composed.
- And calm.

936
01:00:14,943 --> 01:00:16,798
Friday?
Are you out of your mind?

937
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,791
Steady on. You've made some
excellent discoveries this morning.

938
01:00:20,895 --> 01:00:23,033
Get your coat on.
We have a cab waiting.

939
01:00:25,854 --> 01:00:27,741
- What discoveries?
- For one thing,

940
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:31,101
the Royal Mint purchased its paper
from the Camden paper mill.

941
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:32,823
You make these things up,
don't you?

942
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:40,088
Those men were here
about my father, weren't they?

943
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:42,100
Oh, good morning.

944
01:00:42,717 --> 01:00:45,205
Is there any news,
anything at all?

945
01:00:45,277 --> 01:00:46,586
Sadly, no.

946
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,149
But take heart. Last night
something occurred to Holmes,

947
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:54,643
and he suddenly realized
how stupid he'd been.

948
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:56,058
Really?

949
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:58,875
- I didn't exactly say "stupid."
- Yes, you did.

950
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:01,429
And now he's off
to continue the investigation.

951
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:04,468
- Perhaps I could come, too.
- Ah. Now...

952
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:07,672
The moment he knows anything,
he'll tell you.

953
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:09,913
- Thank you.
- Cabbie.

954
01:01:23,804 --> 01:01:25,048
What's that?

955
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:28,082
A reply to a telegram I sent
late last night.

956
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:32,756
You might let me in
on the joke, old boy.

957
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:34,202
In due time.

958
01:01:39,035 --> 01:01:41,174
Cabbie, stop.

959
01:01:41,979 --> 01:01:43,834
You was dead right, Doctor!

960
01:01:43,899 --> 01:01:46,485
All of 'em, just sittin' there
waitin' for customs.

961
01:01:46,556 --> 01:01:49,141
Wonderful! Just as I thought!

962
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:50,291
Hop in, lad!

963
01:01:52,412 --> 01:01:54,867
Driver, Southwark docks!

964
01:02:12,155 --> 01:02:13,202
Thanks, guv'nor.

965
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:14,737
Wiggins.

966
01:02:32,793 --> 01:02:34,222
Here they are.

967
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:37,144
- We found 'em here this morning.
- Wonderful.

968
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:40,690
All these crates
full of imported shoes.

969
01:02:42,586 --> 01:02:44,179
And the ship?

970
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,967
Got in this morning from Germany.
Two days late, she was.

971
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:49,968
Excellent. You've done well,
my boy.

972
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:52,628
We'll take it from here.

973
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,570
Picture it...

974
01:03:03,673 --> 01:03:07,634
two, three, maybe four
of Moriarty's henchmen

975
01:03:07,705 --> 01:03:11,185
waiting here under cover
of darkness for that ship.

976
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:12,501
But it's delayed.

977
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:15,383
They wait. They become bored.

978
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:18,482
Being men of
no moral fiber whatsoever,

979
01:03:18,553 --> 01:03:23,603
they can't resist helping themselves
to a new pair of shoes.

980
01:03:23,671 --> 01:03:26,038
Do you think
they have these in brown?

981
01:03:42,456 --> 01:03:45,041
I hate Italian shoes.

982
01:04:02,647 --> 01:04:03,923
Moriarty.

983
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:06,159
- Moriarty?
- Without doubt.

984
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,132
- This one.
- All right.

985
01:04:31,221 --> 01:04:33,261
What's "tinte"?

986
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:35,538
German for "ink."

987
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:39,124
He smuggled it in to avoid
the attention of Scotland Yard.

988
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,499
Marvelous.

989
01:04:40,566 --> 01:04:42,638
He already has
the paper he needs.

990
01:04:42,741 --> 01:04:44,683
He got it from
The Camden Paper Mill...

991
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:47,342
burning the place to the ground
to cover the theft.

992
01:04:47,413 --> 01:04:51,636
The John Clay case was staged
simply to throw me off the scent.

993
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:54,123
What's the German for "pen"?

994
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:00,367
What's all this?

995
01:05:01,141 --> 01:05:02,089
Blast!

996
01:05:04,757 --> 01:05:06,667
You can't be movin' things about.

997
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,129
It has to be cleared
through customs.

998
01:05:10,677 --> 01:05:14,190
Sorry, Professor. We thought
the dock was deserted.

999
01:05:14,293 --> 01:05:16,562
Sorry, indeed.

1000
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:21,642
I went to all this trouble...

1001
01:05:23,156 --> 01:05:25,011
...for the sake of discretion.

1002
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,492
Then you allow this to happen.

1003
01:05:31,315 --> 01:05:32,625
Well?

1004
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:50,350
Do you have your revolver with you?

1005
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:52,368
Yeah, somewhere.

1006
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:00,782
Come on.

1007
01:06:00,851 --> 01:06:03,121
Let's not be all day about it.

1008
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:05,096
Here it is.

1009
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,237
Now, I'm gonna let you
have some bullets for it.

1010
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,089
Try not to shoot yourself...

1011
01:06:11,155 --> 01:06:13,741
at least, not until
I give the signal.

1012
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:29,070
Moriarty.

1013
01:06:32,466 --> 01:06:33,414
Damn.

1014
01:06:40,881 --> 01:06:43,183
What am I doing here?

1015
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,802
Nobody told me Moriarty was...

1016
01:07:03,089 --> 01:07:04,518
- Holmes!
- What?

1017
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,413
Come on!

1018
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:23,112
Die, Moriarty.

1019
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:28,744
Idiot!

1020
01:07:32,911 --> 01:07:33,859
Come on!

1021
01:07:33,935 --> 01:07:36,269
They can't follow us
down the canal.

1022
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:41,768
How demeaning to be
set upon by nitwits.

1023
01:08:05,902 --> 01:08:07,528
What are you doing?

1024
01:08:10,479 --> 01:08:11,526
Damn!

1025
01:08:17,518 --> 01:08:18,795
Look out!

1026
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,067
No luck, Sergeant.

1027
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:09,347
- Anything?
- No, sir.

1028
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:13,708
The tide may have carried
the body miles downriver.

1029
01:09:50,731 --> 01:09:52,739
Is it true?

1030
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:56,676
I'm afraid it's true.

1031
01:10:01,835 --> 01:10:04,071
I am so sorry.

1032
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:06,921
He was such a good man.

1033
01:10:06,987 --> 01:10:09,736
I can't believe he's gone.

1034
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:12,137
I know it's difficult
at such a time,

1035
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:15,978
but if it's any consolation,
we still have Mr. Holmes.

1036
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:21,696
Did I say something wrong?

1037
01:10:37,385 --> 01:10:40,865
I seem to have overestimated
the amount of rope required.

1038
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:43,010
One more thing I've botched.

1039
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:46,377
What would Dr. Watson say?

1040
01:10:46,441 --> 01:10:49,059
He'd have volunteered to kick
the chair out from under me!

1041
01:10:49,129 --> 01:10:50,503
He would not!

1042
01:10:50,569 --> 01:10:53,154
He said this was gonna be
our last case together.

1043
01:10:57,609 --> 01:10:59,681
You mustn't blame yourself.

1044
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:01,280
You can still avenge
the doctor's death

1045
01:11:01,385 --> 01:11:04,996
by capturing this Moriarty
and rescuing my father.

1046
01:11:05,064 --> 01:11:06,591
Oh, what a good idea.

1047
01:11:06,697 --> 01:11:09,795
While I'm at it,
I'll bring in the Loch Ness Monster.

1048
01:11:09,864 --> 01:11:12,799
I don't understand!

1049
01:11:12,873 --> 01:11:15,939
I am not a detective.
I never solved anything.

1050
01:11:16,009 --> 01:11:17,568
Dr. Watson did.

1051
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,047
You're just upset.

1052
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:21,729
I couldn't detect horse manure
if I stepped in it.

1053
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:23,490
Please, Mr. Holmes!

1054
01:11:24,456 --> 01:11:25,765
Sorry.

1055
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:44,035
- Another one?
- Yes, please.

1056
01:11:45,863 --> 01:11:47,325
Stop.

1057
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:49,766
Perhaps not.

1058
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:54,533
I'm afraid my grief...
has exceeded my resources.

1059
01:11:58,695 --> 01:12:01,477
- It's on the house.
- Thank you, Henry.

1060
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:10,302
Thank goodness!

1061
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:13,472
Mrs. Hudson said
we might find you here.

1062
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:18,847
We want to offer you
our condolences.

1063
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,471
Pity about Dr. Watson.

1064
01:12:22,949 --> 01:12:24,673
I trust, however,

1065
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,839
it will have no bearing
on the outcome of the case.

1066
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:30,649
What?

1067
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:34,908
You vowed to solve the case
by Friday.

1068
01:12:37,285 --> 01:12:38,976
Well, you see,

1069
01:12:39,077 --> 01:12:42,558
the fact of the matter is,
you see, Lord Smithwick,

1070
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:45,509
is... Dr. Watson...

1071
01:12:45,604 --> 01:12:48,866
I believe what Mr. Holmes
is trying to say

1072
01:12:48,933 --> 01:12:52,927
is that it was Dr. Watson
who first made that pledge, and...

1073
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:55,517
...with all due respect,

1074
01:12:55,589 --> 01:12:59,201
I'm sure he did not fully understand
the complexities of the case.

1075
01:12:59,269 --> 01:13:01,440
As I have tried
to point out to Your Lordship,

1076
01:13:01,509 --> 01:13:03,516
Her Majesty
should rely on the counsel

1077
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:06,109
of trained criminologists
such as myself.

1078
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:09,442
Though well-meaning,
the good doctor was...

1079
01:13:10,436 --> 01:13:11,582
...no detective.

1080
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,248
As I was about to say,
Lord Smithwick,

1081
01:13:16,356 --> 01:13:18,527
Dr. Watson was decidedly precise

1082
01:13:18,596 --> 01:13:21,792
in his estimate of the closure
of this case.

1083
01:13:21,859 --> 01:13:23,867
Have no fear...

1084
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:28,446
you shall have the plates
in your hands come Friday.

1085
01:13:37,123 --> 01:13:38,749
What?

1086
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:41,055
The game's afoot!

1087
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,691
Dr. Watson always said,

1088
01:13:45,795 --> 01:13:48,697
start by listing everything you know.

1089
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:50,429
So, let us begin.

1090
01:13:50,499 --> 01:13:53,149
Number one.

1091
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,647
Moriarty.

1092
01:13:55,715 --> 01:13:58,136
Isn't he wonderful?

1093
01:14:00,355 --> 01:14:03,900
He is behind all this,
that's one thing we know.

1094
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:07,353
Very good. Progressing nicely.

1095
01:14:07,426 --> 01:14:11,169
Now, the next thing we know...
number two.

1096
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:19,741
This might take a while.
I'll get some tea.

1097
01:14:22,593 --> 01:14:23,521
What?

1098
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:37,209
All right...

1099
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,029
...let's go back to number one.

1100
01:14:41,057 --> 01:14:44,090
Perhaps the clue is in
Moriarty's name.

1101
01:14:44,161 --> 01:14:45,983
Clever people often do that.

1102
01:14:47,457 --> 01:14:48,406
Amity...

1103
01:14:49,793 --> 01:14:51,681
rarity...

1104
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,048
I've got it!

1105
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:57,112
His real name is Arty Morty!

1106
01:14:59,552 --> 01:15:01,625
What the hell am I talking about?

1107
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,953
I found a five pound note
floating in the river.

1108
01:15:05,024 --> 01:15:06,301
Lucky you.

1109
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,255
But it's only half printed!

1110
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:10,742
I suppose it's only worth
two pounds-ten, then.

1111
01:15:18,495 --> 01:15:21,310
Everyone knows
the normal five pound note

1112
01:15:21,407 --> 01:15:24,920
carries a serial number
which contains five digits.

1113
01:15:24,991 --> 01:15:26,649
- Six digits.
- Six digits.

1114
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,280
This one contains only three.

1115
01:15:28,351 --> 01:15:32,279
- Two-three-four.
- What's that mean?

1116
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:35,351
Her father's a printer,
ain't he?

1117
01:15:35,423 --> 01:15:37,561
Maybe he's trying to
tell us where he is.

1118
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:43,031
What can these numbers mean?

1119
01:15:43,102 --> 01:15:45,372
Could be a measurement...
an address!

1120
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:47,610
- An amount!
- A page number!

1121
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,134
Did your father
have a favorite book?

1122
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,166
He did!

1123
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:53,237
- The Bible.
- Yes.

1124
01:15:53,343 --> 01:15:56,190
I have a Bible.
It's at my bedside.

1125
01:15:57,279 --> 01:15:59,483
Is there something
on page 234?

1126
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:01,787
Page numbers vary
from Bible to Bible,

1127
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:04,702
but chapter and verse is the same
in every Bible.

1128
01:16:04,767 --> 01:16:07,287
Did your father have
a favorite book of the Bible?

1129
01:16:07,966 --> 01:16:08,915
Yes, he did.

1130
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:12,404
The book of Psalms.

1131
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:15,477
Psalms 23rd, verse four.

1132
01:16:15,549 --> 01:16:19,259
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of...

1133
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,430
the shadow of death."

1134
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:23,028
Does that mean something?

1135
01:16:24,093 --> 01:16:27,671
That means...
the Orpheum Theater.

1136
01:16:27,741 --> 01:16:29,814
What are you talking about?

1137
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:32,568
I'm sorry,
but I just don't understand.

1138
01:16:34,205 --> 01:16:35,798
The Shadow of Death.

1139
01:16:35,869 --> 01:16:39,382
The gripping drama was the last play
presented at the Orpheum.

1140
01:16:39,453 --> 01:16:43,195
It closed after only one night,
but not without garnering some praise.

1141
01:16:43,261 --> 01:16:47,516
Harris, in the Daily Telegram. Said,
"In an otherwise dismal evening,

1142
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,450
Reginald Kincaid
provided some welcome laughs."

1143
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:53,459
Laughs? You said
it was a gripping drama.

1144
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:55,899
It's unimportant now, isn't it?

1145
01:16:57,948 --> 01:17:00,021
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1146
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:02,329
- Cab!
- Oh, dear.

1147
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:04,698
The Fleet River runs
under that part of town.

1148
01:17:04,764 --> 01:17:07,131
The Orpheum Theater
stands right on top of it.

1149
01:17:07,196 --> 01:17:08,691
You could be on to something.

1150
01:17:08,764 --> 01:17:11,066
There's tunnels and caverns
running all under there.

1151
01:17:12,284 --> 01:17:15,665
- Just a moment!
- We haven't got a moment!

1152
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:18,128
Wiggins, fetch Scotland Yard.

1153
01:17:18,203 --> 01:17:19,829
Let me, Mr. Holmes.

1154
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,682
I'm sure they'll be
much more inclined to listen to me.

1155
01:17:22,747 --> 01:17:24,176
Good idea.
Wiggins, on the back.

1156
01:17:24,251 --> 01:17:27,546
The Orpheum Theater.
We haven't a moment to lose!

1157
01:17:40,218 --> 01:17:43,699
I kind of liked you better
when you was a coward.

1158
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:48,976
The stage door's round back.
Go ahead.

1159
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:51,440
- You go ahead.
- Wiggins, go ahead.

1160
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:05,880
Here ya go, gents.

1161
01:18:09,563 --> 01:18:14,035
Here you go, my good man.
You may keep the change.

1162
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:16,822
A fiver? God bless ya, guv'nor!

1163
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:18,799
Think nothing of it.
I print my own.

1164
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:21,524
"Print me own"...
that's a good one.

1165
01:18:22,713 --> 01:18:25,527
Still, we can't afford to waste them.

1166
01:19:04,377 --> 01:19:07,475
We shall move the barge out
at high tide.

1167
01:19:07,544 --> 01:19:11,374
I shall miss this place... somewhat.

1168
01:19:12,855 --> 01:19:13,837
Go around front.

1169
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:16,464
When the police get here,
tell them what happened.

1170
01:19:16,535 --> 01:19:17,844
Right you are.

1171
01:19:17,911 --> 01:19:19,188
And...

1172
01:19:19,735 --> 01:19:22,834
...the best of British luck to you both.
You're gonna need it.

1173
01:19:22,903 --> 01:19:24,725
And don't move until they get here!

1174
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:29,141
Up we go.

1175
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:44,530
- Hold on to that.
- Slowly.

1176
01:19:52,438 --> 01:19:53,900
Where are we?

1177
01:19:56,182 --> 01:19:58,735
Don't kick the...

1178
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:00,464
- bucket.

1179
01:21:01,493 --> 01:21:02,441
Let go.

1180
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:08,147
Are you quite serious?

1181
01:21:28,211 --> 01:21:30,796
Do you do this kind of thing
on purpose?

1182
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:32,839
Listen.

1183
01:21:36,882 --> 01:21:39,337
It's nothing, Professor.
Probably rats.

1184
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:42,280
Ah, yes... rats.

1185
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:49,226
I think...

1186
01:21:50,259 --> 01:21:53,292
I think it's louder over here.

1187
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:56,236
It might...

1188
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,141
I am so dreadfully sorry.

1189
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:09,901
On the contrary,

1190
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:12,238
I think we're making
very good progress.

1191
01:22:45,808 --> 01:22:48,296
There's a hole in the wall.

1192
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,318
I'm not stayin' around here.

1193
01:23:11,503 --> 01:23:13,325
Blimey.

1194
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:17,131
Well, well.

1195
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:23,210
The ink's not dry yet.

1196
01:23:23,695 --> 01:23:26,477
There's more paper line over here.

1197
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:29,545
Hand over.

1198
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:39,908
You've done a splendid job,
Mr. Giles.

1199
01:23:44,943 --> 01:23:47,660
The Queen herself
could hardly tell the difference.

1200
01:23:47,727 --> 01:23:49,701
However...

1201
01:23:49,806 --> 01:23:53,101
this one seems to have been
only half printed.

1202
01:23:53,935 --> 01:23:56,040
It was found on
the bank of the river.

1203
01:23:56,975 --> 01:23:59,942
I've got a pussycat

1204
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:02,534
And I'm very fond of that

1205
01:24:02,606 --> 01:24:04,329
A reject.

1206
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:06,024
Must have slipped away.

1207
01:24:06,766 --> 01:24:08,621
And the tide carried it out.

1208
01:24:08,686 --> 01:24:09,994
The tide, that's all.

1209
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,875
Suppose we have a look
at this reject.

1210
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,053
Shall we?

1211
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:15,783
Two-three-four...

1212
01:24:18,765 --> 01:24:21,350
Oh, yes. Clever.

1213
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:25,895
How many of these rejects
accidentally slipped away?

1214
01:24:25,997 --> 01:24:27,622
Well, I...

1215
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:29,319
No matter.

1216
01:24:29,389 --> 01:24:32,236
Shame that the only person
capable of deducing your clue

1217
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,918
is currently lying at the bottom
of the Thames.

1218
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:37,795
What are you doing here?

1219
01:24:40,621 --> 01:24:43,042
I told you to keep an eye
on that imbecile!

1220
01:24:43,116 --> 01:24:46,345
- He may yet stumble onto something.
- He has.

1221
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:48,681
They know all about this place.

1222
01:24:48,748 --> 01:24:51,650
Luckily for you, they sent me
to fetch Scotland Yard.

1223
01:24:51,724 --> 01:24:55,434
- All right, no Scotland Yard. Fine.
- What now, Professor?

1224
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,387
No need to panic.

1225
01:24:58,924 --> 01:25:00,680
I need a good plan.

1226
01:25:00,748 --> 01:25:02,177
Attack!

1227
01:25:02,284 --> 01:25:04,073
Attack with what?

1228
01:25:11,883 --> 01:25:13,770
That's no good.

1229
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,051
Start packing!

1230
01:25:20,298 --> 01:25:22,208
In spite of this
latest piece of foolishness,

1231
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:24,322
you've done your job well.

1232
01:25:24,394 --> 01:25:28,453
Your reward will be a quick
and relatively painless departure.

1233
01:25:29,194 --> 01:25:31,299
Not so fast, Moriarty.

1234
01:25:36,938 --> 01:25:40,615
I've been waiting hours
for your arrival.

1235
01:25:42,602 --> 01:25:46,050
- Thank God you're here!
- Please, my dear.

1236
01:25:46,122 --> 01:25:49,505
Ingenious, planting a spy
in our midst.

1237
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:52,874
That staged attack at Giles'
was quite realistic.

1238
01:25:52,938 --> 01:25:56,102
However, a cable to France
revealed a rather unique fact

1239
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:58,821
about the real Miss Giles...

1240
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:04,069
...something of an embarrassment
to the Giles family, I should think.

1241
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:24,256
Perhaps you would like to meet
the real Lesley Giles.

1242
01:26:24,329 --> 01:26:25,605
Lesley!

1243
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:30,048
All right, back to the first plan...

1244
01:26:30,153 --> 01:26:31,713
attack.

1245
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:34,686
Pity you won't be able
to share my greatest triumph...

1246
01:26:34,793 --> 01:26:38,404
the forcing of an empire
to its knees.

1247
01:26:38,472 --> 01:26:42,334
But you will be allowed
to see these two die...

1248
01:26:42,408 --> 01:26:44,034
...before you.

1249
01:26:52,488 --> 01:26:53,917
Right!

1250
01:26:55,592 --> 01:26:56,868
Don't anybody move.

1251
01:26:56,936 --> 01:27:00,035
Otherwise, there'll be
an impromptu roasting.

1252
01:27:00,136 --> 01:27:02,591
Has it occurred to you,
Mr. Holmes,

1253
01:27:02,696 --> 01:27:05,063
that if you set fire to that money,

1254
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,339
you will burn to death yourself?

1255
01:27:06,374 --> 01:27:07,518
You will burn to death yourself?

1256
01:27:10,823 --> 01:27:12,033
Of course it has.

1257
01:27:14,343 --> 01:27:16,033
Put out those flames!

1258
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,194
Don't just stand there!

1259
01:27:24,902 --> 01:27:26,212
Look out!

1260
01:27:37,798 --> 01:27:41,094
- I thought you were dead.
- You may yet be right.

1261
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:47,841
I'm not done with you yet!

1262
01:28:06,022 --> 01:28:08,257
- Put sand on it!
- Bring more buckets!

1263
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:12,601
- Get some water in here!
- Clear those boxes!

1264
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:14,400
Leave this to me.

1265
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,439
There, there, my dear.

1266
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:23,898
We're in a tinderbox!

1267
01:28:27,812 --> 01:28:29,089
What was that?

1268
01:28:33,316 --> 01:28:34,909
You cowards!

1269
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:37,369
- Professor, the gas mains!
- What?

1270
01:28:37,477 --> 01:28:39,386
They could blow in the heat!

1271
01:28:39,492 --> 01:28:41,631
Keep them pinned down.
I'll get the plates.

1272
01:28:44,804 --> 01:28:47,106
It's all over now,
my pretty one.

1273
01:28:52,612 --> 01:28:54,237
You're disappointed, aren't you?

1274
01:29:04,196 --> 01:29:05,440
Hell!

1275
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,258
Brilliant.

1276
01:29:16,354 --> 01:29:18,940
Why didn't you kill him
when you had the chance?

1277
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:26,106
Rock of ages

1278
01:29:26,179 --> 01:29:28,600
Cleft for me

1279
01:29:28,674 --> 01:29:31,674
Let me hide

1280
01:29:31,747 --> 01:29:35,358
Myself in thee

1281
01:29:35,427 --> 01:29:37,466
Rock of age...

1282
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:40,189
Go on, hurry up!

1283
01:29:40,258 --> 01:29:43,258
- Get movin'!
- Come on, George!

1284
01:29:47,266 --> 01:29:49,819
- Let's get out of here!
- The back door!

1285
01:30:12,384 --> 01:30:13,529
It's safe, Professor.

1286
01:30:22,977 --> 01:30:24,351
Come on.

1287
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:27,416
This is an escape,
not a cakewalk.

1288
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,976
Oh, please...
don't wait for me, will you?

1289
01:30:35,488 --> 01:30:37,049
Mercy me!

1290
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,324
Oh, my dear...

1291
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,596
...that must have been so painful!

1292
01:30:42,976 --> 01:30:43,925
Hello?

1293
01:30:44,032 --> 01:30:45,439
All right...

1294
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,127
There he is!

1295
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,677
- You hold them off.
- Just like I told ya.

1296
01:30:55,008 --> 01:30:56,415
Oh, my head.

1297
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,520
It's all right, dear.
It's still there.

1298
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,055
- Sorry, Mrs. Hudson.
- Watson, there's a fire down here.

1299
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,421
It became necessary
for me to stage my death

1300
01:31:07,487 --> 01:31:09,942
so I might work unobserved
for a few days.

1301
01:31:10,015 --> 01:31:12,884
And I must say,
you've caused quite a bit of grief.

1302
01:31:15,838 --> 01:31:18,653
You needn't bother with her...
she's an imposter.

1303
01:31:18,718 --> 01:31:21,817
She's not Leslie Giles?
Then who is?

1304
01:31:21,887 --> 01:31:23,261
I am.

1305
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,845
There you have it.

1306
01:31:30,334 --> 01:31:32,156
Ladies and gentlemen...

1307
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:36,023
...you seem to be blocking my exit.

1308
01:31:41,438 --> 01:31:43,773
Kindly step aside.

1309
01:31:53,886 --> 01:31:57,530
Remove these people
from the stage.

1310
01:32:01,278 --> 01:32:02,260
They're locked.

1311
01:32:06,557 --> 01:32:09,906
Ordinarily I do not bother
with half-wits and buffoons.

1312
01:32:09,981 --> 01:32:11,606
Buffoon, is it?

1313
01:32:15,581 --> 01:32:17,075
Buffoons, is it?

1314
01:32:17,149 --> 01:32:19,931
- He'll be killed!
- I quite doubt it.

1315
01:32:19,997 --> 01:32:22,201
He's in his element now.

1316
01:32:23,325 --> 01:32:28,114
I warn you... I've killed
as many as six men in a week.

1317
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,413
Eight, if you count matinees.

1318
01:32:41,852 --> 01:32:45,016
"The brilliant swordsmanship
of Reginald Kincaid...

1319
01:32:48,443 --> 01:32:51,062
...was almost worth
the price of admission,"

1320
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,692
raved the critic of the...

1321
01:32:54,715 --> 01:32:56,820
Cotswold Press.

1322
01:32:56,924 --> 01:33:00,601
All right,
put your shoulders to it, men.

1323
01:33:00,668 --> 01:33:03,156
Let's have it down.
The rest of you, round the back.

1324
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:29,424
He really is quite good.

1325
01:33:40,186 --> 01:33:42,706
- Follow me.
- Follow him, lads!

1326
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,592
Trying to be funny, eh?

1327
01:34:00,186 --> 01:34:02,837
Hold on!
Don't anybody move!

1328
01:34:02,906 --> 01:34:05,239
The authorities are here!

1329
01:34:05,304 --> 01:34:07,344
Stay where you are, everyone.

1330
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:09,107
Get down!

1331
01:34:11,385 --> 01:34:12,945
Right.

1332
01:34:13,017 --> 01:34:14,904
I have killed before,

1333
01:34:14,968 --> 01:34:17,783
and I can assure you
I have absolutely no compunction

1334
01:34:17,848 --> 01:34:19,125
about doing so again.

1335
01:34:19,192 --> 01:34:21,581
You are not dealing
with an amateur, you know.

1336
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,341
Well played.

1337
01:34:31,384 --> 01:34:33,904
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends.

1338
01:34:36,344 --> 01:34:37,937
You're alive!

1339
01:34:38,008 --> 01:34:41,750
Astounding observation, Inspector...
we must discuss it.

1340
01:34:43,224 --> 01:34:44,598
Well done!

1341
01:35:03,415 --> 01:35:04,756
Stand back!

1342
01:35:04,822 --> 01:35:08,019
I'm about to bring the world's greatest
criminal to justice,

1343
01:35:08,087 --> 01:35:09,843
and nothing's going to stop me!

1344
01:35:09,911 --> 01:35:12,147
Have you forgotten
the gas mains?

1345
01:35:35,734 --> 01:35:38,832
More pressure!
Come on, boys!

1346
01:35:38,998 --> 01:35:41,365
More water! Come on!

1347
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,739
Congratulations!

1348
01:35:45,814 --> 01:35:49,523
Her Majesty wishes to offer you
her sincerest appreciation

1349
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:51,313
for a job well done.

1350
01:35:51,382 --> 01:35:53,716
And you too, Dr. Watson.

1351
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:59,051
Mr. Giles tells me that
you both deciphered the clue.

1352
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:02,159
I doubted if anyone
would understand it.

1353
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:03,984
Child's play.

1354
01:36:04,053 --> 01:36:06,125
- 23rd Psalm.
- Shadow of death.

1355
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:07,406
Elementary.

1356
01:36:08,501 --> 01:36:13,803
No, no, no... I was referring to
the serial number... 234.

1357
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:19,852
The address of the theater...
234 Beacon Street.

1358
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,907
Amazing!

1359
01:36:27,956 --> 01:36:30,345
Don't worry,
I'll fix it in the story.

1360
01:36:31,316 --> 01:36:33,650
The arrests were made,
and the rest of the story you know.

1361
01:36:33,716 --> 01:36:36,815
Don't mean to
toot my own horn, you understand.

1362
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:42,191
Nice bit of work, this.
But as I was telling Miss Giles,

1363
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:45,107
had it not been for
the timely arrival of Scotland Yard,

1364
01:36:45,203 --> 01:36:47,308
I doubt things would have
turned out so well.

1365
01:36:48,372 --> 01:36:51,241
Of course, I realize you would
never admit such a thing.

1366
01:36:54,515 --> 01:36:56,042
On the contrary.

1367
01:36:56,115 --> 01:36:59,246
Indeed, Holmes was telling me
how indispensable you were.

1368
01:36:59,315 --> 01:37:01,225
- He was?
- As a matter of fact,

1369
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,982
it is to Lestrade,
and Lestrade alone,

1370
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:07,116
that you owe
your deepest gratitude.

1371
01:37:07,186 --> 01:37:08,615
Really?

1372
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:12,978
Miss Giles is on the stage,
you know, in Paris.

1373
01:37:13,074 --> 01:37:15,922
A revue called Les Femmmes Faux.

1374
01:37:18,962 --> 01:37:21,962
An actress... what a surprise.

1375
01:37:22,034 --> 01:37:25,230
There's more surprises
yet to come.

1376
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:49,039
Good morning!

1377
01:37:49,106 --> 01:37:52,270
Excuse me, sir.
Is it true that Moriarty is dead?

1378
01:37:52,338 --> 01:37:54,640
Never assume, gentlemen,
never assume.

1379
01:37:57,234 --> 01:38:00,136
How did you know where
Moriarty was hiding out?

1380
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:04,365
It was an elementary deduction
based on the clues at hand.

1381
01:38:04,432 --> 01:38:06,636
But how is it that Scotland Yard
did not...

1382
01:38:06,704 --> 01:38:08,111
Perhaps...

1383
01:38:09,552 --> 01:38:13,676
Perhaps Scotland Yard did not
have the invaluable assistance,

1384
01:38:13,776 --> 01:38:16,296
the keen insight

1385
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,440
and the extraordinary patience...

1386
01:38:19,856 --> 01:38:21,547
...of Dr. John Watson.

1387
01:38:28,304 --> 01:38:29,995
My friend.

1388
01:38:38,831 --> 01:38:40,392
Hear, hear!

1389
01:38:42,127 --> 01:38:43,654
Now, gentlemen and ladies,

1390
01:38:43,728 --> 01:38:46,827
I have an announcement
of some consequence.

1391
01:38:46,927 --> 01:38:50,189
With the safe return of the plates
to the Royal Mint,

1392
01:38:50,255 --> 01:38:52,808
I must inform you

1393
01:38:52,879 --> 01:38:54,766
that this is my last case.

1394
01:38:56,304 --> 01:38:59,206
Sherlock Holmes is retired.

1395
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:02,857
Surely not, sir.
That cannot be!

1396
01:39:02,927 --> 01:39:04,039
Is it possible?

1397
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:07,307
Of course it's not possible.
Mr. Holmes is merely pulling your leg.

1398
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:08,651
Aren't you?

1399
01:39:08,718 --> 01:39:09,995
Sherlock Holmes retire,

1400
01:39:10,062 --> 01:39:12,396
when there is murder
and mayhem at every turn?

1401
01:39:12,462 --> 01:39:14,535
Already several adventures
have begun to take shape

1402
01:39:14,606 --> 01:39:17,388
which can be solved
by no one else. Right?

1403
01:39:20,462 --> 01:39:21,989
Right you are.

1404
01:39:25,134 --> 01:39:27,981
And so, without further ado,

1405
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,434
I hereby declare this case...

1406
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:33,382
...closed.
