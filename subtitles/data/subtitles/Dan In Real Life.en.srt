00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:31,941
I will take the cart, I will pick up them of
The school and we will handle later

14
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,577
Directly.

15
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,651
He sounds well.

16
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,753
- No suena bien.
- ¿Ahora qué?

17
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:44,061
You always tell us to go to her
School and now us expensive of her.

18
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,993
What must my studies?

19
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,765
Why do you smile?

20
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,667
It is that I never intended to hear you telling that.

21
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,472
He makes me smile.

22
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,907
I do not want to go.

23
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,377
We do this every year.

24
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,472
It is the only moment in that
That are all together ones.

25
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,177
I like the grandfather's house.

26
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,618
- Destruyen mi educación.
- No digas eso.

27
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,790

30
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,455

31
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,195
I am Marty Barasco, I wanted to thank him
By the last Friday column

32
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,534
He made me understand my parents.

33
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,240
This well one, good Marty
Which mas can I make by you?

34
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,437
Mr wanted to see his daughter

35
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,036
Jane.

36
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,146
In fact, I came by Face.

37
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,747
Taste know you, comes back in 3 years.

38
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,218
I do not want to boast but the Mr Shaw
He says that it am one of the best ones

39
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,491
Drivers in his class, he says that
I am ready for the expressway.

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,292
We do not agree.

41
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,559
Expensive, we go.

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,158
- ¿Me dejaras?
- Ya veremos.

43
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,069
-3 en punto, no lleguen...
- Ya sabemos.

44
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,072
Evening.

45
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,539
For which he knows it, the boy that you threw out
My friend Marty, is my fellow

46
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,775
Of laboratory of the type of science
Even we are doing a project.

00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,645
The bus.

48
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,651
- iEsperen!

49
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,865

If, you him half an hour sends ago.

51
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,300

52
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,030
iNo can be!

53
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,119
- ¿Dónde esta tu hermana?
- Llegas tarde.

54
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,420
Yumes went.
Can I handle?

55
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,949
- Papa será premiado.
- No tan rápido.

56
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,621
- Hay otras dos columnas nominadas.
- Es grandioso.

57
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,654
Can I handle?

58
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,037
He looks, you are a good driver
Himself that is other million of

59
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,068
If you do not let me never learn.

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,144
But if I leave you maybe not alive.

61
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,647
What was that? Which bundles?
You shamed me.

62
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,115
Perdon by interrupting your
Studies with your friend.

63
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,254
Everyone can not be monks I eat your.

64
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,394
Of by the way, these punished.

65
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,726
- ¿Castigada?
- Si.

66
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,857
- ¿Por cuanto tiempo?
- De por vida.

67
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,400
- Vamos papa.
- Esto es humillante.

68
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,596
- Ni que lo digas.
- Castigada por un mes.

69
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:49,040
A month? It is worse than I always give birth.
Why potato?

70
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,139
- Me mentiste.
- No puedes con la verdad.

71
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,976
Quizas you would have to try it for the next one.

72
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,742
- Pero, pero...
- No.

73
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,880
- Esta bien papa, amo a Marty.
- Por favor.

74
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:09,991
Pope; pope; high; listening.
I did not know it immediately, I take a time.

75
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,189
What is a time?

76
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,723
I know it per 3 weeks
But I knew it at the 3 days.

77
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,361
3 days? In three days not it is not, possible.

78
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,064
- Quizas si pueda.
- No, no.

79
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,699
That feeling is not love.

80
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,708
- Lo amo, lo amo, lo amo.
- No es apropiado.

81
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,246
- Lo amo, lo amo, lo amo, lo amo.
- Crees que es amor pero no lo es.

82
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,911
It is not like that

83
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,174
These either, pope?

84
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:09,487
There Jane's university, goes
And there her goes opposite

85
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,217
What must mine?

86
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,689
Your these well ones, does not wait.
There he goes.

87
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,925
You can not move me away from Marty.

88
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,729
Pope, let me remember that the
Half of the world are boys.

89
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,706
Conocere to others.

90
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,410
But alone Marty this in my heart.

91
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,483
One that I am very good driver.

92
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,309
Not.

93
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,661
There you have.

94
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,464
I believe that your sisters are not
Very satisfied with me.

95
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,431
Why do you believe that I am that?

96
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:03,070
You are a good father but
Sometimes a bad pope.

97
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,772
Who told you to say that?

98
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,177
Nobody.

99
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,979
This very expensive One, can tell it to me.

100
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,509
- Yo misma lo invente.
- ¿Cuál de tus hermanas te lo dijo?

101
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:20,250
Him I invent by myself, myself, I am in the fourth grade
I can think of things by myself.

102
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,351
Jane or Face?

103
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,158
- Yo misma pensé en eso.
- ¿Jane o Cara?

104
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,424
I am in the fourth grade

105
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,125
- Esta en el cuarto grado
- Esta en el cuarto grado

106
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,736
They already arrived!

107
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,745
Girls go, they already arrived.

108
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,047
Hello grandfather.

109
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,048
Hello pope.

110
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,122
That good that they are everybody here.

111
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,824
- ¿Cómo estas?
- Estoy bien.

112
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,799
Or my girls not do not, stand me maybe.

113
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,359
It is not novelty.

114
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,607
He looks at your girls, they are all floodwaters.

115
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,112
They are not, very young even.

116
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,547
Hello, I go, she grew.

117
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,211
He grows daily.

118
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,379
Hello.

119
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,352
Hello Elli.

120
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,356
- ¿Había trafico?
- Si, terrible.

121
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,429
- Hola hermana.
- Me alegra que vinieras.

122
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,662
Who are any them?
I had never seen them.

123
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,931
- Hola tío Dan.
- Di algo.

124
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,133
- Algo.
- Paso, lo sabia.

125
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,165
Then he is, he sounds well.

126
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,733
He helps your uncle with his suitcases.

127
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:27,376
Fondness, your brother Mitch
He will bring a visit like that that

128
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,149
I am in the special room.
This well one.

129
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,697
- Duerme bien.
- Tu también.

130
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,261
Good morning.

131
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,423
Did they sleep well?

132
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,956
If.

133
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,930
Them can I bring something?

134
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,966
He gets a life.

135
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,672
- Solo necesitan espacio.
- ¿Eso necesita?

136
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,740
If, everyone him need.

137
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,812
Why do not you go by the newspapers?

138
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,347
- Mama...
- Anda, te hara bien.

139
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,027
Pierdete by a moment.

140
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,656
- Debería quedarme.
- No, pierdete Danny.

141
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,165
It is not a request.

142
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,006
- ¿Podría atenderme?
- En un minuto.

143
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,322
He went to the centre then.
By cafe.

144
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,454
I excuse ¿, I could help me?

145
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,699
If.

146
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,330
I am looking for a book obviously.

147
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,036
Something in particular?

148
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,566
If, something that is possible
Help to fight with.

149
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,175
What could be a situation is inconvenient.

150
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,845
This either ¿, what is?

151
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:55,191
I could be something funny one, but not
Necessarily slightly very funny.

152
00:14:55,861 --> 00:15:01,993
And without playing a trick to nobody
But something

153
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,992
- Gracioso pero humano.
- Esta bien.

154
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:14,005
And if I could surprise me, but that to that
Do same time feeling

155
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:20,178
That what you thought was correct
Of incorrect but wrong way.

156
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,848
There is something of correct in the wrong.

157
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,455
Quizas what I want to say is.

158
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:33,423
Mas important, I want me to be charmed.

159
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,434
And at the same time not.

160
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:43,032
It is that I want to feel
A connection towards something.

161
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,812
Or maybe not one I look for what.

162
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,247
In my experience, rarely him
You find in a book all.

163
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,148
That there are many is by that.

164
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,011
What do we have?

165
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,957
- Tenemos un popurri de elecciones.
- ¿Popurri?

166
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,388
If.

167
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:07,527
There you have, poetry, Dickensen.
Basic things, a little Neruda.

168
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,591
- Siempre es bueno.
- Estoy de acuerdo.

169
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:17,439
This is easy to read, Ghandi life.
The one, but nobody was as inspired.

170
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,439
As that, A good man is
Difficult to find of Lighthouse.

171
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,611
- El titulo solo.
- Ana Karena, Idol.

172
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,120
It is funny.

173
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,949
This is funny.

174
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,828
It Quizas is not.

175
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,825
- De hecho, es muy gracioso y real.
- Bien, me alegra.

176
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,832
If you could elect alone one.

177
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,772
Good, I would say that nothing compares one
To the fish Romance.

178
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:03,252
Walk and grasp what happened one to me.

179
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,153
Was I looking for something?

180
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,418
- Vendido.
- ¿Perdon?

181
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,720
The I love everybody.

182
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,695
- Solo eran sugerencias.
- Asegurese de darle su comisión.

183
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,393
- El no trabaja acá.
- Pues debería.

184
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,402

But I believe that they gave me
A small planet.

193
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,465
Thanks.

194
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,480
Tendo napkins and tools

195
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,177
And your not by him I dress.

196
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,282
- Dime, Dan.

197
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,220
- ¿Naciste?
- Naci.

198
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,388
I grew as everybody and also.

199
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,687
This good?

200
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:25,592
This either ¿, which mas? In the school
Taenia joins Bonanza punchbowl.

201
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,435
It is a program of the 60.

202
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:34,639
That wanted to be magician so
Taenia toys of magic.

203
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,610
Try to make levitate to a girl

204
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:07,669
You are going to laugh, slightly that
I never told him anyone in my life

205
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,677
And me saying it is very difficult.

206
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,887
And then, one gets sick.

207
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,384
And he died.

208
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,891
Me hard a time

209
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,003
We should talk about something mas.

210
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:39,343
¿ So you are one of those widowers
That 3 daughters have that he knows

211
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,902
To women without suspicion in bookstores?

212
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,642
So he seems.

213
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,013
- Estuve ahí.
- ¿En serio?

214
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:55,057
It does not, seem that it was too difficult.

215
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,192
We are well now.

216
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,632
Seriously.

217
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,533
You can smile.

218
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,530
It is better than the alternative.

219
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,538
Can you grasp this?

220
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,212
Disculpame.
Hello.

221
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,243
Not minutes, if.

222
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,984
- Tengo que irme.
- Esta bien.

223
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,093
Perdi the time notion.

224
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,964
Desearia go on talking.

225
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,759
Knowing you was very cute and unusual.

226
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,661
Quizas can call you someday.

227
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,099
- Eso quizas sea incomodo.
- Supongo que tienes una relación.

228
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,905
If, a new.

229
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,606
I had known it of not talking so.

230
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,376
- Eso es cierto.
- No es justo ¿verdad?

231
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:52,984
Thanks.

232
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,910
You taste all of my and he does not swim one of you myself.

233
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:00,721
I do not want to pass me the life rest
Asking me by the bookstore girl.

234
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,063
Alone seriamos two people
Finishing a conversation.

235
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,824
There this well one, is not damage.

236
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,639
Flame or not, but flame.

237
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:36,251
Himself for which he knows, I will call though I am
Alone to tell me not to call.

238
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,264
This well one.

239
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,675
"I will call though I am alone
To tell me not to call

240
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,414
I establish it.

241
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:22,171
I never do that kind of things, officer.
In general I am always careful.

242
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,231
Nobody believes in

243
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,339
- Su multa.
- Esta bien.

244
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,846
That good.

245
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,043
- Hola.
- Hola.

246
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,454
What does it happen?

247
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,482
Nobody, he swims that is to say.

248
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,488
Danny return.

249
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,699
These either partner?

250
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,469
If, I am well.

251
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,268
- ¿En serio?
- Si.

252
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,571
You do not seem to be well.

253
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,142
Slightly very strange step.

254
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,808
I

255
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,945
Conoci to someone and it is other thing.

256
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,051
- Maldición.
- Esto es enorme.

257
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,721
- ¿Tienes su número?
- Si.

258
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,458
- ¿La vas a llamar?
- Es complicado.

259
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,192
It is simple you have to call.

260
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,031
Insurance has just known her, him
That I am very quick worries.

261
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,162
It is never very quick
In special at his age.

262
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,233
- Amy, Dan conocio a alguien.
- ¿Conocio a alguien?

263
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,244
What can he call so soon?

264
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,576
I could not say you
I have not been single per years.

265
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,582
My god, you knew someone.

266
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,641
Dan knew a ricura.

267
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,284
You know that, preguntemosle to potato.

268
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,449
How is he?

269
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,758
Her

270
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,426
Which is... the question?

271
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,665
That is my brother, Dan
He needs your advice.

272
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,765
A ricura and this knew something agitated one.

273
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,538
Would not it be your?

274

All the family would know

275
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,805

- Vámonos todos

276
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,622
- ¿Anie?
- Es Ann Marie.

277
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,219
Mitch me calls Anie but I am Marie.

278
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:27,755
I have to two Maries my class of
Exercises, I did not want to confuse them.

279
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,893
That not serious good.

280
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,335
I prefer Marie.

281
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,998
We go fondness, all the women.

282

- Están muy atrasados.
- No es nada.

287
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,097
Two consecutive things.

288
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:10,937
That is strange your you are interested
In someone, he must be very special.

289
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,311
It is what I try to tell, you, I did not pass anything.

290
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,010
- Ella tiene novio.
- Eso no es problema.

291
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,386

- ¿Tiene una roca en su mano izquierda?
- No, aun no.

295
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,620
It is fair juice then.

296
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,154
Concentrense people, fryer.

297

Pate.

298
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,459
Opening that is that.

299
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:44,340
The previous word the
We relate to this.

300
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,069
That would do the word ocean.

301
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,544
Everyone did them.

302
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,682
10 letters something that could not
Go out bad if Salian so.

303

We are not in them even of down.

304

Rays.

305
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,994
I end one.

306
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,296
Congratulations.

307
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,405

312
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,512
It is very quick for saying.

313
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:37,785
Saying that, it is shiny, kind
And adorable, if you spoil it

314
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,026
We will get rid of you
And her will keep her.

315
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,064
Dan, I am you absent there.

316
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,531
Seriously, that girl is incredible.

317
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,037
- ¿Qué te parece?
- Es grandiosa.

318
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,235
Not, by here.

319
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,373
Do I show you where we are in this map?

320
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,605

Of having known that you are
My brother's girlfriend.

322
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,280

And that I become clear that I do not call you "ricura "

324
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,618
This is the bay.
There we are.

325
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,028
- Ya veo.
- ¿Qué debemos hacer?

326
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,331
It is funny, we should tell everybody.

327
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,836
No, no, no.

328
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,737

331
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,605
- Tío Mitch, no estas contando.

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,007

339
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,516
- Mitch es un gran tipo.
- Si que lo es.

340
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,453
It is funny, complicated
In a good way.

341
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,016
- Justo lo que necesito.
- Es un gran tipo.

342
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:53,393
Sali of a complicated relation
And uni to a gym and Mitch was there.

343
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,525
- Es un gran tipo.
- Sigues diciendo eso.

344
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,061
Because it is.

345
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,432
So good luck gives birth to all us.

346
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,775
This well one.

347
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,476
The small Burt told me that
They will give you a reward.

348
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,487
They are seeing many
Columnists it is something very distant one.

349
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,790
She is incredible he has lived there
Or Tibet has visited it.

350
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,729
Chile, Berlin, where they are the walls.

351
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,928
Wait

352
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,698
- Mitch se saco el premio.

353
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,773

Cover in asparaguses.

359
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,034
And never oli swims myself.

360
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,534
Could they pass me the corn?

361

363
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,074

364
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,311
- ¿Tienes hermanos?

365
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,013

368
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,764
Talent Show.

369

- ¿Cómo seria tu día perfecto?
- El mío comenzaria con Anie

370
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,370
Do not ask you.

371
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:48,844
My perfect day serious wake up in one
pais in which I do not know his language.

372
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,317
No customs, a place where
This out of my element.

373
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,779
Welcome.

374
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,220
That was what I said when
I saw it for the first time.

375
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,722
You do not have to shout.

376
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:09,662
I thought that I had died because
There was an angel in the room.

377
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,227
Thanks.

378
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,944

00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,976
- Algunos seguimos comiendo.

381
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:07,014
He does not, excuse if we overwhelm you.

382
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,654
When does a boyfriend turn into your lover?

383
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:15,688
This either, this well one, believe that
We should he stops doing it

384
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,667
You ask, he has been like that all the night.

00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,533

Excuse, none of them

Mitch old fiancés he has been
Submitted to such interrogation.

390
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,281
There the diabla comes

391
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,491
I do not talk to you of the diabla
Nor who was in the marine.

392
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,190
Or to the masseur therapist.

393
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,326
None of the airhostesses
Of the international lineas.

394
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,929
- que vinieron a esta casa.
- Ya es suficiente.

395
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,566

396
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:06,145
Dan goes by lightening that thanks.
You are the type ready mas that I know.

397
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,320
Turn is of that Anie asks me
What want to know.

398
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,490
Preguntame what you want.

399
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,828
- No tengo preguntas.
- Vamos.

400
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:28,064
Mitch told that me whether he forgot
His last one, that would forget mine.

401
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,438
That is something stupit one.

402
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,679
John, brings the foot.

403
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,764
Your not, your you washed the plates by yourself.

404
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,519
I establish it, go too far of the line.

405
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,584
Never it is like that, you are my brother.

406
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,788
I believe that you would understand.

407
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,161
There is not anything that you can
Make me to worry.

408
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:35,333
When you talked about my others
Girls tell me bill of something

409
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,572
What I establish by Marie is different.

410
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,782
- Sabes ese sentimiento en tu...
- Corazón.

411
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,583
- Si, cuando tu corazón...
- Late fuerte.

412
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,390
¿ How if I were I was
Of the ribs?

413
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,358
If.

414
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:02,458
Feel vulnerable, well but bad.
You the heart hurts and it is good.

415
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,797
If.

416
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,994
How does that call one?

417
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,001
Love.

418
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,302
You always have the words.

419
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,487
- Stanford o Berkley.
- Esas son buenas escuelas.

420
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,115
Quizas Washinton university.

421
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,723
Or some place close to house.

422
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,959
If you have problems with sleeping
You already know where to meet me.

423
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,229

Good night kiss?

Rooms separated until you marry you.

426
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,138

- Yo estoy de acuerdo con eso.

427
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,648
- Gracias Dan.
- De nada.

428
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,850
What do you do Mitch?

429
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,547
Marie I buy books but I believe
That should read a book

430
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,522
- de un escritor verdadero.
- No es buena idea.

431
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,855
- Por favor no.
- Es el mejor libro.

432
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,987
- Quizas otro sea mejor.
- Se amable.

433
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,089
- Si lo firmaras seria grandioso.
- Cuidado, es primera edición.

434
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,793
It is the only edition.

435
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,829
Good night.

436
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,030
He sleeps well.

437
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,700
Deseria you did that not give it to him.

00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,063
Put you to the front.

455
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,219
With the arms.

456
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,699
Look at Dan so they see
What they do not have to do.

457
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,304
- Fue excelente.
- Gracias.

458
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,712
It was impressive.

459
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,623
That one is one good snooty.

460
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,164
Quizas you try that with me later.

461
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,991

In fact my daughters they want it to happen
A time of quality with his pope

467
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,844
But I promise us to do it other day.

468

Shells and of the mache paper shark.

00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,663
Do you remember that you liked taffies?

He sounds well.

478
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,379
Life this full of disillusions
Sometimes big and sometimes mas big

479
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,483
What will, the light or the museum be?

480
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,024
- ¿Saben porque tenemos faros?
- ¿Por qué son bonitos?

481
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,963
If and also because they help
When this dark.

482
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,530
Help to keep to the boats safely.

483
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,240
For which do not crash against the rocks.

484
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:25,047
Because when these over there outside
And waves you rock from a side the other.

485
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:32,511
And you that never consider truths earth once again
And that you would be able I will break to pieces

486
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:37,357
Sink until the bottom, deep.

487
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,757
It is that light what keeps us in course.

488
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,158
- La luz.
- ¿Te sientes bien, papa?

489
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,661
Clear that if, fondness.

490
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,442
Did they have a good time?

491
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,745
- No.
- No.

492
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,515
- Chicos, ¿dónde estaban?
- Lo se, lo se.

493
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,453
- Los busque por todas partes.
- Para un expertos en paternidad.

494
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,962
The one, I was not thinking.

495
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,622
Hello boy.

496
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:29,736
Dave, her you had seen, it is incredible
Me I kill the last mile.

497
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,680
Was it enough?

498
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,239
I believed that I would not achieve it.

499
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,189
To where he went Do they give?

500
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,613
Marie, there are clean towels
In the right office.

501
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,154
I am surprised your skin.

502
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,521
I am surprised your smell.

503
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,521
I am surprised your eyes.

504
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,858
iPapa!

505
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:29,395
You are a strange one. I do not, establish it.
He is my father's loser.

506
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,533
If, I was spying.

507
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,343
- ¿Hola?
- Tenemos que hablar.

508
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:44,984
Can not he wait?

509
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,956
This this working for you?
You have to be honest.

510
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,858
- La estoy pasando bien.
- ¿Bien?

511
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,361
If, then he is.

512
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,160
- ¿Te estas divirtiendo?
- Tengo jabon en los ojos.

513
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,629
Because you know something
Me I am not entertaining

514
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:02,867
I believe that I eat two people
We should have rules.

515
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:07,240
- ¿No lo crees?
- Claro.

516
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:14,276
This well, of that was talking
We must keep distance, tab.

517
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,014
- Una toalla.
- Bien, lo siento.

518
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,112
Thanks.

519
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,985
- Deja de leer mi libro.
- ¿Por qué?

520
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:26,895
- Y esa salsa que haces.
- ¿De qué estas hablando?

521
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,367
The sauce, this thing
If you could stop doing it.

522
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,298
I establish it.

523
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,399
I would much never help each other
Have known of your existence.

524
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,536
- Gracias.
- Si, lo dije

525
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,938
He did not go in serious but I said it.

526
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,642
And do you taste that hare mas?

527
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:52,955
I go to make less attractive give birth
That feelings do not emerge

528
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:58,992
That funny but I
I will stop thinking in you.

529
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,023
- Que bien.
- Lo hare.

530
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:06,168
And if I start to think
In you who it happens maybe.

531
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,899
At a moment of weakness.

532
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,401
I will approach me in your faults.

533
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,773
- ¿Mis defectos?
- Tus defectos.

534
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:14,869
And those are?

535
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,404
I do not have idea but you can be
Sure that I will find out it.

536
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,240
- Estoy acá.
- Lo siento mucho.

537
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,411
- ¿Te estas duchando?
- Si, eso hare.

538
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,652
A small advice
Domestic old trick.

539
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,622
Thanks.

540
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,056
Can I talk you of something?

541
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,221
Opening.

542
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,130
Can he remain between us?

543
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:47,008
That you were talking about your life is alone
Last night and of the importance of traveling.

544
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:55,543
Try new things and I put me
To think of the good that serious

545
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,446
That seems to be this list.

546
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,527
Even these dressed.

547
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,693
Not I will, look, I will look give birth here.

548
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,800
Finally, I have just given me bill.

549
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,100
I have been thinking of what I want a lot
Do.

550
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,444
But not alone in the school.

551
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,646
I have to see that hare with my life exactly.

552
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:33,217
One that I want to go to a new place
And have a house.

553
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:38,820
But trying to decipher is difficult
Where you must be.

554
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,059
That good.

555
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:46,126
And have that experience, knowledge of him
That treats one.

556
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,163
Correct.

557
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:57,146
Me I establish landfall when giving me bill, give you
Bill of what you want ¿, you know?

558
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,701
Lunch.

559
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,620
He walks to suit to the dining room.

560
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,950
You know that I believe me I will suit with
The children.

561
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,855
Dan.

562
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,621
Let me please.

563
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,671
Hello boys.
Hello.

564
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,690
Hello?

565
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:39,504
Hello.

566
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:40,808
Hello

567
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,048
What this passing?

568
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,616
We are talking about something
But we are not entertaining.

569
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,418
If, I can see that.

570
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,416
How this? - She is surprising.

571
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,124
Goodbye daddy.

572
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:53,727
Goodbye.

573
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,730
Goodbye.

574
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,959
You said to me.

575
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:05,974
If, I was about getting out that of above
With a lot of forces

576
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:15,778
So I hid it and Salian, Salian very
Cute, I seemed a star.

577
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:18,387
If?

578
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,320
Dan. - Hello.

579
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,318
Fondness, we are worried about you.

580
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:30,298
And with what I pass this tomorrow are
Very worried.

581
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,798
Thanks, I feel been shocked.

582
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,400
But... I am well.

583
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,743
We are talking in private. - Further, this will be good.

584
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,408
We have to talk. - Further I am all ears.

585
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:51,019
Your you do so by your children
You do so by everybody.

586
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,949
What do you do for you?

587
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:57,717
It happens everyone. - That I am worried is alone.

588
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,764
This well one. Quedense by favor
Ma follows.

589
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,860
Is this by that he functioned rare? - If, fondness.

590
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,669
If, he is an explanation gives birth
All that.

591
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:12,440
And I have to talk with you, you have
You must be very depressed

592
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,676
So I think that you must feel you
With the short self-esteem

593
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,674
Do not - talk with my neurologist on that.

594
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:28,256
The only one asks that all us
We do he is if Dan found love of new.

595
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,150
Not he will not, do it. - Fondness.

596
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,089
I establish it, but he will not do it.

597
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,688
Love meets you.

598
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,773
I do not believe that I was being clear before
But you have to unplug that problem.

599
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:55,378
what I have listened to up to now and;
Worry, unplug, and drain.

600
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,278
Good... graces.

601
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:03,618
That is everything. I end one. - It is not that.

602
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:10,425
We knew Marcus daughter
In the drugstore and her I ask by you.

603
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,325
They should go out to have a good time.

604
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,438
What means that Rutri Draker will pick up you
To the 6 pm, and they are going to take some drinks.

605
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,368
Not the hare. - Angers to an appointment.

606
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,273
iNo, I will not go to an appointment!

607
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,080
iDan is time!

608
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:41,153
Mom I do not remember Ruthie face
I do not want to go.

609
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,463
iNo I want to go out with the hog face!

610
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:48,065
You are going to go. - iYa I do not remember it!

611
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,466
Decided iEsta! - I remember his face not even.

612
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,299
It will be an appointment blindly. - He walks, it will be amusing.

613
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,778
If, it will be amusing.

614
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,620
We go, do you one. - Good.

615
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,923
He walks as rough savage.

616
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,150
This either, this well one.

617
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,252
That is good.

618
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:57,000

You must not have long time to go out.

629
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,063
Someone had.

630

Of disfigured children.

00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,613
You are a saint.

642
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:28,320
By myself I do my part to help.

643
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,120
Like your brother.

644
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,120
Some times when I can not sleep
In the nights

645

I enter to internet and I read your articulos

What you said, the potato mother
It is an impressive story.

649
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:02,924
And in a paragraph speeches that is necessary
Give different foods each boy

650
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,023
What are you your?
A restaurant?

651
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,219
It is shiny. - Each word

652
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,293
Only him I say it is that.

653
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,999

But it is clear.

00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:20,603
That if the I have someday, your words
They will give me support.

655
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,820

656
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,146
Tendran that excuse, I can not
Avoid it.

657
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,367
With a backside I seized

658
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,971
.. que mas puede pedir alguien.

659
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:54,733
He hears.

660
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,342
Truth does ¿ not disturb her? - If.

661
00:56:58,882 --> 00:56:59,644
Good.

662
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,386
But I do not believe that this interested in her. - ¿ Not him these?

663

It seems that he feels better.

667
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,212
If, he seems.

668
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:33,304
That is good.

669
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,031
We go.

670
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,235

How are they? - Daddy, they are delicious.

681

01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,749
But you must use the head. - ¿ What does that mean?

For a columnist.

Lilly has asked me because
You were flirting with Mary.

718
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,223
I was not flirting. - Do not worry, cover you.

719
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,433
I told him that I was not anything.

01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,163
Because it is not.

721

Daddy.

He has come from Boston.

731
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,076
Daddy, that loves me.

01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,044
Good.

733
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,940
You do not have to worry
When one he reports to the sex.

734
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,745
Marty is who wants to wait.

735
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,557
And that must give me peacefulness?

736
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,653
I love daddy.

737
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,855
The master, the master.

The master.

739
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,529
You do not love him.

740
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,697
What we have is true love.

741
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,793
Alone because your you him do not have he does not mean that you must
Punish us.

742
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,201
Love is not at your age, appeal is
Sexual.

743
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,505
It is not love. - Your you are not good.

744
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,410

What is what I understand?
Help me please.

747
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:32,258
What do you feel connected to that person?

748
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:37,557
And when this person's fences
You do not know that say and you say about everything.

749
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,926
That this in your mind and in your heart
You know that they are destined to be together.

750
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:46,269
That this person will make to live you a best one
Version of your life.

751
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,141

He looks, I am not your father, but you must know that
Love is a dangerous feeling.

757
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:21,098
Not gentleman.

758
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,110
These discussing with me? - Not.

759
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,509
It is alone.

760
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,551
Love is not a feeling, it is an ability.

761
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,352
Who told you that?

762
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,919
Invent it, gentleman.

763
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,223
Come to say goodbye.

764
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,465

Sweet? ¿ How it can be
Sweet that?

771
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,595
Be as certain to feel a lot of love.

772
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,798
Love, not is a feeling. - ¿ Not?

773
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,395
It is an ability.

774
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,708
If that is true you have a daughter very skillful.

775
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:40,353
iTu you are a love assassin!

776
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,631
This well Sarah, the following ones.
We must do something with the girls

777
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,723
That we do usually.

778
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,166
My daughter and I work on the same.

779
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:57,263
That is cute.

780
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:58,933
And Jane?

781
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,868
This annoyed one. - ¿ What did he tell you?

782
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,370
Love assassin.

Teniamos he plan for all the family slightly.

785
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,425
Did your pope function?

786
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,396
That will not do it.

787
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,566
That is the only one this excluded from doing it.

788
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,436
I introduce myself to Bill Wilson.

789
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,213
These well ones? - Not.

790
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,050
Always do what bundles.

791
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:49,723
Mary is not a normal girl
I have to do something special.

792
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:52,359
Your same one one.

793
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,776
This is by Marty.

794
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,434
I have an idea.

795
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:08,462
Do you consider that this well one?

796
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:10,636
It can be.

797
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,740
Either, the last but not minus
The Mitch uncle.

798
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:22,242
Someone very wise, my brother.

799
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,444
He once told me that if.

800
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:30,291
.. quieres ser completamente honesto.
He sings.

801
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,591
By the way, let me present him my band

802
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:40,465

Very well in the school.

01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:27,824
What was that?

806
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,370
I could not arrest me.

807
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,430
What will we do now?

808
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,236
We can not do anything.
He is my brother.

809
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,340
Why you sang do I give birth my?

810
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,342
Because

811
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:53,555
He paginates 92, that lives because a
Angel I enter to the room.

812
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:58,390
He paginates 148, I will forget your past
If you forgive mine.

813
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,233
It seems that that was done by you.

814
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:06,797
It is unbearable.

815
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:11,304
I can not go on wanting.

816
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,728
Daddy?

817
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:30,523
If he Blows?

818
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,166
Can you come to my room?
I want to show you something that I need.

819
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,532
We will do it tomorrow
I promise it.

820
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:41,639

821
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:57,449
What this passing?

822
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,992
I must not have sung
The one.

823
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,905
But I already did it.

824
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,307
This crying or laughing?

825
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,845
No, please.

826
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,847
Do not let me.

827
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:36,722
Here he comes.

828
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:37,857
iMamá!

829
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,043
Do not function please normal.

830
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:08,926
I was an impressive kind.
She said that she loved me a lot.

831
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:11,989
And he said later.

832
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,099
The two we have to find ours
Twin souls.

833
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,907
I am confused not one I pass that
Of yesterday for today.

834
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,007
That made it to happen this.

835
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,242
There a reason by which is she. -..

836
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,413
Why do you look me to my? - I am not looking.

837
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:33,015
The I look at his future and your these
In that.

838
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,520
Dan ¿, you have something that to add?

839
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,621
If, that the expert has to say
We go.

840
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,226
Fondness, the truth is.

841
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,630
We fell down well.

842
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,734
If, really if.

843
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,462

Not.

We should do something amusing one.

845
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:09,281
If!

846
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,482
This is my blood. - Do it.

847
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,686
To his marks.

848
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,293
iVamos!

849
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,495

01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,575
You of new.

863
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,419
An official taste see it

864
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,216
Does he know by that I stopped it? - Clear that if.

865
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,386
One what towards and one that this
Evil.

866
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:21,790
This cost him. - Pongalo in my bill.

867
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,293
What was that? - Pongalo in my bill.

868
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,030
What are we doing?

869
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:00,992
That can this evil.

870
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,095
If.

871
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,397
But there is something correct one in our equivocation
Fodder.

872
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,598
¿ You create

873

They ask you.

What?

875
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,988
I believe that all this is premature.

876
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:26,786
You are right.

877
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:33,495

That one was a terrible shooting.

884
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:17,969
We can make it of new.

885
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,644
Two pines. - That is good.

886

We go, together
At three.

You two they finished ¿, certain? - Two hour ago.

896
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,550
The one, the one, himself.

And by yourself you are not a love assassin.
You are the worst world father.

934
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,593
That sweet.

Have the family near.

939

With Dan everyone keep the things
Between family.

01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:25,550
Certain Dan?

941

Thereby we think of you, in your columns
You represent your moral values.

The personal features that one
They reflect in your writings very impressive sound.

What we want to do, is that you say to him
To your readers who you do. -

01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:44,441
What is that?

946
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,338
Put to the family first.

947
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,840
This well, this is the question.

948
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:55,144
Someone has not been reading his
Column.

949
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,185
I am not sure that means that.

950
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,099
Andate.

951
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:16,008
You are one lie and a hypocrite
Deceive your brother with his girlfriend.

952
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:19,505
What as well do you know it? - Two violations and a collision.

953
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,513
Was that part of the plan?

954
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,019
The worst of all.
It was that you avoid to Lilly

955
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,914
She has wanted to show you something that did
For you.

956
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,521
But you never were.

957
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:06,209
I made a mistake really. - You did not do it.

958
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:07,379
If I did it mom.

959
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,213
What I made to Lilly. - Do not forget Mitch.

960
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:11,386
If.

961
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:15,687
And to that newspaper people. - It was not a good day.

962
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,828
If I had approached me in death
Of my wife.

963
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:22,830
Please.

964
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,496
Love is like that. - Debi have made it better.

965
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:30,004
Heri to my children. - He walks to desherirlos.

966
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:34,707
Fondness do task errors. - Many, too many.

967
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,953
Can someone give me other box by favor?

968
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,416
If, I already go.

969
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,431
Mitch, I.

970
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,571
Mas had to have been someone.

971
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,673
I am very

972
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,714
Let it there.

973
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,217
Hello beautiful.

974
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:35,703
Girls?

975
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:40,212
I would like to talk with Lilly to
Alone, if it is possible.

976
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:52,822
This well one.

977
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,404
One that spoils all, a lot.

978
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,474
If, you did it.

979
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:10,409
Now

980
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,305
Ma.

981
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:18,580
Strange to his mom, all the time
Always the hare.

982
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:20,376
Mom has gone.

983
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,016
I see fondness, every day.

984
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:28,894
I see it in his goodness, sacrifice
And passion.

985
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:35,000
Lilly, I memorize... his smile.

986
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,839
This is what hare.

987
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,936
I will punish me by life.

988
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,809
I will stay with you
I will be with you.

989
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:48,905
These with us everybody
The days.

990
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:50,643
I will not go to no place.

991
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,156
Confuse Veran, a little with
Mary.

992
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,923
But that one I end
This well one?

993
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,019
Perdi the head.

994
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:08,158
I was stupit, because I love her.

995
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,038
What?

996
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:15,641
That is... not not her master
What is not fifteen saying.

997
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:18,844
¿ How I can love her if alone
I know it?

998
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,637
Three days.

999
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:20,843
If.

1000
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:25,243
How can you know in 3 days?

1001
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:30,681
Not him one.

1002
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:33,251
If the one, I love her.

1003
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:36,960
I love her, I love her, I love her.

1004
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:47,471
He walks by her.

1005
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:51,374
You must be happy.

1006
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:02,919
He walks.

1007
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:07,621
Now.

1008
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,435
Fondness, for the path.

1009
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:30,446
What does it happen?

1010
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:32,451
I can not do it. - You must do it.

1011
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:33,751
I do not have licence.

1012
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,105
I am very good with the advices.

1013
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,271
This is very strange.

1014
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:59,011
But I would not lose it.

1015
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:15,760
Dear readers for most
You this column in his newspaper is my first one

1016
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:19,758
In the future I will answer his questions, but
Today

1017
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:25,035
I want to break my usual format and
Talk to him on the objective of the plans.

1018
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:29,666
Not my plans with this column, but
My life plans.

1019
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:31,475
As everybody we do it.

1020
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:36,142
And as we hope our children to can
Do it by if same.

1021
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:44,558
But to be honest with ourselves
The plans that do do not work as we wait

1022
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:52,898
So instead of asking people
Young ¿, such as they are your plans?

1023
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,661
What do you plan to do with your life?

1024
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,569
Maybe must tell them this

1025
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,905
Plan to have a surprise.

1026
01:33:00,906 --> 01:33:11,906
