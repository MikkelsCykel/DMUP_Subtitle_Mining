1
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:10,311
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:13,873
Jess told me that he is,
like, way into Ella.

3
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,852
Ugh, can you say "slut"?

4
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:19,755
- I heard she gave him a blumpie.
- Ew.

5
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,348
Boys are disgusting.

6
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:24,257
And that guy, Nick,
he thinks he's all, like,

7
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:26,592
"Look at me; I'm so beautiful."

8
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:28,806
- I think he's kind of cute.
- No, no.

9
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:33,496
I mean, he's kind of hot,
but he's not God's gift. No.

10
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:35,129
I heard he hooked up with Michelle.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,333
No, he did not!

12
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:41,003
He totally did, like, for real.

13
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:42,511
Funny.

14
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:44,343
School night. Bedtime.

15
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,349
But I'm studying with Lisa.

16
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:48,442
Hey.

17
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:51,579
Hey, Lis, where's that big party
this weekend?

18
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:52,849
Looks like she signed off.

19
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:54,925
Ooh, shocker.

20
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:57,722
Hey, isn't it past your bedtime?

21
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:58,955
Night, sweetie.

22
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:00,325
- I love you, sweetie.
- Love you.

23
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,363
- Good night.
- Mwah.

24
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,627
- Night, honey.
- Night.

25
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,374
Hi.

26
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:15,469
Shh.

27
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:26,523
Oh, my gosh, that's so cool!

28
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,859
I was standing next to Chris
in science class today,

29
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,698
and he turned, and he looked at me

30
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:41,066
out of the corner of his eye,

31
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:44,869
but I knew, I knew he was
looking right at me.

32
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:51,040
So then we start talking
about something.

33
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,980
I don't know. It was really silly.

34
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:55,450
And then we just, like,

35
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:57,487
started talking about lunch and stuff.

36
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,647
But it was really nice.

37
00:01:58,756 --> 00:01:59,984
And then he asked me,

38
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,353
"Did you do the homework?"

39
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,357
And I said, "Yeah."

40
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,950
And he said, "Can I copy it?"

41
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:05,461
And I said, "Yeah."

42
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:08,054
I almost died.

43
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:16,601
I'm gonna have to call you back.

44
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,733
Bye.

45
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,147
Jake?

46
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:36,323
Jake?

47
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:49,396
Dad?

48
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,500
Mom?

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,748
Do what I say, and you live.

50
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:09,987
I'm going to kill your mother
or your father.

51
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:13,894
You have 60 seconds to decide.

52
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:14,896
No!

53
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,899
Choose,

54
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,868
or I kill them both.

55
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:21,632
I can't! I can't!

56
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,505
Then that is your choice,

57
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,134
and they both die.

58
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:28,405
No, no, no, no!

59
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:29,411
No!

60
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:30,845
Choose!

61
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,644
Me, me, me, me, me!

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,945
Kill me!

63
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:39,655
Something to add, Dad?

64
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:40,655
Please!

65
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:42,248
Please calm down!

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,725
I will give you whatever you want.

67
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,126
Please don't hurt my family!

68
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,391
Come here, Jake.

69
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:00,402
All right, look.

70
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:02,103
Okay, okay.

71
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:03,111
You can do it. Choose me.

72
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,374
Just choose me.

73
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,712
Otherwise he's gonna kill
our whole family.

74
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:09,082
Please, just be brave and choose me.

75
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,052
Please, no.

76
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:12,144
I can't, Daddy.

77
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:13,245
Yes, you can.

78
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:14,256
Yes, you can.

79
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,294
Choose!

80
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:19,829
He's gonna kill us all if you don't.

81
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:21,091
You can do it!

82
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,066
All right, my father.

83
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,135
My father!

84
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:26,635
What?

85
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:28,535
Please. Come on, now.

86
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,267
That a girl. That a girl.

87
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:32,400
My father!

88
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,503
Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry!

89
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,138
Okay, that's okay.

90
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,147
All right.

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,242
I love you, Daddy!

92
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:53,426
And you will have to do the dirty work.

93
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,263
Pick it up!

94
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:12,707
You can do it.

95
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,478
Be brave. Come on, sweetie.

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,412
I can't.

97
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:23,891
Your choices have ramifications, Daddy.

98
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:25,963
Now!

99
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,190
I can't! I can't!

100
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:29,391
You can do it. You can do it.

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,398
Now!

102
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,594
- I can't!
- Do it.

103
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:34,830
Yes, you can, please!

104
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:35,871
Daddy!

105
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:37,099
Do it now!

106
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,869
Come on. That a girl.

107
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:40,341
- Daddy!
- Damn it, do it now!

108
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:43,107
Yes, Sara!

109
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:44,806
Do it!

110
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,975
Now, God damn it!

111
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:49,176
Do it now!

112
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:53,555
Daddy!

113
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,930
CHOOSE

114
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,367
Sheriff's deputies began
a search this morning

115
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:54,029
for two men who went missing
on the lake yesterday.

116
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:55,435
The sheriff says a family member

117
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,769
reported the 19-year-old and 20-year-old

118
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,536
missing early this morning.

119
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:02,306
The two men whose names
are not being released yet

120
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:05,109
were last seen camping
in the area of the lake.

121
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:08,208
Investigators said a canoe
was missing from the shoreline.

122
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,514
The Sheriff's Department
and New York State Police

123
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:11,849
are helping in the search.

124
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:13,253
We have a crew headed to the scene,

125
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:14,790
and we'll bring you more information

126
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:15,950
as it becomes available.

127
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,652
Thank you, Sandy.

128
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,165
The victim was 57-year-old

129
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:05,208
defense attorney Elliot Vincent.

130
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,869
Police sources say the suspect
bound and gagged

131
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,445
Vincent and his wife.

132
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,141
Then they say the suspect made
Vincent's teenage daughter

133
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,376
choose which parent should die,

134
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:15,975
threatening to kill the entire family

135
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:17,554
if she didn't.

136
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:20,021
Police describe the alleged
killer as a Caucasian male,

137
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:21,455
approximately six feet tall,

138
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,154
wearing a dark hooded
sweatshirt and knit cap.

139
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,127
Vincent was best known for his role

140
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,290
in the highly publicized
Wilshire Barrett case.

141
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,231
That case involved alleged sexual abuse

142
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:33,132
in several state-run
correctional facilities

143
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:35,137
throughout the county.

144
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,066
- Oh, God!
- Jesus!

145
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:52,802
What the hell's the matter with you?

146
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,172
You scared the shit out of me!

147
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:58,078
Well, you left your door open.
Are you okay?

148
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:01,948
And you're certain
that the door was locked?

149
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:04,043
Positive. I had just checked it.

150
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:06,554
Okay, 'cause there's no sign
of forced entry.

151
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,023
So you don't believe me?

152
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:10,150
I'm not saying that.

153
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:11,455
The door was locked.

154
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:14,395
Ever since this article came out,

155
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:17,695
I've had, like, 50 phone calls
down at the station,

156
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,292
everybody in varying degrees
of hysteria.

157
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:22,634
Oh, Dad.

158
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,038
I know what you're thinking.

159
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:26,803
Little Fiona living all alone

160
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,379
with a overactive
reporter's imagination.

161
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,742
Easy, easy, okay?

162
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,440
We'll dust for prints.
We'll investigate.

163
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,847
It's just-- you want my gut on this?

164
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,475
I think it's one of your stupid friends.

165
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:38,384
I don't have friends that
will pull a prank like that.

166
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:39,649
Okay, what about Paul?

167
00:13:39,757 --> 00:13:41,156
He's harmless.

168
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,920
Okay, I give up.

169
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:46,360
I'm sorry. I'll take it more seriously.

170
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,761
In fact, why don't you sleep
at home tonight?

171
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:52,097
For security reasons:
popcorn, old movies.

172
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:57,634
Dad, I lost the pigtails years ago:

173
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:58,799
Mm-hmm.

174
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,137
I'm getting my masters in June.

175
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,506
Not if I talk to your professors

176
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:03,102
and they agree to flunk you.

177
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:06,182
Just dust for prints.

178
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,272
Please?

179
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:08,646
Okay.

180
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:10,379
Let's talk about this
for a moment, though,

181
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:12,011
the scanner you're not supposed to have.

182
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,214
I know.

183
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:14,882
I just like to keep track of you.

184
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,016
Of me?

185
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:18,060
Not of your next story, big headlines?

186
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:19,754
All you, all the time.

187
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:21,228
All right.

188
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:23,300
Then clearly you won't mind
that I dusted for prints,

189
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,958
because as you mentioned--

190
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:27,094
Oh, jeez. Hold on.

191
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:30,634
Go for Wagner.

192
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:32,231
Yeah.

193
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:35,335
Uh-huh.

194
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:37,607
Ouch.

195
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:38,647
Okay.

196
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,717
Yeah.

197
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:42,786
I have to go.

198
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:45,184
I'll take this for prints.

199
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,553
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

200
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:49,523
Just a domestic disturbance
kind of thing.

201
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:50,719
I'll see you soon.

202
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:53,888
My mom would get the axe.

203
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,125
She spends every dime of my inheritance

204
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,758
without my old man keeping tabs on her.

205
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:01,497
I don't know. I guess my dad?

206
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:02,902
Or shit, maybe my mom.

207
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,167
You know what? Forget this.

208
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:05,605
I don't even want to think about it.

209
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,836
What about you, Fiona?
Which one would you choose?

210
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:10,175
You are such a dumb-ass.

211
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,269
Hello?

212
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,247
Shit, I-I spaced. I'm sorry, Fi.

213
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,442
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:15,575
Oh, look at that.

215
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:18,746
Not having a mom has its advantages.

216
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,221
How about this one?

217
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:21,985
You have to sleep with that guy or me?

218
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:24,185
- Choose.
- Ooh, tough one.

219
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:25,955
- I feel your pain, Fi.
- You have to choose.

220
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,724
You have a gun to your head.

221
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,264
I don't, and I won't.

222
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:30,594
Choose.

223
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,931
Jesus, Paul, back off, why don't you?

224
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:34,595
I'm just kidding. God.

225
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,297
Look, guys, I got to go.

226
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:37,635
Well, South Bat tonight?

227
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:40,039
No, I don't know.
I got to finish my paper.

228
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:42,772
Blah, blah, blah.
Just get your ass there, okay?

229
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,279
Idiot.

230
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:50,046
Go by Jefferson Hall.

231
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:42,894
A little less staccato
in that last measure.

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,831
Otherwise, very nice.

233
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:46,266
Bravo.

234
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,702
I will see you all one hour
before the performance tomorrow.

235
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,502
David, would it be all right
if I hang back for a while

236
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,132
and run through it on my own?

237
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:54,710
By all means.

238
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,780
You're coming along nicely, by the way.

239
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,007
Late bloomer, I guess.

240
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:03,709
Mind the house lights when you leave.

241
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,617
Hello?

242
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:46,423
Who--who's there?

243
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,519
Thank you.

244
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:52,398
Um, I was just leaving.

245
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:53,400
Sorry.

246
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,401
Oh.

247
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,701
Hello?

248
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,334
I just wanted to practice the end,

249
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:04,608
but I'm done, so it's fine.

250
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:09,007
David?

251
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,453
Is that you?

252
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:14,717
Hello?

253
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,423
Hey!

254
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:24,432
Stop screwing around!

255
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:51,125
Hey!

256
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:52,252
I'm still in here.

257
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,193
Come on, open up.

258
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,203
Who is that?

259
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,752
slam!

260
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,532
Oh, God.

261
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:39,966
Who's that? Who are you?

262
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:42,375
I'm a member of the orchestra.
It's okay for me to be here.

263
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:44,947
I mean, I'm just David's friend.

264
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:53,816
Just take-- take my money.

265
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:56,119
I don't want your money, Simon.

266
00:20:56,226 --> 00:21:01,994
I am going to take something
much more dear to you than that.

267
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,465
Either you lose the ability to hear

268
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:08,868
or your lose the ability to play.

269
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,111
Shut up! This way!

270
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,613
Hurry up! Get on your knees!

271
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,242
Okay!

272
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,977
Choose.

273
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:29,623
Your hearing...

274
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:33,924
or your fingers.

275
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,498
Why is this happening?

276
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,500
You have 60 seconds to decide.

277
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:41,400
What's it gonna be?

278
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:43,473
Fine.

279
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:46,337
Fingers.

280
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:49,708
But you have one more choice to make.

281
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:52,213
All at once

282
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:57,116
or one at a time?

283
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,212
Choose!

284
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:12,366
crunch!

285
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:41,320
ISO_17?

286
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:42,796
ISO_17.

287
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:11,485
Hey, hey, no sleeping in here!

288
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:12,555
God damn it.

289
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,453
How'd you even get--

290
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:20,862
Shit.

291
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,297
So the janitor found
the poor bastard passed out

292
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:26,369
in the staircase.

293
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,334
No witnesses, no security cameras.

294
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:29,837
Great. What else?

295
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,899
Looks like we got a pattern.

296
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,103
That's blood.

297
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:39,614
From the crime scene last night.

298
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:40,808
That's a match.

299
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,145
Where's the victim?

300
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:43,947
Covenant Hospital.

301
00:24:44,054 --> 00:24:46,784
Show me where they found him.

302
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,788
How bad is it?

303
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,119
He'll live.

304
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:50,716
I'm not sure how much
he's gonna want to.

305
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:52,021
Snipped off all his fingers

306
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:53,925
and made sure they
couldn't be sewn back on.

307
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,395
Oh, shit.

308
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,595
Yeah, that's the symbol
I told you about.

309
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:04,435
I already got Jamie on it.

310
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:07,533
Christ almighty.

311
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,477
The aforementioned fingers.

312
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,415
Sheriff Wagner. Follow me.

313
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,953
Sheriff Wagner, any comments
for the evening news?

314
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:20,249
- No.
- Come on, Tom.

315
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:21,483
Throw me a bone here.

316
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:23,252
Your kid wants to join their ranks?

317
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,554
Good times.

318
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:27,653
Sheriff Wagner has no comment.

319
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:29,254
"Sources close to the investigation

320
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:30,799
"say the attacker forced the victim

321
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,697
"to choose between losing his hearing

322
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:34,360
or losing his fingers."

323
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:36,098
How does a person
do something like that?

324
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,901
You know, personally, I think I'd rather

325
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:39,839
lose my hearing and be deaf
than lose my fingers,

326
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:41,001
but the guy was a pianist,

327
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:43,204
so a pretty raw deal either way, right?

328
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:45,907
Hello? What is with you?

329
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:47,916
You're acting all weird. Are you okay?

330
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:49,315
If I tell you something,

331
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,444
do you promise not to think I'm crazy?

332
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:54,490
- Forget about it.
- No, tell me.

333
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:55,956
No, really, let's just drop it.

334
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,390
Fi!

335
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:04,132
In her note,
my mom talked about choices,

336
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:05,428
and it never made sense.

337
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:07,400
But what if someone made her choose,

338
00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:09,472
choose between doing what she did

339
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:12,803
or--or something else
that was even more horrible?

340
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:14,740
That would explain it, right?

341
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:16,937
Then it would make sense.

342
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,106
Have you spoken
to your father about this?

343
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:21,240
God, I can't talk to him
about this stuff.

344
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:23,216
Last time I tried,
he totally freaked out on me.

345
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,787
Maybe you should just try, Fi.

346
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:26,617
You know, maybe you should just try.

347
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,819
You're right.

348
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,125
It's silly.

349
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:39,497
I'm just being silly.

350
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,090
Mr. Campbell?

351
00:27:11,201 --> 00:27:14,329
Not another one of you.

352
00:27:14,437 --> 00:27:16,337
I just...

353
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,963
I just want to get some sleep.

354
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:21,168
Of course.

355
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:23,177
I understand.

356
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:27,173
Get on with it already.

357
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:30,013
Come on, come on.

358
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:38,360
Um, is there anything else
you can think of that might help

359
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:40,395
identify the guy who did this to you?

360
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:42,965
How many times
do I have to go over this?

361
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,761
It was dark.

362
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:47,632
He had a flashlight
in my eyes the whole time.

363
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:50,672
I don't know who he was
or how he knew my name--

364
00:27:50,774 --> 00:27:52,969
He knew your name?

365
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,639
What else did he know about you?

366
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:00,272
Nothing, I guess.

367
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,010
Did he say anything to you
that stuck out

368
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:04,143
or anything that you could
think of that might have--

369
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:08,953
Something about choices
and, uh, ramifications

370
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:10,184
or something like that.

371
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:12,818
I don't know.

372
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:18,163
There must be a reason
why he picked you.

373
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:20,566
There must be a reason
why he chose you.

374
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,694
Can you think of anything?

375
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:23,067
Do you know him?

376
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,437
Have you ever met somebody
that might do this to you

377
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:26,702
or anything?

378
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,641
Please, there must be a reason.

379
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:33,079
I just--

380
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:35,981
I just want to get some sleep.

381
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:50,751
Okay, next.

382
00:30:50,853 --> 00:30:51,751
Okay, okay.

383
00:30:51,854 --> 00:30:53,014
Do you have the camera?

384
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,787
Try a little less smile.

385
00:30:57,894 --> 00:30:59,088
You got five frames.

386
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:00,628
Great, but it's not been the five best

387
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,662
we've had so far, okay?

388
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:02,753
Come on, give me a nice smile.

389
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,594
Just give me your eyes. There you go.

390
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,259
You know what? I'm over this.

391
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:09,361
I'm done. I'm done.

392
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:17,372
Asshole.

393
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,072
All right, you know,
let me see everything

394
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:20,513
from the first camera right away.

395
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:22,346
Just forget about the other one
for now, okay?

396
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:25,883
No, I just wrapped.

397
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:28,014
A bullshit day, as always.

398
00:31:28,124 --> 00:31:29,182
I don't feel well.

399
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:30,520
Listen, I need to eat.

400
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:33,494
So if you don't mind
putting in an order for me,

401
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,393
that would be great.

402
00:31:35,498 --> 00:31:36,396
Yeah, I know.

403
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:37,830
Baby, I know, but listen--

404
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,162
I-- okay.

405
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:40,326
Fine.

406
00:31:40,436 --> 00:31:41,596
Hey, sorry. I'm sorry.

407
00:31:41,704 --> 00:31:42,966
We're just--we're wrapped up.

408
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,539
Can you see that I'm on the phone here?

409
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:45,938
- Yeah, seriously.
- Okay.

410
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:47,236
Not a conversation for you.

411
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,072
Get the fuck out of here.

412
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:50,270
No, just some idiot.

413
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,678
I'm sorry.

414
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,409
No, don't be such a fucking asshole.

415
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:55,643
No, I don't care.

416
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:57,413
He just walked in here
and was eavesdropping

417
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,112
on my whole conversation.

418
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:00,348
All right.

419
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:02,048
Yeah, well,
you better start thinking of me

420
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:03,056
for a change, all right?

421
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:05,184
Yeah, okay.

422
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:07,228
Yeah, well, that's your opinion.

423
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,457
I'll see you later.

424
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:10,827
If you want to get laid tonight,

425
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,992
you better drop the fucking attitude.

426
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:18,300
What?

427
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:21,434
No, go away.

428
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:25,004
Listen, I'll be done when I'm done.

429
00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:26,240
Just give me a minute.

430
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:29,642
Are you fucking kidding me?

431
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:32,016
What the-- listen, you little shit,

432
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:33,554
whatever the fuck your name is,

433
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:35,123
if you expect to come back here tomorrow

434
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:36,122
and have a job--

435
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,954
Hey, not funny!

436
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:39,688
I thought you loved the camera, Jenna.

437
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,423
Who the fuck are you, you creepy fuck?

438
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:44,591
Sticks and stones will break your bones.

439
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,566
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

440
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:47,931
Vain to the very end.

441
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:51,200
Not afraid for your life,
just for your face.

442
00:32:53,443 --> 00:32:54,341
Help!

443
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:56,708
I want to offer you a choice.

444
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,008
You have 60 seconds to decide.

445
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,913
What is more dear to you, bitch?

446
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:05,454
Your eyesight or your beauty?

447
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:08,615
You'll either never be able
to see yourself again,

448
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:14,527
or the world will see what
a miserable hag you really are.

449
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:22,797
No, please!

450
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:26,705
Now let me see
those big, beautiful lips.

451
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,300
No, please!

452
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:50,983
The hourglass is handmade.

453
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:52,060
And I've timed it.

454
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,389
It's exactly one minute.

455
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:54,929
Down to the frickin' second.

456
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:57,499
Perfection is certainly
keeping with the profile.

457
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:00,797
Hey, Alice. My dad here?

458
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:02,234
Yeah, his office.

459
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:05,800
So that's now two handmade hourglasses.

460
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:07,000
They match perfectly.

461
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:08,633
The last crime scene and now this one.

462
00:35:08,744 --> 00:35:11,975
We got zero fingerprints, zero hair.

463
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:13,912
This guy's good, really good.

464
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:16,314
We've never seen this level
of expertise before.

465
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:19,252
I'm just waiting on
the DNA report from Forensics,

466
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:21,516
see if we can get anything on the blood.

467
00:35:21,624 --> 00:35:23,091
I just heard the vic, Simon Campbell,

468
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:25,353
has regained consciousness
up at Covenant Hospital,

469
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:27,588
so I'm gonna head over there
and question him, all right?

470
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,097
And let me know if anything
clicks with our piano man.

471
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,498
Hey, Ms. Pulitzer herself.

472
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:35,298
- Hmm.
- How you doing?

473
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:37,065
Good. You?

474
00:35:37,173 --> 00:35:39,403
Oh, you know, been worse.

475
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:41,066
Been better.

476
00:35:45,514 --> 00:35:46,742
Hey.

477
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:50,379
- Bad time?
- No, no.

478
00:35:50,486 --> 00:35:51,885
Just promise me you'll never become

479
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:53,512
one of these bottom-feeders.

480
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:55,147
No comment.

481
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:57,192
That's my line.

482
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:58,419
Whole town's in a tizzy

483
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:00,859
because there might be
a madman on the loose.

484
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:03,454
Well, isn't there?

485
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:04,624
It's a little early

486
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:06,668
to be broadcasting
that kind of hysteria.

487
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:09,636
So the crimes actually aren't connected?

488
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:11,206
I'm not saying that.

489
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:13,172
Then there's a maniac on the loose.

490
00:36:13,276 --> 00:36:15,039
Are we really having this discussion?

491
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:16,338
You taking notes?

492
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:18,606
God help the cops on your beat.

493
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:19,942
Please, come in.

494
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:22,313
Sit down.

495
00:36:28,524 --> 00:36:31,357
I got a pop-up message
this morning on my computer.

496
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,554
Photographs of this woman
tortured, burned.

497
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:35,995
I think she might be dead.

498
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:38,692
Uh-huh.

499
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:42,464
You know, that's terrible.

500
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,004
I'm not saying it isn't,

501
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:46,597
and I don't mean to downplay
what you're going through here.

502
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:49,075
It's just that it could be spam.

503
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:50,839
It could be one of your stupid friends.

504
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:55,145
It had the same symbol
right there from that musician!

505
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,317
Why didn't you tell me?

506
00:36:58,421 --> 00:36:59,615
Why didn't I tell you?

507
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:01,087
That's classified information.

508
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,658
Listen, I can't tell you everything,
all right?

509
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,249
There's this crazy little fuzzy line

510
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:06,487
between being your father

511
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:08,722
and being in charge of an investigation,

512
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:10,958
not to mention your
soon-to-be chosen prof--

513
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,058
Don't give me that look.

514
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:14,534
Your mother gave me that look.

515
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:15,729
You piss her off too?

516
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,863
Quite regularly.

517
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:26,743
What I wouldn't give
for one of her looks right now.

518
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:28,976
Oh, Fi.

519
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:34,580
She would be so proud of you,
all this nosing around.

520
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:42,057
Coming up on the anniversary.

521
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:43,096
Is that right?

522
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,724
It comes up so quick every year.

523
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,928
Oh, come on, Dad.

524
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:49,504
There's a lot of stress in the office,

525
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:52,699
in case you hadn't noticed.

526
00:37:52,808 --> 00:37:54,435
Get your team to look at this, please.

527
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:56,135
I will. I promise.

528
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:58,645
Just promise me you're gonna
stay away from this case.

529
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:00,306
- Promise.
- Okay, go.

530
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:02,748
Go, go, go already.

531
00:38:09,258 --> 00:38:10,953
I told you she'd be a heartbreaker.

532
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,153
Yeah, you did say something about that.

533
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:15,662
Imagine if it was yours.

534
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:19,462
Have forensics examine this
hard drive, will you, please?

535
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:20,933
We, uh, we just got a call.

536
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,561
Looks like we got another one.

537
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:23,968
Photo studio downtown.

538
00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:26,701
Young woman, tortured, burned?

539
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:29,141
Jesus, you're good.

540
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:30,712
How the fuck did you get that?

541
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:31,364
Hello! Are you coming out
with us tonight?

542
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:33,567
God!

543
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:35,007
You know, your door was open again.

544
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,806
You got to get that fixed.

545
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:40,473
Yeah, I know.

546
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,414
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

547
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,509
Okay, fun

548
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,019
or whatever the hell you're doing:

549
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:47,180
it's your choice.

550
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,348
Oh, God, it's gone viral already.

551
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,618
Look, I'm sorry.

552
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:53,354
I'm in tonight, but thanks anyway.

553
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:56,192
All right, okay. Suit yourself.

554
00:39:56,298 --> 00:39:58,858
But will you just promise me
you'll lock your door this time?

555
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:00,799
Yes, I'll lock the door.

556
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:02,234
Bye.

557
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:03,703
Okay.

558
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:05,433
Bye.

559
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:51,385
Hello?

560
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:54,320
Hello?

561
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:59,324
Anybody there?

562
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:09,649
Can I help you?

563
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,218
I'm sorry.

564
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,795
I tried the office, but no one answered.

565
00:43:13,896 --> 00:43:14,794
I was just leaving.

566
00:43:14,897 --> 00:43:15,864
Wait.

567
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:17,727
You're trespassing.

568
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,425
I could call the cops, you know.

569
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:23,767
But you, uh...

570
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:25,999
you look like maybe you like to party.

571
00:43:27,943 --> 00:43:29,934
Excuse me.

572
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,345
You smell good.

573
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:47,625
Like apples.

574
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,392
I like apples.

575
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:53,525
Yeah?

576
00:43:53,635 --> 00:43:56,570
Yeah.

577
00:43:57,673 --> 00:43:58,867
How do you like them apples?

578
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:09,408
346...

579
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:18,017
Huh.

580
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,111
The Barometer of Morality.

581
00:45:28,964 --> 00:45:30,659
Hmm.

582
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:36,737
I see 6941.704.

583
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:42,368
69...694...

584
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:43,877
Oh, God.

585
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:46,539
Oh, Paul, God damn it!

586
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:47,945
A little on edge?

587
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,449
God, a little.

588
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:52,019
Hey, so are you going
to South Bat tonight or what?

589
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,418
I can't. I'm buried.

590
00:45:54,523 --> 00:45:56,047
Bummer.

591
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:59,753
All right, I got to go find
my Environmental Economy texts.

592
00:45:59,862 --> 00:46:00,760
Okay.

593
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:01,852
Don't study too much, okay?

594
00:46:01,964 --> 00:46:04,194
Do you need to unwind a little?

595
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:05,664
You want to make out?

596
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:06,665
No!

597
00:47:19,074 --> 00:47:22,532
Hey, I would like to check these out.

598
00:47:22,644 --> 00:47:26,375
Hmm, Free Choice Psychology,

599
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:29,939
Pathology of lrrational Choices,

600
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:33,021
and Choices: The Barometer of Morality.

601
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:36,113
All right.

602
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,087
Hmm.

603
00:47:39,194 --> 00:47:42,527
These aren't ours.

604
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:43,859
Excuse me?

605
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:47,026
Yeah, they're not showing up
in the system.

606
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,407
Next.

607
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:09,751
Sorry, guys.

608
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:11,416
I'd prefer more of a tropical landscape,

609
00:48:11,526 --> 00:48:12,424
to be honest with you.

610
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:16,857
I'm not really sure.

611
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:21,633
Brian.

612
00:48:21,737 --> 00:48:24,968
Fi, what's up?

613
00:48:25,073 --> 00:48:27,268
Can you check this out for me?

614
00:48:27,376 --> 00:48:29,344
Yeah, sure. Just give me a second.

615
00:48:29,444 --> 00:48:30,741
Sorry, guys. Closing time.

616
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:32,438
Got to go. Sorry.

617
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:33,809
- Sorry, guys.
- Sorry.

618
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:34,939
- Thank you.
- See you.

619
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,575
I'll help you with the next one.

620
00:48:37,686 --> 00:48:39,745
Peace. See you, man.

621
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:41,288
Yeah, come on in.

622
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,052
Take a seat.

623
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,285
Well, what I can tell you is,

624
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:47,123
is that we have
seven binary identifiers,

625
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:49,356
a constant width module,
and an interweaving matrix.

626
00:48:49,464 --> 00:48:51,261
- English.
- It's barcode.

627
00:48:51,366 --> 00:48:52,856
Yeah, I kind of got that far myself.

628
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:54,526
Can you look it up?

629
00:48:55,937 --> 00:48:57,905
Yes, I can look it up.

630
00:48:58,006 --> 00:49:00,372
Just give me one second here.

631
00:49:04,813 --> 00:49:08,476
That's weird.

632
00:49:12,888 --> 00:49:15,083
No.

633
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,990
Um...

634
00:49:19,094 --> 00:49:21,494
It's Codabar.

635
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:22,858
This isn't current barcode.

636
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,397
Meaning?

637
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:26,592
Meaning it's, like,
old linear code used in libraries

638
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:28,329
way before the digital age.

639
00:49:28,437 --> 00:49:29,995
Nobody uses this anymore.

640
00:49:30,105 --> 00:49:32,733
Where did you get these books?

641
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:34,706
Can you trace it?

642
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:35,902
I can try.

643
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:37,501
Really don't have
much to work with here.

644
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,412
Got nothing here.

645
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,418
Are you sure?

646
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:47,647
Yep.

647
00:50:05,874 --> 00:50:06,932
The last four numbers

648
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:09,476
look like the Dewey decimal numbers.

649
00:50:09,578 --> 00:50:11,102
Holy shit.

650
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:13,374
Who doesn't love a girl who
knows the Dewey decimal system?

651
00:50:13,482 --> 00:50:16,417
Do you think the other numbers
are a branch code, a city,

652
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:17,780
a state, or something?

653
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:19,012
Maybe.

654
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:20,452
That's not a bad idea.

655
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:27,284
What's that number?

656
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:31,329
Milburn.

657
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:33,526
That's, like, a half hour from here.

658
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,296
Yeah. Let's see.

659
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:46,474
The only problem is, there are
no libraries in Milburn.

660
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:49,311
Well, maybe it's a private school,

661
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:50,441
an old folks' home,

662
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:51,951
or something else that has a library.

663
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:53,350
I mean, it's a possibility.

664
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:54,547
But I'm telling you,

665
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:56,419
the only public institution I see here

666
00:50:56,525 --> 00:50:59,050
is Milburn Juvenile Detention,
and that's about it.

667
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:00,355
And it closed in 2000.

668
00:51:00,462 --> 00:51:02,362
Where the hell did you get
these books from again?

669
00:51:02,464 --> 00:51:04,398
Look up why they closed.

670
00:51:08,837 --> 00:51:09,997
Whoa, holy shit.

671
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:11,402
"After extensive inquiries,

672
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:13,770
"charges were never filed
as the evidence was considered

673
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:15,536
purely circumstantial."

674
00:51:17,345 --> 00:51:19,404
Jesus.

675
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:21,539
Does that look circumstantial to you?

676
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,674
Absolutely not.

677
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:24,308
The official story: "The Milburn guards

678
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:25,477
were cleared of all charges."

679
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:27,555
But they closed the place anyway.

680
00:51:27,656 --> 00:51:29,021
Yep.

681
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:33,385
These books are from there.

682
00:51:33,495 --> 00:51:34,553
He's from there.

683
00:51:34,663 --> 00:51:36,153
Are you talking about Mr. Choose-it?

684
00:51:36,264 --> 00:51:37,697
How the hell do you know that, Fi?

685
00:51:40,302 --> 00:51:42,236
I just know.

686
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:47,071
Brian, thank you.

687
00:51:50,178 --> 00:51:52,305
So far, the pattern is no pattern.

688
00:51:52,414 --> 00:51:54,314
Hundred miles apart, male, female,

689
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,509
different jobs, lifestyles.

690
00:51:56,618 --> 00:51:59,348
The latest DNA check on
the blood tells us what, Alice?

691
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:01,581
Nothing matches the database so far.

692
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,090
But the maze for Jenna Marlowe

693
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:06,353
was drawn in Simon Campbell's blood.

694
00:52:06,461 --> 00:52:07,758
He appeared to know all of them,

695
00:52:07,863 --> 00:52:09,160
or at least knew facts about them.

696
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:10,925
That simply tells us
that he stalked them.

697
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:14,195
Well, we got to start thinking
about this in a whole new light,

698
00:52:14,302 --> 00:52:16,133
a different angle,
different possibilities.

699
00:52:16,238 --> 00:52:18,832
Maybe the victim isn't the target.

700
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,601
Case in point, young Sara.

701
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:24,201
What if she's the target
instead of her father?

702
00:52:24,312 --> 00:52:25,711
She brings the killer to the family.

703
00:52:25,814 --> 00:52:26,803
She feels responsible.

704
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:28,348
She was forced to kill her own father

705
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,008
in front of her mother and brother.

706
00:52:30,118 --> 00:52:32,109
I'm simply suggesting
that we examine this from--

707
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,154
and by the way, when I say "we,"

708
00:52:34,256 --> 00:52:35,780
I'm of course referring to those of us

709
00:52:35,891 --> 00:52:37,688
involved in official police business.

710
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:38,816
It is my business.

711
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:41,691
He keeps making it my business.

712
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:46,256
He just dropped these off
while I was in the library.

713
00:52:46,368 --> 00:52:48,131
We just tracked the same thing
a few hours ago,

714
00:52:48,236 --> 00:52:49,635
the same book, in fact.

715
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:51,706
Yeah, but the real clue
is more where they came from,

716
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:52,704
not what's in them.

717
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:54,604
Fi, this is dangerous.

718
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,472
What are you doing
holding on to this stuff?

719
00:52:56,578 --> 00:53:00,036
If he wanted to hurt me,
he would have already.

720
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:02,116
Can't you see that he wants me
personally involved?

721
00:53:02,217 --> 00:53:03,548
He wants me to find out about him,

722
00:53:03,652 --> 00:53:04,846
probably to publicize his story.

723
00:53:04,953 --> 00:53:05,942
Okay, hold it a second.

724
00:53:06,054 --> 00:53:07,419
If he wants a story on the front page,

725
00:53:07,522 --> 00:53:09,456
he's got a dozen or so
working writers here in town.

726
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:11,422
Hell, the Times is less
than a hundred miles away.

727
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:12,618
No offense, but why you?

728
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:15,753
Look, whatever the reason is,
he chose me.

729
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:18,829
What have you got?

730
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:23,702
These books are from Milburn
Juvenile Detention Center.

731
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,170
These barcodes here prove that.

732
00:53:25,273 --> 00:53:26,501
They're actually Codabar,

733
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:29,406
an old system that they used
back in the '70s.

734
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:31,706
Milburn closed down
more than eight years ago.

735
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:35,249
These books came from there,
so he came from there.

736
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:37,876
Okay, good work.

737
00:53:37,986 --> 00:53:39,783
We'll check it out.

738
00:53:39,888 --> 00:53:41,150
But for now, everybody goes home,

739
00:53:41,256 --> 00:53:42,917
gets some sleep.

740
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:45,015
Everybody.

741
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:06,278
You look so very at home sitting there.

742
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:07,473
I am at home, Dad.

743
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:09,049
But you know I can't stay here forever.

744
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,879
Classes and a life, you know.

745
00:54:10,986 --> 00:54:12,476
Yes, I know.

746
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:13,849
I made some eggs and bacon for you

747
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:14,887
over there on the counter.

748
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,457
Thank you. I saw that.

749
00:54:16,558 --> 00:54:18,583
I'm just saying it's nice
to see you here; that's all.

750
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:19,955
And I'm sure you feel safer here.

751
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:21,153
Yes, I feel safe.

752
00:54:23,465 --> 00:54:24,591
More coffee?

753
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:25,893
Mm-hmm.

754
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,034
Whoa.

755
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:35,707
- Check this out.
- Well, I would.

756
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,471
You have to make the screen
a little larger.

757
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:38,841
I'm 107.

758
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:41,142
All right, let me zoom in.

759
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:42,341
Holy shit.

760
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,042
Choice therapy?

761
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:48,054
- Milburn.
- Milburn.

762
00:54:48,156 --> 00:54:50,317
You just kicked the police's ass
with your laptop.

763
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:51,414
Is that how it works?

764
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,653
Guess where I get it from.

765
00:54:53,762 --> 00:54:56,253
Well, everyone knows that.

766
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,427
Come on. Let's go.

767
00:55:02,537 --> 00:55:03,504
I'm gonna be late.

768
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:04,902
Wait a minute. What?

769
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:06,735
I emailed Benson.
He's digging up an address.

770
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:07,933
He's gonna call us on the cell.

771
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:10,739
You said "we." There can be no "we."

772
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:12,710
Well, you can leave me here

773
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:14,907
and keep guessing what I'm up to,

774
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,951
or you can take me with you
and know for yourself.

775
00:55:18,053 --> 00:55:19,042
Yeah, fine. Go ahead.

776
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:21,054
Get in the shower.

777
00:56:13,374 --> 00:56:14,932
Just for now, okay?

778
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:16,067
Stay in the car.

779
00:56:17,946 --> 00:56:19,208
Seriously?

780
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:24,117
Hi-dee-ho.

781
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:26,346
Come on out.

782
00:56:26,454 --> 00:56:27,512
Scared me.

783
00:56:27,622 --> 00:56:28,987
Oh, sorry.

784
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,148
That's okay.

785
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:31,850
Dr. Ronald Pendleton.

786
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,621
You already knew that.

787
00:56:33,728 --> 00:56:35,252
Nice to meet you, sir.

788
00:56:35,363 --> 00:56:36,955
You too.

789
00:56:37,065 --> 00:56:40,933
This-a-way we go.

790
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:43,026
- Just try not to--
- Okay.

791
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:47,434
Of course, this is in regards
to your work at Milburn.

792
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:48,668
We've drawn a connection

793
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:52,712
and hoping that someone
might come to mind,

794
00:56:52,814 --> 00:56:54,577
which is why we've come here,

795
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:57,651
hoping you could narrow the field.

796
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:04,725
Could be any one of these candidates.

797
00:57:04,826 --> 00:57:09,854
So the rumors, the abuse, was true.

798
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:14,765
The facts say yes, but the state?

799
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,598
No, ma'am.

800
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:19,537
Right, sir, but if you
could answer the question--

801
00:57:19,641 --> 00:57:25,170
Oh, I propose that even if
you left here today with a name,

802
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,645
you're no better off.

803
00:57:26,748 --> 00:57:28,978
And I propose you underestimate me.

804
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,520
I'm water. You're the horse.

805
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:35,850
He brought you to me.

806
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:39,358
The books? Milburn?

807
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,654
He knows you're here.

808
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:43,731
He wants you to be here.

809
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:47,323
Under his terms, not yours.

810
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:49,027
And it's safe to say your choice therapy

811
00:57:49,137 --> 00:57:51,230
wasn't exactly a cure-all
for one particular boy.

812
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:55,366
Hey, I never said it was therapy.

813
00:57:55,476 --> 00:58:00,277
And I never, ever said that
it was any kind of a cure-all.

814
00:58:00,381 --> 00:58:02,474
It was more like a barometer

815
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:06,486
about how the choices
that we make define us.

816
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:12,183
What better way to understand
how the mind works

817
00:58:12,293 --> 00:58:17,993
than by analyzing
the most difficult choices

818
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:22,035
we have to make?

819
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,127
He chose you.

820
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,469
That's interesting.

821
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:27,871
So far that I can see,

822
00:58:27,976 --> 00:58:32,003
you're holding up
your part of the bargain.

823
00:58:32,113 --> 00:58:33,512
That's also interesting.

824
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:36,516
Most people would have cut tail
and run by now.

825
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:39,314
But not you.

826
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,857
And he knows that.

827
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:47,416
And I'll tell you something, detective.

828
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:50,793
He's gonna catch you,

829
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:55,358
and he's gonna catch you
way before you ever catch him.

830
00:59:07,248 --> 00:59:09,443
You believe this guy?

831
00:59:16,257 --> 00:59:19,226
There you are.

832
00:59:19,327 --> 00:59:26,392
All you have to do is very
carefully look at the tapes.

833
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:28,128
And you know what?

834
00:59:28,236 --> 00:59:33,970
He's gonna jump off that tape
and tell you exactly who he is.

835
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:39,570
And there is no way
that you will ever stop him.

836
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:42,673
Thank you, sir.

837
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:47,584
Take care.

838
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:49,054
Be careful.

839
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:55,325
And you, sir?

840
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:58,365
Be warned.

841
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,704
The choice is now

842
01:00:04,806 --> 01:00:07,468
snap her neck and leave immediately,

843
01:00:07,575 --> 01:00:12,808
or stay here for another ten years.

844
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:15,314
What's your answer now?

845
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,849
I'd kill you before I'd kill this dog,

846
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:20,682
you sick old fuck.

847
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:22,688
I'm gonna reach over
and break your neck.

848
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,281
Do I get the money then
or just another ten years?

849
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:26,587
- That'll be all.
- Fuck you.

850
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:28,855
See, this kid I like.

851
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:30,896
That's done.

852
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:33,933
Here's the last one.

853
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:36,961
Yeah, I like her.

854
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:39,437
Let me ask you a question.

855
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:45,274
If I were to offer you $1,000
to snap her neck, would you?

856
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,473
No.

857
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:49,607
Are you sure?

858
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:52,242
I wouldn't hurt Molly. Would I, girl?

859
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:56,255
Just 'cause I'm in here doesn't
make me what you think I am.

860
01:00:56,357 --> 01:01:00,555
Let's make it $10,000.

861
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:02,026
You're playing a game.

862
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,188
I get it.

863
01:01:03,297 --> 01:01:05,788
A simple choice. Yes or no?

864
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:10,804
No, I wouldn't.

865
01:01:10,905 --> 01:01:12,600
What if I informed you

866
01:01:12,707 --> 01:01:15,608
that she was scheduled
to be put down anyway

867
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,735
later this afternoon at the pound?

868
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:19,836
Nothing you can do to stop it.

869
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:22,973
Then would you take the $10,000?

870
01:01:23,084 --> 01:01:24,813
No, I'm not a monster.

871
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:27,353
$100,000?

872
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:29,685
I said no. Now leave me alone.

873
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:33,090
The choice is now.

874
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:37,096
Snap her neck and leave immediately,

875
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:41,931
or stay here for another ten years.

876
01:01:42,036 --> 01:01:44,800
Please choose.

877
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:52,072
What have you done?

878
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,909
My God! Jesus, stop the tape!

879
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:55,107
So I guess I'm free to go.

880
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:58,947
Stop the tape!

881
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:00,714
Holy shit. What's that kid's name?

882
01:02:00,822 --> 01:02:03,689
Yeah, what is that kid's name?

883
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:07,249
Uh, Nathan Jones.

884
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:09,488
Nathan Jones?

885
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,834
All right, adopted when he was
two months old.

886
01:02:14,936 --> 01:02:17,496
The adopted parents returned
the kid to child services

887
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:18,799
when he was three years old.

888
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:21,466
Mentally unstable. Destructive.

889
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:23,168
How destructive can you be at three?

890
01:02:23,277 --> 01:02:25,768
I guess destructive enough
for the state to take him back.

891
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,814
It's pretty goddamn destructive
for that to happen,

892
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:28,973
don't you think, boss?

893
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,573
Yeah, I never heard of that happening.

894
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:32,915
Does it say anything else about
what happens to the kid next?

895
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,453
Yeah, let me see.

896
01:02:34,555 --> 01:02:35,988
After several years in an orphanage,

897
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,819
he was finally placed in foster care.

898
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:39,187
And get this.

899
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:42,057
His foster dad was
Simon Campbell, the musician.

900
01:02:42,163 --> 01:02:44,825
It says here that there are
allegations of sexual abuse.

901
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,901
It was five months before he was
moved out of Campbell's care.

902
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:49,560
Oh, Jesus.

903
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,967
And then he was placed in the home

904
01:02:51,072 --> 01:02:53,438
of Martin and Melinda Marlow.

905
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,600
He lived with the Marlows
for only two years

906
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:59,043
before their daughter Jenna
accused him of rape.

907
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:00,636
Charges were never proven.

908
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:03,615
And Nathan was removed from their home.

909
01:03:03,718 --> 01:03:05,242
Shit.

910
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:06,342
Then he entered Milburn.

911
01:03:06,454 --> 01:03:09,150
That's when the real shit started.

912
01:03:09,257 --> 01:03:10,918
Hey, boss. We got an address.

913
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:13,994
Let's go right now.

914
01:03:14,095 --> 01:03:15,619
No, no, no, not you.
Where are you going?

915
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,129
You stay here, okay?

916
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:18,926
You've done good work,
so keep following it.

917
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:20,398
Alice can help you.

918
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:21,798
Alice, you'll make sure she stays?

919
01:03:21,903 --> 01:03:23,666
For my peace of mind.

920
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:24,829
Okay.

921
01:03:24,939 --> 01:03:27,601
Just stay.

922
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,421
Oh, my God. What took you so long?

923
01:03:48,529 --> 01:03:50,156
Ever since the power
went out last night,

924
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:51,959
it stinks to high heaven in there.

925
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:53,829
It's absolutely disgusting, right?

926
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:55,402
It's disgusting in there.

927
01:03:55,503 --> 01:03:56,868
- Please.
- We got it.

928
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:59,797
- Did you call the power company?
- Stay back.

929
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:02,636
- Everybody's disgusted with the smell.
- Stay back.

930
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:17,181
Okay, boys, break it down.

931
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:18,417
Ready?

932
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,488
Police, open up!

933
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:26,567
Hey, police!

934
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,852
All right.

935
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:50,720
Uniforms, I want you to file through.

936
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:52,554
- Watch your step.
- Yes, sir.

937
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:55,620
It smells like shit in here.

938
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:58,358
Quiet, quiet, shh.

939
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,335
Jesus, I can't take the stench.

940
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:12,774
Ugh.

941
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,074
Oh, fuck me.

942
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:17,116
I don't even want to know
what that shit is.

943
01:05:17,218 --> 01:05:18,845
Fuck me.

944
01:05:26,293 --> 01:05:29,285
Ken, check the back.

945
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,737
Holy Christ.

946
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,240
Get forensics here right away.

947
01:05:42,343 --> 01:05:44,436
Jesus.

948
01:05:44,545 --> 01:05:45,534
Find Wagner.

949
01:05:45,646 --> 01:05:46,635
Get him down here.

950
01:05:46,747 --> 01:05:49,648
He's got to see this.

951
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:00,925
Chief?

952
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:02,052
Yeah.

953
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:04,757
You better come take a look at this.

954
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:06,196
Worse than in here?

955
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,768
A little bit.

956
01:06:11,272 --> 01:06:13,172
You all right?

957
01:06:13,274 --> 01:06:14,263
No.

958
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:23,741
ISO_17.

959
01:07:23,844 --> 01:07:26,005
Isolation room 17?

960
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:43,096
This thing caused the fuse

961
01:07:43,197 --> 01:07:45,131
to blow the mains
on the entire building.

962
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:46,494
Mm-hmm.

963
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,261
Which in turn shut off
these air fresheners

964
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:49,768
designed to mask the stench.

965
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,929
We found his dog locked up
in his bathroom over there.

966
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:54,007
Dog by the name of Molly?

967
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:55,268
Yeah.

968
01:07:55,376 --> 01:07:59,335
I can't even describe that next part.

969
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:01,073
Jesus, who the fuck is that?

970
01:08:01,182 --> 01:08:03,946
That is who we believe
is Dr. Ronald Pendleton.

971
01:08:04,051 --> 01:08:05,518
We found his ID under the tub.

972
01:08:05,619 --> 01:08:07,450
Forensics is running a check on it.

973
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:09,352
I think you're gonna find
the next revelation

974
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,753
a little more disturbing.

975
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:11,756
Yeah? Why's that?

976
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:13,918
I'll show you.

977
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:20,933
From the looks of it, you were next.

978
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:41,751
Jesus.

979
01:08:50,998 --> 01:08:52,522
Hey, you've reached Fiona.

980
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:53,895
Please leave a message.

981
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:55,025
Fiona, Dad.

982
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,330
Listen, I have some news.

983
01:08:57,438 --> 01:08:58,666
I need to talk to you.

984
01:08:58,772 --> 01:09:00,603
You got to call me back
as soon as you get this.

985
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:03,074
All right, bye.

986
01:09:03,177 --> 01:09:04,303
Yeah, I still can't reach her.

987
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:08,541
So, boss, listen.

988
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:09,547
What if this guy--

989
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:11,840
Hey, boss.

990
01:10:49,383 --> 01:10:51,214
Hello?

991
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:54,310
Anybody here?

992
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:23,608
Hello?

993
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:22,375
Oh.

994
01:13:00,914 --> 01:13:02,882
Open the door!

995
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:04,007
Hello, Fiona.

996
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,915
Let me out of here!

997
01:13:06,019 --> 01:13:09,921
Welcome to a special place
for bad little children.

998
01:13:10,023 --> 01:13:14,392
Don't be overly concerned
with Milburn's date rape drug.

999
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,019
Open this door!

1000
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:19,588
It's a harmless little gas
that will knock you right out.

1001
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,100
See you when you wake up.

1002
01:14:23,764 --> 01:14:25,823
Look who's awake.

1003
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:38,340
Your father made our mother choose.

1004
01:14:38,445 --> 01:14:41,346
Your father, our mother.

1005
01:14:41,448 --> 01:14:42,915
Do you get it?

1006
01:14:43,016 --> 01:14:44,813
I don't understand.

1007
01:14:44,918 --> 01:14:48,684
When your father Tom
was away at the academy,

1008
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:50,757
she met my dad.

1009
01:14:50,857 --> 01:14:52,984
I was conceived right here in this room.

1010
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:59,494
Tom said he wouldn't raise
another man's child.

1011
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,730
He made her choose.

1012
01:15:03,837 --> 01:15:08,672
You weren't even born yet,
and she chose you over me.

1013
01:15:08,775 --> 01:15:11,175
She told me it was the hardest choice

1014
01:15:11,278 --> 01:15:14,213
she ever had to make.

1015
01:15:14,314 --> 01:15:16,874
But I gave her one that was even harder,

1016
01:15:16,984 --> 01:15:20,385
and she made the ultimate sacrifice

1017
01:15:20,487 --> 01:15:22,682
for you, Fiona.

1018
01:15:22,789 --> 01:15:26,020
She chose to die so you could live.

1019
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:27,923
You killed her.

1020
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:29,962
You killed her and made it
look like a suicide.

1021
01:15:30,063 --> 01:15:30,961
No.

1022
01:15:31,064 --> 01:15:32,691
I gave her a choice.

1023
01:15:32,799 --> 01:15:34,562
She killed herself.

1024
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:38,297
It can't be.

1025
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:40,464
You should feel special, Fiona.

1026
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:42,667
No one ever did that for me.

1027
01:15:42,776 --> 01:15:46,837
Why are you doing this to me, Nathan?

1028
01:15:46,947 --> 01:15:48,676
Look, I understand why you're angry.

1029
01:15:48,782 --> 01:15:49,840
You have every right to be.

1030
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,542
But why am I here?

1031
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:06,560
You think I'm ugly, don't you?

1032
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:09,227
I'm not as pretty as you.

1033
01:16:09,336 --> 01:16:12,931
It's no wonder she chose you.

1034
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,565
Three years ago,

1035
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:17,769
after our mother died,

1036
01:16:17,878 --> 01:16:22,906
I put a gun in my mouth,
and I pulled the trigger.

1037
01:16:23,016 --> 01:16:28,010
When I woke up, I looked like this.

1038
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:30,282
Pendleton was right.

1039
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,915
Our choices define us.

1040
01:16:42,235 --> 01:16:43,395
Dad.

1041
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:45,130
Didn't you ever wonder
why he was so quick

1042
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:47,331
to put her in the grave
and forget the whole thing?

1043
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:48,430
Dad, can you hear me?

1044
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:49,770
It must have been pretty painful

1045
01:16:49,876 --> 01:16:51,366
that this is where she had
to end her life.

1046
01:16:51,478 --> 01:16:52,502
Dad, Dad!

1047
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:53,909
I wanted you to know the truth.

1048
01:16:54,014 --> 01:16:56,175
I wanted you to hear it from him.

1049
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:57,773
Dad, can you hear me?

1050
01:16:57,884 --> 01:16:59,784
Go ahead and ask him.

1051
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:01,820
Ask him, Fiona.

1052
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:03,890
Go ahead, ask him!

1053
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:05,548
Ask him!

1054
01:17:05,659 --> 01:17:07,559
Ask him what he did!

1055
01:17:16,236 --> 01:17:17,828
Is it true?

1056
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:21,772
Was there a baby before I was born?

1057
01:17:24,044 --> 01:17:26,137
You know I love you more than anything.

1058
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:35,044
Nathan, stop!

1059
01:17:39,092 --> 01:17:40,457
Nathan, I'm begging you, please!

1060
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,656
Look at me, Nathan!

1061
01:17:44,765 --> 01:17:46,232
Nathan!

1062
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:50,934
Nathan, please!

1063
01:17:51,037 --> 01:17:51,969
Nathan, stop!

1064
01:17:56,543 --> 01:17:58,977
Nathan, please!

1065
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:07,010
No, no, no, no!

1066
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,886
No, no, no, Dad.

1067
01:18:10,991 --> 01:18:12,083
Come on, it's okay.

1068
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:13,557
Breathe.

1069
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,218
No, no.

1070
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:17,592
No, no, no.

1071
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:20,860
No, no.

1072
01:18:24,905 --> 01:18:26,998
No, come on, no!

1073
01:18:27,107 --> 01:18:30,133
No!

1074
01:18:54,301 --> 01:18:57,498
thud!

1075
01:20:41,074 --> 01:20:44,305
Hey, lady, you okay?

1076
01:20:44,411 --> 01:20:47,073
You need some help?

1077
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:56,017
I forgot to tell you

1078
01:20:56,122 --> 01:20:59,023
how much you remind me of your mother.
