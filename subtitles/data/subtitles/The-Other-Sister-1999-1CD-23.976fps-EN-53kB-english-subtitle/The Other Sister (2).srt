1
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,854
Bye, Carla.

2
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,356
Thomas Porter, get off of that.

3
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,693
Ah, good morning. Jason,
thank you for calling the auto club.

4
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,112
Good morning, Dr Tate.
How are you?

5
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,156
- Dr Johnson.
- Carla's ready to go.

6
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,618
She's just saying goodbye
to all her friends. Very popular girl.

7
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,329
Very popular. Louise?

8
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,873
Carla? Carla, your father's here.

9
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,171
Pumpkin!

10
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,471
Ohh, Carla, come on.

11
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,056
You know, we talked about this.
Now, you're ready to go home.

12
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,517
Right? You're ready to go home now.

13
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,731
She'll be fine. She'll be okay.
You're ready. You can do it.

14
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,569
We're all so glad
you're comin'home, pumpkin.

15
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,864
Heather flew in from New York,
and Caroline came from school.

16
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,617
And Mom...
Boy, she's just so excited.

17
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:43,913
She just keeps saying,
"You get my Carla back here fast. "

18
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,252
Try these. I'm sorry the headset hurt
your ears, but they don't come in sizes.

19
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,755
- How much longer before we land?
- We're ahead of schedule.

20
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,840
We should be landing
in about 15 minutes.

21
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,342
- Thank you.
- Teeth okay?

22
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,016
Yes, they're okay.

23
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,940
Honey, I'd like the girls to come with me
to the Palace of Fine Arts this weekend...

24
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,525
because there's
this special exhibition...

25
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,944
Uh-uh, Carla. Oh, Carla, dear.

26
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,281
Can you please try to eat it with your
fork, and that would be very... Carla.

27
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,117
With your fork. No, no, dear.

28
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,786
I said with the fork,
not with the knife, dear.

29
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:26,789
All right. No, no.
No more cake. No. No.

30
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,708
- Excuse me.
- Carla?

31
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,087
No, no, what is the matter?
Oh, my gosh. Oh, Car...

32
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:37,800
- Carla, you're... Radley. Radley.
- No! No! It's my cake!

33
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:41,470
Please, come on. You're supposed
to handle... Please, Radley. Radley.

34
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,557
- Leave me alone!
- Carla. Carla.

35
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,018
- What the hell do they know?
- They are experts, and she has all the symptoms.

36
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,312
- She has an I. Q bordering on 2nd grade.
- I know about...

37
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,315
- I know a few things about experts.
- She has... She has significant social adjustment problems.

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,317
- And now her school... - I'm sorry.
Where's my drink? - What's the matter? What?

39
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,402
Oh, your drink.
It's right there.

40
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,779
And now this school, her regular
school won't even take her back.

41
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,614
- What about that, Radley?
- Ah, I need another drink.

42
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,950
Forget the drink, Radley!

43
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,537
Now listen to me. We need
to talk about Carla. Do you understand?

44
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,372
- She is beautiful! - We have
got to! - Have you looked at her?

45
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,500
- She is gorgeous.
- She nearly burned the house down with the other two girls in it.

46
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,335
- Radley, we can't do this.
- That... That was an accident.

47
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,046
- You know that was an accident.
- It was not. We can't keep saying things like that.

48
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,757
We can't keep saying, "Carla is
a slow learner. Carla will blossom. "

49
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,011
Because those are lies.
Now, Radley, we have to do something.

50
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,681
We have to make a decision. This is
a special school in Santa Barbara.

51
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,684
- All right, back up just... The school...
- It is for the mentally challenged.

52
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:32,521
- Right there. - Yes, what? - Now, they don't allow
adults and the parents to go visit them. They...

53
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:35,649
They have limited... limited visitation,
and let me tell you something, Radley.

54
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,651
- If it doesn't work out, she doesn't have to be there.
- I don't...

55
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,279
- I don't want her to be retarded.
- Of course you don't.

56
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,281
Of course you don't.
I understand completely.

57
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:45,117
We have to send her there, Radley.
We don't have a choice. All right?

58
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:49,538
- Sign it.
- How are you two doing here? Can I get you anything?

59
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:51,665
Can I get you anything?

60
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,711
Uh, no, I've got water,
and, uh... Ah.

61
00:04:55,836 --> 00:05:00,632
We ordered
a vegetarian worm. No?

62
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:04,720
- I'll see if I can find one in coach.
- I would appreciate that.

63
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:11,351
I'd like to be the first to welcome you
to San Francisco International Airport.

64
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,187
It's currently 54 degrees
in the Bay Area...

65
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:16,815
and a beautiful, clear day.

66
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,401
Thank you for choosing
to fly with us.

67
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:32,539
She's here! She's home. Mrs Tate!

68
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,668
Come on.

69
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,921
All right. Okay.
Heather! Hang up!

70
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:42,424
She's home!

71
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:44,009
That call was important...

72
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:47,554
and you yelling in the background
is not exactly good for business.

73
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,682
- I'm sorry.
- Here we are.

74
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:56,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
the homecoming queen, Carla Tate.

75
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:04,237
We're all waiting for you.
Come on, honey.

76
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:06,739
Bring Tickles. Come on.

77
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,835
Oh. Ohh, hello, Carla.

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,797
- Welcome home. G... Hello. Hello.
- Here. I'll take this.

79
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,216
Uh, would you like
some help with that, sir?

80
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,635
- Hi, Carla! Welcome home.
- Oh, Carla, it's so good to have you home.

81
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,638
- Thanks. Say hello to Carla.
- We missed you, Carla.

82
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:34,934
- Who's that?
- Uh... Oh, well, um...

83
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,688
This is Jeff Reed.

84
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:42,275
And, actually, Carla, I have
kind of a surprise for you because...

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,153
we're engaged to be married.

86
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:47,321
Ooh, yea!

87
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:49,365
Well, let me take your coat,
dear. All right?

88
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,243
- No!
- Oh. You sure? You don't want...

89
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:54,453
All right, fine. Just...

90
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:57,832
Dr Johnson said
that it would be nice...

91
00:06:57,957 --> 00:07:00,751
if I got everybody presents.

92
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:03,337
- Oh!
- And I thought so too.

93
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:05,673
Well, thank you, Carla.

94
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:08,217
- It's, uh... It's necklaces.
- Oh!

95
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:10,511
- And they're beautiful.
- Carla!

96
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:13,639
- Say cheese!
- Winnie!

97
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:17,017
- Welcome home! - I missed
you! - It's so good to see you!

98
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:18,435
Sweetheart!

99
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,148
We were thinking that maybe
we would just like to elope, you know?

100
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:26,777
- That's very funny, but not hysterical. All right?
- Okay!

101
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:29,697
We're gonna have
a big wedding ceremony at the church.

102
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:31,532
- And the wedding...
- I know. We're gonna have the wedding reception at the club.

103
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:34,702
- You remember the club, don't you, Carla dear?
- Yeah!

104
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:38,706
You know what. You could just put this in your
lap. That's good. That's very nice that way.

105
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:43,043
You look very grown up. So I hear you
and Jeff settled on a honeymoon spot.

106
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,546
Did you two do it yet?

107
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:48,674
- No. Caroline.
- She's gonna spit it out. I can see it.

108
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:52,386
Sex is something that we talk
about in private, I think. Am I right?

109
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,973
No, but my teacher
at the school says...

110
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,185
that two people do it
when they're in love.

111
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,523
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm sure she meant that you
do it after, you know, you're married or something.

112
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:05,899
Definitely.

113
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:10,112
And then you don't talk about it
ever again in your whole life.

114
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,739
- Winnie.
- A special dessert for Carla.

115
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:14,741
- Oh, boy.
- Please.

116
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,995
- That's nice.
- So a doctorate, Jeff? That is so refreshing.

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,205
So what is your doctorate
dissertation gonna be on?

118
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,916
Um, multi-tiered financing
of petrol chemical surveys...

119
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,877
in an uncertain
political terrain.

120
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:29,297
Translation: Finding the big bucks in tiny
little countries whose names you can't pronounce.

121
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:30,298
Wow!

122
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:34,594
I mean, it's so good to hear someone's
actually using their college education.

123
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,973
Come on. You know, I'm not teaching second
grade because I happen to like children.

124
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:41,101
You know, I think that
they're the hope of the world.

125
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:44,396
Of course they're the hope of the world,
but, really, isn't it just as noble...

126
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:47,107
to be a college professor
and earn four times the money?

127
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,943
- Mother!
- You know what. Daddy, will you make a toast right now?

128
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:52,445
I'd gladly make a toast, yeah.
To the Tate family and its good...

129
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,282
- I want to go to school also.
- That's great.

130
00:08:56,408 --> 00:09:00,954
Well, dear, you just completed school. And, in fact, I
think they gave you a certificate of completion, didn't they?

131
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,833
I am gonna be
a veterinarian's assistant.

132
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,295
- Wow!
- And, but to do that, I need a high school diploma.

133
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,841
I think the best thing for right now would
be just to have a nice, big, long vacation...

134
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,343
and we'll explore
your options later.

135
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:20,807
- Okay. To the Ta...
- I would like to explore my options now, Mother.

136
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:26,104
Carla, we're all just a little bit too
tired for such an important conversation.

137
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:28,314
So, Radley...

138
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:33,152
To the Tate family,
all of us together again.

139
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,822
Follow me. Hurry.

140
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:38,950
- Just follow me.
- Stop it.

141
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:41,452
Stop following me.

142
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:43,996
I can't, stupid.

143
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:49,085
- Stop it!
- I told you, I can't, stupid.

144
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,588
Stop laughing at me!

145
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:04,433
Oh, my goodness!
Are you all right?

146
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:10,356
- Carla!
- Yeah.

147
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:15,027
All right. Now, I want you
to close your eyes. Close your eyes.

148
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:18,197
Okay, Carla.
All right.

149
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:21,367
- No, stop, stop. Stop.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:21,492 --> 00:10:26,956
You can stop. Good girl.
Open your eyes. Surprise. Do you...

151
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:31,460
What do you think?
You think... Do you like it?

152
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:35,047
- You gave my room to somebody else?
- No!

153
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:40,135
I redecorated it for you, dear.
I just changed it a little.

154
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:44,390
- But where is my tea party table that was right here?
- Who did this?

155
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,394
Well, Carla, those are little-girl
things, and you're a young woman now.

156
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,730
Remember, downstairs you were talking
about taking on more responsibility.

157
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,691
- Well, this is...
- I want my things.

158
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:58,737
Carla, I really think that you should
live with these things for a while...

159
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:02,032
and you'll see, I'm sure that
you will grow to like them very much.

160
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:05,911
And, anyway, Dr Johnson said that, uh,
that these are your favourite colours.

161
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:09,748
Uh, you like red,
don't you? Where...

162
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:12,251
Carla, wh...
Why are your eyes closed?

163
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:15,837
I'm remembering my old room.

164
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:18,340
Ohh! Heather?

165
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,093
Heather!

166
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:27,891
Bye.

167
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:31,269
I'm really sorry we didn't
visit you more frequently...

168
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:35,273
but I got a job in New York,
and Caroline went to college.

169
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:38,610
- So...
- Yeah, but that's okay 'cause sometimes...

170
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:44,115
we thought that the visits
sometimes upset the parents...

171
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:47,452
more than it made
the kids happy.

172
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:49,412
Well, we're sorry, Carla.

173
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:52,958
But I liked all your letters
that you wrote, Heather.

174
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,044
They were better
than Caroline's...

175
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:59,130
'cause she mostly drew pictures.

176
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,221
- What?
- Honey, I think you just...

177
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,972
She's overwhelmed by all of this.

178
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:11,893
Now, why don't you just relax?
You did great, okay?

179
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:14,395
Just don't be
so hard on yourself.

180
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:18,566
Radley, I'm gonna
make it up to that girl.

181
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:21,069
I really am.

182
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:24,989
Winnie!

183
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:28,493
Your mother said
another 15 minutes.

184
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:32,163
Did you tell her that
I don't like tennis still?

185
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:35,958
She said that all
well-bred girls play tennis...

186
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:38,836
chess or bridge.

187
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:41,589
Oh.

188
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:44,675
Is it 15 minutes yet?

189
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,969
- We'll look at that. We'll look at that right...
- Hello, Mrs Tate.

190
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:50,389
- How are you? - Oh, Victoria,
you look so lovely. - Thank you.

191
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:52,391
I'd like you to meet my daughter.
This is Carla.

192
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:53,726
- Hello, Carla.
- Hello.

193
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,311
Didn't your other daughter,
Heather, get married?

194
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:58,773
- No, no. Actually, it's, uh, Caroline is engaged.
- Oh!

195
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:02,068
But anyway, I want to see
a couple of sweater sets.

196
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,446
- And, Carla, come on.
- That's a very nice shirt, Mom.

197
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:07,990
Very beautiful feet.
Nice toes.

198
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,326
And the sock really
accentuates your feet.

199
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,328
You know that the,
uh, the Chinese say...

200
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:15,706
that the toes are
the windows to the soul?

201
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:19,210
- They do?
- I've been to Hong Kong several times, and I've never heard that.

202
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:22,380
Why don't you just, uh, enlighten us
with your knowledge of shoes?

203
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:25,466
- Do you have this in a size eight?
- She's a little uptight, isn't she?

204
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:27,968
- What?
- It's tight. This shoe's a little tight.

205
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:31,222
It'll... Here.
How 'bout these? These red ones here.

206
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:35,017
- Yes, this is a fun shoe, Mom.
- I don't think so. Thank you very much.

207
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:37,394
What about these with the heels?
Remember the leather?

208
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,233
- This is hip. Hip.
- Those are not what we want. Thank you so much.

209
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,318
Mothers are always right.

210
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:47,821
And today the dogs
are here to be seen...

211
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,909
in the hopes that they'll be adopted
by the nice people of Sutter Hills.

212
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,869
- And I'm a friend of your mother's.
- And so, thank you from me...

213
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:58,040
You know that your mother was the one who
made this animal rescue shelter a possibility.

214
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:01,126
- No. I didn't...
- Yes, and she did a lot of other things in Sutter Hills.

215
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:04,254
- You're too kind.
- The youth orchestra, the theatre, the library.

216
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,717
- Wow.
- And today your mother's gonna get some recognition, which she deserves.

217
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:13,555
My job to introduce the head
of our Sutter Hills City Council...

218
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,850
- Drew Edison. - Excuse
me. - Oh, sure. Of course.

219
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:19,269
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

220
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:22,606
There are so many people
to thank for this wonderful shelter.

221
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:25,275
- Hello, puppy. - And they
used every... - Carla, please.

222
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,444
- Fund-raising device known to man...
- Hello, puppy.

223
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,572
From a, a bake sale in my mother...
Pucky Ryan's... garden.

224
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:34,618
Carla, please don't do that.
Please. You're disrupting.

225
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,454
- ... country club.
- Woof!

226
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,247
- Woof! Woof!
- Carla.

227
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:43,126
Elizabeth. Elizabeth,
your daughter is barking.

228
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:46,421
- Carla!
- Woof!

229
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:48,798
- Elizabeth, now they're all barking.
- I know.

230
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:53,094
- Carla, dear. Carla. Carla!
- Oh, I'll quiet them, Mom. They like me.

231
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,266
- Carla, Carla!
- Hello, puppies. I'll teach you how to behave, little puppies.

232
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,901
Stay! No, go, go, go.

233
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:10,779
- No!
- Come back in the cage. Come on.

234
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:13,406
Behave! Mom!

235
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:18,870
It was so embarrassing, Radley.

236
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,831
I feel like... I feel like I try
all these things, and nothing works.

237
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:25,585
I've been doing my best to have fun with
her, but I don't know what fun for her is.

238
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,962
And she won't even tell me.

239
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:31,007
Honestly, I just want to quit.

240
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:10,630
Mrs Tate! Mrs Tate!
Carla's run away!

241
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,218
When the police picked her up,
she gave them another name...

242
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:21,807
and listed this as her home address,
so they threw her back here.

243
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:25,644
- Here's the police report.
- Did she really say that I'm smothering her?

244
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,438
In so many words. Yeah.
Do you want to read the police report?

245
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:30,691
I just want you to know that I don't
understand any of this, not for one second.

246
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,319
I give her love, I protect her, I teach
her, and suddenly that's smothering.

247
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:35,696
Those are her words,
not mine, Mrs Tate.

248
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:39,575
Did she tell you that I took her to the
pet shelter so she could possibly get a job?

249
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,369
Yes, and we agreed it ended badly.
Could you... Could you not?

250
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:46,415
- That's a hand-carved Indian relic.
- I'm sorry.

251
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,501
I also enrolled her in
a calligraphy class, an origami class.

252
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:52,755
- And I, I even got her into that...
- She doesn't want to do those things.

253
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,090
They... They don't interest her.
They don't work for her.

254
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,510
- Maybe Carla doesn't know what works for her.
- And you do.

255
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,763
I think so. I'm her mother.

256
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,432
That's why she tried to hitchhike
over 200 miles to get back here?

257
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,268
- Would she do that again?
- I believe she will, yes.

258
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:10,105
If things continue at home the way
they've been going, yes, absolutely yes.

259
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,774
And we were lucky this time.
She came back here.

260
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,444
A lot of kids run away,
we never hear from them again.

261
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,741
This is a girl who is determined
to push the edge of the envelope.

262
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:25,037
And I, for one,
I like the fact that she never quits.

263
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:30,417
Specifically, she wants to attend
this, uh, uh, Bay Area Polytech.

264
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,045
A public vocational school?
Is that what you're talking about?

265
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,465
They do welding there.
She can't possibly keep up with that.

266
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,093
- And she's going to be humiliated by those people there.
- You don't know they're going to humiliate her.

267
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,137
- Of course they're going to humiliate her!
- Please...

268
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,972
They... They did it
when she was young. L...

269
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,975
She's got to have the opportunity
to meet challenges.

270
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,312
I mean, do you want the... do you want the
kid to remain a child the rest of her life...

271
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,315
or do you want to let her grow into an adult
and take the same risks that you and I take?

272
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,152
I want her to take risks.
It's the kind of ri... Are you a parent?

273
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,280
Uh, no, not yet, no, no,
but I have worked with children...

274
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,073
including yours, for ten years.

275
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:05,994
Y... You think she should
go to school and be on her own?

276
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,496
Independence can
give Carla something...

277
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,416
that you and I will never
be able to give her.

278
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,835
- Dignity.
- What?

279
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,339
- Dignity.
- Dignity.

280
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,096
- To the left. - Thanks a lot.
- Okay, honey, here we are now.

281
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:30,351
- Uh, you sure you don't want me to walk you in?
- No, Dad, I'm not... I'm fine.

282
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,812
Come on, man. You got to remember
to lock your bike up, man.

283
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:36,190
Your mama's gettin' tired
of buyin' you bikes.

284
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,294
Citizenship test?

285
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:59,881
The courses are English,
History and Political Science.

286
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:07,805
Mmm. Hey, new girl.
You lookin' to score, huh?

287
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,850
Hey, send me some vibes, wolf eyes.

288
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,644
Yo, mama.
Welcome to the party.

289
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,397
Hey, don't run, baby doll.
Don't run.

290
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,900
Where are you goin'?

291
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,612
- Oh, yeah, baby. Oop! She's got the pepper spray!
- She definitely has the pepper spray!

292
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,405
- She's packing now.
- Go on through, wolf eyes.

293
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,824
Go on through.

294
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:30,202
- I have everything you need to get started, I do hope.
- Next.

295
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:34,415
- Hi, my name is Carla Tate.
- Nice to meet you.

296
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,418
- Uh, you're taking Computer 101.
- Yeah.

297
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:42,339
- That's okay, isn't it?
- The only requirement at Polytechnic is that you pay.

298
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,179
That's fine enough.
Here's your receipt. You're registered.

299
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,932
Thank you very much.

300
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:56,520
Next. Hello!
Let's keep the line moving, please.

301
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,901
- But he's next.
- So?

302
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,946
- He doesn't know it. Look at him.
- You're kidding me?

303
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,407
- He's asleep.
- That class is closed? It'll take an extra semester.

304
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:10,951
You're next in line.

305
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:15,122
Oh. Uh...

306
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,333
Ow! Watch what you're doing!
What is the matter with you?

307
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:21,086
- Uh, he's a retard.
- Oh, and that's supposed to be my problem?

308
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:25,048
- He nearly broke my toe.
- Hey, special boy, why don't you get back on the short bus?

309
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:28,468
Hey, don't talk like that.
Be nice.

310
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,058
Hi, little puppy!
Hello, puppy.

311
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:38,437
No, no, don't touch. He's not
for petting. He's for drug sniffing.

312
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:41,314
- He's on a break.
- Okay. Sorry.

313
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,278
Well, hello, ladies.
How are you doin'?

314
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,655
Oh, Mr Taylor, hi!

315
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,742
I just have to tell you this is the best
computer class I have ever taken.

316
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:57,164
- Well, looks like you're doing just fine.
- And it is such thanks to you.

317
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,125
Before I came to this class, I just
didn't even know the difference...

318
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:05,088
between, like, a ROM
or a RAM or a bit or a byte.

319
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,757
So, um, I don't know
if you're interested or not...

320
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:10,802
but, um, do you give
private lessons?

321
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:14,306
Uh, well, no, not really.

322
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:20,145
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- Okay.

323
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,689
- So how 'bout you, Carla?
- What?

324
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,525
How are you doing?

325
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,320
Well, I-I know the difference
between a bit and a byte.

326
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:32,323
Okay. Well, you keep up the good work.

327
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:35,118
- Thanks.
- I'll be back if you need me.

328
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:38,037
- He's kind of cute, huh?
- Uh, yeah.

329
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,833
And how are you doing
over here, Mr Garbis?

330
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:03,062
Hi.

331
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,486
Do you give private lessons?

332
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,826
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Oh.

333
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,745
I brought some of that
nice brewed tea you like.

334
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,666
Yeah. You just put it
right by the bed, Dad.

335
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:29,380
I'll do that. And I'll leave you
all alone so you can do your homework.

336
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:30,923
- Okay?
- Okay.

337
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,551
- Okay.
- Good night.

338
00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:36,053
Good night, pumpkin.

339
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,185
Come on, Danny. Here we go.
Hold on one second. Let me put it down.

340
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:52,736
- You're really strong, Rachel.
- Yeah, Danny, thanks.

341
00:22:57,491 --> 00:23:00,411
Watch it.

342
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:03,289
L- I'll see you later, Rachel!

343
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:06,083
- Hi!
- Hi.

344
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,585
Hi. My name's Daniel McMahon.

345
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:11,630
I know. I asked someone
what your name was.

346
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:14,133
My name is Carla Tate.

347
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,636
Hello, Carla Tate.

348
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:21,723
Thank you for helping me the other day
with re... with registration.

349
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,810
It was really confusing.

350
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:27,312
Yeah, I know.

351
00:23:27,437 --> 00:23:30,065
You're welcome. Okay, bye.

352
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,317
Yeah, thank...

353
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:35,654
Where are you going
right now, Carla Tate?

354
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:39,324
I have to go phone my father
to come pick me up...

355
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:43,954
because I got out
of school early today.

356
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,670
- Well, okay.
- Do you... You wanna... You wanna get a soda and something to eat first?

357
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:56,967
L... 'Cause I know
the greatest place, and I can drive.

358
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:02,013
Well!

359
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:05,308
Is this a date?

360
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,311
No, it's just getting sodas
and something to eat.

361
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:11,773
Good. 'Cause I don't
want to date yet.

362
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:15,318
Look at the buses.
Watch 'em.

363
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:18,196
Why? What are they gonna do?

364
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:21,700
They pull in, and then
they pull out, and they turn...

365
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:24,619
and they back up.

366
00:24:24,744 --> 00:24:27,706
I went... I went to a regular school.

367
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:31,334
I went for
a long, long, long time. Hi!

368
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:37,215
L- I finally quit
when I grew a moustache...

369
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,218
'cause I looked older
than the teachers.

370
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:44,806
Stop it. I don't like
when people laugh at me.

371
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:49,060
No, I wasn't laughing at you.
I was just making a joke.

372
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:53,690
- Oh.
- T-This is the Falcon Bar.

373
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:56,651
And this is where
all the bus people come.

374
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:03,241
- "Free tids and bits"?
- You can eat till you burst.

375
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:05,576
Sometimes I-I mess up
on my allowance...

376
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:08,413
and then... and then
I- I just come here.

377
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:11,416
Um, a-a-and I can eat all I want.

378
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:17,922
You see that girl over there?

379
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,844
Don't ever play pool with her
'cause she'll beat you.

380
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:25,346
They call her the Black Widow.

381
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:30,601
She has really long hair.

382
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:35,564
L- I-I like short hair.

383
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,448
It's easy. You just... You just
get on, and you give them a ticket.

384
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:46,867
But what if you take
the wrong bus?

385
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:50,287
Uh, th-the driver
just throws you off.

386
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:53,124
See, okay, I been on...
I been on most of these buses...

387
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:56,919
and I been... I been thrown
off most of them too.

388
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:01,674
You must like taking
bus rides, Daniel.

389
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,468
Uh, no. Well, no,
'cause I... 'cause I...

390
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:06,971
I- I gotta take
the buses to see, uh...

391
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:10,099
to see marching bands
at the college football games.

392
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:14,144
Th... um, this one takes me
to UCLA, Stanford...

393
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:16,647
and th-this one takes you...

394
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,899
- Hi, Francis.
- Danny.

395
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:22,277
This one takes me
to Western Pacific State.

396
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:25,697
Well, you must really like
marching bands then.

397
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:29,159
Yeah. Yeah,
I love marching bands.

398
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:32,079
L- I even got a job
working with one.

399
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:35,749
Here. You can sit here right there...

400
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:39,586
'cause this is where I usually sit
when I'm waiting for buses.

401
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,339
Okay.

402
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:46,677
And I-I usually sit there,
but it's usually empty.

403
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:52,974
If it... If it was empty,
I could... I could sit next to you.

404
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,856
Thank you, sir.

405
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:02,025
Bus 45, express service to Sacramento...

406
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,113
Wow. Daniel, you have a job?

407
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:08,532
- Yes.
- Wow!

408
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:11,535
How much does it pay?

409
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,538
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

410
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:20,877
Well, uh, I get... I get... I get
to keep... keep lots of marshmallows.

411
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:24,214
Your job pays you
in marshmallows?

412
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:26,508
Well, during... Okay.

413
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:28,968
Well, during the games, the students
throw marshmallows onto the field...

414
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:32,889
and they... and they try
to get them into the tubas.

415
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:35,558
You know, they think
it's fun and stuff.

416
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:40,313
And then... And then on Mondays, um, uh,
I get... I get to clean out the tubas.

417
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:44,734
I love marshmallows.
I like the way they taste.

418
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:47,320
What are you...
What are you writing down?

419
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:51,533
Oh, I'm just writing things down
about different jobs...

420
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:54,744
because someday
I'm gonna have a job, too...

421
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:57,830
and I need to be responsible...

422
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:00,750
so that my parents
get off my back.

423
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,002
4:30 bus to Las Vegas
is now departing.

424
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:06,881
I have to go back
because my father is coming.

425
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:10,426
He'll come and pick me up. Oh.

426
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:13,262
I shouldn't have
come with you, Daniel...

427
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:17,016
but you have
a really nice smile.

428
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:26,943
L... I-I-I also got a job
that pays money.

429
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:30,780
- Really?
- I bake cookies at Emil's Bakery.

430
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:34,075
I got a cookie maker's hat
and everything.

431
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,704
- It's very high.
- Commuter service to Sausalito, Marin City...

432
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:44,043
Alone?
You live all by yourself alone, Danny?

433
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:48,798
- Yeah, all by myself in my own apartment.
- I could never do that.

434
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:51,425
- Yes, you could.
- I could?

435
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,135
Yeah, sure. It's great.

436
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,263
You can come and go
whenever you want...

437
00:28:56,388 --> 00:29:00,142
and you can stay up as late
as you want, and you can watch TV.

438
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:03,479
- Really?
- You can walk around in the apartment...

439
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:05,981
in your underwear, if you want.

440
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:08,901
But could I have a pet too?

441
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:12,571
Oh, definitely. Definitely.

442
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:15,658
I have to call my father now.

443
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:19,161
I don't have to call my father.

444
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:26,460
They put gum in my hat again.

445
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:30,089
Happy birthday to you

446
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:34,301
Happy birthday to you

447
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:39,014
- Happy birthday, dear Carla
- So high...

448
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:43,519
Happy birthday to you

449
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:47,022
- Oh, that was so good. - And
many more - I have to make a wish.

450
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:49,524
Yes, all right. All right.
Make a...

451
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:54,613
- Happy 22nd, Carla.
- Yeah!

452
00:29:54,738 --> 00:29:57,866
Thank you for coming back
for my birthday.

453
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:59,993
Are you kidding?
We wouldn't miss this for the world.

454
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:03,538
Yeah, Winnie tells me that, uh, Carla
bought groceries for the family this week...

455
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:05,540
and she did some of the cooking too,
right, Winnie?

456
00:30:05,665 --> 00:30:09,461
And she helped me do all my laundry
that I brought from school.

457
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:13,381
- Yeah. And I recycled all the garbage, Mother.
- I know.

458
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:16,468
Well, I mean, someday you'll be able to take
care of this house without me. That's for sure.

459
00:30:16,593 --> 00:30:18,345
Not this house.

460
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,557
Maybe one day I'll be able
to take care of my own apartment...

461
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:26,061
like some of the kids at school do.

462
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:29,648
- Oh, Carla, you don't know what you're saying.
- Yes, I do.

463
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:33,068
No, we can't discuss this right now,
all right? Open these presents.

464
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:35,654
- Here. There.
- But...

465
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:38,573
Thank you, Radley.
Here you go, dear. There.

466
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:41,576
- "Carla. " It's from...
- Excuse me now.

467
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:45,497
- I have to go feed my fish.
- Oh.

468
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:48,333
- Mother, why did you do that?
- Aw, Mom. - What did I do?

469
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:51,169
I mean, maybe she's ready
for her own apartment.

470
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:53,588
You know, a lot
of the new books out right now...

471
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:59,510
you know, they... they advocate
disabled people living on their own.

472
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:02,597
- What are we movin' the presents for? - Why
don't we just take a vote? - Yeah, voting's nice.

473
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:05,099
- Oh, a family meeting.
- Yes! A family meeting.

474
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:08,019
We haven't had a family meeting in ages.
I would love to try it.

475
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:10,021
I think we should just forget this,
because I just want to say something.

476
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:12,607
This is not a political referendum.
This is a child's life.

477
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:16,361
And this is my child's life.
Carla's not ready for an apartment.

478
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:19,781
And really, she may never
be ready for an apartment. My God!

479
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:22,200
What if there were a fire?
What if there was a burglar?

480
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:25,286
- Well, that can happen to anyone, honey.
- "What if?" - No, but not with Carla.

481
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:28,122
She can't handle the unexpected,
Radley. You know that.

482
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:32,210
Mother, I think that she has tried very
hard to show that she's a responsible person.

483
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:33,794
- Heather!
- She's capable.

484
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,547
You don't live here any more,
so you don't vote!

485
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:38,633
Mom, why don't you think
of it this way, as a...

486
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:42,345
Oh, look, Caroline, you and Jeffrey can raise your children
any way you want to raise them, but this is my child!

487
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,139
- All right. All right. Ease up.
- You know something? I don't know what you're trying to do.

488
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:47,975
I don't know what you're trying to prove
by refuting every single thing I say.

489
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,480
- I'm not refuting everything you say!
- I didn't want to put her in that place!

490
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:55,316
But I had to.
I had no other choice.

491
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:57,651
She needed professional help.

492
00:31:57,777 --> 00:32:01,155
Now it is Carla's turn,
and I am going to protect her!

493
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,992
And nobody's going to tell me
how to do it, not even you, Radley. No!

494
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:08,996
Girls, inside, please.

495
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:18,797
- I guess we'll be forever 10 and 12.
- Marcia and Jan.

496
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:20,674
- Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
- Elizabeth, shut the hell up.

497
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,426
- It means a lot to me...
- Do not...

498
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,012
Do not speak to me that way
in front of the children.

499
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:27,848
And we are both responsible
for putting Carla in that place.

500
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:30,809
You went along with it
because you were too drunk to face it.

501
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:33,687
I made that decision by myself!

502
00:32:33,812 --> 00:32:37,274
I wasn't drinking when I picked her up,
and I haven't had a drink...

503
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:40,569
since that family meeting
8 years, 4 months and 11 days ago!

504
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:43,989
That is not the...
That is not the same...

505
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:47,951
It is the same family. Damn it!
Our family, Elizabeth!

506
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:50,495
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

507
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:53,957
Dinner will be served soon.

508
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:56,460
I'll skip dinner.

509
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:36,833
- Permission to come aboard?
- Permission granted.

510
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,763
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I just... I...

511
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:55,101
Anyway, I never meant to insinuate
anything against you.

512
00:33:56,895 --> 00:34:00,899
Maybe we should just trust Carla.

513
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:03,776
But it's not just trusting Carla.
I really don't think so.

514
00:34:03,902 --> 00:34:07,363
I think it's everybody.
It's everything out there. It's the...

515
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,283
Well, she can live near us.
That way we can keep an eye on her.

516
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:14,579
She just got back.
Does she have to leave so soon?

517
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:17,123
Not like you planned, huh?

518
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:20,543
No. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

519
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:29,635
Is anybody coming to dinner, or
are we voting on what's being served?

520
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:40,062
What?

521
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:43,441
What is...

522
00:34:49,238 --> 00:34:52,241
- Well...
- Hot roll or baguette?

523
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:55,369
I think I will have a hot roll...
Oh, come on, please.

524
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:58,289
This is just absurd.

525
00:34:58,414 --> 00:35:01,542
This is not a casual decision,
and Carla is not like other girls.

526
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,463
But I don't want to be the one who
always says no to her. I really don't.

527
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:08,340
So I'm gonna try and
see it your way. I'm gonna try and see...

528
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:10,718
- Oh!
- I am so happy, Mama!

529
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:13,012
- This is so great!
- Carla? This is...

530
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:16,348
- You could come and help me pick an apartment out...
- Not quite so hard to Mom. Okay.

531
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:19,101
- And everything.
- All right, maybe we will. Maybe I could do that.

532
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:22,521
I could call up Gibson Realty. We could
have them, you know, get a couple of videos.

533
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:25,232
- Dear, that is my... Oh, dear.
- Mom, this is the best...

534
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,234
- birthday present I've ever had.
- Please don't do that.

535
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,156
I'm thrilled. Is everybody happy?

536
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,491
Bye!

537
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:38,203
- Bye, Daniel! Bye!
- Bye!

538
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,998
- Bye, Daniel!
- Bye!

539
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:43,208
Bye, Carla!

540
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:48,881
Bye. L-I'll see you tomorrow.
Goodbye.

541
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:52,050
So who's the fella?
Is he kind of a sweetheart?

542
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:55,178
No, that's my friend Daniel.

543
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:58,015
Um, but I like
to call him Danny.

544
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,852
Danny. Well, Danny's kind of cute.

545
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:06,565
Stop teasing, Dad!

546
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:17,451
Carla, this way. Uh, your father
mentioned that you met a young man.

547
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,494
Yeah, that's Daniel.

548
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:25,208
But I told Dad that he was just
a "friend" friend, not a boyfriend.

549
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,420
Darling, don't sit there!
It's just wet.

550
00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:31,339
No, it isn't, Mom. It's dry.

551
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:35,010
It's dry, Mom.

552
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:37,304
Well, Carla, you're going
to be getting this apartment...

553
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:40,765
and I'm sure you're gonna want
to have visitors come over...

554
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,185
and I'm sure that some
of these visitors are going to be...

555
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:47,105
well, they're going
to be young men.

556
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,025
Mom, is this a sex talk?

557
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:52,944
No.

558
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:57,282
Well, yes. Is that okay?

559
00:36:57,407 --> 00:37:00,243
- Okay.
- All right. Okay.

560
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:03,705
Well, then I know that
recently you mentioned, um...

561
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,125
doing it...

562
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,628
and I just wanted to know
if you really know what that means.

563
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:13,590
Yeah, that's what
Thomas Porter calls it.

564
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:18,720
And Mrs Matthews, the health teacher
and the cafeteria monitor...

565
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:21,222
she called it coitus.

566
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:24,308
- And she also told us about penis...
- Okay, we've got it.

567
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:27,478
- And vulva.
- Shh. Carla. Just a little less loud, okay?

568
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:30,481
- And then she was telling us all about semen...
- Carla, honey.

569
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:35,570
And how there's 50 billion sperms
in one shot, and that...

570
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:38,823
No, no, no.
We do have the... We have the...

571
00:37:38,948 --> 00:37:41,409
- Yeah, yeah. All right. That's very good. No, no.
- I know all about it.

572
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:45,413
You know all about it. I understand that. You know
all about reproduction. That's excellent. Good.

573
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:48,082
Yeah, and she also told me...

574
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:51,335
that people like us...

575
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,672
they... boys can try
to take advantage...

576
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:58,926
and that they'll try to coitus us.

577
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:02,638
So if that should
ever happen, to say, "No!

578
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:04,682
- Oh. Okay.
- Stop right there!"

579
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:08,018
Good. And that's excellent advice.
What else did she say to you?

580
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:11,647
"Don't put gum under
the cafeteria table!

581
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:14,150
How many times
do I have to tell you?"

582
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:17,361
She's teaching you
a lot of variety there.

583
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:21,866
Anyway, dear, with this apartment, I just
don't think that you should have, um...

584
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:24,535
any boyfriends over
for a while, all right?

585
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,038
- Is that okay with you?
- But, Mom...

586
00:38:28,163 --> 00:38:31,000
what if I want to go visit...

587
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,377
at someone else's apartment?

588
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:38,382
Well, in that case,
you remember "No, stop. "

589
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:42,177
And you don't forget
your pepper spray.

590
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:46,306
- Whose apartment might you be visiting, Carla?
- Nobody's.

591
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:50,769
I was just saying what if.
I'm gonna go feed the birds.

592
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:54,648
Okay. Oh, geez.

593
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:57,818
No, Carla, wait!
Get away from the water.

594
00:38:57,943 --> 00:38:59,903
Hello, duckies.

595
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:03,824
- Come here, duckies.
- Carla!

596
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:08,912
- I want to live
- Like animals

597
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:12,040
- Careless and free
- Like animals

598
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:17,087
- I want to live
- Uh, excuse me, sir.

599
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:20,173
Does this bus go
to La Pine Street?

600
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:23,427
Nah, this is the eastbound.
You want the westbound over there.

601
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:25,804
But I took four buses already.

602
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:29,432
- I don't know what to tell you, but that bus will take you there.
- Okay.

603
00:39:29,558 --> 00:39:32,561
Thank you very much.

604
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:40,402
It's so confusing
There's so many rules to follow

605
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:42,862
But I don't feel it

606
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:49,744
'Cause I just run away in my mind

607
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:53,248
Ohh-ohh

608
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:56,793
- I want to live
- Like animals

609
00:39:56,918 --> 00:40:01,089
- Careless and free
- Like animals

610
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:03,299
I want to live

611
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:07,720
I want to run through thejungle
The wind in my hair

612
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:11,391
And the sand at my feet

613
00:40:11,516 --> 00:40:13,810
Daniel!

614
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:16,479
- Hey!
- Hi.

615
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:18,398
You found it!

616
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:21,651
And... And these are my CDs.

617
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:26,656
Would you have any blues? My friend
and I at my school, we love the blues.

618
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:31,494
I like, like Muddy Waters
and Billie Holiday.

619
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,163
- She's dead, you know.
- Yeah.

620
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:37,917
Yeah. I like that one song
where she sings...

621
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:41,003
I'm gonna love you

622
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:45,258
Like nobody's loved you

623
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:51,514
Come rain or come shine

624
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:55,518
No, but I-I have marching bands.

625
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,313
L- I-I have marching bands
from all over the world.

626
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:01,274
From Scotland and from Russia.

627
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,734
But do you have
the one song that goes...

628
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:07,697
- I'm gonna love you
- No blues!

629
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:12,034
- I'll... Okay, I'll... I'll play you my favourite one now, okay?
- Like nobody's

630
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,161
Loved you

631
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,122
Come...

632
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:34,014
W- Watch. Watch this.
Watch this.

633
00:41:44,149 --> 00:41:47,236
You're gonna wake...
You're gonna wake Mrs Waters' baby.

634
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:50,572
I've told you time and time again,
don't play the music so loud.

635
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:54,910
- Okay, okay. S- Sometimes
I forget, Ernie. - Yeah.

636
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:59,081
- Who are you?
- This is... This is Ernie. He's a painter.

637
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,416
- And he... he's a, a musician.
- Well...

638
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:05,379
I'm an art, painting, music
and volume control manager.

639
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:07,714
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know you were entertaining a lady.

640
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,885
No, Ernie, this is... this is
Carla. She's... She's my friend.

641
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,930
My name is Carla Tate.

642
00:42:15,055 --> 00:42:18,266
Thanks for calling me a lady.

643
00:42:18,392 --> 00:42:21,436
Mrs Tate, I want you to bear in mind that all the
apartments that I'm gonna be showing you in the video are...

644
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:24,064
Winnie, where's Carla?
She should be here. She should see this.

645
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:26,066
Oh, she phoned to say she's
going to be a little late.

646
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:27,609
- She's studying with friends.
- Really?

647
00:42:27,734 --> 00:42:30,028
Now, remember,
this is tape number two.

648
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:34,032
- Now, Mrs Tate, it's a little small. Kitchen.
- No, this is out of the question.

649
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:35,325
No, I don't like it.

650
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,576
- I agree.
- No, next, okay?

651
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,411
- Oh, Ernie...
- Yeah?

652
00:42:38,537 --> 00:42:42,165
- Uh, did my dad send a cheque... -
Oh, yeah, yeah. - For, for my allowance?

653
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,000
- Hold on. Here. That's right. I forgot.
- Okay.

654
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,795
- I got two leaky sinks here. Here.
- Okay.

655
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,588
Paid your bills.
Here's your allowance.

656
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:50,799
Don't spend it all
on the first date, all right?

657
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:55,136
- Yeah, my... my dad sells Mercedes. Yeah.
- Right. Okay.

658
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:58,306
- All right? All right.
- Okay. Bye!

659
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,101
- Bye. - Okay!
- Bye now!

660
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:06,314
Ernie has killed people.

661
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:09,984
What?

662
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,822
He was in Vietnam.

663
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:17,784
He doesn't like to talk about it,
but he talks to me about it.

664
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:22,080
And he lives down
in the basement all alone.

665
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:25,416
- What I really like is the kitchen.
- Yeah, isn't that beautiful?

666
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:29,253
- It's sweet.
- You know, and a lot of the owners don't like to rent to people like Carla.

667
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:32,298
- And knowing that...
- I'm sorry. Would you wait one second?

668
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:37,178
- Well, I mean, not don't like to...
- I'm sorry, but there are no people like Carla, okay?

669
00:43:37,303 --> 00:43:42,308
- She happens to be a very unique young woman.
- Okay.

670
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:46,979
Okay. Of course she is,
but they just wanna know...

671
00:43:47,105 --> 00:43:50,983
if the unique young woman
is gonna leave the gas on...

672
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:53,486
or if she's gonna leave
the door unlocked.

673
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:56,447
This is them asking, not me.
Is she reliable?

674
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:59,825
Well, of course she's reliable. I mean,
this is her first apartment, though.

675
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:03,371
I mean, I can't vouch for the fact that the
window might not be left open during a rainstorm...

676
00:44:03,496 --> 00:44:05,665
but what mother
can vouch for that?

677
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,627
Look, I understand what their concerns are,
but let me tell you something right now, okay?

678
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:12,713
My daughter happens to be
a very amazing person.

679
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:16,133
She's tough,
and she is adamant to be on her own.

680
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:19,220
She's gonna be just fine.

681
00:44:19,345 --> 00:44:23,057
Now, if there's any sort of a problem,
I am only 15 minutes away.

682
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:27,853
- You think that's gonna be enough for them?
- It's enough for me.

683
00:44:27,978 --> 00:44:32,233
All right. Thank you.
Let's watch it.

684
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,074
No! She can't marry
that guy, Daniel.

685
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:43,994
I want her to marry
Dustin Hoffman.

686
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,082
Yeah. Okay. Okay,
wait just a second.

687
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,335
Elaine!

688
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:56,340
- Elaine!
- Whoa-oh!

689
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:58,842
Yeah!

690
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:06,892
- Yeah.
- Do they live happily ever after, Daniel?

691
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:10,729
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
They didn't make a Graduate 2.

692
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:13,106
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

693
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:17,402
That was a great movie, Daniel.
I'm so happy you let me watch it.

694
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:20,530
I would have never seen it
had you not asked me to see it.

695
00:45:20,656 --> 00:45:23,867
Carla, do you...
do you wanna be my friend?

696
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:27,621
- I am your friend.
- No, no, no. L-I... No, I don't...

697
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:30,749
I like that one part where he's trying
to get away from his parents.

698
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:34,920
I don't mean "friend" friend.
I mean boy-girlfriend.

699
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:42,093
Are you getting
the pepper spray?

700
00:45:43,094 --> 00:45:46,806
No. I'm thinking.

701
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:51,895
Okay.

702
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,397
Okay.

703
00:45:59,444 --> 00:46:01,821
Okay.

704
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:11,998
One bedroom, one bathroom,
hardwood floors...

705
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:15,543
- eat-in kitchen, working fireplace.
- That is good.

706
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:19,631
- I knew it. I knew it.
- This... I love those Georg...

707
00:46:19,756 --> 00:46:24,010
That's a Georgian window, Mrs Tate. That's
a classic. That's a San Francisco classic.

708
00:46:45,531 --> 00:46:47,617
Hi, Daniel.

709
00:46:48,785 --> 00:46:51,204
Hi!

710
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:58,127
Mr Vitello, s-she's my friend.
She's my friend.

711
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:03,299
- Wh-What are you doing here?
- I came to tell you the best news.

712
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:07,386
Wh-Wh... What's that?
What's that?

713
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:11,182
I got my own apartment,
my very own apartment.

714
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:15,019
Nobody lives there but me,
and I move there in two weeks!

715
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:19,190
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

716
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:26,739
Sorry, Mr Vitello. Sorry.

717
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:44,423
See, not a marshmallow in the bunch.

718
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:49,386
Okay, okay, okay,
see that guy right there?

719
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:52,222
That's my friend,
and he's... he's a bandmaster.

720
00:47:52,348 --> 00:47:55,100
And see that guy right there
with the big baton?

721
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:57,728
That guy's name
is Wally Williams...

722
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:03,609
and, and, and he's a drum major, and
they, they, they call him Walkin' Wally.

723
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:06,945
- Why?
- I don't know.

724
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,865
All right, perfect.
Once again from the top.

725
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,784
- Hi, everybody!
- Hey, Danny.

726
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,454
- Hi.
- Hey, Danny. Uh, how's it goin'?

727
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:18,248
- Good.
- I wasn't expecting to see you till Monday.

728
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:23,629
Uh... Yeah, just 'cause... just 'cause
I wanted... I wanted to bring Carla in...

729
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:26,381
so that she could see
where I work.

730
00:48:26,506 --> 00:48:29,551
- Hi, Carla. - Hey, Carla.
- She... She's my girlfriend.

731
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:32,471
Ohh!

732
00:48:32,596 --> 00:48:35,474
No, I... They're
not laughing at you.

733
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,102
You just missed marching band rehearsal, and
right now we're working with the Dixieland band.

734
00:48:39,227 --> 00:48:42,355
Ohh.

735
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:45,066
But you know what?
I was just talking to Wally.

736
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:49,821
And we decided it would be great
to hear the band from the audience.

737
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:11,134
Wow, Carla. A new boyfriend.

738
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:15,847
- And now a dance?
- Yeah. The dance is this Friday.

739
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:19,684
- Mm, that's exciting.
- Well, I was just calling, Heather...

740
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:22,520
because I wanted to tell you
the good news...

741
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:27,192
and I want to look special,
with nice make-up on...

742
00:49:27,317 --> 00:49:30,153
and I don't think
I could do it myself.

743
00:49:30,278 --> 00:49:33,781
Just go to the mall. They have
lots of make-over places there.

744
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:38,286
- You know, they'll just do it for you or show you how.
- Really?

745
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:40,663
- Free make-over demonstration over here.
- Really?

746
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:42,582
- We can do wonders for you, I promise.
- Good. Thanks.

747
00:49:42,707 --> 00:49:45,001
- Hi, miss. We're having a free
make-over demonstration. - No, thank you.

748
00:49:45,126 --> 00:49:48,713
- Free make-overs.
- Oh, it's free?

749
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:52,050
Wow. But over there, it's 35.

750
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:56,053
- But it's free over there.
- Thank you.

751
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:59,223
And smile. Perfect! Beautiful.

752
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:02,560
Now, this is the new you.

753
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:05,188
The old you.

754
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:07,481
Good.

755
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:09,984
Not so good.

756
00:50:11,777 --> 00:50:16,240
Okay. Anyone else
for a free make-over demonstration?

757
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:19,869
But when are you gonna do
the rest of my face?

758
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:24,582
This is a demonstration, and
this demonstration was absolutely free.

759
00:50:24,707 --> 00:50:28,544
Oh, but how much is it
to buy the other half of my face?

760
00:50:28,669 --> 00:50:31,714
About $50.

761
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,633
- But I don't have $50.
- Oh.

762
00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:38,554
Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take the
next customer then, so if you could just move aside.

763
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:42,850
But you didn't say anything
about $50 before.

764
00:50:42,975 --> 00:50:46,729
Come on. Everybody knows
the whole thing isn't free.

765
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:49,773
- But that's not fair.
- Life isn't fair.

766
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:53,110
Okay, if you'll just step aside.
Thank you so much for coming in.

767
00:50:53,235 --> 00:50:55,946
- That's not fair.
- Bye-bye now.

768
00:50:56,071 --> 00:50:58,532
Next.

769
00:51:02,411 --> 00:51:05,289
Well, you walk right in

770
00:51:05,414 --> 00:51:08,751
And you walk right out, hmm

771
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:12,045
You walk right in there

772
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:14,381
Walk right out

773
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:17,551
Well, my baby keeps on walkin'

774
00:51:19,261 --> 00:51:23,390
All she want to do
is walk right in, yeah

775
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:25,642
She walk right out

776
00:51:26,602 --> 00:51:29,313
She walks right in there

777
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:31,982
She walks right out

778
00:51:32,107 --> 00:51:34,234
- Happy Halloween.
- Hi.

779
00:51:35,152 --> 00:51:38,488
There's just too many people out there
who'll take advantage of you.

780
00:51:39,656 --> 00:51:42,451
I don't think
you should go to the dance.

781
00:51:42,576 --> 00:51:43,910
- Mother!
- What?

782
00:51:44,036 --> 00:51:46,037
- I have to go to the dance.
- Well...

783
00:51:46,163 --> 00:51:50,041
- You said I could.
- I know, I know. Okay, okay.

784
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:52,127
Can you do a whole new make-up?

785
00:51:52,252 --> 00:51:56,256
No, I won't do that, Carla.
Now, you have such a lovely face.

786
00:51:56,381 --> 00:51:59,551
You don't need
all that make-up. No.

787
00:51:59,676 --> 00:52:01,386
- Well...
- What?

788
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:04,723
How about if you taught me
how to dance?

789
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,353
Wow, Mom!

790
00:52:10,478 --> 00:52:13,565
I feel the earth move
under my feet

791
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,859
- But I can't do that with my arms.
- Yes, you can.

792
00:52:15,984 --> 00:52:18,528
Look at me.
It's very simple.

793
00:52:18,653 --> 00:52:21,823
I feel my heart
start to tremblin'

794
00:52:21,948 --> 00:52:23,450
- Whenever you're around
- I feel the earth

795
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:27,162
Thomas Porter, at my school,
he used to go like this.

796
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:30,540
- Oh, no, no, Carla. Stop. No, no, don't. No, Carla.
- And then the teacher would come and...

797
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:32,709
- All right.
- Darling, just don't move your hips like that.

798
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:37,255
Don't do this. Don't do that. Just
keep it calm down there. That's right.

799
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,924
Give me your hand.

800
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:42,844
- Okay. -
Whoo! - Wow!

801
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,014
And then the dip thing!

802
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:51,436
Oh, dear! I'm terrible!

803
00:52:52,895 --> 00:52:54,772
You're funny, Mom!

804
00:52:54,897 --> 00:52:58,109
Oh, my baby. I love you.

805
00:52:58,234 --> 00:53:00,945
- I love you.
- You're silly.

806
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:05,658
You're silly. Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, what's the matter with me?

807
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:08,411
- Wow.
- What's the matter with... I might be having a breakdown.

808
00:53:08,536 --> 00:53:10,997
- But, Mom...
- Oh, dear.

809
00:53:11,122 --> 00:53:13,916
I have to learn my slow dances too.

810
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:16,711
No, but slow dances, dear, they're...

811
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:20,798
they're a bit of a problem because you don't
want to get too close, you really don't.

812
00:53:20,923 --> 00:53:23,092
You want to keep time to the music.

813
00:53:23,217 --> 00:53:25,803
Want to do it

814
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:27,972
- Stand up and I'll show you how you do it. You just sort of...
- Yeah.

815
00:53:28,097 --> 00:53:31,308
You made me want you

816
00:53:31,434 --> 00:53:34,145
- And all the time you knew it
- All the time you knew it

817
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:40,067
- Yeah. Well, all the movies I've s-seen,
Mom, they all... - I guess you always knew it

818
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:42,653
- It's slow, like this.
- No, no. I don't think so, Carla.

819
00:53:42,778 --> 00:53:46,574
When they start to play a slow song,
I think what might be best is...

820
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:50,619
you and your partner should immediately
go and get yourselves a soda.

821
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:54,832
- That might be nice.
- But there were times

822
00:53:54,957 --> 00:53:56,917
Dear

823
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:59,670
Happy Halloween, Dad!

824
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:01,672
Look what Winnie made me.

825
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:06,844
My pumpkin's a duck.

826
00:54:06,969 --> 00:54:10,848
- No, I'm a swan.
- Oh, yeah, a swan. Of course. You...

827
00:54:13,225 --> 00:54:15,477
I feel so delicate.

828
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:19,773
Oh, honey, well, you have
always been delicate to me...

829
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:22,109
and you were always beautiful.

830
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:24,194
What is it? What... Ohh!

831
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,739
- Oh, look at you!
- Careful.

832
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:29,867
- It's Swan Lake.
- Yeah.

833
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:32,536
Oh, you're beautiful.
Now, Carla, let me just take that off.

834
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:34,871
'Cause I don't think that's gonna fit
in the back seat of the car.

835
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:37,124
And, Radley, you'd better get going,
otherwise you're gonna be late.

836
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:40,794
Oh, wait!
Oh, wait just one minute.

837
00:54:40,919 --> 00:54:43,296
- My, uh, boyfriend is coming...
- Here...

838
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:45,757
- and he's gonna go with us.
- Boyfriend?

839
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,386
Don't make that face, Mom.
He's very nice.

840
00:54:49,511 --> 00:54:52,722
- He has two jobs, Mom.
- What kind of jobs does he have, Carla?

841
00:54:52,848 --> 00:54:55,725
- Well, he wor... One w... He works at the bakery.
- The bakery.

842
00:54:55,851 --> 00:55:00,814
And then the other one is, he's a music...
works in the music department at the university.

843
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:03,483
- I don't know...
- That's nice.

844
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:06,611
- Oh! That's him! - L... I... -
Radley, come here just one moment.

845
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:07,946
- Do you believe this?
- What?

846
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,031
This guy has the nerve
to come to our very own home.

847
00:55:10,156 --> 00:55:13,410
- I mean, what does he want with her anyway?
- Honey, she's a very attractive girl.

848
00:55:13,535 --> 00:55:17,622
- She's very pretty anyway, and he just...
- I'll tell you what he wants. He wants to have his way with her. That's what he wants.

849
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:19,874
Hi, Daniel.

850
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,586
- Hi. You look really pretty.
- Thank you.

851
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:25,588
This is my idea of a nightmare.

852
00:55:25,714 --> 00:55:27,257
Mom!

853
00:55:27,382 --> 00:55:30,427
- I want you to meet Daniel.
- Oh.

854
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:34,639
And Daniel, this is my mother
and my father.

855
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,641
Hello... Ohh!

856
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,477
What is... What?

857
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,604
- Give me your paw, Daniel.
- Hello.

858
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:43,731
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Look, do, uh...

859
00:55:43,857 --> 00:55:46,442
- Do you have a head? You know, a head.
- Sorry.

860
00:55:46,568 --> 00:55:49,028
I did... I didn't...

861
00:55:49,153 --> 00:55:53,283
Oh, he's the boy at school.
Yes, well, I'm gonna find my car keys.

862
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:57,787
Don't worry,
'cause I've been house-trained.

863
00:55:58,913 --> 00:56:01,874
- That's a joke, Mom.
- You're gonna have a wonderful time tonight.

864
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:03,376
- Okay! - Yeah. -
Sure. - Sure, dear.

865
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:05,712
- So, that's an excellent costume you picked out there.
- Goodbye.

866
00:56:05,837 --> 00:56:09,006
- You don't wanna miss that party.
- What's that right there? - Oh.

867
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,885
- Trick or treat!
- My dad gives these instead of candy.

868
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,847
Oh! Up and down, and not across.

869
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,015
- Thank you! Okay.
- Bye, Carla.

870
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,435
- Bye, Mom. - Bye.
- Bye. - Be good.

871
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:23,437
- Oh, dear.
- Well...

872
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:35,199
I am not the person
who is singing

873
00:56:36,409 --> 00:56:40,037
I am the silent one inside

874
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:46,127
I am not the one
who laughs at people's jokes

875
00:56:47,628 --> 00:56:49,505
We're not responsible for lost items...

876
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,842
so please make sure you pick up
your wings and your antlers.

877
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,844
Also, for those interested...

878
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:58,097
the first-quarter grades are posted
downstairs on the bulletin board.

879
00:56:58,222 --> 00:56:59,598
Who's next?

880
00:56:59,723 --> 00:57:02,184
I want to see if I passed.

881
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:05,729
- Come on, Daniel.
- Um, well, o-okay.

882
00:57:05,854 --> 00:57:08,357
She said it was downstairs.

883
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,237
He who makes the monsters

884
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:18,075
He who strips my confidence

885
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:21,620
I passed it.

886
00:57:21,745 --> 00:57:23,497
I passed it, Daniel!

887
00:57:23,622 --> 00:57:27,668
I passed my subject
in a regular school...

888
00:57:27,793 --> 00:57:30,504
with real tests
and regular teachers.

889
00:57:30,629 --> 00:57:32,923
I did it, Daniel!

890
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:36,051
I love Polytechnic School!

891
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:40,055
I love my teachers!
I love everybody, Daniel!

892
00:57:57,948 --> 00:57:59,991
But... But, Daniel...

893
00:58:00,117 --> 00:58:03,245
you didn't fail by much,
just a smidge.

894
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,455
My... Ohh.

895
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,334
I didn't... I didn't want to
fail by a smidge. I wanted...

896
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:15,090
I- I-I wanted to...
I wanted to get out of one class...

897
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:18,760
just 'cause I passed, not 'cause I was...
n- not 'cause I was too old.

898
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:24,975
It's o... It's o... It's okay, Daniel.
Don't... Don't be upset.

899
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:29,270
No! No, it isn't okay!
It isn't...

900
00:58:31,564 --> 00:58:35,318
Everybody... Everybody's right!
Everybody's right, Carla!

901
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:37,695
Every... I am... I'm dumb!

902
00:58:37,821 --> 00:58:41,699
Everybody's right, Carla!
Everybody...

903
00:58:44,536 --> 00:58:49,749
Carla... C-Carla, can you... C-Could
you go away for a second? Please?

904
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:10,603
Okay. Okay.

905
00:59:10,728 --> 00:59:13,231
At my special school
they taught us...

906
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:17,193
that first you learn
the easy courses.

907
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:20,947
Then after you learn those,
you try the harder courses.

908
00:59:21,072 --> 00:59:23,157
Only they're not so hard any more...

909
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:26,994
because you learned
the easy stuff first.

910
00:59:28,162 --> 00:59:30,039
See?

911
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:42,677
An-Another reason I got mad is 'cause
I- I didn't want you to think I was dumb.

912
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:49,725
I could never think that.

913
00:59:54,146 --> 00:59:56,816
It's amazing how you

914
00:59:56,941 --> 01:00:00,319
Can speak right to my heart

915
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:08,661
Without sayin'a word

916
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:12,831
You can light up the dark

917
01:00:16,001 --> 01:00:17,878
Try as I may

918
01:00:18,003 --> 01:00:20,881
I could never explain

919
01:00:22,174 --> 01:00:29,223
What I hear
when you don't say a thing

920
01:00:31,266 --> 01:00:33,393
The smile on your face

921
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,897
Lets me know that you need me

922
01:00:37,022 --> 01:00:39,066
There's a truth in your eyes

923
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:42,611
Sayin'you'll never leave me

924
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:44,738
The touch of your hand

925
01:00:44,863 --> 01:00:46,740
Says you'll catch me

926
01:00:46,865 --> 01:00:51,328
If ever I fall

927
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:57,459
You say it best

928
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:00,462
When you say nothin'at all

929
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:02,923
Okay, you're disappointed.
Disappointed in what?

930
01:01:03,048 --> 01:01:07,094
- Uh, me? You? Us? What?
- Well, no, dear, not us.

931
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:10,847
But, I mean, of course
it has been bumpy at times.

932
01:01:10,972 --> 01:01:14,100
But... But I always thought
we'd end up like this, you know.

933
01:01:14,226 --> 01:01:17,771
- Somehow sailing along together.
- Oh, well, good, good. You're not disappointed in us.

934
01:01:17,896 --> 01:01:22,484
'Cause I love sailing with you. The girls,
they never really liked sailing much.

935
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:25,070
- Yeah.
- You disappointed with the girls?

936
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:29,949
Well, I feel like I'm the mother of a
dedicated underachiever, a gay workaholic...

937
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:35,622
and Carla, who thinks she can conquer this
whole terrifying world that we live in.

938
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:38,375
Honey, they're doing fine.

939
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,921
They're not drug addicts; they're not
axe murderers; they're not Democrats.

940
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,800
I don't know. Tell me... I don't know
why I am talking like this anyway...

941
01:01:46,925 --> 01:01:52,388
but honestly, Radley, sometimes I think that there
must be some mothers out there in the world...

942
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:54,849
who are better equipped
to handle Carla.

943
01:01:54,974 --> 01:01:58,144
Elizabeth, stop it, will ya.

944
01:01:58,269 --> 01:02:02,231
I mean, I know that I fail
in some horrible way. Do you know...

945
01:02:02,357 --> 01:02:05,693
Oh, I'll shut up. I promise.
Radley, I'm gonna shut my mouth.

946
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:08,613
Honey, you're just trying
to be honest with yourself.

947
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:13,493
- It's okay.
- It's not fair, Radley. It's not fair.

948
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,881
First you're judged as a person,
and then you become a parent...

949
01:02:16,006 --> 01:02:21,637
and not only are you judged as a person, but you're
also judged by how well your children are doing.

950
01:02:21,762 --> 01:02:26,475
I mean, not who they are, not what they
think, but just how well they're doing.

951
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,143
- Elizabeth.
- What?

952
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:33,106
They're doing just fine.
We are doing just fine.

953
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:35,651
- What is this?
- Fire.

954
01:02:35,776 --> 01:02:37,861
- And what is the blue?
- That's the police.

955
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:40,280
- And finally, the green.
- The hospital.

956
01:02:40,405 --> 01:02:43,075
- That is excellent. - Uh,
Elizabeth, how many... - Oh! Thanks.

957
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,619
- Now what... Oh, just...
- how many of these extinguishers did you buy?

958
01:02:45,744 --> 01:02:47,829
Not enough, obviously.
Hold on just a second.

959
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:50,916
- L... I know what I'm gonna do. - What are you
doing now? - I'm gonna put it in the kitchen.

960
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:53,085
This is... All right.

961
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:56,004
Dad, she put one in my bathroom.

962
01:02:56,129 --> 01:03:00,133
Well... Good luck,
person in her first apartment.

963
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,928
- Oh, pumpkin.
- My first apartment.

964
01:03:03,053 --> 01:03:04,513
Yes.

965
01:03:04,638 --> 01:03:08,684
Now, if you feel lonely or if you need
anything, call dear old dad, okay?

966
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:11,019
- I will.
- All right.

967
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:13,105
- All right... -
Well... - say goodbye.

968
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,107
Thank you, Mom.

969
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:19,319
- Elizabeth.
- Don't worry.

970
01:03:19,444 --> 01:03:21,321
- Oh, dear. I got a little bit of lipstick on you.
- I'll be okay.

971
01:03:21,446 --> 01:03:24,283
- All right, of course we have to go. Good. Let's go, then.
- All right.

972
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:26,451
Oh, one moment. Oh! Forgot.

973
01:03:26,577 --> 01:03:30,455
This is for you, dear. This is for you to
remember every time you leave the house.

974
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:31,874
- Uh, I showed it to her earlier.
- It's a list that I...

975
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:35,627
- I... It's written down, and I see it. - All
right. Good. All right, honey. - Okay. Bye.

976
01:03:35,752 --> 01:03:37,212
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

977
01:03:37,337 --> 01:03:39,006
Goodbye...
Do you smell gas?

978
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:41,925
- Drive safe.
- Bye. - Bye!

979
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,386
And don't worry!

980
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:48,182
I'm free to do what I want

981
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:50,851
Any old time

982
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:57,232
I said, I'm free
to do what I want

983
01:03:57,357 --> 01:04:00,194
Any old time

984
01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:07,409
Hello.
This is my apartment.

985
01:04:07,534 --> 01:04:09,620
Would you like to sit down?

986
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:16,168
I say, love me, hold me

987
01:04:16,293 --> 01:04:18,295
'Cause I'm free

988
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,422
To do what I want

989
01:04:20,547 --> 01:04:23,008
To be what I want

990
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:26,011
Any old time

991
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,360
'Cause I'm free

992
01:04:41,485 --> 01:04:43,987
To do what I want

993
01:04:44,112 --> 01:04:46,698
Any old time

994
01:04:46,823 --> 01:04:52,538
Listen up, everybody. The Falcon Bar
presents body shots at table number 4.

995
01:04:53,747 --> 01:04:57,459
- Body! Body! Body! Body!
- My turn!

996
01:04:57,584 --> 01:05:01,797
Body! Body! Body! Body!

997
01:05:01,922 --> 01:05:04,967
Body! Body! Body! Body!

998
01:05:05,092 --> 01:05:07,427
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

999
01:05:13,517 --> 01:05:16,562
The regular... regular couples
don't do that, Daniel.

1000
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:18,856
- They're from college.
- Yeah.

1001
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,858
- Huh.
- Yeah.

1002
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:25,320
Daniel, I want us to be friends...

1003
01:05:25,445 --> 01:05:28,699
for a really long time.

1004
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,743
Um, well, I-I don't think so.

1005
01:05:33,203 --> 01:05:35,539
Why not?

1006
01:05:35,664 --> 01:05:39,084
Uh, well, j-just 'cause
I... I may have to move to Florida.

1007
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:43,589
- Why?
- To live with my mom.

1008
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,427
You have to leave?

1009
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:51,346
Well, uh...

1010
01:05:51,471 --> 01:05:53,932
'C-Cause my dad
won't pay my rent any more...

1011
01:05:54,057 --> 01:05:56,435
'cause I...
'cause I failed my classes.

1012
01:05:57,644 --> 01:06:00,939
So, um, after the new year's
I have to go...

1013
01:06:01,064 --> 01:06:03,609
because... 'cause... 'cause I only make
350 dollars a month...

1014
01:06:03,734 --> 01:06:06,945
and... and my... and my rent's
500 dollars a month.

1015
01:06:11,074 --> 01:06:13,785
Mrs Robinson,
you're trying to seduce me.

1016
01:06:16,455 --> 01:06:18,373
Aren't you?

1017
01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:20,626
Well, no.
I hadn't thought of it.

1018
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:24,588
- I feel very flattered.
- Mrs Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?

1019
01:06:24,713 --> 01:06:27,132
- It's all right.
- It's not all right. It's the worst thing I ever...

1020
01:06:27,257 --> 01:06:29,134
What's the... What's the matter?

1021
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:34,681
Strange things are...
are happening to my body.

1022
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,060
Me too.

1023
01:06:38,185 --> 01:06:41,146
I kinda feel like...

1024
01:06:41,271 --> 01:06:44,149
we should be doing something more
than kissing.

1025
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:45,692
Me too.

1026
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:48,695
What did they do
after they kissed?

1027
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,325
They do it,
and then he smiles...

1028
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,370
and then she...
and she smokes a cigarette.

1029
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:02,000
Mmm, but I don't like smoking.

1030
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:07,381
Uh, w-well, me neither.
But, uh... I just like to smile.

1031
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:11,385
But... Yeah, I know.
Doing it. Sure.

1032
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:13,387
Yeah.

1033
01:07:16,431 --> 01:07:18,600
Did you ever?

1034
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:25,482
Oh, I...

1035
01:07:26,859 --> 01:07:28,944
Oh, sort of, I did it.

1036
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:32,990
- But you sort of what?
- Well, it's just 'cause I was with a bunch... some older guys...

1037
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:36,368
a- a-and they... they all chipped in
and they paid this girl...

1038
01:07:36,493 --> 01:07:38,954
and she had... she had a reputation...

1039
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:42,666
to... to kiss me,
and then, and then, you know...

1040
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:45,878
and do some other stuff, you know.

1041
01:07:46,003 --> 01:07:48,589
And then... And then...

1042
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,844
And then what?

1043
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,263
Well, i... it's just that there was...
there was a lot of kissing...

1044
01:07:56,388 --> 01:07:59,183
and there was a...
there was a lot of, um, hugging...

1045
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:02,978
and there was a...
there was a lot of rubbing.

1046
01:08:03,103 --> 01:08:07,900
And then... See, 'cause the thing was, I...
'Cause I finished before I was supposed to. See?

1047
01:08:08,025 --> 01:08:11,778
'Cause I... You know.
You have to be a guy to understand that.

1048
01:08:11,904 --> 01:08:14,072
- 'Cause, see... 'Cause guys and girls are different.
- Daniel.

1049
01:08:14,198 --> 01:08:17,868
- Guys have a thing.
- Did you love her?

1050
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:24,333
I sure...
Well, I sure thought I did.

1051
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:27,503
Hmm.

1052
01:08:28,712 --> 01:08:32,841
But not... not like I love you.

1053
01:08:32,966 --> 01:08:36,762
'Cause I... I... I...
I love you every minute.

1054
01:08:38,388 --> 01:08:41,600
I love you more than band music...

1055
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:43,602
and cookie-making.

1056
01:08:45,395 --> 01:08:49,358
That's... That's a stupid thing
to say, I know, I...

1057
01:08:53,946 --> 01:08:55,822
No.

1058
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:05,123
That's the first time...

1059
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:08,377
anybody's ever
said that to me before.

1060
01:09:18,095 --> 01:09:20,973
I love you too, Daniel McMahon.

1061
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,032
I don't want you to leave.

1062
01:09:39,157 --> 01:09:41,034
Me neither.

1063
01:09:42,703 --> 01:09:46,832
The reason I'm always saying no to you
is because of what you ask for, Carla.

1064
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:49,501
But Daniel
never asked for the money.

1065
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:53,547
- He would just come and move in with me.
- That's the same as asking for money.

1066
01:09:53,672 --> 01:09:55,757
But it's my idea.

1067
01:09:55,883 --> 01:10:00,053
- And, see, his rent is $500, and he can't afford it, Mom.
- Honey. Carla.

1068
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:03,307
Carla, he cannot move in with you.

1069
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:05,851
- But it's my place.
- No, it is not your place.

1070
01:10:05,976 --> 01:10:10,189
It is the person who pays for the rent.
That is the boss of the apartment.

1071
01:10:10,314 --> 01:10:14,276
B- But Dad pays the bills here,
and you're the boss.

1072
01:10:15,652 --> 01:10:17,196
That's different.
Radley, please.

1073
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:21,200
- Dad, tell Mom that it's not very different.
- Please.

1074
01:10:21,325 --> 01:10:24,119
Honey, your mom is right
on this one.

1075
01:10:25,537 --> 01:10:27,414
Oh, really.

1076
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:34,922
- Mom is right.
- Oh, pumpkin.

1077
01:10:35,047 --> 01:10:37,216
I'm telling you,
that boy sees her as a rich girl.

1078
01:10:37,341 --> 01:10:42,888
Well, she is a rich girl,
but I don't think he's after her money.

1079
01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:44,973
But seriously,
aren't you concerned?

1080
01:10:45,098 --> 01:10:47,059
Carla is young,
she's full of love.

1081
01:10:47,184 --> 01:10:50,479
This is the first love she's ever had.
She's feeling that for the first time.

1082
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:54,775
This is just a harmless
flirtation, a crush.

1083
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,652
That's all it is.

1084
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,738
So, we can do...

1085
01:10:59,863 --> 01:11:05,244
Or we could try, um, page 39.

1086
01:11:05,369 --> 01:11:06,745
I marked that.

1087
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:11,041
And page 84...

1088
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,085
is okay.

1089
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:16,797
But I don't want to do page 155...

1090
01:11:16,922 --> 01:11:20,551
But... I... If I...
If I remember correctly...

1091
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:25,264
t- t-there's a page...
it's, uh, 146.

1092
01:11:25,389 --> 01:11:30,310
And i-i... it looks pretty good.

1093
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:37,276
How much do you weigh?

1094
01:11:37,401 --> 01:11:42,781
Uh, well, let's see. L... I-I...
See, 'cause... 'cause I weigh 145...

1095
01:11:42,906 --> 01:11:45,367
and four ounces.

1096
01:11:45,492 --> 01:11:48,453
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

1097
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:51,456
- Well, that sounds okay.
- Yeah. See... Yeah.

1098
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,298
So, d-do you want to do it now?

1099
01:12:01,592 --> 01:12:04,219
'Cause I... I got the, um...

1100
01:12:04,344 --> 01:12:07,014
I got protection...

1101
01:12:07,139 --> 01:12:11,518
at the family planning place.

1102
01:12:11,643 --> 01:12:16,481
And, uh... See- See, 'cause, uh... I...
I even got ones that glow in the dark.

1103
01:12:16,607 --> 01:12:20,277
And... And... And see, they... 'cause
they made me practise on a banana.

1104
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,738
- Do you want me to show you how to do it?
- No.

1105
01:12:23,864 --> 01:12:25,741
Okay.

1106
01:12:26,992 --> 01:12:29,036
So, are you ready?

1107
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:31,705
'Cause, 'cause I'm ready.

1108
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,960
Ready?

1109
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,633
Are you r-ready?

1110
01:12:45,886 --> 01:12:51,183
Come on, 'cause... 'cause we can do it
in the... in the bedroom, if you want.

1111
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:54,186
No, I'm not ready.

1112
01:12:54,311 --> 01:12:58,023
L... Daniel.

1113
01:12:58,148 --> 01:13:00,943
I don't want to do it right now.

1114
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:05,239
I was thinking that we could wait
till the next holiday...

1115
01:13:05,364 --> 01:13:07,366
because holidays are special...

1116
01:13:07,491 --> 01:13:09,660
and Thanksgiving
is coming up soon...

1117
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:13,705
Oh, 'cause, uh,
I feel special right now, Carla.

1118
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:18,210
But Thanksgiving, there's a turkey
and there's more than two desserts.

1119
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,045
Yeah.

1120
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,130
It's like a magic.

1121
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:27,135
- Oh.
- But I don't... I don't wanna do it now.

1122
01:13:28,345 --> 01:13:29,721
- Uh...
- Well, let's get your bike.

1123
01:13:29,847 --> 01:13:32,933
So I just save these
for Thanksgiving, right?

1124
01:13:33,058 --> 01:13:36,895
- Yeah, Thanksgiving.
- Yeah. Okay.

1125
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:44,152
You always tell me

1126
01:13:44,278 --> 01:13:46,613
That it's impossible

1127
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:52,578
To be respected

1128
01:13:53,704 --> 01:13:55,914
And be a girl

1129
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,504
Please be careful with me

1130
01:14:02,629 --> 01:14:04,423
I'm sensitive

1131
01:14:04,548 --> 01:14:08,594
And I'd like to stay that way

1132
01:14:10,095 --> 01:14:13,307
- Very careful. Good girl. That's right. It's hot.
- Wow.

1133
01:14:13,432 --> 01:14:15,309
- Oh, that looks good.
- Looks good.

1134
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:18,353
Put it down over here,
'cause this is nice, cold marble.

1135
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,149
Yes!

1136
01:14:22,274 --> 01:14:25,986
Good! That's good. All right, now curl
your fingers. Don't get your fingers in.

1137
01:14:26,111 --> 01:14:30,991
And we thank You that we are all here together
again for the first time in many years...

1138
01:14:31,116 --> 01:14:35,621
making this a Thanksgiving
for each of us to remember.

1139
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:40,626
Amen.

1140
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:42,544
- Potatoes.
- Good.

1141
01:14:42,669 --> 01:14:45,547
So, Caroline, please tell me how,
with your horrible temper...

1142
01:14:45,672 --> 01:14:47,549
you think you're going to be able
to manage teaching second grade.

1143
01:14:47,674 --> 01:14:49,968
- Oh, don't talk like that about your sister.
- I don't have a horrible temper.

1144
01:14:50,093 --> 01:14:52,846
- I love children. - She's a good
teacher. - I just get mad at adults.

1145
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:55,140
- Mm-hmm. And her sister, occasionally.
- Thanks, Winnie.

1146
01:14:55,265 --> 01:14:57,142
- Yeah!
- Oh, just occasionally her sister.

1147
01:14:57,267 --> 01:15:00,020
- Have you seen her temper?
- But, Carla, do you know what I did?

1148
01:15:00,145 --> 01:15:02,147
- Are we almost done?
- What's your hurry?

1149
01:15:02,272 --> 01:15:04,149
Carla, why are you in such a hurry?

1150
01:15:04,274 --> 01:15:06,902
I don't want to get home too late.

1151
01:15:10,697 --> 01:15:14,076
Yes, Mom,
I took all the right buses.

1152
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:18,997
Will you thank Winnie
for making me the food bundle?

1153
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:23,168
Okay, good night, Mom.

1154
01:15:23,293 --> 01:15:25,170
Happy Thanksgiving.

1155
01:15:28,882 --> 01:15:32,344
John Elway recovers
on the 13-yard line!

1156
01:15:32,469 --> 01:15:34,930
This is so good.

1157
01:15:36,056 --> 01:15:38,559
It's, uh... Uh, this is...
Last year...

1158
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:42,813
Uh, last year,
um, I ate tids and bits...

1159
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,691
and it... and it just... it just doesn't
have that Thanksgiving feeling.

1160
01:15:45,816 --> 01:15:47,317
Yeah.

1161
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:51,071
Well, Winnie made everything
except the sweet potatoes.

1162
01:15:51,196 --> 01:15:54,575
I made that and put
all the little marshmallows on top.

1163
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,536
Oh, 'cause...
'cause that was my favourite part.

1164
01:15:57,661 --> 01:16:00,622
- Eh, no, it wasn't.
- Yeah, it was.

1165
01:16:06,086 --> 01:16:08,463
Well, I'm stuffed.

1166
01:16:11,508 --> 01:16:16,930
Well, it's... it's Thanksgiving. Remember the...
'm-m-member what we said we were gonna do on Thanksgiving?

1167
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:19,516
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1168
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:29,651
I wonder who thought up sex
in the first place, Daniel.

1169
01:16:29,776 --> 01:16:32,321
L- I-I think it was Madonna,
actually.

1170
01:16:40,287 --> 01:16:43,540
But, Daniel...

1171
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,542
I'm kind of scared.

1172
01:16:47,294 --> 01:16:49,755
Well, you... you don't
have to be scared, Carla.

1173
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,757
'Cause you know why?

1174
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:55,385
'Cause I would...
'Cause I would never hurt you.

1175
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:59,389
'Cause you... you're the last person
in the world that I'd ever hurt.

1176
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,770
Okay.

1177
01:17:14,905 --> 01:17:17,282
- Carla?
- Just a second.

1178
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:12,045
That's nice underwear.

1179
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:14,047
Yeah.

1180
01:18:14,173 --> 01:18:17,050
I got it from my sister's closet.

1181
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,724
I've never been naked
in front of anyone before.

1182
01:18:25,726 --> 01:18:27,603
Just you.

1183
01:18:46,163 --> 01:18:48,749
Should we have some music,
Daniel?

1184
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:50,834
Uh, i-i-it's okay.
I'll get some music.

1185
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,836
Okay.

1186
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:28,247
I know why you're smiling.

1187
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:32,751
- Why?
- When someone smiles like that, they're in love.

1188
01:19:34,711 --> 01:19:36,588
Really?

1189
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:43,178
Oh, Carla, there you are. You know, I've
got some new art books for you to look at.

1190
01:19:43,303 --> 01:19:47,641
And I want you to select a few paintings
that we can discuss later. All right?

1191
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:49,518
- Yeah.
- All right.

1192
01:19:49,643 --> 01:19:53,230
- Well, I like "The Lace Maker. "
- Mm-hmm.

1193
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,108
And this one right here.

1194
01:19:56,233 --> 01:19:58,318
That's the famous
"Girl with the Red Hat. "

1195
01:19:58,443 --> 01:20:00,320
- That's such a pretty painting.
- She...

1196
01:20:00,445 --> 01:20:05,617
But I think we should look at our Sister Wendy, because
she's going to be in Florence this week. I'm very excited.

1197
01:20:05,742 --> 01:20:10,622
I'm going on a grand tour in search of some
of the finest art treasures in the world.

1198
01:20:11,748 --> 01:20:13,625
What are...
You know something?

1199
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,838
- What?
- You look different to me, dear.

1200
01:20:19,089 --> 01:20:21,675
- What's going on, huh?
- Beginning my grand tour in Florence.

1201
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,177
Strange.

1202
01:20:26,096 --> 01:20:28,473
...and sometimes played at funerals.

1203
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,476
Um...

1204
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:35,063
Hello?

1205
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:39,193
Oh, hi, Dad.

1206
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:42,821
Yeah. Um, wait.

1207
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:47,868
Uh, well, I was... I was wondering
i- if... if you could change your mind...

1208
01:20:47,993 --> 01:20:50,496
a- a-about not giving me the money,
just 'cause...

1209
01:20:50,621 --> 01:20:54,124
just 'cause I...
I met this girl and then...

1210
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,126
Um...

1211
01:20:57,461 --> 01:20:59,505
Oh, y-yeah.

1212
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:02,174
Well, Dad, just... Wh... Uh...

1213
01:21:02,299 --> 01:21:07,930
What about just giving me, uh, enough... enough money just
until I... I fi... I find a better job that... that pays...

1214
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:15,395
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1215
01:21:15,521 --> 01:21:18,565
Okay... Yeah, 'cause it...
It's just that sometimes I forget.

1216
01:21:20,025 --> 01:21:22,069
Yeah.

1217
01:21:22,194 --> 01:21:25,197
Um, yeah, I m... I miss you too.

1218
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:27,699
Uh, I'm, uh...

1219
01:21:27,824 --> 01:21:29,701
How... How are you, Da...

1220
01:21:32,913 --> 01:21:34,790
Okay, bye.

1221
01:21:48,595 --> 01:21:52,766
If you're happy and you know it
clap your hands

1222
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:56,728
If you're happy and you know it
clap your hands

1223
01:21:56,854 --> 01:21:59,106
If you're happy...

1224
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:02,651
Oh, I know what you guys
are gonna do tonight.

1225
01:22:05,612 --> 01:22:09,741
Hey, the Daniel McMahon bike rack.

1226
01:22:09,867 --> 01:22:12,828
Hey!
Take that bike off my porch!

1227
01:22:12,953 --> 01:22:17,416
If you're happy and you know it
clap your hands

1228
01:22:19,877 --> 01:22:24,173
Ernie! Ernie!

1229
01:22:24,298 --> 01:22:27,509
Thank you, San Francisco!

1230
01:22:29,887 --> 01:22:33,432
Thank you, Elvis McMahon.

1231
01:22:33,557 --> 01:22:35,142
Ernie!

1232
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:38,604
The Spanish mustang!

1233
01:22:38,729 --> 01:22:42,107
- Uh, hey, that smells like a good year, pal. Come on. Come on inside.
- Well, I...

1234
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:50,949
I love Carla, Ernie.
Carla loves me. There's a fact.

1235
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:54,286
Okay, most people at school
make fun of me...

1236
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:58,165
and they... and they... and they never...
and they never talk to me, Ernie.

1237
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:01,084
They never, ever talk to me.

1238
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:05,172
And she... she... 'Cause she's the... she's
the only one that makes me feel like a person.

1239
01:23:06,423 --> 01:23:09,009
- Oh, come on, now.
- To Carla!

1240
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:11,053
Now... Now... Come on, now!
Now, that's... All right. Here.

1241
01:23:11,178 --> 01:23:14,056
- Let's go... What's that? What's that?
- Got ya.

1242
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:17,643
- Aw, Ernie!
- See how I did that?

1243
01:23:17,768 --> 01:23:20,145
- I love to drink, Ernie.
- Oh, yeah? Come on.

1244
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,898
- Yeah. It makes me feel good.
- Oh, yeah?

1245
01:23:23,023 --> 01:23:25,484
Yeah. Wait, is that...
is that why people drink?

1246
01:23:25,609 --> 01:23:27,486
Oh, people drink
for lots of reasons.

1247
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:31,865
Some to be happy, some to forget,
some to be brave.

1248
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:34,409
I think... I think I wanna...
I think I wanna be brave, Ernie.

1249
01:23:34,535 --> 01:23:36,829
No. Only cowards
get brave that way.

1250
01:23:36,954 --> 01:23:39,540
Forget drinking.
Forget all that stuff.

1251
01:23:39,665 --> 01:23:42,042
You gotta find what makes you happy.
Danny, what makes you happy?

1252
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:44,545
Uh...

1253
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:47,548
- Come on. What makes you happy?
- I wanna... I wanna take a ride in your Mustang.

1254
01:23:47,673 --> 01:23:50,217
That's, uh...
That'd make me really happy, Ernie.

1255
01:23:50,342 --> 01:23:53,512
You never did that, and that...
t- t-that would make me very happy.

1256
01:23:53,637 --> 01:23:57,516
No, I can't take that car out in winter
weather. It'll ruin her paint job.

1257
01:23:57,641 --> 01:24:01,061
Some other time. Anything else
would make you happy? Come on.

1258
01:24:01,186 --> 01:24:02,855
Yeah.

1259
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:08,360
Help me... Help me find a job
so that I can be with Carla forever.

1260
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:13,073
I'm sorry your father
won't change his mind.

1261
01:24:14,533 --> 01:24:18,036
See, he s... he s... he said
he'd paid for me long enough...

1262
01:24:18,162 --> 01:24:21,915
and that he... he said...
he said it's my mother's turn.

1263
01:24:24,001 --> 01:24:26,044
I'm very angry right now, Ernie.

1264
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:29,047
Oh, I can understand anger.
I know about that.

1265
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:34,136
No! No, no, no, no. Easy now.
There. Easy. Come on, now, easy.

1266
01:24:34,261 --> 01:24:36,471
Watch my guitar.
Now, easy.

1267
01:24:36,597 --> 01:24:40,058
You know what I do sometimes
when I get angry? You know what I do?

1268
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:43,187
I call up a buddy.
I call a pal. Hmm? See?

1269
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:48,233
And, uh, somethin' like this.
How are ya? See?

1270
01:24:48,358 --> 01:24:50,235
That's it. That...

1271
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:53,030
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1272
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:55,574
Yeah?
That's it. See? See?

1273
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:57,618
- Yeah.
- Patting. Patting is good.

1274
01:24:57,743 --> 01:24:59,953
P... Patting. That's it.

1275
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:04,500
Heather!

1276
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:08,962
All right, guys, what do we think
about this for the country club, hmm?

1277
01:25:09,087 --> 01:25:12,132
- Mm-hmm. That is so chic.
- Very.

1278
01:25:12,257 --> 01:25:15,844
- Where'd you get that?
- At Michelle's, uh, Soho boutique, actually.

1279
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:18,055
Where is Carla?
We're gonna be late, aren't we?

1280
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,974
You know what? You always do that,
Mother. You know who she is.

1281
01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:24,019
- She's the one... - Oh, please. -
That you refer to as my special friend.

1282
01:25:24,144 --> 01:25:25,771
- Ohh.
- All right, tension alert.

1283
01:25:25,896 --> 01:25:29,107
You know what? Honey, why don't you go
start the car, and I'm gonna go find Carla...

1284
01:25:29,233 --> 01:25:31,443
- and you...
- Mmm.

1285
01:25:31,568 --> 01:25:34,613
Wait, Mother,
you never even met Michelle.

1286
01:25:34,738 --> 01:25:37,574
- Come on!
- I cannot believe it. You're still doing the look.

1287
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:40,828
- Oh, wow. Dad, she's still doing the look.
- Look...

1288
01:25:40,953 --> 01:25:43,163
- You know what? - I just... - Mother,
we've had this conversation several times.

1289
01:25:43,288 --> 01:25:45,290
- I don't wanna have it any more.
- I just hope you outgrow it, that's all.

1290
01:25:45,415 --> 01:25:47,417
Yeah, a-and I'd hoped
you'd accept it.

1291
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,838
Mother, being gay
is not a diagnosis.

1292
01:25:50,963 --> 01:25:54,466
It's not a disease I'm going to recover
from or a phase I'm going to outgrow.

1293
01:25:54,591 --> 01:25:56,635
I know what being gay is, okay?

1294
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:00,138
I give to gay causes. I support gay
parades. They even gave me a plaque.

1295
01:26:00,264 --> 01:26:02,641
Yes. So why support them
and not me?

1296
01:26:02,766 --> 01:26:06,144
- Because I'm not their mother.
- Yes, I know this. You're mine.

1297
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,939
So why can't you just say it?
I have a gay daughter.

1298
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:11,859
- I have a gay daughter.
- It's not like I'm asking you to go on Oprah, mother. Just say it to me.

1299
01:26:11,984 --> 01:26:15,988
- Oh, look at this. - I have. - Look at
this evolution coming down the stairs.

1300
01:26:16,113 --> 01:26:17,698
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Ohh.

1301
01:26:17,823 --> 01:26:22,452
Caroline and Heather did my make-up.
Both sides.

1302
01:26:22,578 --> 01:26:26,415
Oh, yeah. Look at that. Well, honey,
let's... Uh, the limousine is waiting for you.

1303
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,917
- Let's go out there, princess... -
Ohh, beauty. - And slip into your...

1304
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:32,004
Carla. Your gentleman caller
just arrived. He's on the porch.

1305
01:26:32,129 --> 01:26:34,840
- Oh, your Prince Charming. Let's go find Prince Charming.
- Ohh... Oh, it's Daniel!

1306
01:26:34,965 --> 01:26:36,842
- We're gonna check on the limo.
- All right.

1307
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:39,678
- I'll put his bike away.
- This earring is driving me crazy.

1308
01:26:41,138 --> 01:26:44,683
I can't take it. I'm not...
I'm never gonna wear it again.

1309
01:26:44,808 --> 01:26:46,935
- Hi.
- Wow.

1310
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,354
You look really handsome.

1311
01:26:49,479 --> 01:26:51,940
Yeah, you look r-really pretty.

1312
01:26:52,065 --> 01:26:55,611
Oh. Did you talk to your dad yet?

1313
01:26:55,736 --> 01:26:59,531
Oh, n... Well, 'cause I... 'cause I
don't... I- I-I don't need my dad any more...

1314
01:26:59,656 --> 01:27:02,784
'cause I...
'cause I have an idea for... for us.

1315
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:05,537
I knew you'd come up
with something.

1316
01:27:05,662 --> 01:27:07,539
- Yeah.
- We're coming, Dad!

1317
01:27:07,664 --> 01:27:12,377
- Okay!
- So deck the halls with boughs of holly

1318
01:27:15,422 --> 01:27:18,467
- 'Tis the season to bejolly
- To bejolly

1319
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:24,723
Yeah, don we now our gay apparel

1320
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:29,228
- It's Christmas time
- Hi.

1321
01:27:29,353 --> 01:27:31,355
- You know my mother Pucky.
- Of course I know Pucky.

1322
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,358
So, how are the plans going
for Caroline's wedding?

1323
01:27:34,483 --> 01:27:36,527
- We're excited.
- What about you, Heather?

1324
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:39,363
- Any young chaps on the horizon for you yet?
- Oh!

1325
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:43,492
You know what? No. You know, the literary
world is just a lot of reclusive writers...

1326
01:27:43,617 --> 01:27:46,620
and, you know,
serial killers, so...

1327
01:27:50,707 --> 01:27:54,044
- Caroline, where's the wedding going to be?
- It's gonna be at St John's Church.

1328
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:56,213
- Oh, right here in Sutter Hills.
- Uh, New Zealand.

1329
01:27:56,338 --> 01:28:00,217
- Hey.
- It's not in New Zealand, Jeff.

1330
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:02,928
It's in Sutter Hills.

1331
01:28:03,053 --> 01:28:05,055
Carla...

1332
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:08,559
I- I-I'm kind of afraid
of your family.

1333
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:12,896
I feel that way too
sometimes, Daniel.

1334
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:14,898
- You do?
- Yeah.

1335
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:17,693
But all you have to do
is be brave...

1336
01:28:17,818 --> 01:28:20,445
and then you could say
anything you want...

1337
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:22,656
'cause you feel more comfortable.

1338
01:28:26,952 --> 01:28:29,830
E- Excuse me, I'll be...
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

1339
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,587
- Here you are, sir.
- Very nice bottle.

1340
01:28:36,712 --> 01:28:39,840
Yes, sir, you picked
a very nice bottle. Green.

1341
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:43,677
So that...
So that'll make me very brave?

1342
01:28:43,802 --> 01:28:46,930
Sir, it's 110 proof.
It'll make you very brave.

1343
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:49,183
- Thank you.
- Thank you, and merry Christmas.

1344
01:28:49,308 --> 01:28:51,185
Yes, it is.

1345
01:28:54,188 --> 01:28:56,064
Thank you, Martin.

1346
01:28:58,525 --> 01:29:00,652
My publishing company
is going to merge next month.

1347
01:29:00,777 --> 01:29:04,490
Ah, Dr Longhurst,
master of the root canal.

1348
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:10,204
- Elizabeth. Elizabeth Russell.
- Mmm.

1349
01:29:10,329 --> 01:29:13,290
That's that young dental hygienist
who married the Tate boy.

1350
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:14,416
- You know, Ridley?
- Radley.

1351
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,418
- Radley.
- I should've married him.

1352
01:29:16,543 --> 01:29:18,420
His father Orson built this club.

1353
01:29:19,796 --> 01:29:22,424
Oh, Carla, did you receive that
Dustin Hoffman book that I sent you?

1354
01:29:22,549 --> 01:29:26,762
Yeah. I'm going to give it
to Daniel for Christmas.

1355
01:29:35,812 --> 01:29:37,689
Don't tell Ernie.

1356
01:29:37,814 --> 01:29:40,025
- I don't know any Ernie.
- Good.

1357
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:43,070
- Merry Christmas.
- It still is.

1358
01:29:45,864 --> 01:29:48,033
Carla, come here.

1359
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:50,744
- Sit down there. This is a surprise.
- Where is... Where is Daniel?

1360
01:29:50,869 --> 01:29:52,955
He's missing everything.

1361
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:57,209
Ladies and gentlemen, everybody,
may I have your attention, please?

1362
01:29:57,334 --> 01:29:59,378
Olive juice.

1363
01:29:59,503 --> 01:30:03,048
- Some months ago...
- What are you saying?

1364
01:30:03,173 --> 01:30:05,843
- Olive juice.
- While I was soliciting petition signatures at a sorority house...

1365
01:30:05,968 --> 01:30:08,053
- Why?
- Because from far away...

1366
01:30:08,178 --> 01:30:10,514
- I had this wonderful...
- it looks like "I love you. "

1367
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,559
That's a very good trick!

1368
01:30:13,684 --> 01:30:17,563
And if I said it was love at first
sight, that would be disingenuous.

1369
01:30:17,688 --> 01:30:20,399
- "Disin... " What?
- Untruthful. - Oh.

1370
01:30:20,524 --> 01:30:24,903
She had just come back from a softball game and
had the worst case of hat hair I've ever seen.

1371
01:30:25,028 --> 01:30:26,905
Je... Oh, my God.

1372
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:29,032
It looked terminal.

1373
01:30:29,158 --> 01:30:31,243
"Hat hair. "

1374
01:30:31,368 --> 01:30:36,748
But Cupid's arrows
overcame her dishevelled coif...

1375
01:30:36,874 --> 01:30:40,252
and I did fall in love with her,
very much in love.

1376
01:30:40,377 --> 01:30:43,255
And next month
she's going to make me...

1377
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:47,301
the happiest man alive
by becoming my wife.

1378
01:30:49,094 --> 01:30:52,139
And now I would like to dance
to our favourite song...

1379
01:30:52,264 --> 01:30:54,141
"Baby, I'm Yours. "

1380
01:30:59,062 --> 01:31:01,857
My favourite song is
"Michelle, My Belle. "

1381
01:31:01,982 --> 01:31:05,110
- What? What did you say?
- Nothing.

1382
01:31:05,235 --> 01:31:10,157
- Baby, I'm yours
- Baby, I'm yours

1383
01:31:10,282 --> 01:31:12,409
- And I'll be yours
- Yours

1384
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:19,500
Until the stars
fall from the sky

1385
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:25,339
Yours until the rivers
all run dry

1386
01:31:25,464 --> 01:31:30,177
In other words, until I die

1387
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:33,180
- Baby, I'm yours
- Hi.

1388
01:31:35,432 --> 01:31:39,603
Uh, I just... C-Caroline and Jeff...

1389
01:31:39,728 --> 01:31:41,980
w- would you mind
j- j-just to sit down for ju...

1390
01:31:42,105 --> 01:31:45,734
Olive juice.

1391
01:31:45,859 --> 01:31:48,570
Could you sit down as well?

1392
01:31:48,695 --> 01:31:50,280
- Just give him a minute.
- He might...

1393
01:31:50,405 --> 01:31:54,910
- All right, let's just see what he has to say.
- Maybe he has a surprise.

1394
01:31:55,035 --> 01:31:57,913
My name is Daniel McMahon...

1395
01:32:00,332 --> 01:32:03,460
and I... I'm in love
with a girl too.

1396
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,344
A- A-A-And she...
she does not have hat hair.

1397
01:32:21,186 --> 01:32:24,356
- That's was a joke, Mom. - He's a stand-up
comic. It was a good joke. - Mmm. Yes.

1398
01:32:24,481 --> 01:32:27,776
Her... Her- Her na...
Her name is Carla Tate...

1399
01:32:30,529 --> 01:32:33,407
and she love... s-s-she loves me too.

1400
01:32:36,702 --> 01:32:39,204
And I have never had that before.

1401
01:32:40,372 --> 01:32:44,209
And my... my dad...

1402
01:32:44,334 --> 01:32:47,212
is... is, uh...
he's gonna send me to Florida.

1403
01:32:49,673 --> 01:32:52,676
And I want her to...
I w-w-want her to come along with me.

1404
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:55,095
Oh! Wow!

1405
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,014
- That is out of the question.
- He's just kidding.

1406
01:32:57,139 --> 01:32:59,183
- That is out... - Please. - Excuse me. Look
what I've done. - He's just kidding, dear.

1407
01:32:59,308 --> 01:33:01,894
He's full of surprises, Mom.

1408
01:33:03,896 --> 01:33:07,357
And we love each other so much...

1409
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:10,194
that last Thanksgiving...

1410
01:33:11,862 --> 01:33:13,530
we did it.

1411
01:33:21,413 --> 01:33:24,374
And it was... it was so beautiful.

1412
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,711
- That is not what... But he's
saying that... - Daddy. - Mark.

1413
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:29,880
- Daddy, please go up there and do
something. - B-But, Mom... - O-O-Okay.

1414
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:33,884
- I'd like to sing a song for her. - That's not what he
was saying... - It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

1415
01:33:34,009 --> 01:33:36,637
And here's our song.

1416
01:33:36,762 --> 01:33:40,724
Seventy-six trombones
led the big parade

1417
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:43,227
No, that's not
what it is, what...

1418
01:33:44,853 --> 01:33:48,357
With 110 cornets close at hand

1419
01:33:48,482 --> 01:33:52,736
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me!

1420
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:56,281
Stop laughing at me!
You stop laughing at me!

1421
01:33:56,406 --> 01:34:00,035
- Honey. Honey. Honey.
- That's not funny, Daniel!

1422
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:04,081
Honey... Baby, please...
Baby. Baby, baby. It's okay.

1423
01:34:04,206 --> 01:34:08,836
- It's all right.
- Stop laughing at me!

1424
01:34:08,961 --> 01:34:12,256
Sir. Sir, if you would
kindly step this way, sir.

1425
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:16,009
Step this way, sir, please.
Uh, everybody dance, please!

1426
01:34:16,134 --> 01:34:18,011
Play something.

1427
01:34:24,601 --> 01:34:27,521
All right, Jeff, get the girls home.
We'll call you later.

1428
01:34:27,646 --> 01:34:30,774
- I hate what he did.
- Calm down. I know.

1429
01:34:30,899 --> 01:34:32,359
- I know, I know, dear.
- Charles!

1430
01:34:32,484 --> 01:34:35,863
- Now, just get in this car, sit down... - Where
the hell is he? - Sit down and relax. Why did...

1431
01:34:35,988 --> 01:34:37,865
- I don't know where Charles is. Is she okay?
- Where is he?

1432
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:40,701
- I think he's probably in the restroom. -
Well... - Gary, did you see our limousine driver?

1433
01:34:40,826 --> 01:34:43,620
Carla, Carla, I'll be right back.
Just sit right there.

1434
01:34:43,745 --> 01:34:46,957
Oh, for God's sake!
Where is that man?

1435
01:34:47,082 --> 01:34:49,459
- Is she all right?
- Yes, she's fine!

1436
01:34:52,588 --> 01:34:55,215
Carla. Carla.

1437
01:34:57,467 --> 01:35:00,846
Why did you do that, Daniel?

1438
01:35:00,971 --> 01:35:05,684
- I'm s... I'm sorry.
- Why did you tell everybody our love secrets?

1439
01:35:05,809 --> 01:35:08,812
- I'm sorry, Car...
- No!

1440
01:35:08,937 --> 01:35:14,193
You made everyone laugh at me!

1441
01:35:14,318 --> 01:35:18,739
I'm sorry, Carla. I never... I don't... I
mean, I don't think everybody laughed at you.

1442
01:35:18,864 --> 01:35:22,409
I don't care if you're sorry,
Daniel!

1443
01:35:22,534 --> 01:35:24,995
God!

1444
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,997
You're stupid!

1445
01:35:27,122 --> 01:35:32,586
What you did was stupid,
and I don't want to ever see you again!

1446
01:35:34,838 --> 01:35:37,049
So? I don't even care!

1447
01:35:37,174 --> 01:35:39,051
I never... I don't care!

1448
01:35:39,176 --> 01:35:42,554
I never... I don...
I don't wanna see you either!

1449
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:44,932
- Shut up! Leave me alone!
- I think you're stupid too!

1450
01:35:45,057 --> 01:35:47,559
- I think that you're really stupid!
- Carla!

1451
01:35:47,684 --> 01:35:50,020
- I want you to leave me alone!
- Carla!

1452
01:35:50,145 --> 01:35:53,106
- Mom, make him leave
me alone. - Here. - Whoa!

1453
01:35:53,232 --> 01:35:55,901
- No, no, no. No, no. - Charles,
get her in the car. - You're stupid!

1454
01:35:56,026 --> 01:35:58,237
- No, I'm not stupid. - I'm not...
I'm not stupid! - Just go in.

1455
01:35:58,362 --> 01:36:01,031
- Gary! Make sure he gets home!
- I'm not... I'm not stupid!

1456
01:36:01,156 --> 01:36:03,242
- Get a cab. Get him home.
- I don't love him.

1457
01:36:03,367 --> 01:36:05,327
- I know.
- You're stupid.

1458
01:36:05,452 --> 01:36:07,830
- Go home, Danny. Just get in.
- Here. Good.

1459
01:36:07,955 --> 01:36:11,875
'Round yon virgin
Mother and child

1460
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,044
- Let's go, Charles.
- We'll be out of here in a minute, Dr Tate.

1461
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:21,134
Holy infant
so tender and mild

1462
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:28,934
Sleep in heavenly peace

1463
01:36:29,059 --> 01:36:32,229
Sleep in heavenly

1464
01:36:32,354 --> 01:36:34,690
- Why did he do it?
- Peace

1465
01:36:34,815 --> 01:36:38,402
Danny had too much to drink and he
didn't know what he was saying, pumpkin.

1466
01:36:38,527 --> 01:36:41,738
He didn't mean to embarrass you.

1467
01:36:41,864 --> 01:36:46,243
Everything is going to be fine.
It's all going to work out in the end.

1468
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:57,546
I don't understand

1469
01:36:57,671 --> 01:37:00,507
How the sun keeps shinin'

1470
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:05,262
And I don't understand

1471
01:37:05,387 --> 01:37:08,765
Why the seasons change

1472
01:37:08,891 --> 01:37:10,767
Oh, he's fine.
Yeah, he's a friend of the band.

1473
01:37:10,893 --> 01:37:14,938
- And I don't have a clue
- Oh, yeah. That's the kid who's leaving.

1474
01:37:15,063 --> 01:37:19,067
What makes the rivers flow

1475
01:37:19,193 --> 01:37:23,780
Loving you is all I know

1476
01:37:26,116 --> 01:37:28,660
I can't tell you why

1477
01:37:28,785 --> 01:37:33,207
The stars come out
in the evenin'

1478
01:37:33,332 --> 01:37:38,253
And I can't tell you
where they go

1479
01:37:38,378 --> 01:37:41,465
When they're gone

1480
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:46,428
And I don't have a clue

1481
01:37:46,553 --> 01:37:50,682
What makes a flower grow

1482
01:37:50,807 --> 01:37:55,312
Loving you is all I know

1483
01:37:57,272 --> 01:38:01,151
I don't know how the world
keeps on spinnin' 'round

1484
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:04,988
I don't know why the sky
don't come fallin'down

1485
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:08,283
I just know that I would die

1486
01:38:08,408 --> 01:38:12,663
Without your touch, oh

1487
01:38:12,788 --> 01:38:16,834
I don't know why the tide
needs to reach the shore

1488
01:38:16,959 --> 01:38:21,839
I just know that I need you
for forevermore

1489
01:38:21,964 --> 01:38:27,010
- Knowin'that I get inside our love
- All aboard!

1490
01:38:29,179 --> 01:38:31,723
I don't understand

1491
01:38:31,849 --> 01:38:35,769
How the sun keeps shinin'

1492
01:38:35,894 --> 01:38:39,690
I don't understand

1493
01:38:39,815 --> 01:38:44,361
Why the seasons change
and change and change

1494
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:48,198
And I don't have a clue

1495
01:38:48,323 --> 01:38:53,370
What
What makes the rivers flow

1496
01:38:53,495 --> 01:38:57,624
Loving you is all I know

1497
01:38:57,749 --> 01:39:04,882
Is all I know, is all I know
Is all I know

1498
01:39:05,007 --> 01:39:11,054
Loving you is all I know

1499
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,432
All right,
let's start the rehearsal.

1500
01:39:13,557 --> 01:39:18,103
The groomsmen over here, and we'll
have the bridesmaids come up and...

1501
01:39:20,856 --> 01:39:24,193
Excuse me, but are they going
to continue to act like clowns?

1502
01:39:24,318 --> 01:39:26,195
Well, they're just having fun.
They're good guys.

1503
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,363
- All right, excuse me.
- Ohh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

1504
01:39:28,489 --> 01:39:31,074
I'm so sorry, but, you know,
Cousin Anne...

1505
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,327
she was not exactly thrilled
with her hotel accommodations.

1506
01:39:33,452 --> 01:39:37,664
- Hi. - Okay. - Not that she has
any idea what a hotel accommo... Oh.

1507
01:39:37,789 --> 01:39:41,251
- I'm sorry, who is... Are you a groomsman?
- No. This is my assistant Mark.

1508
01:39:41,376 --> 01:39:45,130
Okay. Cousin Anne's very happy.
Let's move on.

1509
01:39:45,255 --> 01:39:47,424
- All right. - Let's do move on,
all right? - Excellent. All right.

1510
01:39:47,549 --> 01:39:49,426
- Everybody, we're gonna start with a...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

1511
01:39:49,551 --> 01:39:52,888
Would you mind if I had just a few
minutes alone with my family, please?

1512
01:39:53,013 --> 01:39:55,432
- Fine. - Thank
you. - Okay, listen.

1513
01:39:55,557 --> 01:39:58,435
- I'd just like to say that the only reason
I'm even here... - Oh, Heather. - Huh?

1514
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,605
Is because it's Caroline's dream to have
all of her sisters at her wedding.

1515
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:05,234
But this might be the very last time I
attend a family function without Michelle.

1516
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:07,945
Duly noted. Let's rehearse, okay?
Come on. Let's go. Let's rehearse.

1517
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:11,698
- Yeah, and if Daniel is not here...
- Dad, I mean it.

1518
01:40:11,824 --> 01:40:15,077
- I have no one to dance with, Mom. - You have someone you can
dance with, honey, right here. - We'll talk about this, okay? Shh.

1519
01:40:15,202 --> 01:40:17,830
You can dance with your cousin Theodore.
I'm sure he would love to dance with you.

1520
01:40:17,955 --> 01:40:22,334
You know... Hello! Guys! This... It's, like,
Danny, Michelle... Would you give me a break here?

1521
01:40:22,459 --> 01:40:24,461
It's the middle child's wedding.
You know what I'm saying?

1522
01:40:24,586 --> 01:40:26,630
- The middle child's wedding. I am the middle
child. - Caroline. - Honey. Caroline, honey.

1523
01:40:26,755 --> 01:40:28,340
- Honey, we know that. - My wedd...
No! - No, no, excuse me. - Calm down.

1524
01:40:28,465 --> 01:40:31,969
- I think it's just as important that I have somebody here that I want here. That's all I'm saying.
- All you do... Danny and Michelle...

1525
01:40:32,094 --> 01:40:34,763
- My wedding comes once in a lifetime.
- Listen to me for one minute.

1526
01:40:34,888 --> 01:40:36,431
- Come here. Come here. - This
is ridiculous. - Listen to me.

1527
01:40:36,557 --> 01:40:40,811
- Be quiet! - Please.
Everybody, please. - Shh!

1528
01:40:40,936 --> 01:40:43,647
This is a Tate family wedding.
I'm very proud of that.

1529
01:40:43,772 --> 01:40:45,816
And, Caroline,
I'm very proud of you.

1530
01:40:45,941 --> 01:40:49,528
But we have hundreds of guests
and family who are attending...

1531
01:40:49,653 --> 01:40:53,365
so I think it would behove us
to suppress the minutiae...

1532
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:57,911
long enough to show everybody
how proud we are to be Tate family.

1533
01:40:58,036 --> 01:41:00,998
- Now, let's rehearse.
- Well said. Well said.

1534
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,298
But my favourite actor's Dustin Hoffman. Did... Did
you... Did you ever see that movie, The Graduate?

1535
01:41:09,423 --> 01:41:13,218
Is that the one where, uh, he's in a
dress, or is that the one with the camels?

1536
01:41:13,343 --> 01:41:17,347
- Deming. This station is Deming. Next stop is El Paso.
- And then... And then...

1537
01:41:17,472 --> 01:41:21,268
And then s-she goes off to get, get married
to somebody else, and see... and see...

1538
01:41:21,393 --> 01:41:24,396
Dustin knows
that she still loves him.

1539
01:41:24,521 --> 01:41:26,064
A- A-And...

1540
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:30,110
And then he gets
all confused and, and mixed up...

1541
01:41:30,235 --> 01:41:33,780
and then... and then he goes
and he tries to rescue her.

1542
01:41:35,324 --> 01:41:37,701
All aboard!

1543
01:41:47,252 --> 01:41:50,380
All aboard!

1544
01:41:50,506 --> 01:41:55,010
- Do, do-do-do, do-do do-do, do-do-do-do,
do - O-Okay. Okay, bye! I'll see you later.

1545
01:41:55,135 --> 01:41:57,513
Nice talking to you.

1546
01:42:13,654 --> 01:42:16,532
Uh... I-I-I
was going to Florida...

1547
01:42:16,657 --> 01:42:20,452
and I-I-I changed my mind, and I want...
I wanna go back to San Francisco.

1548
01:42:20,577 --> 01:42:23,288
Do, do-do-do, do-do
do-do, do-do-do-do, do

1549
01:42:23,413 --> 01:42:25,749
You want to exchange
your ticket?

1550
01:42:25,874 --> 01:42:29,211
Yes! Yes, I want...
Um, okay. Okay.

1551
01:42:33,507 --> 01:42:36,176
And here's to you
Mrs Robinson

1552
01:42:36,301 --> 01:42:41,348
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Hey, hey, hey

1553
01:42:41,473 --> 01:42:44,351
- Do Flipper! - God, you're
a freak. - Hey, hey, hey

1554
01:42:45,727 --> 01:42:49,398
- Yea! Yeah! Do more, Heather.
- No.

1555
01:42:49,523 --> 01:42:53,569
I'm not doing any more. Can we just
play, like, another game or something?

1556
01:42:53,694 --> 01:42:56,363
Yeah, but I don't wanna play...

1557
01:42:56,488 --> 01:42:59,533
Pin the Penis
on the Naked Guy again.

1558
01:42:59,658 --> 01:43:02,703
- Yeah, I'll second that.
- Come on, you guys! This is fun.

1559
01:43:02,828 --> 01:43:05,622
I mean, we gotta have fun.
This is my last night single.

1560
01:43:05,747 --> 01:43:08,876
God bless you, please
Mrs Robinson

1561
01:43:09,001 --> 01:43:12,504
Heaven holds a place
for those who pray

1562
01:43:12,629 --> 01:43:16,466
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

1563
01:43:16,592 --> 01:43:20,137
- You go, Carla.
- Okay. Now it's my turn.

1564
01:43:20,262 --> 01:43:22,973
I wish I could
see Daniel again.

1565
01:43:23,098 --> 01:43:25,267
- Oh, Carla, don't be sad.
- Oh, Carla, don't get sad.

1566
01:43:25,392 --> 01:43:29,563
- Come on. You gotta be happy. This is my sisters happy night thing.
- No.

1567
01:43:29,688 --> 01:43:33,775
But I wish I could see him
again just for a little second...

1568
01:43:33,901 --> 01:43:36,904
to tell him
that I don't hate him.

1569
01:43:37,029 --> 01:43:40,449
Where have you gone
Joe DiMaggio

1570
01:43:40,574 --> 01:43:44,203
A nation's turns
its lonely eyes to you

1571
01:43:44,328 --> 01:43:46,413
Whoo-whoo-whoo

1572
01:43:46,538 --> 01:43:49,500
What's that you say
Mrs Robinson

1573
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:53,295
Joltin'Joe has left
and gone away

1574
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:57,049
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

1575
01:44:21,365 --> 01:44:24,493
Hi. You look like you need a ride.
Come on. Dad says it's okay.

1576
01:44:24,618 --> 01:44:26,870
- O-Okay.
- Hi. I'm Jenny.

1577
01:44:26,995 --> 01:44:29,373
- You want a pretzel or a marshmallow?
- Yeah, thank you.

1578
01:44:29,498 --> 01:44:31,875
I'm really hungry.

1579
01:45:42,404 --> 01:45:44,907
Who presents this woman
to be married?

1580
01:45:45,032 --> 01:45:47,034
- We do.
- We do.

1581
01:45:47,159 --> 01:45:50,496
- Please be seated.
- Okay.

1582
01:46:02,508 --> 01:46:05,802
Thanks, Fred!
Thanks for the ride!

1583
01:46:05,928 --> 01:46:09,056
Excuse me. The soup kitchen
is around in the parish hall.

1584
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:11,433
But it won't be open until 5:00.

1585
01:46:11,558 --> 01:46:14,770
But I-I, see, I don't...
I don't want any soup.

1586
01:46:14,895 --> 01:46:17,814
- L-I came to see a girl in the wedding.
- I don't think so.

1587
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:21,109
- But can I... Carla...
- I said I don't think so.

1588
01:46:21,235 --> 01:46:23,612
Okay.

1589
01:46:25,697 --> 01:46:28,867
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my vow.

1590
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:31,745
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my vow.

1591
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:35,123
And with all that I am
and all that I have...

1592
01:46:35,249 --> 01:46:37,960
And with all that I am
and all that I have...

1593
01:46:38,085 --> 01:46:40,546
I honour you
in the name of God.

1594
01:46:41,964 --> 01:46:45,676
I honour you
in the name of God.

1595
01:46:46,677 --> 01:46:50,556
The union of husband
and wife in heart...

1596
01:46:50,681 --> 01:46:52,724
body and mind is...

1597
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:54,560
- Ginger. - What?
- Intended...

1598
01:46:54,685 --> 01:46:56,937
- by God for their mutual joy. - Did you
just throw something at my head? - No.

1599
01:46:57,062 --> 01:47:00,315
And for the health
and-and comfort...

1600
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:02,526
gi... given one another in...

1601
01:47:02,651 --> 01:47:04,611
- prosperity... - Radley, what is
going on? - Someone's throwing...

1602
01:47:04,736 --> 01:47:06,280
Well, what on Earth
is this happening?

1603
01:47:06,405 --> 01:47:09,491
And for the gift
and heritage of children.

1604
01:47:09,616 --> 01:47:12,953
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- They are laughing right now...

1605
01:47:13,078 --> 01:47:14,705
- Please, this is not funny.
- At the wedding.

1606
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:18,834
But to reverently and
deliberately in accordance...

1607
01:47:18,959 --> 01:47:22,588
with the purposes for which
it was instituted by God.

1608
01:47:23,922 --> 01:47:25,591
Danny?

1609
01:47:27,593 --> 01:47:29,720
Daniel.

1610
01:47:31,346 --> 01:47:34,725
- Carla Tate.
- Daniel!

1611
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:37,060
- What?
- Oh, my God, it's Daniel.

1612
01:47:37,186 --> 01:47:38,896
Meet you out front
in the lobby.

1613
01:47:39,021 --> 01:47:42,774
Mark, the homeless boy
is up in the organ balcony.

1614
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:46,987
I'm gonna go back down.

1615
01:47:47,821 --> 01:47:50,282
- What are they up to?
- Okay.

1616
01:47:53,035 --> 01:47:55,329
- Don't make trouble.
- Whoa!

1617
01:48:04,338 --> 01:48:08,258
- No. Is he all right?
- Daniel? Are you okay?

1618
01:48:08,383 --> 01:48:10,636
I think...
He seems to be okay.

1619
01:48:10,761 --> 01:48:14,515
I don't wanna be apart
ever again, Daniel.

1620
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,975
- Yeah, never again.
- I love you.

1621
01:48:18,936 --> 01:48:20,229
Carla, Carla.

1622
01:48:20,354 --> 01:48:22,981
I wa-wa-want to get married.

1623
01:48:23,106 --> 01:48:26,318
I want... I want to spend... I want
to spend the rest of my life with you.

1624
01:48:26,443 --> 01:48:29,196
You know, I thought our worst problem
was gonna be parking.

1625
01:48:30,656 --> 01:48:33,408
Carla Tate, will you marry me?

1626
01:48:35,327 --> 01:48:37,871
Did he say marry her?

1627
01:48:38,664 --> 01:48:41,333
- Just call up...
- Winnie, not right now!

1628
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:44,837
Yes, I will, Daniel McMahon.

1629
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:59,351
Daniel, stand right here.

1630
01:48:59,476 --> 01:49:02,771
- Okay.
- And a little bit quiet.

1631
01:49:02,896 --> 01:49:06,692
- Just be quiet.
- This is good. It's like Where's Waldo?

1632
01:49:06,817 --> 01:49:11,530
E- Excuse me, um... Mother,
could you say something, please?

1633
01:49:12,531 --> 01:49:14,408
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm...
I'm so terribly sorry...

1634
01:49:14,533 --> 01:49:18,704
for this slight inconvenience, but
you know how children will be sometimes.

1635
01:49:18,829 --> 01:49:22,291
In any event, I think we should proceed
with our very lovely ceremony...

1636
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:24,793
and Carla will retire
as a bridesmaid...

1637
01:49:24,918 --> 01:49:30,632
and she will come and join us with
Daniel, and we will finalize these vows.

1638
01:49:30,757 --> 01:49:34,970
- Well done.
- Thank you. You have been fabulous!

1639
01:49:35,095 --> 01:49:36,471
Love is in the air.

1640
01:50:00,913 --> 01:50:04,708
Ladies and gentlemen, as
best man of these festivities...

1641
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:08,670
it is my one duty of the evening
to make a toast.

1642
01:50:08,795 --> 01:50:10,756
To the bride and groom!

1643
01:50:58,345 --> 01:51:00,472
Go along. It's all right.
Have a good time, all right?

1644
01:51:00,597 --> 01:51:02,850
- Elizabeth, it should have been filmed for a TV special.
- Hi!

1645
01:51:02,975 --> 01:51:06,895
- And that boy jumping off the balcony!
- Oh, wasn't that... Well, well, we didn't exactly plan that.

1646
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:09,731
- We're gonna be calling you Granny soon.
- Well, I hope so. Oh, what's the matter?

1647
01:51:09,857 --> 01:51:11,191
She broke her shoe.
I can't take her anywhere.

1648
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,484
It's all right.

1649
01:51:12,609 --> 01:51:14,528
- Mom?
- Yes?

1650
01:51:14,653 --> 01:51:17,823
- Is it time to plan another wedding?
- Radley!

1651
01:51:20,951 --> 01:51:24,329
- Uh, I don't think you need...
- I know that you don't like Daniel now...

1652
01:51:24,454 --> 01:51:26,707
but in time...

1653
01:51:26,832 --> 01:51:31,128
Oh! Everything's perfect,
and your daughters are so beautiful.

1654
01:51:31,253 --> 01:51:33,797
- I know they are beautiful, Mary.
- But don't you have a son?

1655
01:51:33,922 --> 01:51:36,175
No, no.
Cousin Vivian has a son.

1656
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,802
- Oh! Thank you.
- Vivian. Yes. That's very... Okay.

1657
01:51:38,927 --> 01:51:40,053
- Mom.
- What, honey?

1658
01:51:40,179 --> 01:51:44,183
- You do like him?
- Oh, I like him. It's just I don't know if you're ready...

1659
01:51:44,308 --> 01:51:47,978
- Hi, Radley. - Did you think so? -
You don't think I'm ready to be married?

1660
01:51:48,103 --> 01:51:52,274
Oh, Carla.
Will you please listen to me?

1661
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:54,276
Please listen
to what I'm saying.

1662
01:51:54,401 --> 01:51:58,071
When you think you're in love, your eyes
are closed to all logic and reason.

1663
01:51:58,197 --> 01:52:03,118
- It's not the time to make a big decision.
- No, but my eyes are not closed, Mother!

1664
01:52:04,286 --> 01:52:05,829
Dear, Carla,
we can have this discussion...

1665
01:52:05,954 --> 01:52:08,248
without you getting upset
in front of everybody, Carla.

1666
01:52:08,373 --> 01:52:12,085
- My eyes are not closed, Mother!
- Please, Carla.

1667
01:52:13,462 --> 01:52:15,756
- Carla!
- Is everything all right?

1668
01:52:15,881 --> 01:52:18,383
Just... Oh! Wh...
Are you all right?

1669
01:52:18,509 --> 01:52:20,928
No, it's fine.

1670
01:52:22,054 --> 01:52:26,433
Carla, wait a minute! Wait!

1671
01:52:26,558 --> 01:52:28,936
Carla! Wait!

1672
01:52:29,061 --> 01:52:31,480
My God, this looks bad.
I better go tell the girls.

1673
01:52:31,605 --> 01:52:34,399
Carla, stop it! Stop! Carla!

1674
01:52:34,525 --> 01:52:36,902
Oh, my God.

1675
01:52:37,027 --> 01:52:40,155
Carla, just wait a second.
I just want you to understand!

1676
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,282
- Carla, listen to me. Listen.
- What? What?

1677
01:52:42,407 --> 01:52:46,036
It's not that I don't like Danny. It has
nothing to do with whether I like Danny or not!

1678
01:52:46,161 --> 01:52:48,038
- Yes, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

1679
01:52:48,163 --> 01:52:51,458
- What's wrong with him, Mother?
- Nothing is wrong with him, Carla.

1680
01:52:51,583 --> 01:52:56,171
He's fine. He's perfectly fine.
I'm just asking for you to wait.

1681
01:52:56,296 --> 01:52:59,716
Danny's the first boy you've met,
and I think you can do better!

1682
01:52:59,842 --> 01:53:03,971
No, but I can't do better
because I'm not better.

1683
01:53:04,096 --> 01:53:07,015
- You're better. You're better.
- Stop touching me!

1684
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:09,309
- You're better!
- I'm not a baby!

1685
01:53:09,434 --> 01:53:11,353
No, I'm not better.

1686
01:53:11,478 --> 01:53:15,232
I'm just me, Mom.
Can't you see me?

1687
01:53:15,357 --> 01:53:19,278
- I just...
- You never look at me!

1688
01:53:19,403 --> 01:53:21,780
And no matter
how long I wait...

1689
01:53:21,905 --> 01:53:26,785
I can't be a painter,
and I can't play tennis.

1690
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:29,496
- And I'm not an artist.
- Okay, but I...

1691
01:53:29,621 --> 01:53:31,456
But I know how to do some things.

1692
01:53:31,582 --> 01:53:34,835
- Yes. Yes.
- And I can love.

1693
01:53:37,379 --> 01:53:42,176
And I love Daniel,
and he loves me very much.

1694
01:53:42,301 --> 01:53:45,262
I know he does,
but, Carla, I just...

1695
01:53:45,387 --> 01:53:47,514
don't think that
he can take care of you!

1696
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:50,642
He can barely take care
of himself.

1697
01:53:50,767 --> 01:53:53,353
We can take care
of each other!

1698
01:53:53,479 --> 01:53:55,772
We don't need you, Mother!

1699
01:53:55,898 --> 01:53:59,610
But don't worry.
You don't have to come to my wedding.

1700
01:53:59,735 --> 01:54:04,114
I'll do my own wedding. I hated
everything you did for Caroline's wedding.

1701
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:05,240
Okay.

1702
01:54:05,365 --> 01:54:09,286
I hated the dumb hats
and these dumb shoes...

1703
01:54:09,411 --> 01:54:12,247
and your big, ugly centrepieces.

1704
01:54:12,372 --> 01:54:15,375
The only thing I like is this dress.

1705
01:54:15,501 --> 01:54:17,377
- This is pretty.
- Okay.

1706
01:54:17,503 --> 01:54:20,964
I'm gonna keep it.

1707
01:54:21,089 --> 01:54:24,968
- Oh, my God! Come back inside, dear, please.
- No!

1708
01:54:25,093 --> 01:54:27,679
- I'm gonna do my wedding all by myself.
- Please, Carla.

1709
01:54:27,804 --> 01:54:31,642
And if you don't like Daniel,
I don't care. Don't come.

1710
01:54:31,767 --> 01:54:34,603
Because Daniel
will be there for sure.

1711
01:54:34,728 --> 01:54:37,815
- I'm going home, Mother.
- Carla, come back!

1712
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:40,442
- No!
- Please!

1713
01:54:40,567 --> 01:54:42,736
Ohh! Oh, C...

1714
01:54:42,861 --> 01:54:45,656
But, Carla... Carla!

1715
01:54:54,414 --> 01:54:59,211
Y- Your mom's not gonna
help throw our wedding?

1716
01:54:59,336 --> 01:55:01,255
- No.
- Are you sure?

1717
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:04,800
'Cause she... she throws
a really nice wedding.

1718
01:55:04,925 --> 01:55:07,427
Yes, I'm very sure.

1719
01:55:07,553 --> 01:55:11,473
She's not planning the wedding
because we are.

1720
01:55:11,598 --> 01:55:14,309
Ow! Oh, you almost got me.

1721
01:55:18,689 --> 01:55:23,735
- Please come to our wedding on February 14 at St Francis Church.
- Heather?

1722
01:55:23,861 --> 01:55:26,989
Guess what. Carla's
getting married this weekend.

1723
01:55:27,114 --> 01:55:32,953
The bridesmaids are going to be you,
Heather and Rachel from school.

1724
01:55:33,078 --> 01:55:35,289
Yes, you plan it.
I will chip in.

1725
01:55:35,414 --> 01:55:38,876
And some other school friends
are coming too.

1726
01:55:39,001 --> 01:55:43,338
Oh, tell Carla I said thank you
so much for including Michelle.

1727
01:55:43,463 --> 01:55:45,340
But be on time.

1728
01:55:45,465 --> 01:55:48,886
Daniel made a special
arrangement with the church...

1729
01:55:49,011 --> 01:55:51,847
and we're going to be married...

1730
01:55:51,972 --> 01:55:55,267
in between another wedding
and a funeral.

1731
01:55:59,354 --> 01:56:03,317
- It's almost time.
- Uh, yes. Yes, Winnie.

1732
01:56:03,442 --> 01:56:06,320
- There's your suit, Dr Tate. - Thank
you. Thank you. - It's been pressed.

1733
01:56:06,445 --> 01:56:08,489
- See you at the church.
- Yes.

1734
01:56:08,614 --> 01:56:10,699
Where were you this morning?

1735
01:56:10,824 --> 01:56:16,538
Carla asked me to talk to Danny
about responsibilities, about bravery.

1736
01:56:18,624 --> 01:56:21,585
- I'm going to that wedding, Elizabeth.
- Mm-hmm.

1737
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:24,963
I'm gonna go
to that wedding.

1738
01:56:25,088 --> 01:56:27,925
Carla refuses to let me pay for
the wedding, but she does want me...

1739
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:32,221
to walk her down the aisle,
and I'm gonna walk her down the aisle.

1740
01:56:37,935 --> 01:56:41,772
When you reach a certain age and
you're not talking to your children...

1741
01:56:41,897 --> 01:56:45,108
I think you're missing
a very important part of the journey.

1742
01:56:49,613 --> 01:56:53,242
You better get going.
You're going to be late.

1743
01:57:30,696 --> 01:57:33,490
- Hi!
- Watch your step.

1744
01:57:41,748 --> 01:57:44,710
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

1745
01:57:44,835 --> 01:57:48,714
I'm so proud of you.
I love you.

1746
01:57:48,839 --> 01:57:51,675
That's the mother,
the boyfriend...

1747
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,178
and the baker, Danny's boss.

1748
01:57:54,303 --> 01:57:57,931
That's the housekeeper
and the son-in-law.

1749
01:58:03,228 --> 01:58:06,440
At last

1750
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:13,530
My love has come along

1751
01:58:16,325 --> 01:58:19,786
My lonely days are over

1752
01:58:24,166 --> 01:58:27,169
- Life is but a song
- I think your boy's gonna be a great baker.

1753
01:58:31,465 --> 01:58:33,342
Come on, come on!

1754
01:59:07,793 --> 01:59:10,921
- Who gives the...
- Will you turn that down?

1755
01:59:14,925 --> 01:59:18,011
Who gives their blessing
that this woman be wed?

1756
01:59:18,136 --> 01:59:19,888
I do.

1757
01:59:25,269 --> 01:59:27,187
You are beautiful.

1758
01:59:35,904 --> 01:59:38,782
Please be seated.

1759
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:44,204
- Do you, Daniel McMahon, take...
- Oh... Uh... See, 'cause... 'cause...

1760
01:59:44,329 --> 01:59:47,583
Actually, Carla and I, we're gonna...
we're gonna do our own vows.

1761
01:59:47,708 --> 01:59:49,459
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1762
01:59:49,585 --> 01:59:53,213
- You said you didn't want to do that.
- Yeah, but that was before...

1763
01:59:53,338 --> 01:59:55,215
w- when we didn't make it up yet.

1764
01:59:55,340 --> 02:00:00,762
And we came up with our own vows now,
at the last minute.

1765
02:00:01,722 --> 02:00:06,435
Okay... Okay, you... We... We say our vows,
and then you say your vows.

1766
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:09,688
But we'll still pay you
if you don't wanna do your...

1767
02:00:09,813 --> 02:00:13,984
Please, just do whatever's
in your hearts.

1768
02:00:15,110 --> 02:00:18,155
Okay. Carla Tate?

1769
02:00:20,449 --> 02:00:23,869
I love you very much...

1770
02:00:23,994 --> 02:00:26,997
and I wanna make you happy.

1771
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:32,586
And, uh, I, I take you
as my wife...

1772
02:00:32,711 --> 02:00:37,466
forever and forever
and forever.

1773
02:00:41,595 --> 02:00:43,639
And then it... it's my turn.

1774
02:00:43,764 --> 02:00:46,141
So...

1775
02:00:47,559 --> 02:00:51,396
Daniel... Daniel McMahon...

1776
02:00:51,522 --> 02:00:53,941
I love you very much...

1777
02:00:54,066 --> 02:00:57,528
and I want to make you happy...

1778
02:00:57,653 --> 02:01:01,615
and I take you as my wife...

1779
02:01:03,242 --> 02:01:05,619
That's all right.
Just try it again.

1780
02:01:05,744 --> 02:01:09,748
That doesn't matter.
It... It doesn't matter.

1781
02:01:12,668 --> 02:01:16,547
I just wanted to say...

1782
02:01:16,672 --> 02:01:20,717
that I love you very much...

1783
02:01:20,843 --> 02:01:23,929
and I wanted
to let everybody know...

1784
02:01:24,054 --> 02:01:26,932
and I take you
as my husband...

1785
02:01:27,057 --> 02:01:29,393
for the rest of my life.

1786
02:01:30,519 --> 02:01:32,896
That's all.

1787
02:01:35,983 --> 02:01:40,195
Oh, uh, uh... Just wait... One... One
moment. We have to do the rings. The rings.

1788
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:43,323
- Danny.
- Now, please take this ring.

1789
02:01:43,448 --> 02:01:46,910
Okay, w-with this ring,
I give you my love...

1790
02:01:47,035 --> 02:01:51,081
and... and I...
my promise and my, my joy...

1791
02:01:51,206 --> 02:01:55,294
that for wherever you are,
I will always love you.

1792
02:01:55,419 --> 02:01:58,672
I feel exactly the same way.

1793
02:01:58,797 --> 02:02:03,051
Oh, wait. Just one more.
I'm sorry. One more moment.

1794
02:02:04,178 --> 02:02:07,055
And now, by the power
vested in me...

1795
02:02:07,181 --> 02:02:09,391
Here it comes.

1796
02:02:09,516 --> 02:02:12,436
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1797
02:02:14,104 --> 02:02:16,607
Go in peace.

1798
02:02:16,732 --> 02:02:19,485
Now you may do it.

1799
02:02:19,610 --> 02:02:22,154
Now you can kiss your bride.

1800
02:02:28,452 --> 02:02:31,288
Please join me in greeting
Mr and Mrs Daniel McMahon.

1801
02:02:31,413 --> 02:02:33,832
Yea!

1802
02:02:42,049 --> 02:02:44,426
- Thanks, Dad.
- Love you.

1803
02:02:48,514 --> 02:02:50,891
Hi!

1804
02:03:04,029 --> 02:03:07,032
Oh, my Carla.

1805
02:03:07,157 --> 02:03:10,661
Oh. Oh.

1806
02:03:14,414 --> 02:03:16,083
Oh, Carla.

1807
02:03:17,417 --> 02:03:19,545
I want you to meet my husband.

1808
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:26,760
- Hi.
- I just would love to welcome you to the family.

1809
02:03:26,885 --> 02:03:29,513
Thank you.

1810
02:03:30,556 --> 02:03:33,475
Daniel... Oh!
That's very, very sweet.

1811
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:35,310
- Thank you, Mom.
- Yes.

1812
02:03:42,985 --> 02:03:44,945
- It was such a beautiful wedding.
- Well, that's very...

1813
02:03:45,070 --> 02:03:47,364
That's okay. Don't worry about it.
That's absolutely fine.

1814
02:03:47,489 --> 02:03:52,077
- Bye, Caroline. -
Bye, sweetie. - Bye!

1815
02:03:52,202 --> 02:03:55,330
- Oh, congratulations.
- Bye!

1816
02:03:55,455 --> 02:03:57,332
- Look at her.
- It's time to meet Michelle.

1817
02:03:57,457 --> 02:03:59,168
- Heather would like you to meet Michelle.
- Where?

1818
02:03:59,293 --> 02:04:01,795
- Where is she?
- Okay, okay, okay.

1819
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,463
- Mother?
- Michelle.

1820
02:04:03,589 --> 02:04:04,798
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Mrs Tate.

1821
02:04:04,923 --> 02:04:09,428
- I've heard so much about you.
- Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

1822
02:04:09,553 --> 02:04:13,056
Ow. Honey,
I have birdseed in my eye.

1823
02:04:14,766 --> 02:04:16,226
Thank you so much.

1824
02:04:17,269 --> 02:04:20,272
W- Wait! Everyone...
Everybody, just...

1825
02:04:20,397 --> 02:04:23,150
J- Just... Wait
for a second, okay? Wait.

1826
02:04:23,275 --> 02:04:26,904
What are we waiting for, Daniel?

1827
02:04:27,821 --> 02:04:31,200
- What's going on?
- No, just wait one second, okay?

1828
02:04:31,325 --> 02:04:33,577
Wait.

1829
02:04:39,958 --> 02:04:42,252
Carla, look.

1830
02:04:50,093 --> 02:04:55,182
- Oh, wow!
- This is my present for my bride.

1831
02:04:55,307 --> 02:04:58,393
- Thank you!
- This is my present for my bride!

1832
02:05:17,204 --> 02:05:22,292
Look, Danny.
Walkin' Wally is walking for us!

1833
02:05:26,088 --> 02:05:30,384
At last

1834
02:05:32,219 --> 02:05:37,599
My love has come along

1835
02:05:37,724 --> 02:05:41,145
- Platoon, halt!
- Oh, my God. L-It's Joseph.

1836
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:43,981
- My lonely days
- Eyes right!

1837
02:05:44,106 --> 02:05:47,776
Congratulations, Carla and Danny!

1838
02:05:49,987 --> 02:05:51,864
- And life is like
- Yea!

1839
02:05:51,989 --> 02:05:55,450
- A song - Ready,
front! - Bye, pumpkin!

1840
02:05:55,576 --> 02:05:57,161
Bye, Mom!

1841
02:05:59,413 --> 02:06:03,792
- Bye! - At last - Don't
worry, Mom. Everything's fine.

1842
02:06:03,917 --> 02:06:06,295
Olive juice.

1843
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:09,673
For you are mine

1844
02:06:09,798 --> 02:06:14,428
At last

1845
02:06:18,765 --> 02:06:21,310
You are mine

1846
02:06:21,435 --> 02:06:24,396
At last

1847
02:06:26,648 --> 02:06:30,694
You are mine

1848
02:06:30,819 --> 02:06:34,031
At last

1849
02:06:52,925 --> 02:06:56,970
When superstars and cannonballs
are running through your head

1850
02:06:57,095 --> 02:07:01,183
And television freaks show cops
and robbers everywhere

1851
02:07:01,308 --> 02:07:05,270
Animals and children tell the truth
They never lie

1852
02:07:05,395 --> 02:07:09,733
Which one is more human
There's a thought, now you decide

1853
02:07:09,858 --> 02:07:14,655
Compassion in thejungle
Compassion in your head

1854
02:07:18,075 --> 02:07:23,247
Would you like to make a run for it
Would you like to take my hand

1855
02:07:23,372 --> 02:07:25,082
Yeah, yeah

1856
02:07:25,207 --> 02:07:29,169
- 'Cause I want to live
- Like animals

1857
02:07:29,294 --> 02:07:33,382
- Careless and free
- Like animals

1858
02:07:33,507 --> 02:07:38,178
I want to live
I want to run through thejungle

1859
02:07:38,303 --> 02:07:43,851
The wind in my hair

1860
02:07:45,727 --> 02:07:49,648
Ohh, ohh

1861
02:07:49,773 --> 02:07:53,986
- See, I want to live
- Like animals

1862
02:07:54,111 --> 02:07:58,407
- And I want to live
- Like animals

1863
02:07:58,532 --> 02:08:02,619
- Ohh, ohh
- Like animals

1864
02:08:02,744 --> 02:08:07,040
- Ohh, ohh
- Like animals

1865
02:08:07,166 --> 02:08:11,545
- Oh, I'm feelin'
- Like animals

1866
02:08:12,671 --> 02:08:15,799
Like animals

1867
02:08:16,925 --> 02:08:19,136
Like animals

1868
02:08:25,392 --> 02:08:28,604
You're gonna love me

1869
02:08:28,729 --> 02:08:32,858
Like nobody's loved me

1870
02:08:32,983 --> 02:08:37,279
Come rain or come shine

1871
02:08:39,114 --> 02:08:42,409
Happy together

1872
02:08:42,534 --> 02:08:45,078
Unhappy together

1873
02:08:45,204 --> 02:08:48,749
And won't it be fine

1874
02:08:52,211 --> 02:08:57,090
Days may be cloudy or sunny

1875
02:08:58,842 --> 02:09:03,972
We're in or we're out of the money

1876
02:09:05,682 --> 02:09:10,020
But I'm with you always

1877
02:09:10,145 --> 02:09:15,984
I'm with you rain or shine

1878
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:23,367
Rain or shine
