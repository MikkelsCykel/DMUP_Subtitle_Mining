(Rattling)

2
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,083
Have a seat.

3
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,265
I want you to listen very carefully,
Mrs. Potenza, all right?

4
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,364
You have the right
to remain silent.

5
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,876
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

6
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,742
You have the right
to an attorney...

7
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,316
and have the attorney
present during questioning.

8
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,113
If you so desire
and cannot afford one,

9
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,155
an attorney will be provided
for you without charge.

10
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,951
Do you understand each of these rights?

11
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,025
Yes.

12
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,095
Do you wish to give up your
right to remain silent?

13
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,960
Yes, I do.

14
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,228
Do you wish to give up
your right to speak with an attorney?

15
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,395
Yes. I don't need
to speak with an attorney.

16
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,632
I just want
to tell the truth.

17
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:55,614
It all started about three weeks ago.
My husband's house.

18
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,370
- (Mrs. Potenza)
- Tony and I had been fiighting.
I'm not gonna lie about that.

19
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,672
There were problems
in our marriage...

20
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,372
and we both were at fault.

21
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:33,384
He was going out.
He was meeting his girlfriend.

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:38,219
(Crying)
And we both knew that I knew.

23
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,062
- It seemed like all we did
was hurt each other.
- (Sighs)

24
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,625
And that night it was especially bad
because Tony was drinking.

25
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,901
And when he drank,
he could be very mean.

26
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,502
Tony, go easy tonight,
please.

27
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,364
You know, I'd like
to get some someday.

28
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,368
Doesn't have to be today,
but, you know, someday...

29
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,995
if it's not
too much trouble.

30
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,678
So that night I decided...

31
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,214
if I couldn't make him
stop lying to me,

32
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,217
at least I'd stop
lying to him.

33
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,070
Is something wrong?

34
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,663
Come on. Sit down.

35
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,412
This is killing me.
I can't keep going on like this.

36
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,641
Leave him.

37
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,014
I can't.

38
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,553
I'll take care of you.

39
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,453
(Sighs)

40
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,220
It's more complicated
than that.

41
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:25,730
Despite everything,
Tony does love me.

42
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,733
He's got a funny way
of showing it.

43
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:33,101
I didn't see you saying that
when he was helping you fnd
investors for the restaurant...

44
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,970
or when he loaned
your ex-wife money.

45
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,976
That was way below the belt.

46
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,647
jake...

47
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,654
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,853
I can't play second best forever.
It's not my style.

49
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,557
That's why this
has gotta be the last time.

50
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,227
I don't want to hurt you,
and I don't want to hurt Tony.

51
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:10,106
- (Door Opening)
- I love you. What am I
supposed to do about it?

52
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,865
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,176
You're sorry?

54
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,179
We're both gonna
have to try here...

55
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,879
and I'm willing to go fiirst.

56
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:59,686
What exactly is it
that you want me to do?

57
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,962
Be nice.

58
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,625
Okay, I will.

59
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,295
I'll try.

60
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,966
And if I'm nice, will you
do something for me?

61
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,681
- (Sighs)
- Stop drinking, Tony.

62
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,048
It scares me,
and it's not good for you.

63
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,485
I know.

64
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,991
Will you try?

65
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:41,528
Yes... I will.
I'll try.

66
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,269
(Indistinct Whisper)

67
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,499
Now will you do
one more thing for me?

68
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:52,704
Will you take me on a trip?
just me and you alone, away.

69
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,246
josie, the timing
is terrible.

70
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,748
It's impossible right now.
The new pilots are shit.

71
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,785
The fall season is upside down, sideways.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

72
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,823
Please. Please.

73
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,038
- All right.
- Thank you.

74
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,689
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you, baby.

75
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,861
(Chattering)

76
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,864
- Howdy.
- Hi.

77
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,026
- Where you headed?
- Merv Gardener's place, Norman's Pond.

78
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,502
- You know where that is?
- Yep. Get in.

79
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,192
(Driver)
You got a key to that gate?

80
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,765
Merv didn't mention
anything about it.

81
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,301
That's a problem.

82
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,667
(Tony Sighing)
I can't believe this.

83
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,003
Why didn't you fnd out
we needed a key to the gate?

84
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,010
It's not like you have anything
to do with your time but go shopping.

85
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,673
This whole trip was your idea.
It's your responsibility.
Can't you do anything right?

86
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,945
Tony, we just got here.
Please don't ruin our vacation.

87

88
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,066

(Teapot Whistling)

94
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,553
So what do they want to do now?
Shuffie the whole schedule?

95
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,529
No, goddamn it!
Goddamn it, no!

96
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,099
That is exactly
the wrong thing to do.

97
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,498
Bullshit!
Absolutely not!

98
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,037
Well, look, I'll tell you
what you can do.

99
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,506
You can send the damn plane.
How about that?

100
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,045
All right, I understand.
Yes. What about Arnie?

101
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,047
He's in New York. Great.
Oh, what about Frank?

102
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,345
All right, listen, why don't you
give me an hour and then call me back?

103
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,014
All right?
Let me sort this out.

104
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,522
Thanks.

105
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,473
Why don't you just go?

106
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,874
- It's the best thing for both of us.
- What about you?

107
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,151
I'm gonna stay.

00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,348
To a guy who runs off and leaves you
in the middle of nowhere.

160
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,010
He had a very important
business meeting.

161
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,213
What could be
more important than you?

162
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,449
(Laughs)

163
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,290
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

164
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,387
Okay.

165
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,170

[Skipped item nr. 166]

167
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,678
* The look on your face
tells me where you've been *

168
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,219
*And every time you walk
out of that door *

169
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:19,229
*I act a fool
to let you back in *

170
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,926
- * You're not the only one paying rent *
- (Laughs)

171
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,527
*Before I get burned
you need to understand *

172
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,072
* There'll be some pain *

173
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,233
*Some shame *

174
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,583
- What's wrong?
- That was a mistake.

175
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:50,128
It went too far. Dinner's my limit,
just like I said.

176
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,396
You want
to tell me why?

177
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,935
I think I've told you
several times now.

178
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,202
Would you like
something else?

179
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,437
Uh, you...

180
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,810
No.
(Mutters)

181
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:14,818
You know, really, you're
better off anyway. I'm pretty messed up.

182
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,651
My father used to say, when a woman
doesn't want to make love to you,

183
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,817
they usually tell you the story
of their life, so why don't you?

184
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,454
- I'll pass.
- No, I mean it.

185
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,260
Tell me, you know.

186
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,597
How long
you been married?

187
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,602
Seven years.

188
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,831
Is he rich?

189
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,101
Yeah.

190
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,541
How'd I guess?

191
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,842
He must've met you
when you were a baby.

192
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,314
Actually, I was 1 7.

193
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,510
- Hmm.
- A runaway, high school dropout.

194
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,646
I was lonely,
scared, dead broke.

195
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,590
- Out there on the edge, you know?
- Yeah.

196
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,594
I got a job in a grocery store,
working as a cashier.

197
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,154
Men were always coming in,
trying to pick me up, and I guess...

198
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,963
I didn't have a very high
opinion of myself.

199
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,506
- You know what I'm saying?
- Little bit.

200
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,939
So one night
Tony came in, and...

201
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,604
to me he looked like a god
in a thousand-dollar suit.

202
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,443
Sweet.

203
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,882
And on our frst date,
he asked me to marry him. I said yes.

204
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,979
- Uh-huh, a regular fucking fairy tale.
(Laughs)

205
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,789
The prince loved you, and,
well, you loved his money.

206
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,289
No, really, that's not what happened.
I loved Tony...

207
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,961
and I still do...
Iove my husband.

208
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,802
You know, for some reason,
I think you're bullshitting me.

209
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,344
Okay? Why don't you
just tell me the truth?

210
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,347
Y-You used him, and
now you're sick of him.

211
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,417
Why be so greedy?

212
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:57,853
Why don't you just, uh, divorce
his ass and collect half the money?

213
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,220
No, I can't do that.
I signed this paper...

214
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,520
that said if I leave him,
I get nothing.

215
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,858
See? He's
a real smart guy.

216
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,727
You know, excuse me
for saying so,

217
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,496
but he didn't even trust you
when he married you.

218
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,902
If someone made me
sign a piece of paper,

219
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,272
that would piss me off.

220
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:24,213
And I would really,
really hate them for that.

221
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,183
You gotta hate him.

222
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,552
You gotta really, really
hate him, don't you?

223
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,024
You do hate him, don't you?

224
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,265
Sometimes I do.

225
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,572
Sometimes... I wish he...

226
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,044
Sometimes, what?

227
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,377
(Whispering)
I wish he were dead.

228
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:10,360
Look, let's say
you could have that, okay?

229
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:14,125
Let's say Tony
was out in the car one day,

230
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,565
goes off to work and
he just never comes home.

231
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,435
And there you are, poor
littleJosie, the widow.

232
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,068
A certain period of time goes by.
Nobody blames you...

233
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,171
because you're young,
you're beautiful.

234
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,978
Tony was a schmuck
to begin with.

235
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,714
You get the house,
you get the cash.

236
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,485
I mean, baby,
you have it all.

237
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,117
Perfect solution.

238
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,628
I'll do it.

239
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,733
Do what?

240
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,804
I'll kill him.

241
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,872
Kill Tony?

242
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,238
Oh, no!

243
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,712
No! No!
You're joking, right?

244
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,339
What if I was serious?

245
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,250
Uh-uh, no. Mm-mm.
I've had too much to drink.

246
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:13,415
Wait a minute. Wh-Wh-Whoa.
Don't go. We're just talking.

247
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,526
Wait a minute, whoa.
Where you gonna go?

248
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,065
- I'm gonna call a cab.
- There's no cabs
this time of night, okay?

249
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,364
I brought you, I'll take you home.
just come on, let's go.

250
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,835
(Laughs)
You know, I thought we were friends.

251
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,604
We're friends, right?
You like me?

252
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,044
- Look at me.
- Don't touch me, okay?

253
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,048
- Don't touch you?
- No.

254
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,846
(Sighs)

255
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,013
You know...

256
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,183
the things you want most
you pretend you don't want,

257
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,126
and you should really
get over that.

258
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,893
I'll tell you what. I haven't
played a game since I was a little kid.

259
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,401
Ever drive
by the moonlight?

260
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,098
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

261
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,971
- We're driving in the dark.
- No, uh-uh. Turn the lights back on.

262
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,273
- No. No!
- Let me out! I want to get out!

263
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,145
- No! No! No!
- Sit back and enjoy.

264
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,781
- Turn the lights back on!
Turn the lights on!
- No, no! Come on!

265
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,120
- Oh, my God!
- Scared now, baby?

266
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,126
- Yes! Yes!
- Huh?

267
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,220
- (Screaming Continues)
- Isn't this fun?

268
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,033
- Stop it! No!
- Come on!

269
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,197
No! Stop!

270
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,743
- Slow down! Oh, my God!
- (Laughing)

271
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,745
- Hold on! Whoa!
- (Screaming)

272
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,752
(Grunting, Groaning)

273
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,914
(Laughing)
Goddamn, I'm havin' fun, Josie!

274
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,754
- Stop! Stop!
- Oh, shut up!

275
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,821
(Screaming Continues)

276
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,434
(Screaming Continues)

277

(Laughing)

278
00:25:55,954 --> 00:26:00,050
- The gate up there! Stop!
- We're going right through it.

279
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,720
(Screaming Continues)

280
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,990
Lights out.

281
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,972
- Oh!
- No! No!

282
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,669
- Nice catch, huh? I know what you want.
- Get off of me!

283
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,679
- You wanna go inside the cabin?
You know you want it, baby!
- Get off of me!

284
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,181
- (Laughing)
- Get off of me!

285
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,024
(Panting)

286
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,154
Leave!

287
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,665
You little fucking bitch!

288
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,437
(Shuddering)

289
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,906
That was a really
big mistake, partner.

290
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,277
(Door Opens)

291
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,590
(Engine Starting)

292
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,252
(Chattering)

293
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,629
(Man)
Hey, here comes the cake.

294
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,531
 Happy birthday to you 

295
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,968
 Happy birthday to you 

296
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,906
 Happy birthday, dear Tony 

297
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,570
 Happy birthday to you 

298
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,774
(Cheering)
 How old are you now 

299
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,351
 How old... 
That's funny.

300
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,216
Look at that bonfre.
How old are you anyway?

301
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,085
Yeah, why don't you test your math
skills and count the candles?

302
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,091
Forty one.
Forty one?

303
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,458
- One to grow on.
- If he grows any more,
you might divorce him.

304
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,726
- (Laughter)
- I'll have a very small piece.

305
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,802
No, thanks.
I gave that up.

306
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,366
Make a wish.

307
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,408
(Laughter)

308
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,416
Almost, almost.

309
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,986
- The smoke from this...
- (Cheering)

310
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,751
(Sighs)

311
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,967
I got it.

312
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,400
Ow. Thank you.

313
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,597
For what?

314
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:05,107
(Sighs)
Well, for the nice party.

315

For putting up with me.

316
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,783
I blew our vacation.
That was pretty stupid.

317
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,648
Stunat'.
It was selfsh.

318
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,053
Oh, just forget it, Tony.
It was my fault too.

319
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,615
No. No, it wasn't.

320
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,093
You...

321
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,664
You blame yourself too much.

322
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,996
What's wrong, sweetie?

323
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:36,100
Oh, another
goddamn birthday.

324
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,107
Ya!

325
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,337
This is the big one.
(Chuckles)

326
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,712
You know, it's...
incredible.

327
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:50,220
I have to tell you,
I feel... I feel old.

328
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,881
Half my life is over.

329
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,753
How's it been?

330
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,090
The truth?

331
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,063
You're the only good thing
that ever happened to me.

332
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,737
Thank you.

333
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,874
Do you remember how it was
when we frst met,

334
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,647
the way we were together?

335
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,724
Yeah, I do.

336
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,922
I miss that.
I miss those days.

337
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,930
I do too.

338
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:38,366
I would love to put the ways
we hurt each other behind us...

339
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:43,372
and... just wipe the slate.

340
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,375
Do you think
that's possible?

341
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,879
You tell me.

342
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,987
Yeah.

343
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,725
Oh, Josie.

344

- I can't believe you were gonna do that.

437
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,116
You know, it took the whole clip to drop
that man of yours.

438
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,990
- The whole goddamn clip!
- (Gasps)

439
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:29,123
And you know what I did?
I took him to a park.

440
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,963
I don't know what park.
Some park.

441
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,505
And pop, pop, pop, pop!
Emptied the whole fucking clip on him.

442
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,040
And you know,
the son of a bitch would not die.

443
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,737
- Imagine that.
- No!

444
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:46,215
And do me a favor. Do not sit there
and act surprised, okay?

(Whimpering)
Tony.

446

I did it for you!

You're crazy.

449
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,525
(Laughing)
Oh, I'm crazy?

450
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,361
You know, you have selective
fucking memory, is what you have.

451
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,129
Don't you remember?
We had dinner.

452
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,035
We discussed... a murder.

453
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,540
There were people
milling all about.

454
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,133
And we danced
the fuckin' night away.

455
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,645
- (Laughing)
- Oh, we did, though, didn't we?

456
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,841
And I bet you
my bottom dollar...

457
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,885
that waitress...
that snoopy little waitress...

458
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,047
I bet you she heard
every goddamn thing!

459
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,421
- Oh, yeah.
- No.

460
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,892
Without a doubt.
She heard you say,

461
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:36,058
"I want my husband dead,
and I want you to kill him."

462
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,658
- (Sobbing) Mm-mm, no!
- (Chuckles)

463
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,863
- Then you took me back to your cabin.
- Mm-mm. No!

464
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,702
You made love to me.

465
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,141
In my mind, anyway.

466
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,441
(Sighs)
You even gave me a gun.

467
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,917
The gun from your cabin.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you did.

468
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,010
(Gasping)
I'm calling the police.

469
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,681
And what the fuck
you gonna tell 'em?

470
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,350
- I'm gonna tell 'em the truth.
- Oh, the truth?

471
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,860
The truth. Now,
what is the truth?

472
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,193
I would say the truth is that you're
a greedy little bitch...

473
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,199
who married
a sugar daddy.

474
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,702
And they will say
that this little bitch has motive.

475
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,704
And I don't.

476
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,366
I'm calling the police.

477
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,001
Oh, please.
Give me the phone.

478
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:24,410
just give me the phone.
Give me the goddamn phone!

479
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,507
- Christ!
- What is it that you want?

480
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,519
You know, if you had been
this much nicer to me,

481
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,954
things-things would've
been very different.

482
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,151
(Panting)

483
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,922
I want 30 grand
by Friday.

484
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,361
And you have to suffer
just a little bit...

485
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,592
for the way you
treated me, okay?

486
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,398
Because the way I see it, you're just
a hooker with a wedding ring.

487
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,406
(Knocking)

488
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,136
I got a feeling
that's the police.

489
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:57,613
So come on, get up. Get up,
get up, get up. Clean yourself up.

490
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,912
Come on. You're so pretty.
Be pretty here, okay?

491
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,179
They're gonna think
it was a carjacking.

492
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,017
You let them think it was
a carjacking, all right?

493
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:10,560
If you tell them about me,
then we both go to jail.

494
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:14,062
Okay? 'Cause I'll tell them that you
were in it with me.

495
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:17,190
- I swear to God I'll
make them believe it.
- (Doorbell Chimes)

496
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,634
Now, we're partners,
right? Right?

497
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,571
Okay, go.
You, you go downstairs.

498
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,938
You look beautiful.

499
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,102
- (Sighs)
- Go on.

500
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,680
Wipe the tears.

501
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,375
(Clears Throat)

502
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,384
(Sighs)

503
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,148
(Door Opens)

504
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,352
(Sniffiing)

505
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,928
(Sighs)

506
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,802
Mrs. Potenza?

507
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,236
Yes?

508
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,175
I'm Detective Dan Fredricks and this is
my partner, Detective Ron Lewis.

509
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,509
It's about your
husband, ma'am.

510
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,712
(Sobbing)

511
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,079
Somebody must've
heard something.

512
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,656
(Det. Lewis)
Nobody heard a thing.

513
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,091
(Chattering)

514
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,326
(Man)
All right, come on.

515
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,528
- (Woman)
- Man, this is fucked up.
Why you guys pick me up?

516
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,834
He's the one who rolled up
on me. Man, this is fucked up!

517
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,842
I don't know why you guys didn't arrest
him too. He's gonna jam me up.

518
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,504
Hey, can you help me?
Please, help me.

519
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,105
- Please, please!
- Lady, come on.

520
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:42,117
See how they treat me?

521
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,737
(Sobbing)

522
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,452
(Panting)

523
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,587
(Sighing)

524
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,563
(Sighs)

525
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,041
Go ahead.
Right in.

526
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,781
Come on in.

527
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,080
Sit down, Mrs. Potenza.

528
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,183
We'll be recording this
interview, with your permission.

529
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,791
State your name
for the record.

530
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,130
josie Potenza.

531
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:10,036
Mrs. Potenza, when was the last time
you spoke with your husband today?

532
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,700
He called
at about 7:45.

533
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,472
- He called you?
- Yes, he did.

534
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,946
And he told me he'd be home
in about 20 minutes.

535
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,574
We were supposed
to go out to dinner.

536
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,313
How can you be
so sure of the time?

537
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,123
'Cause I looked at the clock.

538
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,728
And then?

539
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,129
I decided to call him
on his car phone.

540
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,667
But then when I called...

541
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,294
(Sobbing)
I didn't get an answer.

542
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:45,307
Did your husband
have any enemies?

543
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,640
Outstanding debts?
Disgruntled business partners?

544
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,646
Anything like that?

545
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,648
No.

546
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,878
Can you think of anybody
who would've benefted from his death?

547
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,522
No, I can't.

548
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:11,225
Mrs. Potenza, do you have any idea who
might have killed your husband?

549
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,873
No, I don't.

550
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,680
I'm letting the wife go.

551
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,883
What did you think
about her?

552
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,358
What?

553
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,257
Think it was
a real carjacking?

554
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,698
Yeah. Don't you?

555
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,430
Then why'd the perp
leave the Caddy?

556
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,098
The alarm scared him away.

557
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:54,007
Did you get a good look
at the, uh, widow Potenza?

558
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,579
She's a shitload younger
than her husband.

559
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,877
No alibi. Alone at
the time of the murder.

560
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,315
And black.

561
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,887
Well, that's got
nothing to do with it.

562
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,320
Spouse is always
a suspect, right?

563
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,086
(Chuckles)
He's stretchin', man.

564
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:13,254
Yeah, Ron, I'm stretching.

565
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:17,823
Oh, you remember that instateller
receipt we found in Potenza's pocket?

566
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,835
Yeah.
What about it?

567
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,497
I just saw the bank video.

568
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,235
There was a guy standing directly
behind him when he got his cash.

569
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,312
Yeah.
What kind of guy?

570
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,506
Ayo.

571
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,515
(Chuckles)

572
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,017
In full view of the camera,

573
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,919
a black man standing behind
Potenza while he got the cash.

574
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,356
Damn! Case closed.

575
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,429
Don't get all sensitive, Ronnie.
I'm just pointing out a fact.

576
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,464
It might've been
a local out for a run.

577
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,863
A black man, Ron,
in the Palisades?

578
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:54,096
One dead white man,
two black suspects.

579
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,968
Whew!
You're on a roll.

580
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,315
Here we are.

581
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:10,853
Look, if you, uh, think
of anything else, just call.

582
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:16,350
This is a direct line
to my offce, okay?

583
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,088
Thank you.

584
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,131
I'm sorry about everything.

585
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,167
Well, you've been very kind.
Thank you.

586
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,830
All right, and you
take care of yourself.

587
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,873
Okay.

588
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,909
Good night.

589
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,536
Good night.

590
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,145
The peace of an exclusive
Los Angeles neighborhood...

591
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,011
has been shattered
by news of a brutal murder.

592
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:17,576
Anthony Potenza, a prominent
executive at PBC Broadcasting,

593
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,317
was shot and killed last night
in Pacifiic Palisades.

594
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,985
No motive is yet known
for the killing,

595
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:27,860
but it appears that Potenza
was the victim of a carjacking.

596
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,195
It was shortly
after 8:00 p.m. last night...

597
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,792
when Potenza stopped for cash
at this instateller.

598
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,134
Police believe the victim
was accosted here,

599
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,434
then driven
to a park nearby.

600
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:42,569
A violent struggle ensued,
in which Potenza fought for his life...

601
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,239
as he was shot repeatedly.

602
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,510
No suspect
is yet in custody,

603
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:50,518
but police are looking
to question this man.

604
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,350
Anyone with information
as to his whereabouts...

605
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,482
is asked to call police
immediately.

606
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,525
Mr. Golden, can we please
get a statement from you?

607
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,858
When was the last time
he was in your restaurant?

608
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,194
Do the police
have any idea?

609
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,359
Is she expecting
your visit, sir?

610
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,528
(Shouting, Cameras Clicking)

611
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,265
Sir, can we at least
get a statement?

612
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,921
Anything I can do?

613
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,188
just leave, Jake.
Please.

614
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:36,425
No. You need a friend.
You shouldn't be alone now.

615
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,268
You don't understand.

616
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,600
What don't I understand?

617
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:48,010
I want to tell you, Jake, but
I can't. It's too dangerous.

618
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,807
Hey, come on, it's me.

619
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:54,611
- No, I'm in big, big trouble.
- It's all right.

620
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,279
No, listen, I know who killed Tony,
but I didn't tell the police.

621
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,856
It's not what
you think, okay?

622
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,016
I met this guy
in the mountains.

623
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,687
I met him at a bar, and I started
telling him about me and Tony and...

624
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,992
- I didn't know the man was crazy.
- Crazy? What the...

625
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:13,058
He tried to rape me, Jake.
So I used this gun to get him off me.

626
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,365
Then he followed me here,
and he killed Tony.

627
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,872
And now he's trying to say
that it was all my idea.

628
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:20,408
He said I have to pay him
$30,000 by Friday.

629
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:24,674
Wait a minute, slow down.
Why do you have to pay him if
you had nothing to do with it?

630
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:28,080
If I don't give him the money, he's
gonna tell the cops that I was in on it.

631
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,380
He's gonna say
it was all my idea.

632
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:33,718
He's gonna say that
I paid him to kill Tony.

633
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,758
Did you?

634
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,062
Oh, my God!

635
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,724
Even you think I'm guilty.

636
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,999
Want to know what the really
horrible thing here is?

637
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,769
It's that for one minute,
I wanted this to happen.

638
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:56,869
But I swear to God,
I didn't make it happen.

639
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,513
Do you believe me?

640
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,643
Of course
I believe you.

641
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,880
Listen, l...
I shouldn't be here.

642
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,856
W-We can't be seen together.
If the police fnd out about us...

643
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,018
I know. I already
thought about that.

644
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,359
- So how are you gonna get rid of him?
- I'm gonna have to pay him.

645
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,864
But I don't want you to have
anything to do with it.

646
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,367
I just want you to tell me
you believe I didn't do it.

647
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,132
Yeah, I believe you. But for God's sake,
Josie, don't tell anyone else.

648
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,538
Okay, I promise.
I'll call you later, okay?

649
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,542
Okay.

650
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,544
(Sighs)

651
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,283
Who you callin; Jake?

652
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,456
What the hell
are you doing here?

653
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:17,618
(Chuckling)
What, no hello?

654
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,855
How are you?
How you been doing?

655
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,159
You idiot.
I just sawJosie.

656
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,291
Are you out
of your mind?

657
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,996
What kind of stunt are you pulling,
blackmailing her?

658
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,909
What's this?

659
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:39,709
What... does it look like?

660
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,553
See, I been thinking.

661
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:49,056
Now that I deal with Josie
directly, why do I need you?

662
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,892
Okay, you thought the plan up,
but who did all the work?

663
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,192
I did, didn't I?

664
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,893
- Didn't I?
- Yeah, you did, you did.
You did it brilliantly.

665
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:02,335
So let's not blow it now.
I can help you get your money.

666
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,239
I can make sure thatJosie doesn't go to
the police. That would ruin everything.

667
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,744
I need you.
You need me.

668
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,684
Got some food?

669
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,015
just tell me.
I'm curious.

670
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,888
I'm not challenging you.
Why didn't you follow the plan?

671
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,291
You were supposed to kill
Tony in the mountains.

672
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,955
An anonymous robbery, a simple hit. You
weren't even supposed to talk toJosie.

673
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:32,660
- That was the whole idea.
- That's right.

674
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,600
So what happened?

675
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:39,164
- "What happened?"
- Tony left.

676
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,439
And then I found myself with
this sweet little thing.

677
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,315
Decided to have
a little bit of fun.

678
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,884
You should know
about that, right?

679
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:52,352
But if you'd have followed the plan that
we'd agreed, to kill him and disappear...

680
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,219
in six months she'd have
married me and I could have
paid you anything you wanted.

681
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,294
We can still do it.

682
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,030
Why don't we?
Name a fgure.

683
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,870
How about if you
give me $30,000?

684
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,065
Fine.
I'll take care of it.

685
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,870
(Laughing)

686
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:18,471
You, my friend,
do not have a dime.

687
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,542
What puts you over the edge
in this place, anyway?

688
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,884
Your overhead?
This wonderful kitchen?

689
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,481
Fantastic furniture
you have?

690
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,924
If you want to know
what sunk me, it was Tony.

691
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,189
He brought in investors
who get paid...

692
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,697
straight out of the gross,
so when things are slow,
like they have been lately,

693
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,234
then the investors still get the money,
but I go broke.

694
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:43,238
But things are looking up, man. Soon,
there'll be enough money for everyone.

695
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:48,209
Then I'll pay you double.
just... Just leaveJosie alone.

696
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:52,941
I'll tell you what.
I want her to pay me.

697
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:57,110
Why?
Because I like her.

698
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:02,219
She... She said
you tried to rape her.

699
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,522
No. She wanted it so bad
I could smell it.

700
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:15,226
Don't fuck with me!
You got what you wanted.
I'm gonna get what I need.

701
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,330
I don't wanna
see you again, okay?

702
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,546
Promise me
you won't hurt her.

703
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,640
Now, why should I
promise you anything?

704
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,687
You're just some asshole
I met in a bar, right?

705
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:41,294
I don't believe this crap! You have my
face all over the fve o'clock news...

706
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,027
- Like I was some common criminal!
- It's not really a bad picture.

707
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,865
Look, I don't want any of your cracks.
I want a formal apology.

708
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,871
- I want you to call a press conference.
- My offce will be...

709
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,873
a great place
to discuss this.

710
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,603
Why don't we step right down here
and I think we...

711
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,942
- Who is he?
- Oh, hell, man. Just another yo.

712
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,345
A neurosurgeon.
(Groaning)

713
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,441
A golfng buddy
of the Mayor's.

714
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,020
He's suing the whole department
for defamation of character.

715
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:08,488
- Jesus.
- Dan, your ass is grass.

716
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,219
My wife told me I should go
in the real estate business.

717
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,989
Too late, man.
The market sucks.

718
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,997
Unless you want to go back
to walkin' the beat,

719
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,431
I suggest we fnd
another suspect.

720
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,696
How did the neighborhood
canvass go?

721
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,272
Nobody heard
or saw anything.

722
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:26,137
If it was a 'jacking, it's cold.
It may never go down.

723
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:29,939
No witnesses,
no fngerprints, no murder weapon.

724
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,538
At least we got
one suspect left.

725
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,585
You don't mean you're back
to the pretty young wife?

726
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,677
It's the only concept's
got any life left in it.

727
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,847
Is either one
of you guys religious?

728
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:44,120
No, sir. But we deeply
appreciate your prayers.

729
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,718
Have a look at these.
Maybe you won't need 'em.

730
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,898
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Wait a minute.

731
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:57,336
What is she grabbin' for?

732
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,499
Oh, I get it.

733
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,745
Havin' a good time, fellas?

734
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,576
- Yeah, Mrs. Golden...
- Smith.

735
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:10,085
I'm back to my maiden name
for obvious reasons.

736
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,654
Okay.

737
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,882
Where'd you get
the Polaroids?

738
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:19,052
Glove compartment
ofJake's car.

739
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,756
Last place I looked,
naturally.

740
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:24,390
Mind if we
keep these?

741
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,061
My lawyer needs 'em.

742
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,070
You can make copies.

743
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,437
- Your lawyer?
- Jake and I are in court next week.

744
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,669
He's trying to cut
my alimony.

745
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,677
He is so bullshit.

746
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:43,774
Okay, let's start
at the beginning.

747
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,355
State your name, please.

748
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,293
My name is Nora Smith...

749
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:54,659
and we've been talking about
the fact that my ex-husband, Jake...

750
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:59,064
has been screwing
josie Potenza for God knows how long.

751
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,538
That level okay?

752
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,907
- Yeah. That's fne.
- I think Jake killed Tony.

753
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,742
See,
jake is broke.

754
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:15,545
Nobody knows that,
but it's true.

755
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,813
He wanted Tony's wife...

756
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,412
and he wanted Tony's money.

757
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,923
But he couldn't get them
both in one package.

758
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,256
Why do you
say that?

759
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,261
Because of the prenup.

760
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:33,767
- They had a prenup?
- I can't believe
you didn't know about that.

761
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,895
It's ironclad.

762
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,463
lfJosie left Tony,
she wouldn't get a penny.

763
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,044
The only answer
would be forJake...

764
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:46,081
to kill Tony,
and then marryJosie.

765
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:49,982
Why do you think we should suspect
your husband and not Mrs. Potenza?

766
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,814
josie doesn't
owe me alimony.

767
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,327
Excuse me.

768
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,989
Before I go any further.

769
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,431
Did anyone offer a reward
in this case?

770
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,093
(Laughing)

771
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,103
Sorry.

772
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,135
Shit.

773
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:21,079
(Man) How could this happen?
In the Palisades.

774
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:25,052
In the park where my
grandson plays soccer.

775
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:28,715
- (Sighing)
- The important thing for you to know...

776
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,850
is that your friends
are here for you.

777
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,860
Thank you.

778
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,192
Have you been
to the bank?

779
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:40,258
- No.
- The accounts are all frozen.

780
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,270
Don't take it personally.

781
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,603
It's standard procedure when
somebody dies like that.

782
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,642
Well, how long?

783
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:51,202
Not long, I hope.

784
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,544
I wish that
were the only problem.

785
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,918
I feel personally responsible for
what I'm about to say.

786
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:02,253
I told Tony again and again.

787
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:05,987
I warned him. Not that
that's any excuse.

788
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:09,724
I don't understand.
What are you trying to say here, Bill?

789
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,357
(Sighs)
Tony didn't leave a will.

790
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:16,905
As far as a legal document is concerned,
he never signed a goddamn thing...

791
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,999
apart from this prenup
which is tying my hands.

792
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,544
Tony kept everything
in his name.

793
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,638
Including real estate,
bank accounts, other assets.

794
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,842
He didn't put anything
in community property.

795
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,478
So the estate
is gonna have to go through probate...

796
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,523
before you can
touch anything.

797
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,559
How long will that take?

798
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,424
Could be a year,
maybe longer.

799
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,765
So I have nothing?

800
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,104
You've got
yourjewelry.

801
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,203
And the car.

802
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:02,216
I could help you
liquidate them.

803
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,412
A loan is always
a possibility.

804
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:10,686
Trust me.
You're gonna be a very rich woman.

805
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,693
Eventually.

806
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,834
I'm sorry.

807
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,699
I'm so sorry.

808
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:22,393
I'm so sorry, Josie.
What a shock.

809
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:26,093
- Thank you for coming.
- Call if there's anything I can do.

810
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,337
- I'm so sorry. Anything...
- Thank you.

811
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,906
- Hey.
- Hi, Corey.

812
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,048
Smile, Jake. The police
are taking your picture.

813
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,623
What are you
talking about?

814
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:52,285
It's standard in a murder case
to photograph everyone at the funeral.

815
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,364
Because most people
are killed by someone that they know.

816
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:59,696
- And trust.
- Well, I'm not planning anything.
Maybe you are.

817
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,862
- (Laughing)
- Why bother? You don't
even have life insurance!

818
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:06,703
josie, on the other hand,
just hit the jackpot!

819
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:10,711
- That's a disgusting thing to say.
- Tony was a good friend!

820
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:13,714
He doesn't deserve what he got from the
people that he trusted.

821
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,580
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

822
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,984
Checked your
glove compartment lately?

823
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:36,703
- Is leather appropriate?
You know, for funerals?
- (Laughing)

824
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,536
Okay, what's he doin'?

825
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,343
(Dan) He's going back to look
in the glove compartment.

826
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,608
(Ron)
Oh, yeah.

827
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:54,921
(Dan) Right about now he's thinkin,
"Holy shit!"

828
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:04,132
What's he looking at?

829
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,559
(Ron)
Now, who the hell is that?

830
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,231
- Get a good shot of him.
- I got him.

831
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,246
(Dan) Whoever he is,
she ain't glad to see him.

832
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:28,755
(Ron) He's got his hands
all over her. Look at that.

833
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:33,124
- (Dan) Damn. Where's a good
lip reader when you need 'em?

834
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,959
Tonight at seven o'clock I want you
to get in your car and drive, okay?

835
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:39,501
Let you know where to go.
Bring me my money.

836
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,695
My money.

837
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,172
What if I don't
have the money?

838
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:55,845
That... that wouldn't be very cool,
because then I would
have to kill the other one.

839
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,852
What other one?

840
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,651
What's his name, Jakey Boy.
RememberJake?

841
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,282
Yeah,
I know about him.

842
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:08,454
I been watching you.
I love you.

843
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,171
(Ron)
There's something strange going on here.

844
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:24,906
Listen, follow that guy.
Get a shot of his license plate
and don't let him see you.

845
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,711
Okay, now where's
jake Golden?

846
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:38,416
(Ron)
Damn!

847
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,035
(Phone Ringing)

848
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,104
- Yes.
- Hi, partner.

849
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,106
I want you to go
to Pico and Sepulveda.

850
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,836
Make a right on Sepulveda
and a right again on Sardis.

851
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:33,278
Park at the end of the street and I'll
be sittin' there waitin' for you.

852
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,524
Got my money?

853
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,928
I got your money.
Right here.

854
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,592
You really are a stupid bitch,
you know that?

855
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,763
Don't push me! I don't
want to have to kill you, but I will.

856
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,966
This is a real good
place to do it.

857
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,908
- What is this?
- Give me the gun from the cabin,

858
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,912
and I'll give you the money.

859
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,642
- I'll give you the gun.
- Uh-uh!

860
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:52,084
Take off the coat and give it to me.
I'll get the gun. Come on!

861
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,316
Okay. Just relax,
all right?

862
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,755
Want the coat?

863
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,023
Take it.

864
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,622
(Voices, Indistinct)

865
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:09,302
- Help! Help!
- Hey! What the fuck is goin' on, man?

866
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,305
- (Shouting)
- (Indistinct Grumbling)

867
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,705
Hey, I said
let her go, puto!

868
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,834
You're psycho, man!

869
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,311
(Shouting)

870
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:21,110
Enough of this shit.
You're next.

871
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,380
First, let me grab my money.
Don't wanna get blood on it.

872
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,819
(Screaming)

873
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,957
- I'm gonna kill you!
- (Panting)

874
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,362
Fucking bitch!

875
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,492
- (Panting)
- Fucking bitch!

876
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,672
(Gasping)

877
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:54,014
(Gasping, Panting)

878
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:07,092
Help! Help me!
Help!

879
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,103
Shit!

880
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:30,173
Goddamn it, stop!

881
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,145
(Horns Honking)

882
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,994
I will get you, bitch!

883
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,826
You can't get away, whore!

884
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,196
(Horns Tooting)

885
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,668
I'm gonna rip
your fuckin' heart out!

886
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,243
Shit!

887
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,598
Excuse me.

888
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,471
josie.

889
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:34,811
(Gasping)

890
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:38,080
What happened?
He tried to kill me.

891
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,087
Oh, my God.

892
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,680
- I'm gonna need your help, okay?
- Yeah, of course, anything.

893
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:46,522
- Let's go upstairs to my place.
- No. I'm going to the police.

894
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:49,859
- Come on.
- No. You can't do that.

895
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:53,526
Either you're coming with me
or I'm going alone. Now, let's go.

896
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,601
Listen, you've waited
too long to go to the police.

897
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,645
They'll never believe you.
You lied to them.

898
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,647
He's gonna kill me
and he's gonna kill you.

899
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:08,649
- No, he won't hurt me.
- Yes he will. He's been following me.

900
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:12,847
- He knows exactly who you are.
- Okay, let's discuss options.

901
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:17,415
Fuck it. What if
we just keep driving?

902
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:20,461
I'm talking about Canada, Mexico.
Why not? There's plenty of money.

903
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,530
There is no money, Jake.
Tony never made a will.

904
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,861
It's all tied up in probate.
And you know what?

905
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,561
If I had that money,
I would throw it all away.

906
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:29,603
That's crazy.
The money is your security.

907
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,333
It's blood money, Jake.
Tony never wanted me to have it.

908
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,375
As far as I'm concerned,
he died with it.

909
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:37,536
- But of course Tony would have
wanted you to have it!
- Oh, really?

910
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,614
Then why was it all
in his name?

911
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:42,309
Because it was his power.
Over me and over everybody.

912
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,477
I threw my whole life away
for that money.

913
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:48,522
There's no way I'm going to let that
influence one more decision that I make.

914
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,752
If I take that money, I'm going
to feel like I'm responsible
for what happened to Tony.

915
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,828
Now where are you going?
You made a wrong turn.

916
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,487
I'm not fucking taking you
to the police station!

917
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,087
You don't know what you're doin'!
You're in terrible shape!

918
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,430
I know exactly what I'm doing,
and what I'm doing is what's right.

919
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,436
And what's right is
to never touch Tony's money.

920
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,768
- What's right is to make
the man pay who killed him.
- We're nearly...

921
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,036
- What's right is for me
to suffer the consequences...
- We're nearly at your house.

922
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,077
We can go inside
and discuss it there.

923
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:13,444
- There's nothing to discuss!
Now take me to the police.
- No.

924
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:15,346
- Stop the car!
- (Brakes Squeal)

925
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,614
Get out.
I'm driving. Get out!

926
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,752
- Give me the goddamn keys!
- Josie, listen to me.

927
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:28,056
just listen, please.

928
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,427
Cole won't hurt you.

929
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:33,865
That would be stupid. He's just trying to
scare you. We can handle this together.

930
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,800
What did you say?

931
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,134
I said he won't hurt you.
He's just trying to scare you.

932
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,174
No. That's not
what you said.

933
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,300
You said Cole
won't hurt me.

934
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:45,175
Well, what's the difference?

935
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,046
I never told you
his name.

936
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,815
Yes, you did.
Of course you did.

937
01:14:55,924 --> 01:15:00,486
Uh-uh. I never
told it to you.

938
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,156
No, Josie, wait a minute!
Let me explain.

939

- Cole Wilson, convicted felon.

What the hell is this guy doing
talking toJosie Potenza
at her husband's funeral?

josie, it's me!

953
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:55,171
josie, let me in! Cole's car
is in the alley. He's out here somewhere.

954
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:58,576
josie, hurry up!
Open the door.

josie, you
have to trust me.

He might be
in the house.

957
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:08,448
Open the door.
Hurry up.

You are so fucking pathetic,
you know that?

01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:58,100
just go ahead and do it.
just do it!

on your own, can you?

Go ahead!
Shoot!

01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:08,340
No. I need you
to tell those cops...

that I'm innocent, okay?

998
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:15,421

Get her beyond, go!

1013
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,459
That's exactly
the way it happened.

1014
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,864
The last time you questioned me,
I lied, so...

1015
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:38,029
you have no real reason to believe
that what I'm saying is the truth.

1016
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:42,303
But I'm telling you
the truth.

1017
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,401
I loved my husband.

1018
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:47,345
And I would have never done
anything to hurt him.

1019
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,178
But you did
kill Cole Wilson.

1020
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:57,524
Yes, I did.

1021
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,116
But that was
in self-defense.

1022
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,064
Mrs. Potenza,

1023
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:07,657
is there anyone who can corroborate
any part of what you just told us?

1024
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,935
No.

1025
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,308
- Fellas, the lady is amazing.
- Yeah, I almost believed her.

1026
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,385
I guess I am a sucker.
For a while, she had me goin' again!

1027
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:26,920
What a story. Know what part
I liked the best?

1028
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:30,582
Where she just happened to run
into Cole in the mountains.
What a coincidence.

1029
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:34,958
- And how she never suspected
jake until the last minute.
- But that was good!

1030
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,861
And how she pawns her jewelry.
She had a lot of details, didn't she?

1031
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:41,424
She slipped up on that one. If Wilson
took the $30,000, where did it go?

1032
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,436
We didn't fnd it
on the body.

1033
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,438
- Well, she probably kept the money.
- Do you thinkJake...

1034
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,270
- Was in on it?
- If he was in on it, she
wouldn't have killed him.

1035
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,777
- So what do we do now?
- Damned if I know.

1036
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,906
I'm almost positive she hired
Cole Wilson to kill her husband...

1037
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:56,916
and he went
out of control on her.

1038
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:59,077
But we can't prove a damn thing.
We've got no evidence, no witnesses.

1039
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:01,655
- She made sure of that.
- Her story makes perfect sense...

1040
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:04,953
as long as there's
no one to refute it.

1041
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:08,085
So, whether we believe it
or not, I'm going to have to let her go.

1042
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:11,222
You can't do that.
She killed the Wilson guy!

1043
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,130
Yeah. And with his record,
she will have no problem...

1044
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,135
pleading self-defense.

1045
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:18,831
just imagine that innocent little
face in front of a jury.

1046
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,408
She'll have them eating
out of the palm of her hand.

1047
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,977
Come on. We gotta
charge her with something!

1048
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:27,570
No, not without evidence.
Remember that neurosurgeon?

1049
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:31,083
It's because of you, Danny, that I got
the ACLU climbin' all over my ass.

1050
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:34,178
just give us a couple of hours.
There is one witness that isn't dead.

1051
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,120
- Now, who would that be?
- Jake's ex-wife.

1052
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,124
- I want to bring her back.
- Why?

1053
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:42,094
What she told us supports Mrs.
Potenza's story. She said it was Jake.

1054
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,757
Yeah, but she dreamed
that up to extort alimony from Jake.

1055
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:49,235
He can't pay now. Look. Maybe she's
got one small piece of information...

1056
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,396
to help us keep
the merry widow in jail.

1057
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:59,508
jake is dead, and you think
thatJosie killed him.

1058
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:03,072
She is a suspect, yes.

1059
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:05,379
Okay,
that's a mindblower.

1060
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:08,853
All right. Let me just
get my head around this.

1061
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,116
PoorJake.

1062
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,458
Yeah, it's a real tragedy.

1063
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:19,465
Yeah...
He still owed me a check.

1064
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:24,470
We were wondering if you had
any information that we should know.

1065
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,972
You were friends
with Josie Potenza, weren't you?

1066
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:32,479
Not exactly, Detective.
She was screwing my ex, remember?

1067
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,878
It's not like we
hung out together.

1068
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:36,883
Tony was my friend.

1069
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:38,680
He loaned me money.

1070
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,720
So he was a good guy,
was he?

1071
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:43,154
As long as you weren't
married to him, yeah.

1072
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,726
He defnitely liked the ladies.
(Laughing)

1073
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,818
He had quite a few.

1074
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,126
So it wasn't
a good marriage.

1075
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:55,498
Compared to what?
Tony loved her. I think she loved him.

1076
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,503
So they screwed around.

1077
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,971
You don't think
she loved your ex-husband.

1078
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,201
You got to be kidding me.

1079
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:05,768
I mean, Jake could be
pretty charming...

1080
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,212
when he wanted to, but...

1081
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,114
Tony was a mensch.

1082
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,847
josie never would have
left Tony forJake.

1083
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,513
jake knew that.

1084
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,784
That's when he decided
to kill Tony.

1085
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:22,488
You don't think Josie
had anything to do with it?

1086
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:26,055
Hello-o?
Did you check out her personality?

1087
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,260
I don't think so.

1088
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:30,496
Now, if I were married to Tony,
you might have a case.

1089
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:38,002
Nah. Josie's not the type
to commit murder.

1090
01:28:38,112 --> 01:28:41,775
She doesn't have the guts.
Or the brains.

1091
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:24,817
You look like shit.

1092
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:27,690
I had a long night.

1093
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,423
You were out of there
in record time.

1094
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:33,898
I've had facials
that took longer.

1095
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:37,562
(Nora) You should have seen me
in there. I was brilliant.

1096
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:42,132
And they call themselves
detectives? Suckers!

1097
