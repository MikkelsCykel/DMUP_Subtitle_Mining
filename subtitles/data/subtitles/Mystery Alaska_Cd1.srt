Hey.
What did you say?

4
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:41,206
You teach him that?

5
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,501
He heard it
in the locker room, Dad.

6
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,907
<i>- From who?
- Everyone.</i>

Take the sled, will ya?
I wanna wait for the mail.

13
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:10,435
- The magazine's supposed to be here, express.
- Okay. Better be good.

14
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,038
Of course it's gonna be good.
That's the whole point.

I don't exactly trust
Chuckie boy.

Fat men don't shovel,
Bailey.

No, it's dry.
It's dry.

- Hey, is the magazine out yet?
- Monday.

32
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:04,211
- Johnny's supposed to get a copy expressed.
- Maybe we made the cover.

33
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:09,617
- We ain't on the cover.
- He said it would be a big story with pictures.

34

<i>Yeah, Chuck exaggerates.</i>

35

Hey, guys, you are

Sarah Heinz.

37
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:25,060
I know!
She's supposed to be this shy girl.

38

<i>I figure, what the hell.
I ain't that attractive.</i>

39
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:31,876
I'll vaccinate her quick, get home for an
early sack, beat what's left of the bishop.

40
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,945
Like this?

41
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:37,106
- She's much fatter naked. Yeah!
- No.

42
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:41,117
I'm telling you, she got her February
fat now in the second week in December.

43
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,519
She's riding me

00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,462
- Hey.
- What?

49
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,301
- You kill one more wolf...
- Ain't no sheriffin' in here.

50
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,374
I ain't sheriffin'. I'm just
a teammate concerned for his freedom.

51
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,511
<i>Come on, boys.
Let's move it.</i>

52
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:08,342
It's two tenths below zero.
The committee won't be happy.

53
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:13,248
- The committee.
- You seen Weeks lately? He's been skating the river.

54
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:17,345
<i>I don't care. I'm about to be on
the cover of Sports Illustrated.</i>

55
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:23,256
<i>That photographer said I have
one of those expressive faces.</i>

56
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:27,526
- A face that tells a story.
- Too bad it's a tragedy.

57
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,398
- A comedy.
- A horror story.

58
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:33,370
Come on, guys.
Let's start gettin' our heads into it.

59
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,603
Like Connor says,
that Weeks kid, he's got jump.

60
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,981
I'm tellin' you, Tree,
there's rumors.

61
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:44,413
One of us is going down.

62
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:54,051
Let's go! Let's move!

63
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:06,904
Let's go!

64
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,747
Good game!
Good game!

65
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,792
Stretch 'em out.

66
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:32,357
- Let's do it, Sheriff.
- Sticks!

67
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:35,798
<i>- Line 'em up, Michael!
- Don't give me Tree. I wanna win this week.</i>

68
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,699
- I win no matter what side, huh?
- Win this, Tree.

69
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,242
- Maybe it's you and me, huh?
- Winetka.

70
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,937
Here.

71
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:51,141
- Paul.
- Brown's the winner.

72
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:54,514
- Dad!
- Thanks, Mikey.

73
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:57,623
<i>Tree!</i>

74
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:34,850
- You see Stevie Weeks yesterday?
- Chump.

75
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:36,962
You think
we gotta do it?

76
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,660
- Birdie!
- Try and pass me!

77
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,501
- Give it to me!
- Try it! Try it!

78
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,132
<i>Pass! Damn!</i>

79
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,457
Whoo!
All right!

80
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,353
Soon, it'll be you
out there.

81
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,695
- Oh, I don't know.
- It will, Stevie.

82
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:24,636
- Ow!
- Daddy!

83
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:28,736
There are things you do in public...
and things you don't.

84
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:31,043
We're just kissing.

Geez.

87
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,922
Very effective, Walter.

88
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,426
Nipped in the bud.

89
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,129
- MaryJane.

90
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:49,396
I got it. Look. It's three pages

Well, he can't not like that.

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,543

152
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,179
Well, they've been sniffin'.

153
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:40,121
Oh, Skank.

154
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:57,074
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

155
00:13:57,283 --> 00:14:00,343
<i>"On the left side,</i>

156
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:03,284
Skank Marden is a master
of sticky sores... "

157
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,322
No, no, Shawnette.

158
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,324
Um, remember, you want
to sound out the words.

159
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,429
- Okay.
- Let's try again.

160
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,398
"Skank Marden,
a master of the stick,

161
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,434
scores on demand. "

162
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:21,130
<i>That's right. Good. Excellent.</i>

163
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:24,539
Tommy! What?

164
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:28,113
Word is Biebe is out
and Weeks is going up.

165
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,943
Really?

166
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,788
- Don't get too far.
- Yeah, Dad.

167
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,026
<i>- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.</i>

168
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,689
Thanks for coming, Johnny.

169
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:56,098
Well, we can't hold
Stevie Weeks back any longer.

170
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:59,176
You'll be first alternate,
of course.

171
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,574
That's...

172
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:12,356
There's more to the game than speed,
Scott. Experience counts.

173
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:15,824
Which Stevie Weeks can't get
till we call him up.

174
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:19,420
You've been in the Saturday game
13 years, Johnny.

175
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:24,492
- That's a record!
- I can still play.

176
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:28,300
When was the last time
you scored a goal?

177
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:34,441
Look, it's not fair to the Weeks boy
to keep him back.

178
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,846
<i>And it's not fair
to the Saturday game.</i>

179
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:55,095
Shit!

180
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,092
<i>I gotta go.</i>

181
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,749
Donna's inside, Johnny.

182
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:50,355
- Hey.
- Hey.

183
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,399
I'm fine, Donna.

184
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,475
We talked about this.

185
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:17,878
We knew one day eventually...
I'm fine.

186
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,008
Don't tell me you're fine.

187
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,601
I better check on Mike.

188
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:06,757
<i>- You could've told me.
- I can't give you that kind of information.</i>

189
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:09,835
We're sleeping together,
for God's sakes.

190
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:13,700
Skank, we're committing adultery. It's
not like I threw in trust as a perk.

191
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,069
<i>Honey.</i>

192
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,338
- Hi.
- Look, you, uh... you may have heard.

193
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,538
- We just did it.
- I heard.

194
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:25,172
And so did I,
and it's a big mistake.

195
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:28,946
John Biebe is the anchor,
for God's sakes!

196
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,090
Geez.

197
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:40,326
<i>Stevie! Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!</i>

198
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:43,902
Guys, it ain't my birthday.

199
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,196
It's better.
You're in the Saturday game!

200
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,603
L- I could go down
as fast as I come up.

201
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:53,735
- There's no way.
- Hey, I'm next. They'll be callin' me next.

202
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,722
Hey, Mike.

203
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:07,348
- Hey.
- Why don't you get yourself that milkshake?

204
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,863
Better not hear
your grades are dropping off.

205
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,876
They-They won't, sir.

206
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:30,539
You skate like you can
and you'll be fine.

207
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,615
- Boys.
- Sheriff.

208
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,656
<i>- I ordered one for you too, Dad.
- Thanks, Mike.</i>

209
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,818
- Johnny?
- Yeah?

210
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:47,456
You gotta get out to Gagney Grocers.
Connor Banks just shot a guy.

211
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:54,630
Ow! Jesus!
What, did you put your finger in it?

212
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:57,003
<i>- Try and hold still.
- Could you jam the oxygen tank...</i>

213
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,077
<i>a little further up my ass, please?</i>

214
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:01,975
<i>Have you done this before?</i>

215
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:06,278
- Who is he?
- A rep from Price World.

216
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,477
<i>Good. Twist it! Yeah, that helps.</i>

217
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:12,079
<i>Think about trimming
those nails too, Tarzan.</i>

218
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:15,125
<i>- Just try to hold it there.
- Are you trying to hurt me?</i>

219
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,295
Huh?

220
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,956
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

221
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:23,262
Do I look like I'm okay?
The fucker shot me!

222
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:27,303
What the fuck-ass fuck of a bum-fuck,
shithole town is this?

223
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,101
<i>I make a business call.
I give him my card.</i>

224
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:34,509
And the hick-ass fucker shoots
my foot off! Cock-fucking shit!

225
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:41,275
- John, it was an accident.
- You read him his rights?

226
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,514
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Oh, come on, John!

227
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:47,023
- I didn't mean to shoot him.
- Call Bailey Pruitt. Talk to him.

228
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,127
Don't be saying
anything to me.

229
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,354
<i>Johnny, I heard.</i>

230
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:56,491
- I'm sorry.
- Connor, you just shot a guy.

231
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,502
- Take him.
- Read him his rights.

232
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:02,038
<i>Cock-fucking suck-ass fucker!</i>

233
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:04,369
<i>Have fun in jail, asshole!</i>

234
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,704
They, uh,
got into a beef.

235
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:10,542
<i>- Connor pulled a pistol.
Happened over in feed.</i>

236
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:14,847
Says he was aiming at a sack
of Puppy Chow, trying to scare him.

237
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:17,046
He hit a wheelbarrow.
It ricocheted.

238
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:20,317
<i>- Ow! Ow, ow!
- Johnny?</i>

239
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:24,987
- Yeah?
- There's a helicopter hovering over town hall. Looks Russian.

240
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,456
Whoa!

241
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:56,390
I'm slow in the feet?

242
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:59,053
That's it?
That's all you got for me?

243
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:04,158
<i>No, "Wow, nice helicopter"? No, " Hey,
great article in Sports Illustrated"?</i>

244
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,429
How's Donna doing?
Does she miss me?

245
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:10,767
Twice in one year, Charlie.
What do you want this time?

246
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:15,513
I come bearing
the New York Rangers.

247
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,045
The New York Rangers?

248
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,916
Yeah, I was pretty blown away myself.

249
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:26,057
But the article sparked some kind
of brainstorm at the NHL.

250
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:30,287
<i>- Good writing, I guess.
- The New York Rangers.</i>

251
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,397
The New York Rangers.

252
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:35,023
- In Mystery, Alaska?
- Right here.

253
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,067
To play against our boys?

254
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:39,294
The NHL feels it'll be
great publicity,

255
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:43,704
and the network figures
a 14 share, minimum.

256
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,403
All right.

257
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,978
What's in it for you,
Charlie?

258
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,174
Community pride.

259
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,477
A sense of giving back to
the place where I grew up.

260
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,290
Money.

261
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:11,293
If you all settle down, we'll, uh,
we'll try to answer all your questions.

262
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,665
Now, nothing is definite.

263
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:17,606
There's still some dealing to be done
with the players' unions and things.

264
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:21,303
But what needs to be decided first is,
do we want this game?

265
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:25,747
<i>- I won't kid ya, it would be
a goose to the economy.</i>

266
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:28,148
<i>What economy?</i>

267
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,719
We can be serious
about this,

268
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:35,725
or we can simply leave the decision to
the committee, which I'm quite happy to do.

269
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:38,055
Yes, Miram?

270
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:42,657
The question is,
do we really stand a chance?

271
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,793
<i>'Cause if all that's gonna happen
is we'll get laughed at,</i>

272
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:48,406
I'm not for it
at any price.

273
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,940
That's fair. That's fair.
And to answer that,

274
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:54,638
I'd like to call up here
someone we all know and...

275
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:59,011
Well, we all know.
Charles Danner.

276
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:09,491
Thanks. Um... Well, first of all,
it's really great to be back.

277
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:13,155
<i>Bullshit!</i>

278
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:16,028
<i>Uh... Um, here's the thing.</i>

279
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:19,332
On a standard ice rink,
no, we don't come close.

280
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:22,030
But... our boys on a pond?

281
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:25,133
<i>Now, hold on
just one second.</i>

282
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,009
You're using words
like "we" and "our boys. "

283
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,242
You left this town,
Charlie Danner.

284
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,420
You can't even skate.

285
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,817
Plus, this may be
an old lady talking,

286
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,953
but I've always thought
you were a bit of a prick.

287
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,499
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is a town meeting.</i>

288
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:54,766
Let's have some order,
for God's sakes! John.

289
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:57,102
<i>Could we make a game of it?</i>

290
00:24:57,276 --> 00:24:59,244
<i>Yeah, John.</i>

291
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:09,147
Depends on rules.

292
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:11,279
We play four on four.
They play five on five.

293
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,391
<i>Boards, offsides,
two-line passing.</i>

294
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:16,722
Rules that keep everything bunched.
It's a different kind of game.

295
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:19,763
<i>John, excuse me, but this game
is gonna be played on a pond.</i>

296
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:21,866
- Hey, Chuck...
- One second.

297
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,561
Everybody here always says on a pond,
nobody beats us, right? Nobody.

298
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:29,105
Okay, well, you got a chance
to prove it now.

299
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:32,141
John, can we win?

300
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:39,180
Shooting, passing, stick handling...
The truth?

301
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:42,750
Except for Connor,
nobody here comes close.

302
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:44,618
Except for Connor,
nobody here comes close.

303
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:46,724
<i>But on the pond,</i>

304
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:50,727
black ice, wide open surface,
it's all about skating.

305
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:53,126
And we can skate.

306
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:57,258
Yeah, we can.
All right, man.

307
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:08,741
The New York Rangers
are professionals.

308
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:13,281
<i>Two things we've always had
in Mystery:</i>

309
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:20,924
Our dignity
and our illusions.

310
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,755
I suggest we cling to both.

311
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:41,178
Where's the dignity
in not trying?

312
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,043
I'll play those Rangers.

313
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:53,980
- I'm in.
- I'll play.

314
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:58,153
I'll beat 'em.

315
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:09,135
<i>As mayor of Mystery, Alaska,</i>

316
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:12,710
I'm gonna extend a little invitation
to the New York Rangers!

317
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:41,602
Hey, Johnny!

318
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,938
- This can't wait till tomorrow?
- No, no, we gotta be on the ice at sunup.

319
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,842
If this game happens,
it's only 32 days away.

320
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:51,347
<i>We gotta get goin'.</i>

321
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:54,781
- I bet you're back on the team now, right?
- Maybe.

322
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,411
Well, they're not gonna play the Rangers
with just ten guys.

323
00:27:57,556 --> 00:28:00,582
Here he comes.

324
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,694
- John. Hey, Donna.
- Hey, Scott.

325
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:05,194
- Witch-tit cold, huh?
- Yeah.

326
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,231
Look, John,
these are the developments.

327
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,427
Things have changed.
We want you to coach.

328
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:14,704
Judge turn you down?

329
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:18,070
Yeah.
He's got some bug up his colon.

330
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,008
But next toJudge Fuck Nut,
you know most about hockey.

331
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,774
Scott, you'll need him
to play, right?

332
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:25,940
Oh, uh...

333
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:30,214
Well, the committee feels you can best
help the team by, you know, coaching.

334
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,915
You're the guy.
They all look up to you.

335
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:36,084
Scott, I don't coach.

336
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:39,925
John, I'm asking you
as mayor of the town.

337
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:41,932
Will you coach?

338
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:47,103
<i>Look, think about it.</i>

339
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:49,273
Let me know, huh?

340
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:53,734
You know,

341
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:58,578
every ex-player turned coach says
they prefer coaching to playing.

342
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:01,083
Why would they
all say that?

343
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:04,087
Because they can't play.

344
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:13,364
So why'd you wanna come?
You never wanna come when I plough.

345
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,932
- Well, um, could you pull over?
- Sure.

346
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:28,646
What...
What are you doing?

347
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:30,782
Um...

348
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:34,682
I thought, um...

349
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,846
I think we should celebrate
you making the team.

350
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:42,119
N- Now? Here?

351
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:44,819
I don't know where else
to do it.

352
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:47,023
I got a condom too.

353
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,526
- So...
- Marla.

354
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:54,435
With you on the team, Stevie,
a lot of girls are gonna be,

355
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:57,575
you know, after you.

356
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:07,379
I don't wanna lose you toJody Lange
just 'cause she gives.

357
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:12,379
Marla.

358
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:16,324
I'm not gonna leave you
on account of not having sex.

359
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:21,465
I love you.

360
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:37,907
Are you sure?

361
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,041
Yeah, I'm sure.

362
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,959
Oh!

363
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:29,258
Oh, I'm-I'm...
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:33,734
That's okay. That's...
That's okay.

365
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:37,535
L...
Does this mean we're done?

366
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,769
I'm-I'm sorry.
I must have...

367
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:42,903
That's okay.

368
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:49,682
It's okay, Stevie.

369
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:23,654
Hey, Sarah, sorry to be calling on you
so late, but have you heard?

370
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:27,952
- The Rangers?
- Yeah.

371
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:31,926
Yeah, good news makes
the compass point north.

372
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,225
How about a quick rattle?

373
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,767
After you, Skank.

374
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:51,245
"Mother walrus going
thwap, thwap, thwap"?

375
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:54,443
- What?
- You wanna hear a thwap?

376
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:17,465
Women don't like being referred to
as fat mammals, Skank.

377
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,280
I never would've said that
to her face.

378
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:26,373
- Are you gonna arrest me?
- Do you want me to?

379
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:30,181
Well, if it's all over what he said, I'd
just as soon it'd be all over that I hit him.

380
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,958
It will be.

381
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,700
<i>You gonna let the kids keep the school?</i>

382
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,836
<i>We gotta have a new rink, Donna.</i>

383
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,337
You want one of those goddamn
TV trucks to fall through the ice?

384
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:54,036
Plus we need new boards, lights,
and they're sending us a Zamboni.

385
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,979
Oh, a Zamboni.
Gettin' wet just thinking about it.

386
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:00,084
Jesus!

387
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:09,053
- Donna. Hey.
- Hey.

388
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:11,253
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hi. Good.

389
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,364
- How are you?
- I'm good.

390
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,989
- You ran out before I could say hi last night.
- I know. Hi.

391
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:18,296
Hi.
God, you look good.

392
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,098
How can you look this good? What do
you have, like nine children now?

393
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,504
All right, well,
we're not the Partridge Family.

394
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:26,803
- Three kids.
- I know how many kids you have.

395
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:30,210
So, you're a producer, huh?

396
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:32,407
Yeah, well,
associate producer.

397
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,814
What's a producer do?

398
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:37,080
Uh, well,
I'm-I'm doing it.

399
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:40,589
- Really?
- Yes, I'm liaising with the locals.

400
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:42,955
I see.

401
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:45,460
And the helicopter was...

402
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:49,931
Well, you know, it's the kind of news
you wanna deliver in person, you know,

403
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:53,765
and I can't help it if it impressed
the hell out of you.

404
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:59,668
So, uh...
Well, so did it?

405
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,938
Do I look impressed?

406
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:06,779
You look good.

407
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,191
Your Honor,

408
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,456
at this time I'd be asking the court
to dismiss the charges...

409
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:22,863
<i>on the grounds of patriotism.</i>

410
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:25,265
I'm not in the mood,
Mr. Pruitt.

411
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:31,307
If Price World
did come here...

412
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:34,241
with the one-stop shopping
and the low, low prices,

413
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:38,577
it would threaten to put every merchant
in this town out of business,

414
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:40,343
<i>as it has in so many communities
across this country.</i>

415
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:42,976
- Trial date?
- This Tuesday.

416
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:45,646
Tuesday?

417
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,351
- Fine by me.
- All right, next Tuesday.

418
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,495
And impanel Monday.

419
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:58,895
I don't want a trial now. Suppose I
lose? I get jail, I miss the game.

420
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,597
Connor, trust me. They're not gonna
lock up our leading scorer.

421
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:09,003
As the puck comes off the ice,
the left wing will always drop back.

422
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:13,174
These four swing around here,
try and force the puck this way.

423
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:17,082
So the puck carrier is
always facing three defensemen.

424
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:19,383
<i>- Are we gonna play it?
- No.</i>

425
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:21,422
We're gonna learn it
so we can beat it.

426
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:24,323
It's five-man, not four.
It's complicated.

427
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:26,954
Before we get into that,

428
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,659
There's one rule we got we live by.

429
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:35,432
What happens in this room,

430
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:38,167
what's said in this room,
stays in this room.

431
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:42,509
Now, last night Skank
took a shovel to the temple...

432
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,774
<i>because somebody repeated what
was said in the locker room.</i>

433
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,885
<i>Somebody repeated
to Silvie Walker,</i>

434
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:51,182
<i>and Silvie Walker
repeated it to Sarah Heinz.</i>

435
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:00,953
- I told her confidentially.
- Aw, Jesus.

436
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:04,193
What you say in the room
stay in the room.

437
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,269
I didn't think she
was gonna say anything.

438
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:11,031
Skank, I'm sorry.

439
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:15,374
She just smoked the hog, man.
I wasn't myself.

440
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,841
- It's your call, Skank.
- Oh, I want it.

441
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,921
Fuck!

442
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,920
<i>Fuckin' wind-chill. This ain't right.</i>

443
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,153
It's not that easy!

444
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:35,392
<i>- One slip of the tongue. All right, that's it.
- Rules are rules!</i>

445
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,602
Come on, guys!

446
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:42,672
- Do it!
- Come on!

447
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,604
Aw, shit!

448
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:06,760
Oh, shit!
Mother...

449
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,763
<i>I hate you bastards!
I hate you all!</i>

450
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:16,805
All I did was suggest we meet,
and then he pulled out a gun.

451
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:18,909
Did he say anything,
Mr. Walsh?

452
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,671
Objection!
Now, that question...

453
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:27,978
Fuck it.

454
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:31,946
What did he say?

455
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,526
Well, he conveyed his anger at the idea
of Price World moving into the community.

456
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:39,754
<i>He threatened to shoot me if I didn't
leave the premises, and then he shot me.</i>

457
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:42,698
Thank you, Mr. Walsh.
Reserve the right to recall, Your Honor.

458
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:48,970
Big doings we've got going here
in Mystery these days, huh?

459
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:52,440
<i>Price World wants to come here,</i>

460
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,340
and now the New York Rangers
want to come.

461
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,281
Mr. Pruitt, I don't want to hear
anything about Price World.

462
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:04,547
I don't wanna hear another word about
a hockey game. We talked about this.

463
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:07,489
Yeah, well, forgive me, Your Honor.
I'm fat.

464
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,759
Mr. Walsh, that bullet
that struck you,

465
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,199
did it appear to ricochet
off a wheelbarrow?

466
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,668
It... Maybe.
So what?

467
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:27,005
Is it legal to shoot in the vicinity
of people in this town?

468
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:29,976
You don't care very much for
our community, do you, Mr. Walsh?

469
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:33,845
<i>- I have nothing against
your community, Mr. Pruitt.</i>

470
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:35,883
Did you say,

471
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,423
"What the fuck-ass fuck
of a bum-fuck shithole town is this?"

472
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:44,255
Did you say that, Mr. Walsh?

473
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:49,561
The game is tentatively
scheduled forJanuary 16.

474
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:53,398
<i>- Hey, this is it!
- Sounds like fun, Barry, but evidently not for everyone.</i>

475
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:55,539
<i>No, I don't think so, Steve.
No one thought...</i>

476
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,868
to check with the New York Ranger
players about this.

477
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,307
<i>The bottom line is, you only get
a few days off during this long season.</i>

478
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:03,572
<i>Now, instead of spending these days off
at home with their families,</i>

479
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,878
they're told they gotta go to Alaska
and play a game of pond hockey.

480
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:10,215
<i>- This is a joke.
- Turning now to real hockey news,</i>

481
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:13,551
<i>the NHL named Wayne Gretzky
as its player of the month.</i>

482
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:16,285
<i>The superstar scored 17 goals
with 22 assists...</i>

483
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:26,664
Yeah, wait till we beat 'em.
Then we'll see who's a joke.

484
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,874
You guys know what you're made of.
You know what you've got inside.

485
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:39,405
Nervous?

486
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:46,222
- Come on, let's work it around.
- Don't leave him alone!

487
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:59,001
- Whoa. That guy can shoot, huh?
- Yeah.

488
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,697
- Get on him! Get on him!
- Okay, guys, come on, now!

489
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:15,911
- Fighting the puck a little.
- Oh, let him find his legs.

490
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:18,021
Yeah, his first game.
He'll be fine.

491
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,261
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

492
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,628
Look out!

493
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:39,467
<i>Get away! Get away!</i>

494
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,273
<i>- Stevie? Stevie!
- Give him some air.</i>

495
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:46,941
<i>- Biebe.
Good work, Tree. You killed him.</i>

496
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:49,417
- Head was down.
- I know. I know.

497
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,146
I brought the salts, Dad.

498
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,494
- Stevie?
- Huh?

499
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:02,725
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Hello.

500
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:08,099
Stevie, how many fingers
have I got? Hmm?

501
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,706
I'm a premature ejaculator.

502
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:19,048
<i>Let's go, guys.
Three on three.</i>

503
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:23,348
- So?
- So?

504
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:27,218
- Anyone special in New York?
- Uh, no.

505
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,384
I don't... I don't want you
to feel bad about that either,

506
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:33,258
just 'cause I haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than six weeks...

507
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:35,763
since we broke up
in the 12th grade.

508
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,164
- That's... The important thing is that you're happy.
- Right.

509
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:41,965
You are...
You are happy, I take it?

510
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:44,974
Yeah.
I'm happy.

511
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:47,304
Good. Good.

512
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:50,003
How is your husband,
anyway?

513
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:52,674
Appears to be, uh,
well fed.

514
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,909
Of course he is.

515
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,680
I mean, what else
do I have to do, really,

516
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:02,657
besides slave over a hot stove,
rub my fat husband's feet,

517
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:07,196
dig splinters out of my ass that I get
while sitting around pining for you?

518
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,789
Well, you said it,
I didn't.

519
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:13,029
Seriously, though.
I mean, forget about me.

520
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,730
Don't you ever wish you lived
in a town that had a museum...

521
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:21,539
or someplace where brothers and sisters
were off-limits to each other sexually?

522
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,915
All right,
just follow the light.

523
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:38,586
No, just over here. There you go.
Over here. Come on.

524
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:40,926
<i>Still sleepin'?</i>

525
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,898
- How's he doin'?
- He's a little happy.

526
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,401
<i>No, no, no.
Easy, son.</i>

527
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:51,269
<i>- I'm okay. Birdie, I'm sorry.
- All right.</i>

528
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:53,309
I didn't even get
the condom on.

529
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:57,140
It was 'cause of your sister's breasts.
They're perky.

530
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:05,578
Well, he's out again.

531
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:14,688
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

532
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:20,530
- Sweetheart...
- I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

533
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:24,266
Well, if you can't talk
to your own mother...

534
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:30,409
Stevie doesn't wanna
sleep with me.

535
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:34,644
Oh. Oh.

536
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:37,987
Oh.

537
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:40,817
<i>Hmm.</i>

538
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:43,756
So, uh, you two
have already,

539
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:47,853
uh, you know,
had relations?

540
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:50,399
No, he came in the condom.

541
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:52,764
<i>Oh!</i>

542
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:55,269
Where, uh,
was the condom...

543
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:58,931
when he, uh,
you know...

544
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:00,943
<i>Um...</i>

545
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:04,673
On-On his, uh, serpent.

546
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:10,317
Hi.

547
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:14,648
What's wrong?

548
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:18,228
Uh, Walter, get out.
This is private.

549
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:20,660
I'm entitled to know
what's going on under this roof.

550
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:22,665
After all, I am
the father of this child.

551
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:26,030
Walter, if you don't leave,
I swear I'll tell you.

552
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:29,805
Right.

553
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:46,654
<i>The defendant will please rise.</i>

554
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,692
What say you, Karen?

555
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:52,921
The State of Alaska
versus Connor Banks.

556
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,021
<i>Second-degree assault.</i>

557
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:59,865
<i>We find the defendant
not guilty.</i>

558
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:07,939
That's a not guilty verdict on Connor.
Betty?

559
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:13,176
And we further order Price World
to pay damages...

560
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,341
in the amount of $42,000.

561
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:19,616
- What?
- 42,000 bucks?

562
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:22,783
They can't do that.

563
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:28,562
This is a criminal trial.

564
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:32,328
We don't award damages
to criminal defendants.

565
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:34,733
The damage award is vacated.

566
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:38,104
What's that, "vacated"?

567
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,780
Look around.
Look at yourselves.

568
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:54,285
<i>You have exalted this game
above what is right,</i>

569
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:56,723
but you have
your star center back.

570
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:01,030
<i>The defendant is free to go.</i>

571
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:05,561
You have embarrassed
my courtroom.

572
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:20,549
Thanks a lot.

573
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:22,618
Fuckin' moron.

574
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:42,703
It's me that embarrasses you,
isn't it?

575
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:50,413
- Did I say that, Brian?
- I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.

576
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:54,108
I'm sorry I don't feel like goin'
to college and getting some degree.

577
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:57,449
<i>I'm sorry for only wanting to play hockey,
and I'm sorry that you never played...</i>

578
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:01,682
in the Saturday game, but I would think
there are bigger tragedies in life!

579
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:04,953
<i>Brian!</i>

580
00:48:16,106 --> 00:48:18,666
Scotty. Hey.

581
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:21,209
I want you to meet
the folks from the network.

582
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,575
- That's Jonathan Slaven. Scott Pitcher.
- Hi.

583
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:28,151
- And, uh, this is Janice Pettibone.
- My nostrils just froze.

584
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:31,152
It's a pleasure to welcome
a famous TV personality.

585
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:34,086
- Uh, hi.
- Janice, see how everybody skates here?

586
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:36,693
- Yeah.
- Even on the sidewalks. We should get some shots...

587
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:40,024
- I can't feel my nose.
- All right, then.

588
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:46,331
- She's cold.
- She's weird.

589
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,666
"Eskimos On Ice. "

590
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:54,005
In fact, that's what we're calling
the team: The Mystery Eskimos.

591
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:58,076
Well, we're not Eskimos.

592
00:48:58,182 --> 00:49:00,810
Well, I don't think it refers
so much to your ethnicity.

593
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:05,854
And the Native Americans who do live
here call themselves Inuit, shark meat.

594
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,515
<i>The deal here is we're selling
this as a human interest story.</i>

595
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:12,390
The strange snowmen who play
on a lake... the Mystery boys.

596
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:14,987
<i>We don't know who they are
or what they are.</i>

597
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:19,501
All we know is they have poor dental
health and can skate like the wind.

598
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:23,596
It's a hockey game.

599
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:26,437
- How does she know what kind of dental health we have?
- Guys!

600
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,306
Guys!
It's just a name, you know?

601
00:49:29,446 --> 00:49:32,210
Nobody thinks the Dallas Cowboys
are actually cowboys.

602
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:34,249
- If this ends up making fun of us...
- Scott, it won't.

603
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:37,717
<i>- You think I'd let that happen?
- For business, who knows?</i>

604
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:39,755
- Excuse me?
- He's right.

605
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:41,891
- You'd bite off your own jimmy if the price were right.
- Really, Scott?

606
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:44,824
My own jimmy? You know what?
Why don't you go plan a rummage sale...

607
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:47,453
- or renew a fishing licence?
- If you try pulling something, I'll be so far up your ass...

608
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:51,295
- Gentlemen.
- You sorry piece of tit meat!

609
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:00,009
- Just talkin' about the game.
- Yeah.

610
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,908
If nothing else,
it's good for morale.

611
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:09,074
Good night.

612
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:12,587
No blood.
Judge!

613
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:15,281
- He started it.
- Don't!

614
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:17,860
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

615
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:20,122
I don't know how to coach.

616
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:23,755
You taught half the kids in this town
how to skate. You played 2-A college.

617
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,495
You understand
North American hockey.

618
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:29,970
Shit, they used to call you
the Bear.

619
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:32,302
That was then.

620
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:36,806
Okay, Judge.

621
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:39,906
If we're gonna make a game of it,
it should be you.

622
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,951
It won't be, John.

623
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:49,217
Come on! Pull it off!

624
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,955
People of Mystery,
I give you...

625
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:56,658
your very own Zamboni.

626
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,793
<i>- Now, don't be alarmed.
- It looks 100 years old.</i>

627
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:03,202
<i>Well, it works just like new,</i>

628
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:06,741
and it's kind of in keeping with
the whole idea, don't you think?

629
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:09,039
What whole idea?

630
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:13,013
Scott, you got a Zamboni here
in Mystery, Alaska.

631
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:16,551
Yeah.
The original.

632
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:45,213
Why'd you say yes to boards?
Sponsors?

633
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:50,720
You guys have never played with boards.
Won't that be a huge advantage to the Rangers?

634
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,351
John?

635
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:01,363
You've been smiling
a lot lately.

636
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:04,262
<i>- Excuse me?
- Ever since he came back.</i>

637
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:09,304
Charlie.
You've been smiling a little more.

638
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:13,505
John, that was high school.

639
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,050
This is not a pond.

640
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,324
<i>The fans are into it.</i>

641
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,428
Let's play hockey.

642
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:34,053
- Oh, there we go.
- Oh, Domi and Langdon.

643
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:39,363
Well, eight seconds in. Domi leads
the league in penalty minutes.

644
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:43,131
<i>A couple of short rights knocks the helmet
off. Another one. Are they gonna get tired?</i>

645
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:46,071
<i>- I don't know.
- We're playing these guys?</i>

646
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,644
Oh, he's landing a couple of big ones,
and so is Domi.

647
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:50,939
He's got the fans
into this one early, Sam.

648
00:52:51,048 --> 00:52:53,278
Yo, maybe we should fast-forward
to the hockey part.

649
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,975
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

650
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:58,453
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

651
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:04,260
- Come on.

652
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:07,558
<i>- Come on!</i>

653
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:11,395
- Caboose, holding on back there?
- Yeah.

654
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:13,832
<i>- Toot, toot!
- Uh-oh! Uh-oh, we're gonna crash!</i>

655
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:16,030
- Aah!
- Oh, no!

656
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:18,505
<i>- What happened down here?</i>

657
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:21,337
Are you okay? Let me see.
Are you all right?

658
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:27,077
It's a Rockewellian Christmas
up here...

659
00:53:27,217 --> 00:53:29,685
<i>skating, barbecues, snow.</i>

660
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,721
<i>We're here with defenseman
Matt Marden and...</i>

661
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,017
<i>- Cut.
- What?</i>

662
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:38,025
<i>I can't feel my fingers.</i>

663
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:41,723
You need to rub 'em on
a nice warm Yuletide log.

664
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:47,368
I beg your pardon?

665
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:52,202
Look. Christmas is a lonely day
for a guy to be choking his own chicken.

666
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:56,779
And, as women reporters go,
I find you supple.

667
00:53:59,082 --> 00:54:02,108
Oh, that was lovely. It's a shame
we weren't rolling for that.

668
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:04,811
I'm sure he'd be happy
to repeat it.

669
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:08,484
- You need to relax.
- Charles!

670
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:10,560
Do you like massages?

671
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:25,639
- Tree, take the man up front!
- Defense!

672
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:27,971
Tree, you've got to take
the man!

673
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:30,808
<i>- Jesus!
- All right, all right, all right, all right.</i>

674
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:33,006
Sorry, Johnny.

675
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:37,644
- Don't say you're sorry.
- Okay.

676
00:54:37,788 --> 00:54:39,915
Sorry.

677
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:41,957
Tree, am I a big guy?

678
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,788
Yeah, Johnny.

679
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:51,167
No. Look.

680
00:54:51,335 --> 00:54:53,769
See? You're the big guy.

681
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,966
And we need you to start
playing like a big guy.

682
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:01,134
Okay?
Are you a big guy?

683
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:03,939
- Yes, Johnny.
- Come on. Say it.

684
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:05,981
Say it!

685
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:10,820
- I'm a big guy!
- Okay!

686
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:13,320
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay.

687
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,390
Okay, hit me.

688
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:18,323
I don't want
to hit you, Johnny.

689
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:21,625
- Come on, Tree. Hit me!
- Johnny...

690
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:24,826
I'm notJohnny!
I'm a New York Ranger!

691
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:27,766
- Hit me!
- Stop it!

692
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:29,997
You look like the back end
of a moose, Sasquatch.

693
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:37,036
<i>You all right?</i>

694
00:55:37,147 --> 00:55:39,115
Just like that, Tree.

695
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:42,649
<i>- You hit me like that,
I'll kick your ass.</i>

696
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:44,686
<i>Eskimo soup.</i>

697
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:48,347
I'm beginning to have
second thoughts about this.

698
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:52,120
And having Chuck Fuck as our liaison
with the network doesn't help.

699
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:54,163
If they're gonna be pouring
a lot of money into it,

700
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:57,528
I suppose you have to let them sell it.
I suppose.

701
00:55:57,668 --> 00:55:59,829
Besides, if they're going to
be doing a profile on the town,

702
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:01,836
it's as good
as a commercial.

703
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:04,132
<i>Our tourism might grow.</i>

704
00:56:04,307 --> 00:56:06,707
You know, this is the kind
of opportunity that...

705
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:08,743
What?

706
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:15,517
What's that?

707
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:18,849
Skank Marden's
been in this bed.

708
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:50,086
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

709
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,120
Well, that's just great.

710
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:54,290
Shit!

711
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:02,194
- What?
- Uh, we got a problem.

712
00:57:02,332 --> 00:57:05,893
- What problem?
- Uh...

713
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:08,698
They're not coming.

714
00:57:10,373 --> 00:57:12,273
What do you mean,
not coming?

715
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:14,433
Evidently,
the Ranger players...

716
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:17,979
filed some kind of grievance
with the players' union,

717
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:22,313
<i>- and, uh...
- We tapped ourselves on the construction.</i>

718
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:26,946
- Are you saying that we're not
going to get that money now?

719
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:31,083
Uh, I don't think so, no.

720
00:57:34,898 --> 00:57:38,390
I'm really sorry, Scott.
I don't... I don't even...

721
00:57:40,637 --> 00:57:44,095
<i>Jesus Christ, Scott!
Ow!</i>

722
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,869
Jesus! Oh, man!

723
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,620
Hey, hey.
That's enough.

724
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:00,950
It's keeping the kids awake.
Come on.

725
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,925
I should arrest him.
That's what I should do.

726
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:08,225
Arrest him for what?

727
00:58:08,398 --> 00:58:10,298
Fraud.

728
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:21,376
Hey, he promised something
that he couldn't deliver.

729
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:23,479
This town spent money,

730
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,513
relying on
Charlie Danner's word.

731
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:27,650
Flying in here
on a helicopter,

732
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:29,684
- swinging the New York Rangers from his belt.
- Come on, John.

733
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:31,821
- You can't blame Charlie for that.
- Who else is there to blame?

734
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:34,185
You want to sympathize
with the guy, fine.

735
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:36,655
<i>But I really do not
need you taking his side.</i>

736
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,890
- Okay. What is going on?
- You tell me.

737
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:42,965
Okay, I think I've been pretty patient
with this little jealousy thing.

738
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:46,364
The truth is, I've been a little bit
flattered. Now I'm getting insulted.

739
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:48,902
<i>- You're insulted?
- Yes, John.</i>

740
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:51,997
When you read my smiling at him
as a threat, that insults me.

741
00:58:57,814 --> 00:59:01,011
It is not just
a random smile, Donna.

742
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:04,746
Ever since he came back...

743
00:59:04,888 --> 00:59:07,083
you've been walking around with
a big "what if" on your face.

744
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,692
We've been married 12 years.
Three kids.

745
00:59:09,826 --> 00:59:12,192
Sweetheart,
I know your smiles.

746
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:15,663
And that smile is not for me.

747
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:20,895
John, everyone in this goddamn town
peeks over the snowbank and wonders.

748
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:23,301
Except you wonder what
it would be like with him...

749
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:25,373
Charlie fuckin' Danner!

750
00:59:30,547 --> 00:59:33,345
Don't talk to me
about betrayal.

751
00:59:33,483 --> 00:59:37,214
You became half dead the minute you were
bumped from that team. You disappeared.

752
00:59:37,387 --> 00:59:42,222
<i>This is not an easy place
for a woman, John.</i>

753
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:45,453
I thank God every day
I gave birth to boys.

754
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:53,529
I never chose to stay.
I chose you.

755
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:56,069
<i>Give me that,
at least.</i>

756
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:16,022
Move that puck, fellas!
He's opening up!

757
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:18,856
Move that puck, fellas!
He's opening up!

758
01:00:18,895 --> 01:00:20,726
Pass it out
to the wing!

759
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:24,356
<i>Pass the puck! Pass that puck!
That a boy!</i>

760
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:28,265
Over here!
Whoo!

761
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:32,136
<i>Hi.</i>

762
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:35,870
<i>Young man,
lift your elbows.</i>

763
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:39,038
<i>And that'll keep the blade
flat on the ice.</i>

764
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:41,082
I mean, you paid
for the whole stick.

765
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:43,252
You might as well use it all, huh?
Try it.

766
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:45,286
<i>- Good! Good, McGowan!
- Good.</i>

767
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,992
Hey. I'm goin' on a piss later.
You wanna join me?

768
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:56,097
No.

769
01:00:56,299 --> 01:00:58,790
The league is taking
the players' union...

770
01:00:58,902 --> 01:01:02,099
to federal court
in New York on Tuesday.

771
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:05,105
It might help if Mystery
had a face there.

772
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:09,076
There's an estoppel argument
you could make.

773
01:01:09,212 --> 01:01:12,045
Implied third-party contract too.

774
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:14,342
Hmm.

775
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:54,347
Well, now we really have something
to talk about, don't we?

776
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:58,851
You slept with another man.

777
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,658
What's to talk about,
MaryJane?

778
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:17,413
All I've got...

779
01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:22,416
is the notion that being
adored by your husband...

780
01:02:22,552 --> 01:02:25,043
is enough in life.

781
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:30,393
<i>You never touch me.</i>

782
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:51,714
Go ahead.

783
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:03,355
<i>Nothing in the basic agreement
allows them...</i>

784
01:03:03,526 --> 01:03:05,426
to schedule
exhibition games.

785
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:08,588
- Of course we can schedule exhibition
games. - Pre-season exhibition, but...

786
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:13,532
Your Honor, nothing has ever limited
this to pre-season. You know this, Harold.

787
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,867
<i>It's a cheap stunt,
Your Honor, and everybody knows that.</i>

788
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:21,909
<i>They want the Ranger players to go up to
the North Pole and play pond hockey...</i>

789
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:24,046
with a bunch of Eskimos.

790
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,707
It's a big gimmick.
I mean, Mr. Pruitt himself...

791
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:31,252
has brought one of his
lumberjack players with him...

792
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:33,412
<i>to help him further
the exploitation.</i>

793
01:03:33,523 --> 01:03:35,423
Objection, Your Honor.

794
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:38,755
That's-That's not
a very nice thing to say.

795
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:44,392
Your Honor, we've already
spent a lot of money on this game.

796
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:47,298
You can sue the league
for restitution.

797
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:49,997
That's assuming that money
damages could make us whole.

798
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:52,768
But our reputation
has been hurt.

799
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:56,434
Reputation? Price World tried
to move up there, you opened fire.

800
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,410
What reputation?

801
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:02,985
- Could I be heard?
- Go ahead.

802
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:13,357
We do have our pride.

803
01:04:13,496 --> 01:04:15,464
And...

804
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:26,932
And, uh, maybe sometimes it's a little
too connected to how well we play hockey,

805
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:29,636
but we do have our pride.

806
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:33,806
And all of you,
and all the TV commentators...

807
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:36,510
have been going around
saying that this is a farce...

808
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:39,019
that this
is all a big joke.

809
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:42,181
Our town is a big joke.

810
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:44,326
- Is there a legal argument coming?
- It's estoppel.

811
01:04:44,427 --> 01:04:46,725
It's-It's in my brief.

812
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,627
What-What did you call...
You called my friend something before.

813
01:04:49,766 --> 01:04:53,293
- What did you call him?
- A lumberjack.

814
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:58,202
<i>That boy has a heart bigger
than this whole courtroom.</i>

815
01:04:58,341 --> 01:05:00,502
He plays to play.

816
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:03,407
He skates to skate!

817
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:05,912
He don't make
a million bucks a year!

818
01:05:06,049 --> 01:05:09,041
He loves the game of hockey!

819
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:11,210
<i>He loves it.</i>

820
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:16,557
Judge,

821
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:21,159
you can't take this game
away from us.

822
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:24,391
You can't.
It's not about money.

823
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:26,502
It's about our...

824
01:05:27,737 --> 01:05:30,433
Mr. Pruitt?
Are you all right?

825
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:36,174
<i>- Bailey?
- Mr. Pruitt?</i>

826
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:44,718
<i>- Bailey? Bailey? Bailey?
Somebody get this man some help!</i>

827
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:48,914
He's having a heart attack!
Somebody help him!

828
01:05:49,914 --> 01:05:59,914
