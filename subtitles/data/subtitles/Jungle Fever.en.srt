931
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,352  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:464 Y2:525

932
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,915  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:464 Y2:525

960
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,070  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:464 Y2:525

961
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,998  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:464 Y2:525

962
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,077  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:464 Y2:525

963
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,795  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:464 Y2:525

964
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,832  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:464 Y2:525

966
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,519  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:464 Y2:518

967
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,994  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:464 Y2:518

969
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,079  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:464 Y2:522

971
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,636  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:464 Y2:518

972
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,753  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:463 Y2:525

977
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:11,438  X1:139 X2:585 Y1:464 Y2:525
