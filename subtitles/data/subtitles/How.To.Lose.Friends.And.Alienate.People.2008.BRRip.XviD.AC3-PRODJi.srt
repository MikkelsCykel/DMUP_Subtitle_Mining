(CHUCKLES ) Like a hermit.

621
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,300
You know? I'm tracking her down.

622
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,300
''Who is the elusive Paris Hilton
and why is she so publicity shy?''

623
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,900
(LAUGHS )

624
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,900
'Cause...

625
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
Isn't it? It's good.

626
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,500
'Cause just changing it...

627
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,400
That's first room stuff, Sidney.

628
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,400
And call me Clay one more time,
see what happens.

629
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,000
(WHISPERING)
I thought that was quite good.

630
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,200
Sorry.

631
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,800
If I give you an interview,
will you leave me the fuck alone?

632
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
-Bill Nathanson, nice to meet you.
-Sidney Young, Sharps magazine.

633
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,700
Huge fan. Lovely to meet you.
I've just seen the film

634
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,400
-Rap Rat.
-Good.

635
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,900
-Did you like it?
-I did.

636
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,200
I did like it. I did. I liked
the hamster thing that you played.

637
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
-Actually, he's a chipmunk.
-Yeah.

638
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Now, I've done a bit of research

639
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,700
and I can see
that you're quite a private man.

640
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,300
-Is that right?
-Well, I like to keep a line...

641
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,300
I think that's great. That's brilliant,
but today, let's get behind the mask.

642
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,600
I don't think there really is a mask,
as such.

643
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,800
I don't mean to be a pain,
but what I really want to talk about today

644
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,900
is the new musical...

645
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,500
-Yeah.
-...and keep it about the work.

646
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,400
-Is that all right?
-Okay.

647
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,700
First question. Are you Jewish?

648
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,700
I don't see what the relevance of that is.

649
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,200
Okay. Well, fine. Second question.

650
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,800
The hamster thing that you play
in the film...

651
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
-It's a chipmunk.
-Whatever.

652
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
Is that gay?

653
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,200
-It's a chipmunk.
-I know, yeah, but is it a gay chipmunk?

654
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,000
Look, it's a kids' cartoon.
It's just a chipmunk, okay?

655
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,400
I mean,
I don't think chipmunks can be gay.

656
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,800
All right. So it's straight.
It's a straight chipmunk.

657
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,800
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Okay. Got that. So...

658
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,200
Are you gay?

659
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,100
I was...

660
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,400
I was trying to probe.

661
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,800
You want to probe,
become a proctologist.

662
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
(LAUGHS )

663
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,900
You can't ask a musical comedy star
whether he's Jewish or gay.

664
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,100
From now on, just assume
they are all Jewish and all gay.

665
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,700
-Okay?
-All right.

666
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,600
No, I'd love  this, but I'm so fat I couldn't.

667
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,100
-Get out of here.
-You look totally rexy.

668
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,700
That's so sweet.

669
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

670
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,500
I don't mean to be rude, Sidney,
but what the fuck do you want?

671
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,600
You know how things work here.

672
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,000
How am I going to get a piece
in the magazine?

673
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
I thought all this fluff was beneath you.

674
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,000
It is beneath me,
but things have changed.

675
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,800
What's changed?

676
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,200
Well, I know everybody thinks
I'm a bit of an idiot.

677
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,100
Okay, and maybe I didn't have
the best start here, but I want...

678
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,900
I want...

679
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,400
I want to have sex with Sophie Maes
before Maddox does.

680
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,900
You're loathsome, do you know that?

681
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,600
I know he's got a bit of a head start,
but I think I can win her back.

682
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,600
'Cause once I get my hooks into a girl,
she never gets free.

683
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,600
-Like ringworm.
-If you like.

684
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,600
Where are you going?

685
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
You, buddy. You big corporate dick-lick.

686
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,300
Hello, I'd like to apply
for a MasterCard, please.

687
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,200
Yeah. Hon Sidney Young.

688
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,100
Hon. H-O-N. It's short for ''Honorable.''
Yeah, it's a British title.

689
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,700
The Queen? Yeah, I know the Queen.

690
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,100
She used to be
in my break-dancing posse.

691
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,900
She's a body-popper
more than anything.

692
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,400
Fuck!

693
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,100
MADDOX: Well, Hello. Cuba !

694
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,600
(CHUCKLING)

695
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,400
He likes you.

696
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,200
So, how's it feel to be a star?

697
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,000
No, don't, it's so embarrassing. God.
Those pictures are everywhere now,

698
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,700
and I had no idea that, that dress
was so see-through.

699
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,300
Plus, everybody's talking about it
like it was some kind of stunt.

700
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
Such a cynical age.

701
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,200
Hello, Sidney.

702
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,900
Hi, I was just looking for my, you know...

703
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,300
I didn't know you were coming in today.

704
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Lawrence is taking us to lunch
at Cipriani.

705
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,300
That's nice.

706
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,400
Lawrence, can I leave Cuba here?
He doesn't like Italian food.

707
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,900
Of course you can.
He can stay in my office.

708
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,400
Sidney, fetch Cuba a bowl of water.

709
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,400
-Will you?
-Of course.

710
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,300
That is a lovely ring.

711
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,600
-Where is that from?
-It was my mother's. She gave it to me.

712
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,600
You sweetie. That is very, very...

713
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,400
So, listen.

714
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,300
You've met Vincent Lepak,
haven't you, Sidney?

715
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,100
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

716
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,800
See, he has a new movie
coming out soon,

717
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,400
and Lawrence is overstretched as it is.

718
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,100
How would you like
to do the feature on him?

719
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,100
Yeah, I would, actually.
Yes, I'd like that very much.

720
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
Well, great.

721
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,700
Maybe we can get together
and discuss the angle.

722
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,700
Okay.

723
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,100
What do you mean, ''angle''?

724
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,600
Well, I'd need to know
how we're going to present Vincent.

725
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,800
You know, check the story and so on.

726
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,100
Are you saying you want copy approval?

727
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,000
Any stories written about my clients

728
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,700
need to be in their best interest,
that's all.

729
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,900
I mean, if things work out with Vincent,

730
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,200
maybe we can talk about
a follow-up story on Sophie.

731
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,300
What do you think?

732
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,200
I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't work that way.

733
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,500
Sidney, dear...

734
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,600
Think of it like this.
You write about one of my clients,

735
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,700
you are borrowing
some of their starlight

736
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,700
to help sell your magazine.

737
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,100
All I'm saying is quid pro quo.

738
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,300
Sorry. ''Starlight''?

739
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,600
SOPHIE: I just don't usually eat carbs.
MADDOX: It's delicious.

740
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
(GROWLING)

741
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,200
Hello, Cuba. Hello.

742
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,100
It's Uncle Sidney.
Come to see how you are. Yes.

743
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,300
What's this?

744
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,800
Would you like a little  play?
Would you like a little  play?

745
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,000
(BARKING)

746
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,200
Would you like a little  play?

747
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Fetch.

748
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,600
There you go. That's it. That's it.

749
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,800
Well done. Well done.

750
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
You and me are going to be pals,
aren't we?

751
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,600
Yes, we're going to be pals, yes.

752
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,200
You're going to like me
much, much better

753
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,000
than that prick Maddox, aren't you?
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

754
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,100
Okay. Ready? Ready?

755
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,600
(DISTORTED) Oh, no!

756
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500

757
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,800
(SCRAPING)

758
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,900
Come on!

759
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Shit! Come on! Come on!

760
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,600
That's my bag.

761
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,700
Yeah, I was going to borrow it
for a second.

762
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,800
What are you talking about?

763
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,700
I'll bring it right back.
I was just going to put...

764
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,100
-Give me my bag.
-Just let me borrow it.

765
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
No. Give me my bag.

766
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,500
Give me my...

767
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,400
Oh, my God!

768
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,000
-It was an accident.
-What did you do?

769
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,800
I was trying to make friends,
and then it was...

770
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,200
Don't tell her.
Okay, just please don't tell her.

771
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,800
SOPHIE: Cuba !

772
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,700
Sorry, have you seen
this little  Chihuahua...

773
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,300
SIDNEY: Fucking heck!

774
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
MADDOX: Cuba?
SOPHIE: Cuba?

-Have you seen Cuba?
-What?

Have you seen Sophie's dog?

Well, come and help us find him.

He couldn't have gone too far.

I don't...

No, not yet.
It probably just got out the building.

Congratulations on
the Man of the Year thing.

-I don't know.

$1,000 a plate, all I could taste was ass.

I'm kissing their ass.
They're kissing my ass.

I get this dream sometimes.

I never let him know how happy I am
watching the fucker burn.

What do you want?

799
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,800
I want to write a story
about Vincent Lepak, okay?

Not a puff piece.
Something funny, with teeth.

Everyone's treating him

803
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
like he's some sort of a genius
and he's not. He's an idiot.

804

Look at these things.

805
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,200
How'd I get a closet
full of blue fucking shirts?

This is an office, for God's sake.

Why have I even got a fucking closet?

810

Flowers? Yeah, 'cause she doesn't
get enough flowers, does she?

When I met you,
I thought you were bit of a pain,

How can you live with yourself?

I couldn't.
That's why I've broken up with him.

or like a pig, maybe.

And they walk all funny,

from them.

-Weird.

It's all happening so fast,

1120

it has nothing to do with me.

respected magazines in the world.

There's a million hacks that would
give anything to be where I am.

Do you know who I hung out with
just today? Orlando Bloom.

1244
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,800
-I don't know who that is.
-Of course you don't know who that is.

You don't know who anyone is.

You thought Brad Pitt
was a cave in Yorkshire.

1247
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,300
The thing is most people do know
who that is, all right?

1248
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,300
And most people wouldn't think
a journalist hanging out

1249
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,400
with celebrities like that
was a disappointment.

1250
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,700
I don't think
you're a disappointment, Sidney.

I've never thought that.

I'm sorry. I...

1253
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
I didn't mean to upset you.

1254

actually, Dad.

I can't seem to get ahead.

-No, I'm fine.

She wouldn't have anything to do
with your desire to stay on, would she?

1263
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,200
No, we're just friends.

1264
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,400
Anyway, she says that New York women
don't go for losers.

1265
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,800
I suppose not.

1266
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,800

-Mrs. Kowalski?

Don't worry about it. The last woman
she caught me with had a penis.

-That's my mother.

-Was she a model?
-Actress.

-No. She died when I was young.

Must be pretty cool
having your mom in a movie.

01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,600
Get over it

1706
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:14,400
D'you want my side,
my side of the story

1707
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:20,900
D'you want my side,
my side of the story

1708
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:27,700
Well, I want you,
want you like I'm eighteen

1709
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,900
But I'm tied, tied to my baby

1710
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,600
To my baby
Oh!

1711
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:41,600
(ENOUGH LOVE PLAYING)

1712
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:55,500
What hurts but feels so fine

1713
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,900
What turns water into wine

1714
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,300
lt runs so deep in you and me

1715
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:11,700
From a fountain to a river
to the seven seas

1716
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:15,400
Too much push and shove

1717
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,200
With not enough love to go round

1718
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:22,600
I finally found

1719
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:25,700
There must be enough love

1720
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:27,600
To go round the world

1721
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:31,300
There must be enough love

1722
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,300
To go round the world

1723
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:36,600
There must be enough love

1724
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,600
To go round the world

1725
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:45,100
There must be enough love, love, love

1726
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:58,900
Woohoo

1727
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:09,900
