1
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,004
The peace of God,
which passes all understanding.

2
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,014
Keep your hearts and minds
in the knowledge and love of God...

3
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,516
and of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

4
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,952
The blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit...

5
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:07,459
be upon you and remain with you
this day and always.

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,528
Amen.

7
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,824
Will that do the trick, do you think?

8
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,901
We're about to find out.

9
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,076
Jimmy!

10
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,147
Ready?

11
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,240
Ready.

12
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,319
Mum, please. Lads, one-

13
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,388
Just get in the car.
I'll be back. Five minutes.

14
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,759
Let's get it over with.

15
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,421
Ah-ah. Give me a minute.

16
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,194
- Read it out. Fiona, just read it out!
- Let's see, let's see.

17
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,599
Three A's!

18
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,069
- I got three A's! Three A's!
- Chris, what'd you get?

19
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,573
Full house!

20
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,303
- Full house!
- Three A's! Three A's!

21
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,881
- Told you you would!
- Full house!

22
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,350
- Hey, what'd you get?
- "A" and two B's.

23
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,183
Fucking hell!

24
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,190
Hey! Hey, Dakin!

25
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,056
- Stu!
- Stu, what happened?

26
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,463
Yeah!

27
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,728
- Are you not gonna look?
- No, I got mine last night.

28
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,636
- I'll bet you did.
- You jammy sod!

29
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,434
- Lockwood.
- Felix.

30
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,204
- Sir?
- Why are you dressed as a milkman?

31
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,872
Working, sir, for the holidays.

32
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,779
As a milkman?

33
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,786
After the holidays, you'll be coming back
to try for Oxford and Cambridge.

34
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,789
Your A-level results
are the best we've ever had...

35
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,952
and they demand that you return for
an extra term to work for the examination...

36
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,962
to our ancient universities.

37
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,828
One more term, boys.
One more push.

38
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,164
In the meantime, try and do
something, oh, fitting.

39
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,329
- I'm in a book shop, sir.
- Good. Good.

40
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,964
- I'm on the bins, sir.
- I'm a bouncer, sir.

41
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,770
- Lavatory attendant, sir.
- Gigolo.

42
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,640
Congratulations, boys.

43
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,509
Oh.! Mrs. Lintott.!

44
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,310
Hey-hey-hey!

45
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,112
- Three A's! Three A's!
- Three A's! All right!

46
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,187
Mr. Hector!

47
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,087
So we shall be meeting again
after all.

48
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,093
- Yes!
- Yes!

49
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:26,188
At school you don't get parole.
Good behavior just brings a longer sentence.

50
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,597
Ah, you poor boys.

51
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,102
Hey, see you next term, sir!

52
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,105
Thank you, miss.

53
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,199
"The happiest youth,
viewing his progress through...

54
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,973
"what perils past,
what crosses to ensue...

55
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,811
would shut the book
and sit him down and die. "

56
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,344
Congratulations, Dorothy.
You must be very pleased.

57
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,866
Good morning!

58
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:50,749
You are entitled-

59
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,750
though only for five minutes, Dakin-

60
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,752
to feel pleased with yourselves.

61
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:59,382
No one has done as well,
not in English, not in science...

62
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,053
not even, dare I say it,
in media studies.

63
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,063
And you alone are up
for Oxford and Cambridge.

64
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,065
So, to work.

65
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,398
First essay this term will be the Church
on the eve of the Reformation.

66
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,962
- Not again, miss.
- This is Oxford and Cambridge.

67
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,975
You don't just need to know it.
You need to know it backwards, Timms.

68
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,170
Facts, facts, facts.

69
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,974
They're clever.

70
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,072
But they're crass.

71
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,879
And were it Bristol...

72
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,749
or York...

73
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,755
I'd have no worries.

74
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,757
But Oxford and Cambridge!

75
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,123
We need a strategy, Dorothy.

76
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,128
A game plan.

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,130
They know their stuff.

78
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,496
But they lack flair.

79
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:46,538
Culture they can get from Hector,
uh, history from you.

80
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,473
But-
I'm thinking aloud now.

81
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,601
Is there something else?

82
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,613
Think charm.

83
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,615
Think polish.

84
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,880
Think... renaissance man.

85
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,512
Leave it with me, Dorothy.
Leave it with me.

86
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,591
Yes, Headmaster.

87
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,795
Wilkes.

88
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,799
Ah, yes.
An innovation to the timetable.

89
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,801
- P.E.
- Yes, Headmaster.

90
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,804
For the Oxbridge set.
Surely not, you say.

91
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,273
But why not?
This is the biggest hurdle of their lives.

92
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,936
And I want them... galvanized.

93
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,741
Galvanized. Yes, Headmaster.

94
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,650
In the timetable...

95
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,815
our esteemed headmaster has given
these periods the dubious title...

96
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,758
of"General Studies. "

97
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,059
I will let you into a little secret, boys.

98
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:50,067
There is no such thing
as "general studies. "

99
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,627
General studies is a waste of time.

100
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,538
Knowledge is not general.

101
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,873
It is specific...

102
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,140
and nothing to do with getting on.

103
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,411
But remember-
open quotation marks-

104
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,547
"All knowledge is precious, whether or not
it serves the slightest human use. "

105
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,557
Close quotation marks.

106
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,559
Who said, Akhtar?

107
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,721
Timms? Lockwood? Dakin?

108
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,530
- "Loveliest of trees, the cherry now. "
- A.E. Houseman, sir!

109
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,537
A.E. Houseman, sir!

110
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,539
Wasn't he a nancy, sir?

111
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,973
Foul, festering,
grubby-minded little trollop!

112
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,978
- Do not use that word!
- But you use it, sir!

113
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,981
I do, sir, I know, but I am far gone
in age and decrepitude.

114
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,849
You're not supposed to hit us, sir,
or we could report you.

115
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,854
- I know, I know.
- You should treat us with more respect.

116
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,856
We're scholarship candidates now, sir.

117
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,324
We're all going in
for Oxford and Cambridge.

118
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,827
Oxford and Cambridge?
What for?

119
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,830
Old, sir! Tried and tested.

120
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,595
No, it's because other boys want to go there.
It's the hot ticket.

121
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,602
Standing room only.

122
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,968
- Where did you go, sir?
- I went to Sheffield.

123
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,473
I was happy.

124
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,410
"Happy is England,
sweet her artless daughters;

125
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,505
Enough her simple
loveliness for me. "

126
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,516
Keats.

127
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,519
We won't be examined
on that, though, will we, sir?

128
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,816
- Keats?
- Happiness.

129
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,296
- You are?
- Irwin.

130
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,196
- Irwin.
- The temporary contract teacher?

131
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,269
Quite so.

132
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,771
The examinations
are at the end of term...

133
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,569
which gives us, uh,
three months at the outside.

134
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,442
- You were at Cambridge. You know the form.
- Oxford. Jesus.

135
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,572
Ah. Yes, I- I thought of going.

136
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,448
But this was the- the '50s.

137
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,919
Change was in the air...

138
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,990
a spirit of adventure.

139
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,582
So, where did you go?

140
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,131
I was a geographer.
I went to Hull.

141
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,534
They're a likely lot, the boys.

142
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,230
Um, they're all keen.

143
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,500
One oddity- Rudge.

144
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,508
Determined to try for Oxford...

145
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,510
and Christ Church, of all places.

146
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,046
No hope.

147
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,945
Might get into Loughborough
in a bad year.

148
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,950
Um, o-otherwise all bright.

149
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,715
But they need polish, edge.

150
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,984
Your job.

151
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,992
We are low in the league.

152
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,655
I want to see us up there
with Manchester Grammar School...

153
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,427
Haberdashers' Aske's,
Leighton Park.

154
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,771
Or is that an open prison?

155
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,840
No matter.

156
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,713
There is a vacancy in history.

157
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,185
That's very true.

158
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,655
In the school.

159
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,588
Ah.

160
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,218
Get me scholarships, Irwin.

161
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,764
Pull us up the table and it's yours.

162
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,233
I- I-I'm corseted by the curriculum.

163
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,567
But I can find you, uh,
three lessons a week.

164
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,073
- Not enough.
- No, I-I-Yes, I agree, I agree.

165
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,942
However, I think I know
where we can filch an hour.

166
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,437
Où voudriez-vous
travailler cet après-midi?

167
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,382
Je voudrais travailler
dans une maison de passe.

168
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,316
Ooh-la-la!

169
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,320
- Comment, "maison de passe"?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?

170
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,323
A brothel. He'd like to work in a brothel.

171
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,586
Oui. Très bien.

172
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:13,256
Mais une maison de passe
où tous les clients...

173
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,232
utilisent le subjonctif,
ou le conditionnel.

174
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,935
- Oui?
- D'accord, monsieur.

175
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,973
Voilà. Voilà.!

176
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,803
Déjà un client.

177
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,009
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Bonjour, chérie.

178
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,845
Entrez, si'I vous plaît.

179
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,920
Voilà. Votre lit.

180
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,055
Et voici votre prostituée.

181
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,128
- For fuck's sake!
- Ooh-la-la!

182
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,129
Je veux m'étendre sur le lit.

183
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,028
Je voudrais.!

184
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,035
"I would like to stretch out on the bed,"
in the conditional or the subjunctive.

185
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,731
Continuez, mes enfants.

186
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,672
Mais les chaussures, monsieur.
Pas sur le lit.

187
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,438
Oh, excusez-moi, mademoiselle.
Excusez-moi.

188
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,548
Et votre pantalon, s'il vous plaît.

189
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,618
- Fucking hell!
- Sir, come on!

190
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,482
Sir-

191
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,558
Oh.! Quelles belles jambes.

192
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,721
Et maintenant, Claudine.!

193
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,664
Oui. La prostituée,
si'I vous plaît.

194
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,433
Whoo-ooh!

195
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,439
A quel prix?

196
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,441
- Dix francs.
- Dix francs.

197
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,910
Pour dix francs, je peux vous montrer
ma prodigieuse poitrine.!

198
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,481
Non, non, non, non.

199
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,483
Ça vous coûterait quinze francs.

200
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,179
Non. Pour vingt francs-

201
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,689
- Un autre client.!
- Oh, my God.!

202
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,726
Ah! Cher Monsieur le directeur!

203
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,490
- Mr. Hector, what on earth is happening?
- Ah-ah-ah!

204
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,997
L 'anglais c'est interdit.

205
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,226
Ici, on ne parle que francais...

206
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:01,102
en accordant une importance
particulière au subjonctif.

207
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,107
Oh.

208
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,109
Um-

209
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,611
Et qu'est-ce qui se passe ici?

210
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,613
Pourquoi ce garçon-

211
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,876
- Um, Dakin, isn't it?
- Sir.

212
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,385
Est sans ses... trousers.

213
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,387
- Fuck's sakes.
- Oh, um-

214
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,047
Quelqu'un?

215
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,651
Oh, ne sois pas timide.

216
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:28,597
Dites à cher Monsieur le directeur
ce que nous faisons.

217
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,206
- Je suis un homme qui-
- Vous n'êtes pas un homme.!

218
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,743
Vous êtes un soldat.
Un soldat blessé.

219
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,608
Vous comprenez cher Monsieur le directeur.
Soldat blessé?

220
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,614
Wounded soldier?
Yes, yes, of course.

221
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,277
Ici c'est un hôpital en Belgique.

222
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,617
Belgique? Pourquoi Belgique?

223
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,560
- A Ypres, sir. Ypres.
- Ypres?

224
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,324
- Ypres?
- Pendant la Guerre Mondiale Numéro Un.

225
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,422
- It's Ypres, sir.
- C'est ça.!

226
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,763
Dakin est un soldat blessé.

227
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,928
Un mutilé de guerre.

228
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:11,237
Et les autres sont
des médecins, infirmières...

229
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:16,576
et tout le personnel d'un grand établissement
médical et thérapeutique.

230
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,582
Continuez, mes enfants.

231
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,175
Qu'il souffre.!

232
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,984
- Ma mère.! Ma mère.!
- Il appelle sa mère.

233
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,582
- Mon père.! Mon père.!
- Il appelle son père.

234
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,186
Il est distrait. Il est distrait.

235
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,529
Il est commotionné, peut-être?

236
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,363
Comment?

237
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,464
Commotionné.
Shell-shocked.

238
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,311
C'est possible. Commotionné.
Oui. C'est le motjuste.

239
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:54,319
Permettez-moi d'introduire Monsieur Irwin,
notre nouveau professeur.

240
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,320
- Enchanté.
- Bonjour.

241
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,515
Enough of this silliness-
N- N-Not silliness.

242
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,115
Mr. Hector, you are aware these pupils
are Oxbridge candidates.

243
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,626
Are they? Are you sure?
Nobody's told me.

244
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,630
Mr. Irwin will be coaching them.
But it's a question of time.

245
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,633
- I've found him three lessons a week,
but I was wondering- - No, Headmaster.

246
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,636
No, purely on a temporary basis.
The last time. I promise.

247
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,638
The last time was the last time also.

248
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,540
- I'm thinking of the boys!
- I too. No. Absolutement. No. No, no, no.

249
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,544
C'est hors de question.

250
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,308
Et puis, si vous voulez m'excuser,
je dois continuer la leçon.

251
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,315
A tout à I'heure.

252
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,079
Fuck.

253
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,559
It's true, though, sir.

254
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,563
We don't have much time.

255
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,633
We don't even have to do French.

256
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,268
Now, who goes home?

257
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,536
Well, surely I can give somebody a lift.

258
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,701
Who's on pillion duty? Dakin!

259
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,711
Not me, sir.

260
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,713
I'm going into town.

261
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,045
- Crowther?
- No, I'm off for a run, sir.

262
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,210
- Akhtar.
- Computer club, sir.

263
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,844
Ah.

264
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,423
- I'll come, sir.
- Oh, no. Never mind.

265
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,626
I'll come, sir.

266
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,026
Oh. Scripps.

267
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,933
The things I do forJesus.

268
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,094
It's never me.

269
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,103
You're too young still.

270
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,106
It will happen,
now that you've achieved puberty.

271
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,109
If rather late in the day.

272
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,113
Mr. Hector is likely at some point
to try and put his hand on your knee.

273
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,548
This is because Mr. Hector
is a homosexual and a sad fuck.

274
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,553
The drill is to look at the hand and go...

275
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,055
"And what does Mr. Hector want?"

276
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,616
Well, he has no answer for this,
and so will desist.

277
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,813
Thrutch up.

278
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,219
I just think I should have been told.

279
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,223
Well, he comes highly recommended.

280
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,225
- So did Anne of Cleves.
- Who?

281
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,228
He's up to the minute, Dorothy.
More "now. "

282
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,730
"Now"?
I thought history was then.

283
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,735
Felix.

284
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,232
Anne of Cleves. Remind me.

285
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,740
- Fourth wife of Henry VIII, sir.
- Of course.

286
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,743
She was the one
they told him was Miss Dish.

287
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,680
Only when she turned up, she had a face
like the wrong end of a camel's turd.

288
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,751
Quite so.

289
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,358
What's the matter with you, lad?

290
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,360
Oh. I've got a note, sir.

291
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,362
How much for?

292
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,523
I don't do notes. Get changed.

293
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,534
- Sir-
- God doesn't do notes either.

294
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:34,538
Did Jesus say, "Can I be excused
the crucifixion?" No.

295
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,370
Actually, sir, I think he did.

296
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,376
Change!

297
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,537
One day it'll save your life.

298
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,047
Nothing saves anyone's life, sir.

299
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,049
It just postpones their death.

300
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,052
Jesus Christ will save your life, lad...

301
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,554
if you only let him into your heart.

302
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,625
I'm Jewish, sir.

303
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,961
I'm Muslim, sir.

304
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,696
Bloody good.

305
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,532
That was excellent.

306
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,974
Lad, lad, lad.

307
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,746
You're letting yourself down.
You're letting God down!

308
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,753
What's God got to do with it?

309
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,756
- Listen, boy, this isn't your body.
- No?

310
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,656
No. This body
is on loan to you from God.

311
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,661
Well, fuck me.

312
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,594
I heard that. Give me 20.

313
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,759
Twenty what? Hail Marys?

314
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,268
Do it.

315
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,574
You're late.

316
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,839
- Get your kit off.
- I'm on the staff.

317
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,006
Well, I've never seen you.

318
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,448
What's this?

319
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,348
- Do you need a hand with that, sir?
- Is it joined-up writing?

320
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,291
So, Mrs. Lintott's given me a view
of some of your latest essays.

321
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,295
The experience was interesting.
The essays, not.

322
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,922
Dull.

323
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,264
Dull. Abysmally dull.

324
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,430
A triumph- the dullest of the lot.

325
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,007
Well, I got all the points.

326
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,205
I didn't say it was wrong. I said it was dull.
Its sheer competence was staggering.

327
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,974
You've got crap handwriting, sir.

328
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,141
- It's your eyesight that's bad. We know what that's caused by.
- Sir!

329
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,277
Is that a coded reference
to the mythical dangers of self-abuse?

330
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,846
- Possibly. It might even be a joke.
- Ajoke, sir? Oh.

331
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,291
Are jokes gonna be a feature, sir?
We need to know, as it affects our mind-set.

332
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,796
You don't object to our using
the expression "mind-set,"do you, sir?

333
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,866
Mr. Hector doesn't care for it.

334
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,939
At the, uh-
At the time of the Reformation...

335
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,272
there were 14
foreskins of Christ preserved.

336
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:56,279
But it was thought the Church of St. John
Lateran in Rome had the authentic prepuce.

337
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,316
Don't think we're shocked by your mention
of the word "foreskin," sir.

338
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,215
No, sir.

339
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,550
Some of us even have them.

340
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,556
Not Posner, though, sir,
'cause he's, well, Jewish.

341
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,559
- It's one of several things he doesn't have.
- Fuck off.

342
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,561
- That's not racist, though, sir.
- Isn't it?

343
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,564
That's race-related, but not racist.

344
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,157
Has anybody been to Rome or Venice?

345
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,170
Or... Florence?

346
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,173
No. 'Cause the other candidates
will have been.

347
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,176
And they'll have done courses
on what they've seen there, most likely.

348
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,179
So they're gonna know, when they
come to do an essay like this...

349
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,182
on the Church at the time
of the Reformation that, ooh, look...

350
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,185
some silly nonsense on the foreskins
of Christ will come in handy...

351
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,552
so that their essays,
unlike yours, will not be dull.

352
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,125
They're not even bad.
They're just boring.

353
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,456
You haven't got a hope.

354
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,860
- So why are we bothering?
- I don't know.

355
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,762
You tell me. You want it?

356
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,563
Your parents want it.

357
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,570
The headmaster, he certainly wants it.

358
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,572
Me? I wouldn't waste the money.

359
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,642
I'd go to Newcastle and be happy.

360
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,447
Of course, there is another way.

361
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,209
Ooh! Wow!

362
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,148
Cheat!

363
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,949
Possibly.

364
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,886
Dakin.

365
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,926
- Sir?
- Don't take the piss. There isn't time.

366
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:19,588
- What a wanker.
- They all have to do it, don't they?

367
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,599
- Do what?
- Show you they're still in the game.

368
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,101
Foreskins and stuff.
"Oh, sir, you devil!"

369
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:29,162
Have a heart. He is only five minutes
older than we are.

370
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,245
What happened with Hector
on the bike?

371
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,247
As per.

372
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,544
Except I managed to get my bag down.

373
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,881
I think he thought he'd got me going.

374
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,547
In fact, it was my Tudor Economic
Documents Volume 2.

375
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,318
So, let's summarize.
The first world war.

376
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,654
- What points do we make?
- Trench warfare.

377
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,660
- Mountains of dead.
- On both sides.

378
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,662
- Generals stupid.
- On both sides.

379
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,460
- Armistice. Germany humiliated.
- Keep it coming.

380
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,467
- Mass unemployment.
- Inflation.

381
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,868
Collapse of the Weimar Republic,
internal disorder and the rise of Hitler.

382
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,964
So, our overall conclusion
is that the origins of the second war...

383
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,067
lie in the unsatisfactory outcome
of the first.

384
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,203
Yes.

385
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,145
- Yes.
- First-class.

386
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,979
Bristol welcomes you with open arms.

387
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,986
Manchester longs to have you.
You can walk into Leeds.

388
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,488
But I'm a fellow
of Magdalen College, Oxford.

389
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,685
I've just read 70 papers, they're all saying
the same thing, and I'm asleep.

390
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,558
- But it's all true.
- What's truth got to do with it?

391
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,323
What's truth got to do with anything?

392
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,267
The new man seems clever.

393
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,530
He does. Depressingly so.

394
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,641
Didn't you try for Oxford?

395
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,973
Cambridge.

396
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,547
Cloisters.

397
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,548
Ancient libraries.

398
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,211
I was confusing learning
with the smell of cold stone.

399
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,880
If I had gone, I'd probably never
have worked out the difference.

400
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,890
Durham was very good for history.

401
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:30,758
It's where I had my first pizza.

402
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:35,265
Other things too, of course,
but it's the pizza that stands out.

403
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,862
Dakin's a good-looking boy,
though somehow sad.

404
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,807
You always think they're sad, Hector.
Every, every time.

405
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,312
Actually, I wouldn't have said he was sad.
I would've said he was cunt-struck.

406
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,314
Dorothy!

407
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,543
I'd have thought you'd have liked that.

408
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,279
It's a compound adjective.

409
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,379
- You like compound adjectives.
- Yeah.

410
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,389
Oh. Going walkabout.

411
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,825
Oh, yeah.

412
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,631
The truth was, in 1914
Germany doesn't want war.

413
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,169
Yeah, there's an arms race,
but it's Britain who's leading it.

414
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,239
So, why does no one admit this?

415
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,442
That's why- the dead.

416
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,444
The body count.

417
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,447
We still don't like to admit the war
was even partly our fault...

418
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,779
'cause so many of our people died.

419
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,785
And all the mournings
veiled the truth.

420
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,788
It's not "Lest we forget,"
it's "Lest we remember. "

421
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,256
That's what all this is about-

422
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,422
the memorials, the cenotaph,
the two-minute silence.

423
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,592
Because there is no better way of forgetting
something than by commemorating it.

424
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,865
And as for the truth, Scripps,
which you're worrying about, forget it.

425
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,031
In an examination,
truth's not an issue.

426
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,301
You really believe this, sir...

427
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,003
or are you just trying
to make us think?

428
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,012
You can't explain away
the poetry, sir.

429
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,639
- No, sir. Art wins in the end.
- What about this one, sir?

430
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,615
"Those long, uneven lines...

431
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:05,281
"standing as patiently as if they were
stretched outside The Oval or Villa Park...

432
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,449
"the crowns of hats...

433
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,188
"the sun on mustached, archaic faces...

434
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,629
grinning as if it were all
an August bank holiday lark. "

435
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,633
"Never such innocence,
never before or since...

436
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,726
as changed itself to past
without a word. "

437
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,135
"The men leaving the gardens tidy. "

438
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,902
"The thousands of marriages
lasting a little while longer. "

439
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,534
"Never such innocence again. "

440
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,738
How come you know all this by heart?

441
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,312
Not that it answers the question.

442
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,982
So much for our glorious dead.

443
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,853
Quite.

444
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,517
Actually, Fiona's my western front.

445
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,687
Well, last night, for instance.

446
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,357
I thought it might be the big push.

447
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,400
So, encountering
only token resistance...

448
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,767
I reconnoitered the ground
as far as the actual place.

449
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,272
- Shit!
- No, I mean, not onto it.

450
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,274
And certainly not into it.

451
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,640
- Up to it.
- Fuck.

452
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,576
And the metaphor really fits.

453
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,081
I mean...

454
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,083
moving up to the front...

455
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:11,087
troops presumably had to pass
the sites of previous battles.

456
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,521
Well, so it is with me.

457
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,855
Like, particularly her tits...

458
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,589
which only surrendered
about three weeks ago...

459
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:24,465
and which were indeed the start line
of a determined thrust southwards.

460
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,939
What's the matter?

461
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,873
No-man's-land.

462
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,105
Oh, fuck.
So, what do I do with this?

463
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,782
Carry out a controlled explosion?

464
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,556
Still, least I'm doing better than Felix.

465
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,558
- Felix?
- No!

466
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,560
Tries to.
Chases her around the desk.

467
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,062
Ooh!

468
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,496
Actually, the metaphor isn't exact...

469
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,128
because what Fiona is presumably
carrying out is a planned withdrawal.

470
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:04,834
You're not forcing her. She's not
being overwhelmed by superior forces.

471
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,844
- Does she like you?
- Of course she likes me.

472
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,846
Then you're not disputing the territory.

473
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,849
You're just negotiating
over the pace of the occupation.

474
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,852
Just let us know
when you get to Berlin.

475
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,854
I'm beginning to like him more.

476
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,856
Who? Me?

477
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,858
Irwin.

478
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,860
Though he hates me.

479
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,157
Jimmy.!

480
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,164
Wait for me.

481
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,167
Cheer up. Least he speaks to you.

482
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,261
Most guys wouldn't even speak to you.

483
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,273
Love can be very irritating.

484
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,275
How do you know?

485
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,777
That's what I always think about God.

486
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,781
Must get so pissed off,
everybody adoring him all the time.

487
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,785
Yes, only you don't catch God
poncing about in his underpants.

488
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,748
Well done, Posner.

489
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,983
And now for some poetry
of a more traditional sort.

490
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,992
Oh, God!

491
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:39,461
Uh, Timms, w-what is this?

492
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,590
Sir, I don't always understand poetry.

493
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,895
You don't always understand it?

494
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,166
Timms, I never understand it.

495
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,741
But learn it now, know it now...

496
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,310
and you will understand it...
whenever.

497
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,504
I don't see how we can
understand it.

498
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,275
Most of the stuff poetry's about
hasn't happened to us yet.

499
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,783
But it will, Timms. It will.

500
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,718
And when it does,
you'll have the antidote ready.

501
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,085
Grief, happiness.

502
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,249
Even when you're dying.

503
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,452
We're making your deathbeds here, boys.

504
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,496
- Fucking Ada.
- We've got an ending, sir!

505
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,999
Re- Oh! Goody goo-Yes!
Well, be sharp. Where's the kitty?

506
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,638
We have to smoke, sir.

507
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,470
And I happen to have some, sir.

508
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,544
Very well.

509
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,451
Jerry, please help me.

510
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,181
- Shall we just have a cigarette on it?
- Yes.

511
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,672
- May I sometimes come here?
- Whenever you like.

512
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,971
It's your home too.
There are people here who love you.

513
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,046
And will you be happy, Charlotte?

514
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,809
Oh, Jerry,
don't let's ask for the moon.

515
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,044
We have the stars!

516
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,820
Lovely!

517
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,694
Mmm!

518
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,895
Could it be Paul Henreid and Bette Davis
in Now, Voyager?

519
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,600
- Oh, fucking hell!
- It is famous, you ignorant little tarts!

520
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,610
- But we never heard of it, sir!
- Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass.

521
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:38,705
"The untold want,
by life and land ne'er granted...

522
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,686
Now, voyager, sail thou forth
to seek and find. "

523
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,189
Fifty "p," please.

524
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,894
Ah, Rudge.

525
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,565
- There's nothing on the Carry On films.
- Why? Should there be?

526
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,568
The exam.

527
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,400
Mr. Irwin said the Carry Ons
would be good films to talk about.

528
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,806
How peculiar.
Does he like them, do you think?

529
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,470
Probably not.

530
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,479
You never know with him.

531
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,482
I'm now wondering if there's
something there that I've missed.

532
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,486
Well, Mr. Irwin says that...

533
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,955
"Whilst they have
no intrinsic artistic merit, they-

534
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,962
"they achieve
some of the permanence of art...

535
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,964
"simply by persisting...

536
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,967
and acquire incremental significance
if only as social history. "

537
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,163
Dear me.
What fun you must all have.

538
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,900
It's not like your stuff, miss.

539
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,068
It's cuttin' edge. It really is.

540
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,822
Where do you live, sir?

541
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,827
- Portsmouth.
- That's not far from Mr. Hector, sir.

542
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,329
He might even give you a lift
if you ask him.

543
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,262
It's not a loft, is it, sir?

544
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,267
Do you exist on an unhealthy diet
of take-away food, sir...

545
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,769
or do you whisk up
gourmet meals for one?

546
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,272
- Or is it a lonely pizza, sir?
- I manage.

547
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:14,037
- No questions from you, Dakin?
- What they want to know, sir, is, do you have a life?

548
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,545
Or are we it? Are we your life?

549
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,548
It's pretty dismal if you are,
'cause these are as dreary as ever.!

550
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:25,053
You get a question, you know the answer,
but then so does everybody else.

551
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,057
So say something different.
Say the opposite.

552
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,389
Okay, look, take Stalin.

553
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,896
He's generally agreed to be
a monster, and rightly.

554
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,558
So dissent.

555
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:41,001
Find something, anything,
and say it in his defense.

556
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,905
A question is about what you know.
It's not about what you don't know.

557
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,068
A question about Rembrandt,
for instance...

558
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,373
might prompt an answer on Degas.

559
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,380
Is Degas an old master?

560
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,383
About suffering, they were
never wrong, sir, the old masters.

561
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,716
How it takes place while someone's
eating or openin' a window.

562
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,222
- Have you done that with Mr. Hector?
- Done what, sir?

563
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,656
The poem. You're quoting somebody.
Auden, isn't it?

564
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,660
Was it, sir?

565
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,560
Sometimes it just flows out,
you know, brims over.

566
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,657
- Does he have a program, or is it just at random?
- It's just knowledge, sir.

567
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,168
The pursuit of it
for its own sake, sir.

568
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,671
Breaking bread with the dead, sir.
That's what we do.

569
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,367
- It's higher than your stuff. It's nobler.
- Only not useful.

570
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:22,207
- Mr. Hector's not as focused.
- No, he's blurred, sir.

571
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,214
And we know
what we're doing with you, sir.

572
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,217
Half the time with him
we don't know what we're doing at all.

573
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,220
- We're poor little sheep that have lost our way, sir.
- Sit down.

574
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,256
Where are we, sir?

575
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,554
You're very young, sir.
This isn't your gap year, is it, sir?

576
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,561
I wish it was.

577
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,564
Why, sir? Do you not like teaching us?

578
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:45,227
We're notjust a hiccup between the end
of university and the beginning oflife...

579
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,429
like Auden, are we, sir?

580
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,406
- Do you like Auden's poetry, sir?
- Some, yeah.

581
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,603
Mr. Hector does.
We know about Auden.

582
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,612
Oh, yes.

583
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,478
- He was a schoolmaster for a bit.
- I believe he was.

584
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,415
Yeah, he was.

585
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,046
Do you think he was more like you
or more like Mr. Hector?

586
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,647
I have no idea.
Why should he be like either of us?

587
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:12,218
Oh, I think he was more like Mr. Hector-
bit of a shambles.

588
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,026
He snogged his pupils.

589
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,623
Auden, sir. Not Mr. Hector.

590
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,397
So you could answer a question
on Auden then.

591
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,404
No, sir.!

592
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,407
Mr. Hector's stuff's not meant for the exam!

593
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,410
It's to make us
more rounded human beings.

594
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:32,414
Listen, this examination is going to be about
everything and anything you know and are.

595
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,746
If there's a question on Auden,
or whoever...

596
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,752
and you know about it, answer it!

597
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,755
We couldn't do that, sir.
That would be a betrayal of trust.

598
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,916
Yeah! Is nothing sacred, sir?
We're shocked!

599
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,927
I would, sir, and they would.
They're taking the piss.

600
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,963
"England, you've been here too long...

601
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,329
"and the songs you sing
are the songs you sung on a braver day.

602
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,561
Now they are wrong. "

603
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,695
- Who's that?
- Oh, Mr. Irwin!

604
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,206
Don't you know, sir? It's Stevie Smith
of"Not Waving but Drowning" fame.

605
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,709
Well, don't tell me
that's useless knowledge.

606
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,644
Listen, if you get an essay
on post-imperial decline...

607
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,842
losing an empire, finding a role,
all that kind of stuff...

608
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,114
a gobbet like that,
it's the perfect way to end it.

609
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,848
A what, sir?

610
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,115
A gobbet.

611
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,285
A quotation.

612
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:20,296
How much more stuff like this
have you got up your sleeves?

613
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,526
- We've got all sorts. Hey! The train, the train!
- Whoo!

614
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,696
I really meant to do it.

615
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,707
I stood there trembling,
right on the edge.

616
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,209
But I couldn't.
I wasn't brave enough.

617
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,841
I should like to be able to say it was the thought
of you and the children that prevented me...

618
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,713
but it wasn't.

619
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,719
I had no thoughts at all...

620
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,052
only an overwhelming desire not
to feel anything at all ever again...

621
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,558
not to be unhappy anymore.

622
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,061
I went back into the refreshment room.

623
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,291
That's when I nearly fainted.

624
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,367
- What is all
this? - Shh! - Shh.

625
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,265
Laura?

626
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,341
Yes, dear?

627
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,509
Whatever your dream was...

628
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,580
it wasn't a very happy one, was it?

629
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,750
No.

630
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,686
Is there anything I can do to help?

631
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,756
Fred, you always help.

632
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,424
You've been a long way away.

633
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,861
Thank you for coming back to me.

634
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,708
God knows why you've learned
Brief Encounter.

635
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,047
I think you ought to know this lesson's
been a complete waste of time.

636
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,549
Oh, a bit like
Mr. Hector's lessons then, sir.

637
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,642
They're a complete waste of time too.

638
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,655
Yeah, you little smart-ass, but he's not
trying to get you through an exam.

639
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,623
- French Kiss?
- I beg your pardon.

640
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,630
Newmarket, 3:00.

641
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,238
- Dorothy?
- Thank you, Stanley.

642
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,075
So, how are you finding them?

643
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,908
You've taught them too well.
They can't see it's a game.

644
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,915
- History? Is it a game?
- For an exam like this, yeah.

645
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,917
Dorothy.

646
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,987
Oh, fuck.

647
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,285
- Dorothy.
- Headmaster.

648
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,954
- I called him "the awful warning. "
- Who, Felix?

649
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,464
If you don't watch out,
he's what you turn into.

650
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,967
If this was a 1940s film...

651
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,969
he'd be played by Raymond Huntley.

652
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,971
Who? Uh-

653
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,975
He made a speciality of sour-faced judges
and vinegary schoolmasters.

654
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,977
Who would I be played by?

655
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,980
- Dirk Bogarde?
- I'm not sure I like that.

656
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,209
- Dorothy.
- Watch out.

657
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,218
Ah, Hector! The very man.

658
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,220
- Chin up, Rudge.
- Hello!

659
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,222
Mrs. Lintott.

660
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,986
Our lord and master having grudgingly
conceded that art may have its uses...

661
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:06,688
I gather I'm supposed to give your Oxford and
Cambridge boys a smattering of art history.

662
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,197
Not my bag, Hazel.
Irwin's your man.

663
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,701
It's really just the icing on the cake.

664
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,930
Is art ever anything else?

665
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,981
Michelangelo.

666
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,150
Well...

667
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,220
I suppose.

668
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,825
Who have you got?

669
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,925
- Both nancys.
- Are they?

670
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,592
These aren't women.
They're just men with tits.

671
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,432
And the tits look as if they've been
put on with an ice cream scoop.

672
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,339
Do you like Turner, then?

673
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,002
All right.

674
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,443
Well, choose someone you do like.

675
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,606
Art's meant to be enjoyed.

676
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,547
In the long term, miss, maybe...

677
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,484
but with us enjoyment
don't come into it.

678
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,988
We ain't got time to read the books,
we ain't got time to look at the pictures.

679
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,491
What we really need
is lessons in acting.

680
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,562
That's what this whole
scholarship thing is- an acting job.

681
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:18,731
- So, have the boys given you a nickname?
- Not that I'm aware of.

682
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,736
A nickname is an achievement...

683
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,204
both in the sense of something won...

684
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,605
and also in its armorial sense...

685
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,143
of a badge, a blazon.

686
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,645
Unsurprisingly, I am Tot.

687
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,582
Or Totty.

688
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,811
Some irony there, one feels.

689
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,648
- Hector has no nickname.
- Yes, he has- Hector.

690
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,659
- But he's called Hector.
- That's his nickname too.

691
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,662
He isn't called Hector.
His name's Douglas.

692
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,665
Though the only person
I've ever heard address him as such...

693
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,065
is his somewhat unexpected wife.

694
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,874
Posner came to see me yesterday.

695
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,808
He has a problem.

696
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,437
No nicknames.
At least you get their problems.

697
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,948
I seldom do.

698
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,214
Sir, I think I may be homosexual.

699
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,625
I love Dakin.

700
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,326
- Does Dakin know?
- Yes.

701
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,228
And doesn't think it's surprising.

702
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,233
Though Dakin likes girls, basically.

703
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,303
I sympathized.

704
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:30,840
Though not so much as to suggest
I might be in the same boat.

705
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,443
With Dakin?

706
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,446
With anybody.

707
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,346
That's sensible.

708
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,581
One of the hardest things for boys to learn
is that a teacher is human.

709
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,283
One of the hardest things for a teacher
to learn is not to try and tell them.

710
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,292
Is it a phase, sir?

711
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,225
Do you think it's a phase?

712
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,828
Some of the literature
says it will pass.

713
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,835
I'm not sure I want it to pass.

714
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:04,340
But I want to get into Oxford.
If I do, Dakin might love me.

715
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,341
Or I might stop caring.

716
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:14,645
Do you look at your life, sir?

717
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,050
I thought everybody did.

718
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,056
I'm a Jew...

719
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,285
I'm small...

720
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,954
I'm homosexual...

721
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,531
and I live in Sheffield.

722
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,768
I'm fucked.

723
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,907
So, with all this religion,
what do you do?

724
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,409
Go to church, pray.

725
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,776
Yes?

726
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,906
It's so time-consuming.
You've no idea.

727
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,046
Yeah? What else?

728
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,212
Well-

729
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,289
it's what you don't do.

730
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,756
You don't not wank.

731
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,862
- Jesus, you're headed for the bin.
- It's not forever.

732
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,560
Well, just tell me on the big day
and I'll stand well back.

733
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,570
See, what bothers me is,
the more you read...

734
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:11,573
the more you see that literature
is actually about losers.

735
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,575
- No!
- Yeah.

736
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,305
It's consolation.
All literature is consolation.

737
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,506
I don't care what Hector says.

738
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,981
I find literature really lowering.

739
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:24,350
This is Irwin, isn't it?
A line of stuff for the exam.

740
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,355
No.

741
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,789
Well, it isn't wholly my idea.

742
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,828
- I've been reading this book by "Kneeshaw. "
- Who?

743
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,830
Kneeshaw.

744
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,400
He's a philosopher.

745
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,402
Friedrich Kneeshaw.

746
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,938
I think that's pronounced Nietzsche.

747
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,907
Oh, shit.

748
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,409
- Shit.
- What's the matter?

749
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,413
I talked to Irwin about it.
He didn't correct me.

750
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,415
He let me call him Kneeshaw.

751
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,417
Think I'm a right fool. Shit!

752
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,919
- What have I done?
- Nothing.

753
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,921
You've done nothing.

754
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,856
The world doesn't revolve
around you, you know.

755
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,360
Ah, Irwin!

756
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,862
How are our young men doing?

757
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,865
Are they... on stream?

758
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,867
I think so.

759
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,870
Wh-You think so?
Are they or aren't they?

760
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,873
It must always be
something of a lottery.

761
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,138
A lottery? I don't like
the sound of that, Irwin.

762
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:26,410
I don't want you to fuck up. We've been
down that road too many times before.

763
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,421
Oi!

764
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,925
He's coming.

765
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,261
They took the lead off the roofs...

766
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,799
they used the timbers to melt it down,
and time did the rest.

767
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,300
And all thanks to Henry VIII.

768
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,735
If you want to learn about Stalin,
study Henry VIII.

769
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,740
If you want to learn about Mrs. Thatcher,
study Henry VIII.

770
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:03,404
While you and Dorothy are taking them
through the history, I'll pitch camp here.

771
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:06,414
Though, Irwin,
I am constantly available...

772
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,416
for the provision
of useful quotations-

773
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,009
sorry- gobbets on request.

774
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,955
"Bare ruined choirs...

775
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,957
where late the sweet birds sang. "

776
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,959
Remember, boys...

777
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:22,054
festoon your answers with gobbets
and you won't go very far wrong.

778
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:25,066
Actually, singing was the least of it.

779
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:29,332
The monks were farmers,
clothiers, tanners, tailors.

780
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,805
They mined for lead.
They were captains of industry.

781
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,980
- This was a toilet, sir.
- One of them.

782
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,176
- A bit drafty on the bum.
- That was the drain down there.

783
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,686
And then they drank out of it.

784
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:48,246
- Fucking Christians.
- What about the Ganges? You're just as bad.

785
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:52,351
- I'm Muslim, knob.
- Ah, you all look alike to me anyway.

786
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,363
So, what was this then? Chapel?

787
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,866
No. It was a storeroom. A barn.

788
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,802
All the produce would come in here.

789
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,806
You know it all, don't you?

790
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:07,809
- It interests me.
- No, that's good.

791
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,879
It's good.

792
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,180
All-male community, was it, sir?

793
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,188
Of course. They were monks.

794
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,190
Bit of that, do you think?

795
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,193
- What?
- Same-sex stuff?

796
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,195
You've blushed, sir.

797
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,197
Have a fuck! "Blushed. "

798
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,166
- Sir! This is consecrated ground.
- Not to me, sir.

799
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:36,069
To me, it's a pagan temple.
Only you did blush a bit, sir.

800
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:40,269
So that's why Henry VllI put the boot in, sir?
'Cause of them bunking up?

801
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:44,040
- That's what he said.
- There was not much else for them to do, was there?

802
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,047
I mean, in their time off.

803
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,550
- Pray?
- Hey, Posner'd make a good monk.

804
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,553
'Cept he's Jewish.

805
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,954
- DoJews have monks?
- Yes. I'm one now.

806
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,726
In your own time, sir.!

807
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,933
Pass the parcel.

808
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,561
That's sometimes all you can do.

809
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,833
Take it...

810
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,910
feel it and pass it on.

811
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,176
Not for me. Not for you.

812
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,841
But for someone...

813
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:24,409
somewhere one day.

814
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,423
Pass it on, boys.
That's the game I want you to learn.

815
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,459
Pass it on.

816
00:50:42,435 --> 00:50:44,403
Hector?

817
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:48,071
A word.

818
00:50:56,616 --> 00:50:59,744
Uh, this is not the first time,
apparently.

819
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:02,685
But on this occasion, she managed
to make a note of the number.

820
00:51:04,891 --> 00:51:08,793
Uh, f-for the moment,
I propose to say nothing about this.

821
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:12,194
But fortunately, it's not long
before you're due to retire.

822
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:17,201
In the circumstances, I propose
that we bring that forward.

823
00:51:17,303 --> 00:51:19,794
I think we should be looking
at the end of term.

824
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:30,942
Have you nothing to say?

825
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,847
"The tree of man was never quiet:

826
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:40,051
Then 'twas the Roman, now 'tis I."

827
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,128
This is no time for poetry.

828
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,660
Um, I'm assuming
your wife doesn't know.

829
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,669
I've no idea.

830
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:55,798
What women know or don't know
has always been a mystery to me.

831
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:59,139
And are you going to tell her?

832
00:51:59,245 --> 00:52:02,043
I don't know.

833
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:04,514
I'm not sure she'd be interested.

834
00:52:04,617 --> 00:52:08,747
Well, um, there's another thing.

835
00:52:08,855 --> 00:52:11,983
Strange how even
the most tragic turn of events...

836
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:16,994
generally resolve themselves
into questions about the timetable.

837
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:19,564
Irwin's been badgering me
for more lessons.

838
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,328
In the circumstances,
a concession might be in order.

839
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:26,030
- In future, I think you and he might share.
- Share?

840
00:52:26,139 --> 00:52:28,198
Share!

841
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:32,209
In the meantime,
you must consider your position.

842
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:35,814
I do not want to sack you.

843
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,715
People talk.

844
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:43,277
And it's so... untidy.

845
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:47,859
It would be easier for all concerned...

846
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,928
if you retired early.

847
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:53,090
Look, nothing happened.

848
00:52:56,235 --> 00:53:00,103
A hand on a boy's genitals
at 50 miles an hour...

849
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:02,197
and you call it nothing?

850
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:05,402
The transmission of knowledge
is, in itself, an erotic act.

851
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:08,571
- In the Renaissance, for instance-
- Fuck the Renaissance!

852
00:53:08,681 --> 00:53:12,139
And fuck literature and Plato...

853
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:15,550
and Michelangelo
and Oscar Wilde...

854
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:18,123
and all the other shrunken violets...

855
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:21,125
you people line up!

856
00:53:21,227 --> 00:53:24,719
This is a school...

857
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:27,595
and it isn't normal.

858
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:09,072
- Still here?
- It is Wednesday, sir.

859
00:54:09,175 --> 00:54:12,611
Yes, but I thought with the day trip
to Fountains and, uh-

860
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:15,806
It's only half past 4:00.

861
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:18,315
Well, in that case, where's Dakin?

862
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:20,612
With Mr. Irwin, sir.

863
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,688
Ah.

864
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:25,383
Of course.

865
00:54:25,491 --> 00:54:27,721
He's showing him
some old exam questions.

866
00:54:27,827 --> 00:54:31,854
Ah. With all the appropriate
gobbets, no doubt.

867
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:34,091
Well, no matter.

868
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,566
We must keep up the fight
without him.

869
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:39,661
- What have we learned this week?
- "Drummer Hodge," sir. Hardy.

870
00:54:39,772 --> 00:54:41,740
Ah. Nice.

871
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:45,306
"They throw in Drummer Hodge,
to rest...

872
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:48,209
"uncoffined, just as found:

873
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:50,282
"His landmark is a kopje-crest...

874
00:54:50,383 --> 00:54:52,783
"which breaks the veld around;

875
00:54:52,885 --> 00:54:57,549
"and foreign constellations west
each night above his mound.

876
00:54:57,657 --> 00:54:59,989
"Young Hodge the Drummer
never knew-

877
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:02,390
"fresh from his Wessex home-

878
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:04,827
"the meaning of the broad Karoo...

879
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:07,229
"the Bush, the dusty loam...

880
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,301
"and why uprose to nightly view...

881
00:55:09,402 --> 00:55:12,394
"strange stars amid the gloam.

882
00:55:12,505 --> 00:55:15,565
"Yet portion of that unknown plain...

883
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:18,269
"will Hodge forever be;

884
00:55:18,377 --> 00:55:20,675
"His homely Northern
breast and brain...

885
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,476
"grow to some Southern tree...

886
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:26,381
"and strange-eyed
constellations reign...

00:55:26,485 --> 00:55:29,010
his stars eternally. "

888
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:34,959
Good.

889
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:36,961
Very good.

890
