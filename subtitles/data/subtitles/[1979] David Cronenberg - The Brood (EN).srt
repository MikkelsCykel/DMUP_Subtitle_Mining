1
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,136
You're not looking at me, Mike.

2
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,102
You're not looking at me in the eyes.

3
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,906
That's weak.

4
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,406
Only weak people do that.

5
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,852
I could look you in the eye
if I wanted to, Daddy.

6
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,686
I just don't wanna look you in the eye.

7
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,992
I guess you're just a weak person.

8
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,590
You must have got that from your mother.

9
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,468
It probably would have been better for you...

10
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,937
to have been born a girl.

11
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,297
Then we could have named you Michelle.

12
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,677
You see, weakness is more acceptable
in a girl, Michelle.

13
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,044
I'm sorry, I mean, Mike.

14
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,578
I keep forgetting.

15
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,289
Wait a minute.

16
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,353
Why don't I call you Michelle all the time?

17
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,463
Then I wouldn't have to be so goddamn
ashamed of you and your weaknesses.

18
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,329
I could think of you as a girl all the time...

19
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,428
by your frocks, dresses,
and frilly hats and scarves.

20
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,370
You could be Daddy's little girl.

21
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:26,434
I wouldn't have to be so fucking ashamed
of being seen with you in public, would I?

22
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,948
What do you think of that, Michelle?

23
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,378
Sound like a good idea?

24
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,214
Don't, Daddy.

25
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,089
What?

26
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,087
Did you say something?

27
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,724
Such a soft little girl's voice.
I couldn't hear what you said.

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,557
I hate you, Daddy.

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,968
- Speak up, girl!
- I hate you!

30
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,200
I hate you, because I love...

31
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,271
It makes me feel...

32
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,778
guilty inside, hate.

33
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,917
I can't let the heart speak.

34
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,310
Then don't speak.

35
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,818
Don't speak to me. Show me.

36
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,892
Don't tell me.
I'm not interested in what little girls say.

37
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,016
Show me!

38
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,561
Show me your anger.
Then I can understand it.

39
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,594
There you are, Daddy.

40
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,571
I see you, Michelle.

41
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,445
I see everything.

42
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,676
This is me, Daddy.

43
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,316
This is what you do to me inside.

44
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,491
Go all the way through it.

45
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,427
Go all the way through it to the end.

46
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,558
Come out the other end.

47
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,800
Don't stop in the middle.

48
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,495
I'm watching you.

49
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,005
I'm watching everything you do, Mike.

50
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:26,932
Wow.

51
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,130
The man is a genius.

52
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,298
Dr. Raglan would like to thank you all
for coming this afternoon.

53
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,071
I believe your bus is waiting outside now.
Thank you.

54
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,164
Candy...

55
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,196
it's me, honey.

56
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,806
Daddy.

57
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,476
Okay, honey.

58
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,550
Warm enough?

59
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,561
Okay, put the whale down. Turn around.

60
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,400
Hold your hair up.

61
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,975
Oh, my God.

62
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,329
Sorry, Hal...

63
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,407
but Mr. Carveth is still here.

64
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,567
He's starting to get passionate
about the whole thing.

65
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,942
Okay, send him in.

66
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,115
Mr. Carveth.

67
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,984
Thanks a lot.

68
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,280
Frank, it's been some time.

69
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,680
What can I do for you?

70
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,224
I want to see Nola.

71
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,327
I want to see my wife, now.

72
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,428
You know she's still undergoing
intensive therapy.

73
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,824
I can't let you break that isolation.

74
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,230
You let her see Candice
on the weekends, don't you?

75
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,804
Yes, Frank, I do. But that's different.

76
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,638
Visits from her daughter
was in her program from the very start.

77
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,374
Her program has just changed.

78
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,571
What do you mean?

79
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,539
You sound hostile.

80
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,611
My daughter's been beaten severely...

81
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,981
and scratched and bitten!

82
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,283
Her mother did it...

83
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,450
her mother,
who is under your psychiatric care.

84
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,596
That's an incredibly heavy
accusation to make.

85
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,267
Did Candice tell you that?

86
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,471
Candice won't talk about it.

87
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,005
She pretends
the whole thing never happened.

88
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,505
But it was Nola...

89
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,605
or some other crazy
you have stashed away up here.

90
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,048
Either way, no more weekends with Mommy.

91
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,846
The kid stays with me.

92
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,518
To take Candice away from her
at this stage...

93
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,753
could send Nola over into the deep end.

94
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,556
It's a critical time for her.

95
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,563
I happen to think that Nola's
been in over her head for a long time now.

96
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,065
You have no legal right to deny access.

97
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,104
Any time you'd like
to test the matter in open court...

98
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,275
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

99
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,815
For the ultimate good
of your own family, Frank...

100
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,251
we'd be prepared to do just that.

101
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,220
But don't you force it.

102
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,991
You bring Candy back to her mother
next weekend. She won't harm her.

103
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,063
There must be some other answer
to what you've seen.

104
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,098
Until you give me that answer...

105
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,801
Candy is not coming back.

106
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,614
Yes, Hal?

107
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,019
Prepare Nola Carveth
for another session tonight, will you?

108
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,091
Sure.

109
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,486
And, Chris...

110
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,559
make it phase two, after supper.

111
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,857
Okay, Hal.

112
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,627
This guy Raglan
is strictly an emotional opportunist.

113
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,900
He's a legit M.D., right?

114
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,999
He's a real psychiatrist.

115
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,836
Yes.

116
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,016
Goddamn it, psychoplasmics is a rip-off.

117
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,111
It's a sideshow. I've seen it in action.

118
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,620
It doesn't matter what you think.
You listen to me.

119
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,763
You call up this Raglan,
and you be a real mensch with him.

120
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:37,230
Otherwise, it's just a matter of time
before the cops show up at your door...

121
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,497
and you lose your kid for good.

122
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,163
The law believes in motherhood.

123
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,506
If I can dig up enough testimony to prove...

124
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:53,278
that Raglan's a dangerous fraud,
that Somafree is crawling with crazies...

125
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,244
it's no place for a kid, any time...

126
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,984
You're getting warmer.

127
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,154
But when Candy doesn't show up
at Somafree next weekend...

128
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,788
your wife can take legal action immediately.

129
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,627
You could find yourself belted with a writ
in seven days.

130
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,166
If I give Nola enough time,
she'll really hurt the kid.

131
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,767
I know she will.

132
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,511
I'll do anything I have to.

133
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,930
Here's your daddy.

134
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,201
I bet he knows all about this zipper.
There we go.

135
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,500
All set, now.

136
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,074
I'd love to talk to you
sometime soon, Mr. Carveth...

137
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,015
about school activities and Candy.

138
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,321
You missed the last open house.

139
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,318
Okay, soon.

140
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:46,798
Thanks.

141
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,228
See you tomorrow, Candy.

142
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,670
Thank you very much, Frank.

143
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,777
- For what?
- For bringing me my grandchild.

144
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,514
I know if it were up to Nola,
I'd never see Candice.

145
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,478
Juliana, that's not true.

146
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,449
Nola and I both know how much
she needs her grandma, especially now.

147
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,583
You're sweet.

148
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,727
I guess you know, now, what it feels like.

149
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,955
- What it feels like?
- Being a parent.

150
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,999
Being blamed for everything.

151
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,968
To have the past distorted, so you
don't even recognize yourself anymore.

152
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,508
Your child's version of the past, that is.

153
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,940
Juliana, Candice is only five.

154
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,339
She's working on it right now, believe me.

155
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,184
Thirty seconds after you're born,
you have a past.

156
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,884
And 60 seconds after that,
you start to lie to yourself about it.

157
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,658
I guess I've been indulging in a horrid bout
of nostalgia these last few days.

158
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,864
It must be the weather.
At least now I have a partner in crime.

159
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,539
- I've got to go.
- Of course.

160
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,704
'Bye, Daddy.

161
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,157
Take your time, we'll both be just fine.

162
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,068
I'll be with you in a second, sweetie.

163
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:41,442
I'm just gonna get a refill, and then
we'll look at those lovely old pictures.

164
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,016
Mommy.

165
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,014
Yes, Candice?

166
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,215
Yes, sweetie?

167
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,026
Mommy, you hurt me.

168
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,462
You hit me with your fists,
and then you scratched me with your nails.

169
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,593
You hurt me.

170
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,031
I didn't, sweetie.

171
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,538
You must have had a bad dream.

172
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,808
Mommies don't do that.
Mommies don't hurt their own children.

173
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,504
They don't?

174
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,342
They never do?

175
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,656
They sometimes do.

176
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,786
Sometimes, but then they're bad mommies,
they're fucked-up mommies.

177
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,492
Like whose?

178
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,167
Like whose mommy?

179
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,869
Like mine was.

180
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,411
Fucked up and bad.

181
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,282
No, I'm not, Nola.

182
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,816
You're being so unfair, sweetheart.
Mommies never do that.

183
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,555
Mommies never hurt their own children.

184
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,892
You did hurt me.

185
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,923
You beat me and you scratched me.

186
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,732
You threw me down the stairs.

187
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,438
Show me what I did.

188
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,567
Don't stop it now, darling, show me.

189
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,275
Show me your anger. Show it to me.

190
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,911
Go all the way through it.

191
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,878
Go all the way through it, till the end.

192
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,152
Right to the end.

193
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,395
That one's my favorite.

194
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,995
This one's your favorite?

195
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,331
Yes, Mommy in the hospital
when she was a little girl.

196
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,539
That's right. I remember this picture.

197
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,879
Your Grandpa Barton took this picture.

198
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,143
Tell me the rest of the story
that goes with this picture.

199
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,548
Why was Mommy in the hospital so much?

200
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,060
Some days, she would wake up
and she would be covered...

201
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,424
with big, ugly bumps.

202
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,590
And the doctors were very worried,
because they could never find out...

203
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,000
what those bumps all over her skin
really were.

204
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,539
I guess I didn't stack the dishes too well.
I better go see what the damage is.

205
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,076
While I'm there,
I think I'll freshen up both our drinks.

206
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:06,965
Jerry.

207
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,857
Hi, Frank.

208
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,633
You're really falling behind on this.

209
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,366
The Brenleys think that they are going to be
moving in here by May.

210
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,973
We're not going to make that, for sure.
Maybe by June.

211
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,242
I heard that the city plumbing permit
got held up...

212
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,508
because of a change in the building code.

213
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,184
Mr. Carveth.

214
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,744
Telephone call for you.

215
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,464
- Hello.
- Is that Mr. Carveth?

216
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,301
- Yes.
- Mr. Frank Carveth?

217
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,703
- This is Frank Carveth.
- This is Sgt. Martel, with 78th Division.

218
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,534
One of our officers noticed
a broken kitchen window...

219
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,271
while on a routine patrol
of the neighborhood.

220
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,177
He found your mother-in-law's body
in the kitchen.

221
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,579
The murder weapon was on the floor,
next to her.

222
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,816
He then found your daughter upstairs,
sound asleep in the bedroom.

223
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,953
It seems she missed the whole thing.

224
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:14,164
- Where is she now? I'd like to see her.
- With our police psychologist, Dr. Birkin.

225
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,725
- Psychologist? Why? Was she hysterical?
- No.

226
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,600
On the contrary, she was very cool
throughout the whole thing.

227
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,805
A little too cool, I thought,
so I asked Dr. Birkin to talk with her.

228
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,980
Just for an opinion.

229
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,909
In the meantime, can you think of
the names of any persons...

230
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,814
who would have a motive
to murder this woman?

231
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:42,423
You see, it doesn't seem to me to be
a simple case of an interrupted break-in...

232
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,822
or, say, a rape-murder.

233
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,532
Juliana had a long series of lovers.
I never met any of them.

234
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,798
What about her husband?

235
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,140
His name is Barton Kelly.
He works for the government, out in Halifax.

236
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,308
They were divorced over 10 years ago.

237
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,920
- Dr. Birkin.
- You must be Candice's father.

238
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,749
I'd like to take her home now.

239
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,691
Please. Give me just two minutes with you.
It's important. Have a seat.

240
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:23,130
To put it bluntly, I don't think your daughter
escaped this incident entirely unscathed.

241
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,102
- You think she saw what happened?
- I suspect she did.

242
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,140
Or she saw something
which traumatized her, confused her...

243
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,074
disturbed her in some way.

244
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,772
The officer who found her
said that she was very difficult to wake up.

245
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,850
To me, that indicates
a kind of abnormal deep sleep...

246
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,942
which a lot of people,
even children, will use...

247
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,783
to escape something
that's too painful to face.

248
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,924
And she says that she doesn't remember
being brought to her grandmother's...

249
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,790
or seeing her at all.

250
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,797
Do you think she'll remember, eventually?

251
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,498
Mr. Carveth, I think you must
encourage her to remember.

252
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,337
Why?

253
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,104
My concern is that the child
could have a very serious breakdown...

254
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,268
if she doesn't come to terms
with what she's experienced.

255
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:10,474
You see, these things tend to
express themselves in one way or another.

256
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,214
I've seen five-year-olds like her...

257
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,843
with ulcers as bad
as any middle-aged businessman.

258
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,979
Okay, I get the picture.

259
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,188
- Now can I take her home?
- I think that's fine.

260
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,587
No problem.

261
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,035
You're sure you don't want a story?

262
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,965
You don't have to read, you know.

263
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,172
I can make one up for you.

264
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,813
Do you want to tell me a story...

265
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,516
about what happened today at Grandma's?

266
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,818
You go to sleep, honey.

267
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,296
I'll leave the hall light on.

268
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,345
Damn.

269
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,143
No outside calls. You're in isolation.
You know that.

270
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,982
I tried to reach Dr. Raglan. He hasn't come.

271
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,487
He's on his way.

272
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,259
Chris...

273
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,793
Is something wrong? Anything?

274
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,034
Then it's me again.

275
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,565
Nothing's wrong, except with me.

276
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,209
No, that's Frank talking,
Frank twisting my words.

277
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,839
He won't be patient, he won't trust me,
he won't wait until I get well.

278
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,614
He thinks...

279
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,752
that I'm turning into my mother.

280
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,950
Day by day, moment by moment,
he thinks that I'm trying...

281
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,651
to make Candy into Baby Nola.

282
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,291
Is he right?

283
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,358
No. That's the last thing on earth I'd...

284
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,369
Who's that?

285
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,643
It's Daddy.

286
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,850
Frank hates me, Daddy. He despises me.

287
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,190
He thinks I'm trying to harm my little girl...

288
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,389
and I know that he's thinking of a way
to take her away.

289
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,293
And that's very unfair of him.
That's very arrogant of him.

290
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,098
You mustn't be too hard on him,
Nola, sweetheart.

291
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,069
He's just trying to be a good,
protective father.

292
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,400
No.

293
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:26,935
Yes.

294
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,143
He's just doing
what a good father should do.

295
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,350
He's protecting his little girl.

296
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,681
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
He doesn't want to see her hurt.

297
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,280
He doesn't want to see her hurt by anybody,
not even her own mother.

298
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,293
Now, is there anything wrong with that?

299
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,397
No.

300
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,096
No, there isn't.

301
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,072
After all, it's just what I did for you, isn't it?

302
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,007
Frank's protecting Candy
the same way as I protected you, isn't he?

303
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,349
Isn't he?

304
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:07,885
No.

305
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,514
What do you mean, "no"?

306
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,151
- What do mean when you say "no"?
- I love you, Daddy.

307
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,228
I don't want you to think
that I don't love you.

308
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,161
I mean, you didn't.

309
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:28,963
"Didn't"?

310
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,435
"Didn't" what?

311
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,903
You didn't protect me.

312
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,907
You didn't.

313
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,975
You didn't, and you should have.

314
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,995
You shouldn't have looked away
when she hit me.

315
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,436
And you shouldn't have walked away
from the table...

316
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:03,064
when she twisted my words.
You should have stopped her.

317
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,810
You should have hit her when she hit me!

318
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,907
And you should have smacked her
when she smacked me.

319
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,781
Oh, God, I love you.

320
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,154
But you didn't protect me.

321
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,361
And you should have.

322
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,227
You pretended it wasn't happening.

323
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,626
You looked away.

324
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,069
And you should have.

325
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,104
Why didn't you?

326
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,769
Didn't you love me?

327
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,457
Look, there he is.

328
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,056
There's your grandfather.

329
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,088
Barton.

330
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,425
Hello, Frank. How you doing?
Good to see you.

331
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,434
- Let me take that.
- Hello. How you doing, Candy?

332
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,467
I guess you don't remember
your old granddad?

333
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,473
Right this way.

334
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,473
You didn't have to come way out here.
We could have met later, at the hotel.

335
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,071
I just didn't like the idea
of you coming in alone.

336
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,877
How long you plan to stay in town?

337
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,612
I guess we could
have the funeral tomorrow...

338
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,651
but Juliana's parents
might want to come in from Arizona.

339
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,783
Then there's that sister in Vancouver.
I don't know just how it's going to work out.

340
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,920
- All right. What hotel are you staying in?
- Park Plaza.

341
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,160
You know, I was even thinking
about going out to that old house again.

342
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,026
I still have the key, after all these years.

343
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:17,407
Juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks.

344
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,867
I could never understand why.

345
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,940
Maybe it's because she really couldn't admit
that we were finished.

346
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,616
When I think about you and Nola...

347
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,278
and this sweet child having to go through
the same heartaches we went through...

348
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,187
it's enough to make you cry.

349
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,291
Yes, it is.

350
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,767
I'm here to see Mr. Jan Hartog.

351
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,988
Come in. Right in.

352
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,963
Sit down. I'll be right there.

353
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,934
Sit down. I'll be there in a second.

354
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,409
Goddamn son of a bitch.

355
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,682
Okay.

356
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,802
That's my...

357
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,674
heart, over there on the floor.

358
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,437
- Your heart?
- My second heart.

359
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:39,639
Your first heart
makes your blood circulate, right?

360
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,948
But what about your lymphatic fluids?

361
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,449
I don't know.

362
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,055
Movement, walking and running, fucking,
rolling on the floor, anything.

363
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,188
People have this whole other system
they don't even know about.

364
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,823
The lymphatic system,
it's like the blood system...

365
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:01,871
with its own style of veins and arteries...

366
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,937
but no heart.

367
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,571
You have to keep moving
to get it to circulate.

368
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:13,380
And they've just given me pills.
They do that every day.

369
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,711
And I've got to move them
through the lymphatic system.

370
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,987
Goddamn it.

371
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,490
Pardon my sweat.

372
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm gonna take a bath, real soon.

373
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,100
So, Mr. Carveth...

374
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,975
how did you get my name?

375
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,206
My lawyer knows your lawyer.

376
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,179
I see. I get it.

377
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,775
Is your lawyer
preparing a case against Raglan, too?

378
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,851
Basically, yes.

379
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,855
- Slightly different from yours.
- How different?

380
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,929
My wife is still in therapy with Raglan.

381
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,262
I'm claiming psychological damage,
not physiological.

382
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,667
I see. Give him some more time
with your wife...

383
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,232
and you'll be able to claim
physiological damage, too.

384
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,475
Wouldn't this look impressive in court?

385
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,440
Do you like it? I do.

386
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,347
That's Raglan. That's psychoplasmics...

387
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,283
and it's called lymphosarcoma.

388
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,228
And it's spreading.

389
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,291
It's a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system.

390
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,730
You blame Raglan for that?

391
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,336
Raglan did it.

392
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,971
Raglan encouraged my body...

393
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,470
to revolt against me.

394
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,774
And it did.

395
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,913
I have a small revolution on my hands...

396
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,249
and I'm not putting it down
very successfully.

397
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,517
Then your lawyer really thinks
he can prove Raglan's responsible?

398
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,094
Are you kidding me?
You can't prove something like that in court.

399
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,758
Right from square one,
you're into, what, metaphysics?

400
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,364
How do you know
I'm not going to get cancer at age 32...

401
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,000
whether I'd gone into
psychoplasmics therapy or not?

402
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,809
No, we'd get laughed out of court.

403
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,182
Then why are you going into court?

404
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,582
Revenge.

405
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,719
Even if we lose, people will get nervous
about psychoplasmics.

406
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,057
It will be bad publicity.

407
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,825
They won't even remember
whether we won or lost.

408
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,130
They'll just remember the slogan:

409
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,431
"Psychoplasmics can cause cancer."

410
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,639
Catchy.

411
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,475
Is that going to help?

412
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,553
Maybe.

413
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,479
I'm not alone.

414
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,150
I'm in touch with a lot of people
who did psychoplasmics.

415
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,856
We might form a club.

416
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,193
I want to help you.

417
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,095
Okay. Thanks.

418
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,754
Dr. Raglan?

419
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,630
Yes?

420
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,090
I'm Barton Kelly, Nola Carveth's father.

421
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,633
Glad to meet you.

422
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,570
I'm sorry to accost you like this...

423
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,506
but your receptionist wasn't too helpful.

424
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,410
She probably knew I was on my way to...

425
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,504
Did you know
that Nola's mother died yesterday?

426
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,082
That she was murdered?

427
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,343
Yes, the police spoke to me.

428
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,683
- Then you've told her.
- No, I haven't.

429
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,958
That's why I'm here, to tell her.

430
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,996
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death
was a tragic and shocking thing.

431
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,628
That's why Nola must not be told.

432
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,102
What?

433
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,167
Nola's going through a very critical stage
in her therapy.

434
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,374
I'm not sure she could take it.

435
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,773
Are you saying that
I'm just supposed to bury the girl's mother...

436
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,575
and not tell her about it?

437
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,749
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

438
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:46,080
You are one ignorant son of a bitch,
Dr. Raglan.

439
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,422
Now, I have left my phone number...

440
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,924
on your front desk.

441
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,299
If I don't hear from my daughter
by tomorrow afternoon...

442
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,099
I'm coming back up here to get her.

443
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,809
Shall I have him stopped?

444
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,949
No, it's all right.

445
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,777
He's drunk.

446
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,230
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

447
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,361
- You two look like you're having fun.
- We were.

448
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,065
Daddy, Ms. Mayer said she was starving.

449
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,604
Can we feed her at our place tonight?

450
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,675
Candy...

451
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,171
We could if she wanted to.

452
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,745
What do you think?

453
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,475
Well, I...

454
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,348
We could talk after Candy goes to bed.

455
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:25,922
Sure.

456
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,123
As soon as Candy realized
she had me alone...

457
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,928
she got me to play
"mother and daughter" with her.

458
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,002
She obviously needs mothering,
and isn't getting it.

459
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,474
Sometimes it just kills me to think
I might have screwed my kid up already.

460
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,576
She's not even six.

461
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,807
It's not just you.

462
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,219
Sometimes when I'm being easy on myself,
I say, "It's not your fault.

463
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,791
"You got taken in.

464
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,385
"You got involved with a woman
who married you for your sanity...

465
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,191
"hoping it would rub off."

466
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,768
Instead, it started to work the other way.

467
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,112
Hello?

468
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,108
It's Barton Kelly, Frank.

469
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,676
How are you?

470
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,174
Just mediocre.

471
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,011
How are you?

472
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,282
I made a mistake.

473
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,955
I came back to the old place.

474
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,458
It's got me.

475
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,293
I'm depressed as hell.

476
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,665
Barton, get in a cab, will you?

477
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,601
- Just tell him to take...
- That's not all.

478
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,804
There's Nola, too.

479
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,508
How do you mean?

480
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,171
I went up to that place to see her.

481
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,348
They wouldn't even let me talk to her.

482
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,952
They said no to me, her own father!

483
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,020
Jesus.

484
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,049
So I'm going back up there, to Somafree.

485
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,351
We'll leave just as soon as you get here.

486
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,519
Soon as I get there?

487
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,290
I'll be waiting for you.

488
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,661
I know you'll want to go up there with me.

489
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,493
- You're not far from here, are you?
- Barton, listen to me.

490
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,231
I don't think that's a very smart thing to do.

491
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,137
I'm doing it, with or without you.

492
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,170
Okay.

493
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,374
I'm only about 15 minutes away. Wait for me.

494
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,710
I'll be there.

495
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,978
You're a good lad.

496
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,951
We'll go up there together,
and kick their ass.

497
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,322
I'm waiting on you.

498
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,467
I've a feeling
I've just been recruited to baby-sit.

499
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,098
Would you? It'd take 45 minutes.

500
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,068
He's drunk.

501
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,702
He'll drive his car off a bridge,
unless I talk some sense into him.

502
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,074
45 minutes?

503
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,738
That's all it'll take.

504
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,182
Okay.

505
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,517
Thanks.

506
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,452
Help yourself to some coffee.

507
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:12,656
Here.

508
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,222
Look at this while I'm gone.

509
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,654
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

510
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,127
45 minutes.

511
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,007
I shouldn't have...

512
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,276
I never planned it to be this way.

513
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:21,070
Nola?

514
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,471
Barton!

515
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:58,975
It's me!

516
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,040
I can't get over it.

517
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,743
The thing was in the house.

518
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,515
It was in the house all the time.
We searched the place...

519
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,648
but we weren't looking
for anything that small, and we missed it.

520
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,092
We were spending our time
checking out an Estonian musician.

521
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,727
Have you found out who it belongs to,
the kid?

522
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,459
No. My guess is...

523
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:07,196
some crazy woman didn't want
anyone to know she had a deformed child.

524
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:11,172
She's locked this kid up in an attic
for years and never told anybody.

525
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,639
Wouldn't be the first time.

526
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,615
Hello.

527
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,247
Who's this?

528
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,080
Ruth Mayer.

529
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,052
Did you want to speak with Frank Carveth?

530
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,524
Ruth Mayer? From Krell Street School?

531
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,627
Yes.

532
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,560
Is this Mrs. Carveth?

533
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:38,362
Are you and my husband
having your own private PTA meeting?

534
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,233
I won't even bother to answer that.

535
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,529
You bitch!

536
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,771
You're killing my family!

537
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,407
Our friend has very strange eyes.

538
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,036
They have irises, but no retinas.

539
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,949
I should think his vision of the world
is very distorted.

540
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,019
I'm pretty certain he sees things
only in black-and-white.

541
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,178
No colors.

542
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,687
The upper lip is cleft.

543
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,681
Real harelip...

544
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,720
but the palate is not.

545
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,592
And the tongue is too thick and inflexible
for proper speech.

546
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:43,931
It has no teeth...

547
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,662
but you can get a pretty nasty bite...

548
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,000
from these strange, beak-like gums.

549
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,303
Why did it die?

550
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:55,304
I found some sort of collapsed, fleshy sac...

551
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,778
between the little fellow's shoulder blades.

552
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,478
It contains traces
of a solid nutrient material...

553
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,520
a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish...

554
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,719
or a camel's hump.

555
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:11,093
Basically, it's a gas tank
that was full at birth.

556
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:14,888
Once the hump material
is completely assimilated...

557
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,859
I think the creature simply starves to death.

558
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,428
Runs out of gas, so to speak.

559
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,805
And that brings us
to the last point of interest.

560
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,970
There's an external deformity.

561
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,142
I mean, apart from the lack of sexual organs.

562
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:37,213
It's extremely subtle
and extremely provocative.

563
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,724
I wonder if either of you have noticed it.

564
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,224
- Has no navel.
- No what?

565
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:46,323
No bellybutton.

566
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,398
- The thing has no bellybutton.
- That's right.

567
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:54,766
And that means this creature
has never really been born.

568
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,832
At least, not the way
human beings are born.

569
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,175
Jesus.

570
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,013
You're the beginning of the end, Ms. Mayer.

571
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:15,380
The beginning of the end for me,
my family, my dream.

572
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,226
So sad.

573
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:23,360
And I feel so guilty for my part in it.
I wish it had never happened.

574
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,497
I wish we could be together again,
just the three of us.

575
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,669
You're kidding yourself.

576
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,743
Right now, you're dreaming.

577
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,707
From what Frank tells me,
it was lousy from the very start.

578
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,009
You never had anything real together.

579
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,450
It would be better for everybody if you...

580
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,783
If Frank divorced you and married me.

581
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,653
We'd still let you see Candy
in the weekends.

582
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,656
That stinks!

583
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,300
We had a lot.

584
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,961
We had beautiful things,
things that you couldn't understand.

585
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,666
And we'll have them again,
if you'd just leave him alone...

586
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,804
and stop poisoning him against me
and taking advantage of his Ioneliness.

587
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,979
Then he'd wait for me.

588
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,387
He'd help me to get better,
instead of abandoning me.

589
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:24,384
He would do that,
if you would just leave him alone.

590
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,266
Leave him alone!

591
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,981
Listen, I'm sorry. I called a few times.
You didn't answer.

592
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:51,417
I didn't want to talk to your wife again,
that's why. Once was enough.

593
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,388
- Nola called? What did she say?
- Look, I have to go.

594
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:01,861
Your life is just a little too complicated
for me right now.

595
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,360
I'll see you at the next open house.

596
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:08,355
Daddy.

597
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,760
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Why aren't you sleeping?

598
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,864
I had a bad dream. A scary bad dream.

599
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:23,037
- What was the dream about, honey?
- I'm afraid to tell you.

600
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,376
- Why?
- The dream doesn't want me to.

601
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,707
Candy, listen to me.

602
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:32,752
I know what happened at Grandma's.
I know what you saw there.

603
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,990
I just came from the police...

604
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,117
and when I was there,
I saw the thing that hurt Grandma.

605
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,690
And, Candy, it's dead.

606
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:46,893
I saw it lying on a table,
and the police were there, and it's dead.

607
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,563
It can't hurt you now.

608
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,142
And it can't hurt me or anybody else.

609
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,138
Do you understand me?

610
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,241
It's dead?

611
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,208
Yes.

612
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,160
It's all right now, baby.

613
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,507
What do you think?

614
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,275
How many people do we have
at the main house?

615
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:32,741
Twenty-seven.

616
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,618
Okay, I want them out by this afternoon...

617
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,911
and the house closed.

618
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,652
It'll be hard on them, Hal, especially Mike.

619
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,194
Then do it gently.

620
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,861
But get them out.

621
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,395
All right.

622
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:20,151
- Put your suitcases in the compartment.
- I don't want to go.

623
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,528
You have to go.
Come on. I just want you to get on the bus...

624
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,394
You'll see the doctor.

625
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,033
I don't want to go.

626
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,636
- Don't make me leave.
- I'm not making you leave.

627
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,974
Just be a good boy
and get on the bus, all right?

628
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,391
- Hi, Jan.
- Frank, hi.

629
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,424
Look, I think we've got ourselves
a real live one.

630
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,356
Come on upstairs.
There's somebody I want you to meet.

631
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,005
Is this the guy from Chicago?

632
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,539
No. He's a local boy.

633
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,413
He lives a lot closer to home
than you expected.

634
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,397
Mr. Carveth is here to see you.

635
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,268
Look who's here.

636
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,110
Nola's old man.

637
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:48,412
- The queen bee's favorite drone.
- Jeez, he's pretty far gone.

638
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,079
He'd be dynamite in court.

639
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:57,017
What did you mean when you said
Nola's the queen bee?

640
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,321
She's the queen bee, all right.
She's the star.

641
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:06,231
She's the one he's interested in,
and the rest of us don't count anymore.

642
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,303
She doesn't even have to pay for it.

643
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,436
That's because she's the one
who was born to prove...

644
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:18,010
that "psychoplasmics
is the ultimate therapeutic device."

645
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,181
That's the quote, isn't it?

646
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,447
Can you be my daddy?
He won't do it anymore.

647
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,713
And my real daddy won't do it.

648
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:31,052
And that bastard, Dr. Raglan,
won't do it anymore.

649
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,096
You see, my real daddy rejected me.

650
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,395
And my surrogate daddy rejected me.

651
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,868
That's just fucking wonderful,
don't you think?

652
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,600
Calm down, Mike. Cool it,
and tell him what happened at Somafree.

653
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,136
Look...

654
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,005
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

655
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,719
Just be my daddy.

656
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,622
Please. I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

657
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,415
I'll bleed for you. Want me to bleed?

658
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:05,616
No.

659
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:09,630
That's silly, right?
Repulses you, I can see that.

660
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,229
You're not into it, so why do it, right?

661
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:18,340
Besides, nobody could do it like Dr. Raglan.

662
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,076
Not even real daddy.

663
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,278
And he knows it.

664
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,979
Dr. Raglan knows I'm addicted to him...

665
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:31,014
and he doesn't care.

666
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,952
He's such a hard man.

667
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,558
I was at that demonstration last Monday.

668
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:43,832
You and Raglan seemed very close.
What happened?

669
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,733
He threw us out. All of us.

670
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,002
Locked the door.

671
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,142
It's true.
I've been in touch with some of the others.

672
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:59,380
They've all been thrown out of Somafree,
and all therapy suspended.

673
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,177
All except for your wife. She's still there.

674
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,484
Doesn't anybody know why?

675
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:13,219
Sure somebody knows. I know.
He wants to be alone with her.

676
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,956
Dr. Raglan wants to be alone with your wife.

677
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,559
- 'Bye, Daddy.
- 'Bye.

678
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:01,363
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi, Wendy.

679
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,141
Quickly but quietly, children.

680
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,795
Rebecca, do you want to pass out
the blue papers, please?

681
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:36,838
And Clayton, how about you pass out
the purple ones?

682
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:40,870
Okay, let's see.

683
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,685
This person here?

684
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,265
You can do snowflakes, too.
That's a good idea.

685
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,276
Help!

686
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:59,051
- What's the matter?
- They're hurting Ms. Mayer.

687
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,985
The bad kids are hurting Ms. Mayer.

688
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,524
They knocked her to the floor
and they're hitting her.

689
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,493
They're hitting Ms. Mayer.
They made her fall down!

690
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:57,805
Candy!

691
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,159
It's all right. It's Hal.

692
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:23,294
Where's Chris? Chris usually wakes me up.

693
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,698
Chris had to go into the city.

694
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,433
You've been dreaming?

695
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,713
Yes. I was having a wonderful dream.

696
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,142
Wonderful.

697
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,642
And painful, at the same time.

698
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,848
My daughter was coming back to me.

699
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:42,983
And Frank.

700
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,290
And Ruth Mayer?

701
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,226
Was she in your dream?

702
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,633
Candy's teacher?

703
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,902
I don't remember.

704
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:58,803
Then maybe we should talk about her.

705
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:03,236
But I don't feel the need to talk about her.

706
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,372
You don't?

707
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,473
Why not?

708
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,843
I don't know.

709
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:17,781
I think I must be getting stronger,
because somehow...

710
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,321
I just don't feel threatened by her anymore.

711
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,797
This is where my wife and kid lived
for nine months...

712
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,925
before Nola moved out to Somafree.

713
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,428
This is the first time I've seen the place.

714
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,168
What are we doing here?

715
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:10,940
Tell me, again.

716
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:13,713
I don't know.

717
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,683
I thought Candy might come back here.

718
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,694
It's not a coincidence.

719
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,162
Those things, those creatures...

720
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,304
they all disappeared together.

721
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,406
They've got her.

722
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,521
You've got to help me.
Somebody's following me.

723
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:06,459
- Somebody's always following me.
- Did you find out anything?

724
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:11,192
- Did you find out why they moved you out?
- I've got to have something to eat. Anything.

725
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:15,229
What did you find out?
Why did they close Somafree down?

726
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,069
- Talk to me! Now!
- Okay.

727
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:22,509
Raglan's onto something very big,
something to do with the kids.

728
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:26,076
- He just got bored with the rest of us.
- Kids? What kids?

729
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,916
The disturbed kids in the work shed...

730
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,713
the ones your wife's taking care of.

731
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,420
What have you done with my kid?

732
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,344
Where is she?

733
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,451
Carveth, what the hell
are you talking about?

734
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,659
They took her.

735
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:00,863
They killed Ruth Mayer,
and then they brought Candice back here.

736
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,643
They killed Ruth Mayer?

737
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:22,619
I want my daughter back, now.

738
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,656
Did they bring her back here, back to Nola?

739
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,523
I don't know.

740
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:33,257
If they brought her back here,
then she'd be up there, in the attic.

741
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,295
That's where they live.

742
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,137
Frank, I've got a gun.

743
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:53,013
They'll kill you
if you try to take her away from them.

744
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,158
Why?

745
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,585
Because they understand
that she's one of them.

746
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:04,426
You're insane.

747
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,893
Frank, they exist. You've seen them.

748
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:11,734
They're just freaks. Deformed children.

749
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,699
You've got Nola taking care of them.

750
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,904
I'm sure she loves being
their surrogate mother.

751
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,478
She's not their surrogate mother.

752
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,480
She's their real mother.

753
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,885
Their only mother.

754
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,353
- I'm not gonna listen.
- They're her children.

755
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:35,190
More exactly,
they're the children of her rage.

756
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,231
They're motivated only by her anger,
whether that anger...

757
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,324
is conscious or subconscious.

758
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,800
I mean, when Nola got cross with Candy
last weekend...

759
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,705
annoyed, really...

760
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:48,775
the brood beat her.

761
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:53,511
But when she released her rage
against her parents, under therapy...

762
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,310
then they killed them.

763
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,653
I know, I didn't want to believe that...

764
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,086
but now they've killed Ruth Mayer...

765
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:05,886
and they could kill you or me,
and she wouldn't even be aware of it.

766
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:09,725
I mean, she doesn't even know
that Candy's here.

767
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,764
- I want Candice back.
- Then do it my way.

768
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,006
Please.

769
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:20,407
It's the right way.

770
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,606
What do you want me to do?

771
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,778
I want you to go back into that hut...

772
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,574
and persuade Nola that you want her back...

773
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,588
that you want your family back.

774
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:37,347
I want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband.

775
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,949
Why?

776
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,855
Because if you can keep Nola
calm and happy...

777
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,095
then the brood's neutral.

778
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:48,258
If she's mellow,
then I can just walk into that attic...

779
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,136
pick up Candy,
tuck her under my arm and walk out.

780
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,598
Now, can you do that?

781
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,275
I don't know.

782
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,180
Frank, if things go wrong...

783
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,947
if Nola gets angry, if the kids get angry...

784
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,957
You understand?

785
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,952
I'm not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger.

786
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,025
Raglan, I don't trust you.

787
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,165
What does it matter?

788
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:25,266
I'll move up there 30 seconds after you're in.

789
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,748
Frank, be nice to her.

790
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,279
Hal?

791
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:19,386
It's me, Nola. It's Frank.

792
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:26,695
Am I dreaming?

793
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:31,905
I thought you said you weren't going to
come and see me while I was here.

794
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:37,104
I think that was a misunderstanding.

795
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,041
That's why I'm here.

796
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,181
I want us to understand each other.

797
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,100
You're the only woman in the world for me.

798
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,926
You always have been, you always will be.

799
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,566
It won't ever change.

800
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,670
I want you to know that.

801
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:46,238
I wish it were true. God, I wish it were true.

802
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,706
We lost touch.

803
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:22,108
That's the only reason
all this ever happened.

804
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,576
All we have to do
is make sure we don't lose touch again.

805
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:31,214
Isolation is part of my therapy.

806
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:36,628
What's been happening to me
has been just too strange...

807
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:41,165
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life.

808
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,735
Then make me a part of your new life.

809
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:48,466
Let me be part of it.

810
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,578
Show me, educate me, involve me.

811
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:56,213
I'm ready now.
I wasn't before, but I'm ready now.

812
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,589
Candy?

813
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,299
Are you ready for me, Frank?

814
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,705
Are you really?

815
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,407
I seem to be a very special person.

816
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,910
I'm in the middle of a strange adventure.

817
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:31,918
Let me be with you.

818
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:36,453
I want to go with you wherever you go.

819
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:38,392
Do you?

820
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:43,464
Do you?

821
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,034
Yes.

822
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:49,934
Then look.

823
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:33,381
Daddy?

824
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,149
Is it time to go to school yet?

825
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,450
No, sweetheart.

826
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:41,984
It's Dr. Hal.

827
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,458
And Daddy's downstairs talking to Mommy.

828
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:47,795
He wants to see you.

829
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,535
Oh, God, Nola.

830
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,673
No, I disgust you.

831
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,637
I sicken you.

832
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,880
You hate me.

833
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,879
You didn't come here because you love me.

834
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:25,088
You came here to take our daughter away
and give her to somebody else.

835
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,989
I wouldn't do that.

836
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,457
I wouldn't do that to you.

837
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:44,870
You go out of that door.
You find your daddy.

838
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,577
You liar. You're lying.

839
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:58,622
You're lying! I know!

840
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:46,032
I know you so well, and it won't work.

841
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:51,943
I'd kill Candice
before I let you take her away from me.

842
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,104
Do you hear me?

843
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,449
I'd kill Candice before I let you take her!

844
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,619
Make them stop.

845
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,601
They're doing what you want them to do.

846
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:56,234
You want them to kill Candice.

847
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:03,208
You make them stop, or I'll kill you.

848
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,009
Kill me.

849
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,161
We're going home, Candy.

850
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:41,400
We're going home.

851
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:52,400
