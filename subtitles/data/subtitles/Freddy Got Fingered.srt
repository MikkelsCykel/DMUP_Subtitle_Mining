Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

2
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,715
I'm X-ray Cat. I've got super powers.

3
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,342
I can see through wooden doors
with my X-ray vision. Wooden doors.

4
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,801
I can see the criminal on the other side.

5
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,642
He can't see me, and he's committing crime.

6
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:13,721
I come along and say "I can see you. He says
"You can't." I say "Yes, I can with my..."

7
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,940
X-ray...

8
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:20,103
X-ray Cat.

9
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:24,324
"You can't get me. You can't get me."
"Yes, I can. Yes, I can."

10
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:26,484
"Yes, I can. Yes..."

11
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,653
The bananas.

12
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:32,115
I know a banana who applied for a job
as a telephone repairman.

13
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:37,712
Guy came and said "You want a job here?"
And he said "Yeah, I wanna get a job."

14
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,715
"You got the job!
You got the job, buddy!"

15
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:46,629
And then the beavers came. The beaver
started yelling at the other beaver.

16
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:52,595
The beaver started yelling at the other beaver.
He said "You stupid beaver!"

17
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,762
"You stupid..."

Gordie, honey.
I'm so sad you're leaving me.

00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,257
Why are you moving to Los Angeles
to work in a cheese factory?

00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:58,596
I'm not gonna just work in a cheese sandwich
factory. I'm gonna shop my drawings.

- You'll be fine.

- What?

56

You're not taking that bus to Los Angeles.

57
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,781
You bought me a ticket
on this bus to Los Angeles.

58

That's not all we bought you.

Jeez. A convertible.

That's me. I'm the number one son.

- You're number one son, too.

66

Gord gets a LeBaron and I don't?

67

- No. No, they don't.

I don't see two LeBarons.

- Do you see two?

It's...

74
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,467
It's kind of an investment in you.

75

- Proud?

00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,233
OK. I...

154
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:09,399
He'll be at that restaurant.

155
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:13,779
- He'll be devastated.
- OK...

156
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,948
God, he loved Linda.

157
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:24,588
- He did love Linda.
- I know.

158
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:28,089
I think it's wonderful
when two people love one another, and...

159
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:32,970
...even though there's a chance one of
those two people will die a horrible death...

160
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:36,722
...that doesn't make me fear love.
I'm not afraid of love.

161
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:40,809
Could I be your boyfriend? I love you.

162
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:45,358
- Get outta here!
- No, no, no. I was just thinking...

163
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:48,316
A woman is dead. Linda is dead!

164
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:52,534
I thought we could grieve together
over the dead Linda, over the dead woman.

165
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,277
Fuck off!

166
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:56,576
You're a skinny loser!

167
00:11:56,788 --> 00:11:58,782
- Someone call Security.
- Don't.

168
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,748
Shit!

169
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:05,667
- Security!
- Don't call them, OK? I gotta go.

170
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,332
Tell Hanna-Barbera to go fuck themselves.

171
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:13,887
I got twelve Korean teenagers in a tiger cage
that can draw a fucking dog wearing a cape.

172
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:16,886
OK. I'm looking for a Mr. Dave Davidson.

173
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,636
- Are you Dave Davidson?
- No.

174
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:20,637
- David Davidson?
- My name's Peter.

175
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,517
- I'm looking for a David Davidson.
- I'm a woman.

176
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,267
- Did I ask what sex you are?
- No.

177
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:29,404
- Did I ask if you were David Davidson?
- My name is Cheryl.

178
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:32,738
- I'm Dave Davidson. Is there a problem?
- You're Mr. Davidson?

179
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:36,408
- Yeah, officer. Is there a problem here?
- I'm not really a cop.

180
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:40,783
My name's Gord, and I want
to show you my drawings.

181
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:43,626
Your drawings? Are you kidding?

182
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,207
Mr. Davidson, I'm an animator. I've got
this idea I wanna pitch to you. It's a cartoon.

183
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:51,502
It's a cat with super powers.
It can see through wooden doors.

184
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:55,722
He solves crimes, he can fly.
My friends and I think it's hilarious.

185
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:58,132
He flies like this. It's great.

186
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:02,061
Right, well, I'm glad
your friends enjoy it, OK?

187
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:04,352
Tell me something, what do you want?

188
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,227
I want you to help me make it
into a TV show.

189
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:11,397
You just barge into a restaurant
dressed like a fucking English bobby...

190
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,695
...and expect someone to give you a TV show?

191
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,859
Uh, I don't know. Um...

192
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:18,985
- Yeah.
- Do me a favor? Leave me alone.

193
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,740
- Please, please...
- Valet?

194
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:24,201
- Please, just look at my drawings.
- Yeah, OK. Fine.

195
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:30,457
It's X-ray Cat, but instead of seeing through
everything, he can only see through wood.

196
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:34,464
So if there's something on the other side
of a wooden door... See the criminal?

197
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:39,132
- I see the criminal. I see the door.
- He sees the criminal and saves the day...

198
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:44,017
...to the dismay of the police cos they hate it
when people take the law into their hands.

199
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:47,639
- Like a Batman.
- Like a Guardian Angel. What's that called?

200
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:52,230
- Like a vigilante.
- Like a vigilante! He's like a vigilante...

201
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,397
...uh, cat.

202
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:01,446
It's a cat who's a vigilante.
A cat who is a vigilante.

203
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:06,746
I got that, Gord. Listen, your drawings are
pretty good, but it doesn't make sense, OK?

204
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:08,709
It's fucking stupid. OK?

205
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:11,294
What you need here is elevation.

206
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:16,339
There has to be something that happens
that's funny. What the fuck's happening here?

207
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:19,001
- OK. That's a banana...
- I see the banana, Gord.

208
00:14:19,097 --> 00:14:21,055
- With string.
- I see the string.

209
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:25,009
With a bag of eyes on the other end,
ba-ba-baboon eyes...

210
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:27,595
...with sauce...

211
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,149
...uh, dripping.

212
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,689
Dripping sauce and a baboon.

213
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,198
You see what I mean?
It doesn't make any sense, Gord.

214
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:43,330
It sucks! The drawings are pretty good,
but the characters are lame.

215
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,913
God. The characters are lame.
I'm a loser. I wish I was dead!

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,954
Gord, listen! Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

217
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:53,081
I'm trying to give you
a piece of advice. Will you stop?

218
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:56,459
You gotta figure these animals out.
You gotta figure them out.

219
00:14:56,552 --> 00:15:00,251
You gotta get inside the animals. OK?

220
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:02,837
Figure them out.

221
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,807
Take that out. I can't understand.

222
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:08,642
- I gotta get inside the animals?
- Get inside the animals.

223
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:14,357
- You mean I shouldn't blow my brains out?
- No. No, you shouldn't blow your brains out.

224
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:17,564
Wanna play in the big leagues?
You gotta work on it 24 hours a day.

225
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:20,941
You gotta give it weeks and weeks
and months and months and years!

226
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:25,033
<i>And then if it doesn't work out, Gord,
then blow your fucking brains out.</i>

227
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:29,535
But, sir, I can't work on this all day.
I got a job at the cheese sandwich factory.

228
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:32,378
The cheese sandwich factory? That's funny.

229
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:35,582
No, it's true. I gotta make cheese sandwiches.

230
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,999
- I got rent and...
- Gord, listen.

231
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:42,043
If you really wanna be an animator,
you should quit the shitty cheese job.

232
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,215
Think about it, all right?

233
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:05,066
<i>Gord, you really wanna be an animator...</i>

Hello?

256
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,051
Now listen, Gordie's gonna be a little upset
about being back home, so just be nice.

257
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:29,212
I'm home.

258
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:38,140
- Gordie, sit down. We're having roast beef.
- Why do you guys always have roast beef?

259
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:44,234
Boo-hoo! Little Lord Fauntleroy's tummy
hurts cos there's too much roast beef in it.

260
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,728
It's just boring.

261
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:49,529
- I'm eating a chicken sandwich.
- You're not!

262
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:54,078
This is crazy. I'm 28 years old. I should
be able to eat a chicken sandwich if I want.

He's 28 years old and he can eat
a chicken sandwich. Very impressive.

00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,210
Jim, no!

267
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,841
You can either eat that goddamn roast beef,
or you can go to bed.

268
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:20,055
Good.

269

Don't hammer 'em so loud. Jeez.

- What?
- Oh, boys!

274
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:44,585
Will you two faggots stop making
so fucking much noise? We're sleeping.

00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:59,224

- Yeah, nearly, Mr. Malloy.

280
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:02,930
Hey, Gord.
Can I play on your ramp tomorrow?

281
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:05,811
Sure, Andy. Any time.

282
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,734
Has your dad got, like, bowel problems?

283

284
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,414
I gotta work tomorrow.

285
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:31,044
You mean to say we're finished now and you
are not gonna enjoy the fruits of your labor?

286
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:36,674
I don't have the right shoes on.
They're slippery and they got no sole.

287
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:42,474
- Just enjoy the fruits here.
- Don't say "the fruits".

288
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,609
OK.

289
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,152
Holy shit.

290
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,954
Dirty little shit! You think that's funny?
I gotta work in the morning.

Argh!

292
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:11,460

Oh! Oh, Christ! Oh, God!

295
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:18,680
Get him a job!

296
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:22,301
Get him an ambulance!
You get a job. He's got a job.

297
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:29,229
What the hell are you doing?

298
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:40,404

- Sh.

299
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:44,868
Wow. That's a...
Oh, that's a neat trick you do there.

301
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,331
Oh!

302
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:55,630
Wow. Are hospitals always this fun?

303
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,764
No. Sometimes... Sometimes
people here die of cancer.

304
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:04,264
- Cancer, huh?
- Yeah.

305
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:06,097
Hi, I'm Gord.

306
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:08,098
Hi. I'm Betty.

307
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:09,858
Uh...

308
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:14,320
- That creamer game's fun.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah, it's my hobby.

309
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:16,903
- Yeah. My passion is...
- Creamers?

310
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:20,075
No! No. Not just the creamers.

311
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,734
Physics. Flight, actually.

312
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,291
I'm kind of a rocket scientist,
to tell the truth. Yeah.

313
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:32,664
Well, OK, amateur. Amateur rocket scientist.

314
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:36,587
- It's still pretty crazy.
- Yeah. I know.

315
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:40,715
- What do you do?
- Me, uh...

316
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:44,425
Investments. I do investments.

317
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,765
Um... Consulting in the business... business.

318
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:52,024
Um, analyzing stocks.

319
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:57,068
<i>Uh... NASDAQ, Dow Jones,
Wall Street Journal...</i>

320
00:22:57,156 --> 00:23:01,783
...uh, New York City, CNN.
- Oh, wow. Wow. You must be rich.

321
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:07,077
Yeah. You know, they have creamers
in places other than hospitals.

322
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,167
And I thought...
If this is forward, just tell me...

323
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,704
...but maybe we could go to
one of those places, like a restaurant.

324
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:16,799
We could flip them together there sometime.

325
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,172
Uh...

326
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:21,549
That'd be fun. Here's my number.

327
00:23:21,638 --> 00:23:23,299
OK. Call me.

328
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:29,059
Oh, gotta run. I'll talk to you soon.
Call me, Gord.

329
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,562
Bye!

330
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,242
Have you seen that girl, the doctor?

331
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:55,835
No. I haven't exactly been able
to get up and wander around, Gord.

332
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:59,873
OK, well, it's weird cos I asked her out
on a date and she said yes.

333
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:03,385
- Yeah, that is weird.
- Excuse me. Could you keep it down?

334
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:05,760
This is a hospital room and I'm pregnant.

335
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:09,432
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't realize that you were pregnant.

336
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,767
So anyway, that girl I asked out on a date,
see, I thought she could walk.

337
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:18,319
- She's handicapped? Is that what you mean?
- She's in a wheelchair.

338
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:25,235
Could you please just shut the fuck up?!
I am fucking pregnant!

339
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:32,323
- You saying you hate people in wheelchairs?
- I don't hate them.

340
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:35,833
I think it's clear what you're saying.
You hate the handicapped.

341
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:39,005
I don't. You're handicapped.
I don't hate you. See?

342
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:43,676
You're handicapped. You're handicapped.

343
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:47,096
- You bastard!
- My baby's coming! My baby is coming!

344
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,265
Help.

345
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:58,230
Help. My baby is coming.

346
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,777
Oh, no.

347
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:01,736
No, no, no.

348
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:03,899
Oh! Oh!

349
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:08,660
- Are you OK, ma'am?
- My baby is coming. My baby is coming.

350
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:11,865
- Call the doctor, you fucking asshole!
- It's OK. I'm a doctor.

351
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:14,164
No, get me a real doctor.

352
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,873
I am a real doctor. See? I'm a real doctor.

353
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:21,252
Get away from me!

354
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,008
- Here. Spread your legs for me, OK?
- No! No!

355
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,803
What are you doing? What are you doing?!

356
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,387
- I see the problem here.
- Don't.

357
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,224
There seems to be a little baby
inside your body.

358
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,939
Here. Give me your head, little fellow.

359
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:45,232
Give me your head, little fellow.
Here, little fellow.

360
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,491
I got you. I got you. I got her. I got her.

361
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,952
I got her. I got her. I got her. I got her.

362
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,086
Put it back, Gord.

363
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:10,590
You gotta cut the cord.
You gotta cut the cord.

364
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:12,888
Jeez, do I have to do everything?

365
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:16,725
Oh, God. Help me.

366
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:26,066
Why isn't it crying?

367
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:28,148
Uh, it's sleeping?

368
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:32,287
- Give me my baby, you fucker!
- I'll wake up your baby.

369
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,455
- Gordie!
- Wakey-wakey! Wakey-wakey!

370
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:39,244
Wakey-wakey! Wakey-wakey!

371
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,808
I saved the day.

372
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,942
Thank you.

373
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:14,069
I saved the day.

374
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:19,155
I saved the day.

375
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:24,666
My pretty baby girl.

376
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,122
- Don't ever come back. Ever.
- I saved the day.

377
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:30,839
- You did not save the day.
- What's going on, Gord?

378
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,591
I saved the day. Don't touch
my shoulder, OK? I saved the day.

379
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:38,471
Seems like they got
a problem with heroes around here.

380
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:41,053
I saved the day, Betty.

381
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:43,472
- I'll call you tonight.
- OK.

382
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:55,362
Hey! Come on in. Just got four in a row.

383
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:59,163
- What?
- Creamers. Four creamer flips in a row.

384
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:01,740
- Come watch.
- Oh, cool.

385
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:05,371
Whoo! I got another one.

386
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:10,009
- No way. Are those actually rockets?
- Uh-huh.

387
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:14,042
- I'm designing a rocket-powered wheelchair.
- Really?

388
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:16,712
- That's incredible. Does it work?
- No.

389
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:20,225
No, I haven't been able
to quite figure it out yet.

390
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:22,767
Don't you feel like a stupid dummy?

391
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:27,652
- Excuse me?
- You tried to make it work, but it doesn't.

392
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:31,105
- It must make you feel like a stupid dummy.
- No.

393
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:37,654
I didn't expect to master the intricacies
of rocketry on my first attempt. It's a process.

394
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:42,538
- You sort of learn from your mistakes.
- Hm. Never thought of it like that.

395
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:46,501
Besides, they don't let me
work on it at the hospital.

396
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:50,420
They don't think handicapped people
should go fast, but it's bullshit...

397
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:52,964
...cos I like going fast and I like rockets...

398
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:56,921
...because they're hot...
and hard... and long.

399
00:29:03,563 --> 00:29:07,643
Actually, I thought we could
kinda go to a movie or something.

400
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,561
Uh, hi.

401
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:12,944
How are you?

402
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:17,528
Be a lot better if you'd spank my legs
with this bamboo.

403
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:19,777
Um...

404
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:21,116
What?

405
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:25,200
Just whack it against my shins
as hard as you can, OK?

406
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:27,370
Uh... I guess.

407
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,746
Um...

408
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:33,587
How's that?

409
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:36,083
Come on, Gordie.
You can do better than that.

410
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:38,467
What are you, a little puss?

411
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:41,723
- A puss? A pussy?
- Come on.

412
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,428
- Come on, pussy. You can do better.
- Pussy? I don't know...

413
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,929
- How's that?
- Come on, pussy, pussy!

414
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:51,230
Don't be shy, little pussy.

415
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,728
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

416
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:56,855
Oh, come on, I wanna see them bleed!

417
00:30:04,957 --> 00:30:07,448
Oh, yeah! I felt a tingle!

418
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:12,292
Oh, don't stop! Oh, yeah!

419
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:14,042
Oh! Oh!

420
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,335
You wanna get another tingle?

421
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:19,214
Ow! Gord, what the fuck?

422
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:24,465
Not my face! It's not my face
that's paralyzed, you fuck!

423
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:31,604
Sorry. I...

424
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:35,938
I've never really caned anyone before.

425
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:40,530
It's OK.

426
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:42,907
It's your turn now.

427
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:45,872
OK.

428
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:48,662
Don't do it too hard, though.

429
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:51,242
I've got sensitive knees.

430
00:30:53,214 --> 00:30:56,832
Oh, I'm not gonna whack your legs
with the bamboo, Gord.

431
00:30:57,385 --> 00:31:00,303
I'm gonna give you a blow job.

432
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:07,180
Betty, it's only our first date. We should go
do romantic stuff first, like walk in the park.

433
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,853
- I can't walk.
- Maybe I could take you out for a roll.

434
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,767
I'd rather stay here and suck!

435
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,525
The thing is... I think... OK.

436
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:21,690
Come here, Gord.

437
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,990
Uh...

438
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:31,745
Hm.

439
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:33,788
Um...

440
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:37,540
That's my umbilical cord.

441
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:42,216
Oh? Didn't you ever have that removed?

442
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:43,847
Um...

443
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:46,220
It's taped. It's just for fun.

444
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:49,384
I taped it there for fun.

445
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:51,852
Uh...

446
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:54,520
OK. I can work around it.

447
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:56,976
Wait... wait... wait...

448
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:01,728
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

449
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:04,868
OK.

450
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,255
- Hello, Father.
- Hey, Freddy!

451
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:30,508
- How are you, son?
- I'm working hard, just like you taught me.

452
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:34,103
- You moving back home, Freddy?
- What? No, no, no.

453
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,060
No way, Mother. I'm a man now.

454
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:41,231
I'm all grown up and I'm out on my own
and I'm earning a good living.

455
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:45,776
- Is it gonna be a busy day at the bank today?
- Well, I sure hope so.

456
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,285
Is that, um...?

457
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:54,915
Your big brother. He couldn't handle the
complexities of making a cheese sandwich...

458
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:58,418
...so now he's back home with us.
- Wow.

459
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:02,456
Jeez, is that idiot still in the shower?
Shit, how much water is he gonna use?

460
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:04,758
Yeah, how much is he gonna use? All of it?

461
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:07,515
He should save some for the fish. Huh, Pop?

462
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,527
Gord!

463
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:25,898
I'll fix him.

464
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:29,526
How's the water? Cold enough for ya?

465
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:45,129
Dammit. Don't tell me you're so stupid, you
can't tell the difference between hot and cold.

466
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:49,548
- What the fuck is going on?
- I'm underwater. Look, I found a treasure.

467
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,097
- A treasure? That's soap on a rope.
- Sh. I'm pretending it's a treasure.

468
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:58,521
Get out of my goddamn scuba gear,
you imbecile.

469
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:03,357
Oh, no, the treasure!
It went into that underwater cave.

470
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,106
Get out of that toilet!

471
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:09,985
Get out of that toilet!

472
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:13,030
Father, you saved me
from the giant barracuda.

473
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:17,250
But, look, I salvaged the treasure.
We can live like kings.

474
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:20,288
- We can live like kings!
- Forget that fucking soap.

475
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:25,622
Clean up this mess and get your ass
out that door looking for a job, you retard.

476
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:32,882
He's driving me insane.

477
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:36,595
No. No, you're driving him insane.

478
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:39,807
You're older than me
and you still live at home.

479
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,224
I have a job, you know. I pay my own way.

480
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:46,944
- You work in a bank. Should I be dazzled?
- Well, at least I don't live at home.

481
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,863
No, you live in a tiny shithole
and you come here to eat for free.

482
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:53,987
Whatever. Listen, I'm off to work now, OK?

483
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,365
Me and Dad have jobs.
We're doing something with our lives.

484
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,909
It's time for you to grow up.
Good luck with that job hunt, OK?

485
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:04,039
All right. Let's cross our fingers.
OK, Freddy?

486
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,298
Let's cross our fingers
and hope I get a job. I'm serious.

487
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,425
Just cross your fingers.

488
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:11,588
All right! Fingers crossed.

489
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:15,805
I hope I get a jobbie, Freddy.
I got my fingers crossed.

490
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:19,557
- I hope I get a job. I got my fingers crossed.
- Goodbye, Gord.

491
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:22,433
I got my fingers crossed.

492
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:26,059
Crossed. Crossed. Cro...

493
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:30,440
...ssed.

What in God's name are you doing,
you stupid little man? Wait...

516
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:56,818
Did you get a job?

517
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,029
Yeah.

518
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:02,122
I got a job and I wanted to surprise you.

519
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,333
Hey, you bullshitting me, boy?

520
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:09,333
No, I got a job working nights
at a computer company.

521
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:13,800
I was borrowing one of your suits till I could
get enough money to buy one of my own.

522
00:37:13,885 --> 00:37:16,211
Are you kidding? You can keep that suit.

523
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:20,765
Oh, Gord, I knew you had it in ya.
You're just a late bloomer, that's all.

524
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,724
Yeah, I just bloomed late.

525
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:25,765
Hey, can I borrow 50 bucks
or something? For supplies.

526
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:29,806
For, like, pens or Liquid Paper
or a Trapper Keeper...

527
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:33,851
...or one of those little compasses
that you put the pencil in...

528
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:36,864
...and you can make a circle,
a perfect circle.

529
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:39,322
Hey, worker, take a hundred.

530
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:44,867
Golly, Gord. I knew if I kept yelling at ya,
pounding you over the head with it...

531
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,034
...you'd come around.

Oh! Oh, Gord. Oh, you're amazing!

538
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:16,772
- Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
- I'm doing it good.

539
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:18,988
Agh! Agh!

00:38:19,076 --> 00:38:23,238
Aaaaagh!

541
00:38:25,915 --> 00:38:28,702

- Oh, no!

00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:32,578
Oh, that was incredible.
Time for your blow job, Gordie.

543
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:34,831
Oh, not right now, Betty.

544
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:38,128
- Oh, Gordie, come on.
- I thought we could have a nice evening.

545
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,627
- Don't you want me to suck it?
- No, no, no.

546
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:43,296
- Betty, let go. Betty, just let go.
- No, no.

547
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:48,103
- What, Gordie? Come on!
- Betty! Betty! Betty! Betty, come on.

548
00:38:48,188 --> 00:38:49,848
- Betty, stop it.
- What?

549
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,015
Stop it!

550
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:56,102
Why are you yelling?

551
00:38:56,196 --> 00:39:01,487
It's crazy. This is the second date we haven't
gone out on yet, and if you do this again...

552
00:39:01,577 --> 00:39:05,195
...you'll have sucked 200% more times
than we've gone out on dates.

553
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:09,617
And I just think if we went out on at least
one date and you didn't do any sucking...

554
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:15,048
...that'd make the whole sucking-to-date
ratio far more balanced, you know?

555
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:19,502
Yeah. OK. Let's go out then.

556
00:39:20,804 --> 00:39:22,879
Good. Good.

Jim, thank you for
taking me out for dinner tonight.

559
00:39:45,912 --> 00:39:51,832
Maybe now that Gord is working, we can

Andy, would you like a piece of cake?

563
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,673
Am I really allowed a piece of cake, Daddy?

564
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:11,768
Of course you can have a piece of cake.
It's your birthday.

So, Gord...

567
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:29,735
...is your job really hard?

568
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:34,619
It's not hard, no. I mean,
you have to be smart, really smart.

I like to see when the stocks are high, OK?

571
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:45,549
- And I like to see when they're low.
- That's interesting.

572
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:49,506
Sometimes they're really high.
Sometimes they're very high.

573
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,309
That's high!

574
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:56,020
That's when you wanna sell.
You buy them when they're down very low.

575
00:40:56,106 --> 00:40:59,226
Yeah. I have some graphs I can show you.

576
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,779
If you pay attention to these patterns here,
you can see. I made these on my computer.

577
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:07,615
Oh, boy. I need to spill some urine.
Where can I do that?

578
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:11,201

585
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:37,478
Oh, yeah.

586
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:40,354
This is my... This is my cellular telephone.

587
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:47,359
It's wireless. It uses satellites and terrestrial
antennas to send and receive transmissions.

588
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:50,023
It's, um... It's a new thing.

- I'm great.

- Yeah. That kid of mine is something else.

He's working day and night
at his big, new computer job.

596
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:14,763
- Yeah, I noticed him over there.
- Say what?

597
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:18,019
It looked like he was having
an important business meeting.

598
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:21,439
- Oh, yeah.
- Speak up. I'm on my cellular telephone.

599
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:25,025
I don't care, Bob.
You're fired. You're fired!

600
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:27,189
You're fucking fired, Bob!

601
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:30,651
Clean out your locker at the club, Bob.
You're fucking fired!

602

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,531
I'm talking about 40 million
fucking Deutschmark here, Bob.

604
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,116
40 million fucking Deutschmark!

605
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:43,912
I told you to wire the money
to Geneva last week.

606
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:48,300
I say Geneva, you hear Helsinki, huh?!

607
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:51,719
40 million fucking Deutschmark, Bob!

608
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:58,099
- What's going on?
- Da... Jim. Uh, Jim, hi.

609
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:01,686
- Gord, is this your dad?
- No, this is little Timmy. Little Timmy.

610
00:43:01,774 --> 00:43:05,688
He works at the company.
He gets us food and stuff. Right, Timmy?

611
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:09,936
What the fuck is going on, Gord?
Why aren't you at your new job?

612
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:13,280
What are you talking about, Timmy?

613
00:43:13,953 --> 00:43:16,526
Oh, Jesus, Gord.

614
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:20,038
There is no computer job, is there?

615
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:25,333
You're just gallivanting around in my suit,
pretending to be a mover and a shaker.

616
00:43:25,422 --> 00:43:27,795
OK, Timmy. I'm on the cell... phone here.

617
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:30,671
This is my phone from my kitchen.

618
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:33,430
What the hell is this? Ah, boy.

619
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:35,590
Here we go. Hah!

620
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:38,495
My goddamn tape recorder.

621
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:44,643
He's pretending to have a cell phone. He's
an unemployed loser living in my basement.

622
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,269
Wait a minute.

623
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:49,937
- You're a cripple.
- Dad.

624
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,106
- Wha... What?
- Dad.

625
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,034
- Got a problem with my legs?
- You've got the problem.

626
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,654
- Either that, or you're just lazy.
- Hey, Dad, just shut up, OK?

627
00:43:58,748 --> 00:44:00,907
You're telling me to shut up?!

628
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,617
- Why is he shouting, Daddy?
- Can we get the check over here?

629
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:07,962
...retard, slut, whore!
- I am not retarded.

630
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:11,418
<i>- (# band play "Marriage of Figaro" by Mozart)
- Daddy! Daddy!</i>

631
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,420
Goodbye, Gord.

632
00:44:13,513 --> 00:44:15,589
Betty, don't go!

633
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:17,717
Shut up, Dad!

634
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:19,676
Shut up! Shut up!

635
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:27,557
- This is a fancy restaurant.
- Oh, this is a fancy restaurant.

636
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:33,357
This is a fancy restaurant.
It's a fancy... It's a fancy restaurant.

637
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:37,157
- Spanking. Spanking.
- You want a spanking?

638
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,320
Spanking. Spanking.

639
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:41,497
Agh!

640
00:44:41,707 --> 00:44:43,700
Agh!

641
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:53,416
Get off the fucking bar, asshole!

642
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:01,890
Um...

643
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:04,053
...thanks for bailing me out, Betty.

644
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:08,973
Your dad called me a retard, slut, whore.
I don't think he likes me too much, Gord.

645
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:11,356
- That was little Timmy.
- Gord.

646
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:13,979
Come here.

647
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:15,864
I know it was your dad.

648
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:20,529
- You could have told me you lived at home.
- Even though that means I'm a loser?

649
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,832
Just because you're not a stockbroker
doesn't mean you're a loser.

650
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,909
<i>So what do you do?</i>

651
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:28,995
Actually, I kinda draw pictures.

652
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:32,788
Really? What kind of pictures? Like fruits?

653
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:36,548
- Oh, not fruits. I've drawn fruit before.
- Yeah?

654
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:39,210
- Animations.
- Oh, wow.

655
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:42,509
That's great. I've never met
a real animator before.

656
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,678
I'm not really a real animator.

657
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:49,017
Life's hectic. I'm having trouble
concentrating, with all the skateboarding...

658
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:51,682
...and you sucking my penis all the time.

659
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:56,567
Oh, my ear popped. My ear just popped.

660
00:45:57,157 --> 00:46:01,107
- I think I heard it.
- When I laughed, my ear popped.

661
00:46:02,288 --> 00:46:05,703
Well, Gordie, maybe
you're concentrating a little too hard.

662
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:09,076
Maybe you just need to relax while you draw.

663
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:12,753
You know, eat some food, play some music.

664
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,336
I only have two hands, Betty.
How am I supposed to do all that?

665
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:20,346
- What?
- Eat food and play music and draw?

666
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:24,682
- What?
- At the same time?

667
00:46:25,227 --> 00:46:27,303
Oh... yeah.

668
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:51,201
# Sausages, sausages, sausages
Sausages, sausages, sausages

669
00:46:51,545 --> 00:46:56,088
What in the name of
sweet breakfast meats are you doing?

670
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:58,463
For your information, I'm being creative.

671
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:02,052
Betty told me this is what
I need to do to become an artist.

672
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:04,346
Oh, yeah? Is it working?

673
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:09,764
I don't know. I can't think of
anything to draw because I'm so stupid!

674
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:11,598
# I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid

675
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,106
# I'm so stupid, I'm stupid,
I'm stupid, I'm stupid, I'm stupid...

676
00:47:15,194 --> 00:47:18,277
Shit. Hey, this is kinda funny, Gord.

677
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:24,737
- Yeah?
- Maybe you can't see it cos he's your dad...

678
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,912
...but he's a character, your dad.

679
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:30,414
- He is?
- Yeah.

680
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:34,083
- He's a character?
- Shit. It's your dad.

681
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:39,331
- # He's a real character, he's a real character
- Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Brody. Goodbye.

682
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:45,053
- # Sausage, sausage...
- Oh, look, honey. Our boy's a genius.

683
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:49,517
He's rigged a pulley system so he can eat
sausage and work on his stupid drawings.

684
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:55,396
I'm being creative. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I still have some work to do.

685
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:59,814
# Daddy, would you like some sausage?
Daddy, would you like some sausages?

686
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:04,199
# Daddy, would you like some sausage?
Sausages? Sausages?

687
00:48:04,285 --> 00:48:06,158
Ow! Ow! Ow!

688
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,701
Now, you just get outside
and you just cool off!

689
00:48:16,338 --> 00:48:22,174
If this were Pakistan, you'd have been sewing
soccer balls when you were four years old.

690
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:26,090
Miserable, deadbeat punk.

691
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:28,588
I bust my ass working for my family.

692
00:48:28,683 --> 00:48:31,554
You take his side every time.

693
00:48:31,978 --> 00:48:35,394
You want me to cool down?
All right, I'm gonna show you a cool down.

694
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:37,973
Oh, just keep kissing his ass.

695
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:40,986
Cool down!

696
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:44,522
Hey? How's this for a cool down? Agh!

697
00:48:49,955 --> 00:48:51,449
I feel better already.

698
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:57,579
Aaaagh!

699
00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:17,430
My ramp... Why?

700
00:49:21,528 --> 00:49:25,395
- He's such a stupid loser.
- He's not stupid.

701
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,191
We shouldn't put up with the way
he treats us. I wouldn't stand for it.

702
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:32,536
If I were you, I would show him
that I deserve respect.

703
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,532
- If I were you, I would go out. I'd have sex.
- Oh, honey. No.

704
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:39,997
If I were you, I'd go out.
I'd have sex with strange men.

705
00:49:40,088 --> 00:49:42,793
I'd have sex with basketball players.

706
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:45,125
I'd have sex with Greeks.

707
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:47,543
Men from Greece.

708
00:49:47,637 --> 00:49:49,760
I'd satisfy my urges.

709
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:52,423
I'd satisfy my sexual desires.

710
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:55,269
Gordie, honey, come on.
Let's go in the house.

711
00:49:55,812 --> 00:49:57,604
Come on.

712
00:49:57,982 --> 00:49:59,974
Come on.

713
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:03,269
- That's my ramp.
- I know.

714
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,315
- He wrecked my ramp.
- I know. It's OK.

715
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:09,526
- My skateboard ramp.
- I'm sorry.

716
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:15,301
I had the sausages on my fingers.
I was trying to play piano.

717
00:50:15,386 --> 00:50:19,763
I had the sausages.
I had the sausages and the string.

718
00:50:19,848 --> 00:50:24,391
I was playing the organ,
and then he smashed my half-pipe.

719
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:27,230
Jim, do you hear what Gord is saying here?

720
00:50:27,314 --> 00:50:31,727
I hear him boohooing about his broken
wheelie-board ramp. Is that what you mean?

721
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:35,068
<i>Yes, Jim. But do you
understand what he's saying?</i>

722
00:50:35,447 --> 00:50:39,113
Sounds to me like he just wants you
to accept him as your son.

723
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:42,155
To approve of him
and what he wants to do with his life.

724
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:44,411
How does that make you feel?

725
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,533
First of all, I don't give a rat's ass
what this punk wants.

726
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,375
As long as he lives in my house
and eats my food, I make the rules.

727
00:50:51,463 --> 00:50:53,835
- I wanna eat chicken burgers.
- You prick.

728
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:56,629
Jim, don't hurt my baby. Now, sit down.

729
00:50:57,386 --> 00:50:59,878
You're an embarrassment to my family.

730
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,052
Oh, yeah? Well, at least
I don't touch Freddy.

731
00:51:06,478 --> 00:51:08,850
- Say what?
- Excuse me?

732
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:14,855
Yeah, he touches my little brother. He takes
him behind the furnace and touches him.

733
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,733
- See the insanity I put up with?
- He's embarrassed.

734
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,361
- Jim!
- He touches my little brother.

735
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:22,609
He...

736
00:51:22,703 --> 00:51:24,945
He... He fingers him.

737
00:51:25,038 --> 00:51:28,739
- You're a goddamn liar.
- Jim! Do you touch him?

738
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:31,374
Do you finger our boy?

739
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:34,497
Don't get wacky on me.
What the fuck are we talking about?

740
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:36,747
Mr. Brody, this is very serious.

741
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:41,510
Based on what I've heard here today,
I am required by law to notify the authorities.

742
00:51:41,596 --> 00:51:44,597
You hear that, Dad? You're gonna pay!

743
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:49,556
He's a molester. He's a child molester!

744
00:51:49,646 --> 00:51:51,306
Agh!

745
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,777
You'd better run, you li-aaaaaaar!

746
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:08,990
<i>... so then we placed a retractor.
This holds the abdominal wall open.</i>

747
00:52:29,227 --> 00:52:31,469
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Uh, yes, you can.

748
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:33,888
We're here for little Freddy.

749
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:36,850
I'm Freddy.

750
00:52:37,527 --> 00:52:39,235
Oh.

751
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,562
Well, um...

752
00:52:41,656 --> 00:52:44,610
...Freddy, I'm a doctor.

754
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:49,745
What?

755
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:54,116
- What did I do wrong?
- No. No, you didn't do anything wrong.

756
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,330
That's the most important thing
for you to remember.

757
00:52:57,422 --> 00:53:00,293
It's not your fault your dad fingered you.

My dad doesn't finger me.

- No! No, I'm not going anywhere.

- It's over, Freddy.

We'll take you someplace where
your dad won't be able to hurt you any more.

Are you crazy?

- Help.
- I'll get you a lawyer.

Freddy, no!

771

- I've never been fingered!
- It's OK, Julie.

Your husband's deeply disturbed and we
won't let him hurt your little boy any more.

sandwich, that's just two slices of bread.

01:02:59,439 --> 01:03:02,475
No, you're not!
Not in this damn car you're not!

906
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:06,434
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- Fuck you! Thief! Thief! Thief!

907
01:03:11,409 --> 01:03:13,983
- Where the fuck is he?
- Mr. Brody?

908
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,699
- Where's my son?
- What?

909
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:18,450
Where is he?

910
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:21,329
Mr. Brody, please! I don't know. Agh!

911
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,337
Are you gonna tell me, you little punk-ass?

912
01:03:26,634 --> 01:03:29,504
He's in Hollywood, selling his cartoons.

913
01:03:39,438 --> 01:03:42,190
Aaaaagh!

914
01:03:48,321 --> 01:03:51,026
Japan 4!

915
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,160
OK. Davidson for four...

916
01:03:57,247 --> 01:04:00,249
Mr. Davidson, I have
something you need to see.

917
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:03,452
- Is there a bomb in there, Gord?
- It's not a bomb.

918
01:04:04,003 --> 01:04:08,049
I did what you told me. I quit my shitty
cheese job, moved in with my parents.

919
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:11,917
I worked really hard and
I came up with a concept. It's called:

920
01:04:12,346 --> 01:04:14,219
..."Zebras in America". OK?

921
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:16,512
It's about a family who move to America.

922
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,467
It's a classic fish-out-of-water story,
except it's not fish...

923
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:24,310
...it's, uh, zebras... out of water.

924
01:04:24,399 --> 01:04:29,441
- Zebras don't live in water, but I understand.
- I know. That's what I'm talking about.

925
01:04:29,529 --> 01:04:32,814
<i>The zebras aren't in the water.
It's like Splash.</i>

926
01:04:32,907 --> 01:04:38,115
I saw it. I loved it. But is this the father
character with a goatee like you? Is that him?

927
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:41,621
- Yeah.
- Just seems a little unrealistic, that's all.

928
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:43,167
- Unrealistic?
- Yeah.

929
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:49,165
<i>- He's a centaur, like a half-man, half-zebra.
- Right. Clash of the Titans. I saw it. I get it.</i>

930
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:51,665
Half-man, half-zebra, mutant. He's a...

931
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,378
- The myth. The myth.
- It's a myth. It's like a Greek myth.

932
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:58,093
It's like a Greek myth, except African.

933
01:04:58,183 --> 01:05:00,852
- African...
- African-American-Greek...

934
01:05:00,936 --> 01:05:02,312
- Myth.
- Yes.

935
01:05:06,023 --> 01:05:08,182
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, you can, miss.

936
01:05:08,276 --> 01:05:10,683
Get off your ass and tell me where my son is.

937
01:05:10,778 --> 01:05:13,614
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Get the fuck out...

938
01:05:13,698 --> 01:05:15,572
Argh!

939
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:22,286
- But the father is real.
- Nobody does this shit. I don't buy it.

940
01:05:22,373 --> 01:05:24,580
- It doesn't seem real.
- Here you are...

941
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:28,617
...you goddamn lying,
car-thieving, doodling time-waster!

942
01:05:32,259 --> 01:05:35,425
- What's so fucking funny, you little prick?
- You're funny.

943
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:40,138
You think it's funny to brainwash my kid,
so he sits around with his fingers up his ass?

944
01:05:40,225 --> 01:05:42,264
I'll show you what's funny.

945
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:47,559
- Mr. Davidson, run!
- Don't hurt me, big daddy. Don't hurt me(!)

946
01:05:48,776 --> 01:05:52,903
This is my son here. I'm the father here.

947
01:05:52,987 --> 01:05:56,735
I'll get you. Goddamn you, Gord.
You son of a bitch!

948
01:05:57,158 --> 01:05:59,032
You too, you little prick!

949
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,036
Ow! That hurt. Hey. Ow.

950
01:06:02,706 --> 01:06:04,579
Great job. Nice show.

951
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:07,999
Where d'you get this guy?
Central Casting? He is fucking great.

952
01:06:08,085 --> 01:06:10,623
It was hilarious, Gord. That's great shit.

953
01:06:11,297 --> 01:06:14,334
Mr. Davidson, I'm sorry.
That's my father. He's crazy.

954
01:06:14,426 --> 01:06:18,673
Gord, whatever. Do me a favor,
stop the act. Let me tell you something.

955
01:06:20,014 --> 01:06:22,587
I've been doing this job, OK, for six years.

956
01:06:22,683 --> 01:06:25,969
I have never seen a more
creative or exciting pitch than that.

957
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:30,391
I wasn't even thinking about writing
a cheque today, but with such creativity...

958
01:06:30,483 --> 01:06:34,018
...I'm comfortable
green-lighting this fucking project.

959
01:06:34,112 --> 01:06:39,782
I'm gonna write you a cheque right now for,
I don't know, how's $1 million sound to you?

960
01:06:40,826 --> 01:06:43,069
Oh... Uh...

961
01:06:43,163 --> 01:06:46,080

- Sounds...

962

Hi, my name is Harry.

963
01:06:50,295 --> 01:06:52,289
Do you hear the funny sound?

964
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:56,459
It's my hooves. It's my hooves.

965
01:06:56,634 --> 01:07:00,169
<i>In Africa, the humans hated us
because of our zebra lower bodies.</i>

966
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:03,300
<i>And zebras hated us
because of our human upper bodies.</i>

967
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:07,389
<i>So my family moved from Africa
to start over in America.</i>

968
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:10,183
<i>But life in America wasn't perfect.</i>

969
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:15,484
<i>Especially for zebras who are
used to living in fields, not houses.</i>

My dad was weird in Africa,
but America made him crazy.

972
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,032
I'm not getting a stupid job, Dad.
I never had a part-time job in Africa.

973
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:32,332
How dare you!

974

How do you like that, fucker?
How do you like that, fucker? Huh, fucker?

- It's a cheque for a million dollars.

992

I sold my cartoon. My dad said I couldn't
sell it, but guess what? I sold my cartoon.

01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:56,247
- For a million dollars!
- Sh. Sh...

994
01:08:56,337 --> 01:09:00,169
I got a million dollars for my little drawings.
For my little drawings.

01:09:00,257 --> 01:09:05,678
No, don't rub on Mr. Lee. No, no, no,
