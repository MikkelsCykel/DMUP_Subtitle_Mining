00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,300
You've just got a friend there.

8
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Your bets.

9
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,000
He is handycaped
This misses a leg.

10
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,000
I put two in red.
- Too late, Frank, the riders walk out

11
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Give it back.
- Sorry, Frank, you are owed the bank

12
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,300
Transfer?
- I go out, Frank.

13
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,000
Just so?

14
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
Well.

15
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Where is Hedges?

16
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,100
Have you seen him?
He said it.

17
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Is that so?
- You're the next Lenny.

18
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
If they let him go
then you also have a good chance.

19
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,900
They will not as a dream couple
apart?

20
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,900
Drake!

21
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,200
Get your paws off me!

22
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,600
Hedges!

23
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Catwalk!

24
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,000
Hello, brother.

25
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,800
Come on, let's get them.
- You smoked.

26
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Give me one. Come on.
You have them all.

27
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,300
Someone takes care of you.
- Of course not.

28
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,700
Are you sure?
- Yes, I want one of the sissies.

29
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,200
Come on, come on.
Give me one.

30
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,700
Pansy!

31
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,100
Hey, you!
Look good to me!

32
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
The next time I see you
stand with your face against the wall!

33
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Against the wall, yeah!
- You bet.

34
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,400
Pansy! Pansy! Pansy!

35
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,800
Pansy! Pansy! Pansy!

36
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,300
This is your cell. This is your bed.
This is your celgenoot.

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
You come at the wrong time,
the chapel is closed.

49
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,500
Perry!

50
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,000
Well...

51
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,400
It is a while ago.

52
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,700
I wait outside.

53
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,400
This is very difficult.

54
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
But...

55
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I have her own show.

56
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It is dinner time, Batista.

57
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,900
Book!

58
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,600
Book.

59
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Magazine.

60
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Give me a ticket.

61
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,200
Come on, a ticket, Batista.

62
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,200
Give me one.

63
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,400
Give it to me!

64
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,700
Ask your brother.

65
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,300
Do you just wait.

66
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,300
It is cheeky, Rizza!
You know that, damn!

67
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Go away.
You hear me, Tony. Go away.

68
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,300
Batista!

69
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,300
Come with me.

70
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Your choice.

71
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Tony said...

72
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,400
Tony...

73
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
Checkmate.

74
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
The first time in 11 years.

75
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Another game?

76
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,900
Lacey, a round to go.

77
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,500
I do not want.
- Go to a button.

78
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Come on.

79
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,900
Five minutes.

80
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,400
What?

81
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,400
The ventilation pipes in the laundry.

82
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Are they connected to the sewer?

83
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,600
What do you mean?
- The back of the dryer.

84
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,800
Is this connected to the sewerage system?

85
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,500
Frank, what is going on?

86
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,800
My first letter in 14 years.

87
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,300
Since that my little girl
is a junkie.

88
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,500
Her heart is twice ever since.

89
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,000
She is not...
- No.

90
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,500
Before it happens again...

91
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
I must see her.

92
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,200
I have things straight.
- Frank!

93
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,000
I want out, Brodie.

94
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Not in a month,
not six.

95
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,600
Now.

96
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,600
Are the ventilation pipes in the laundry connected?
- Frank, I do not think...

97
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,000
Are they connected?
I do not ask again.

98
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,400
Yes.

99
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,000
But the vent is closed.
You will not go through a hardened steel.

100
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Lenny Drake can do it.
- Lenny Drake? That is rapidly released.

101
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,800
His release was rejected.
Hedges was against the early release.

102
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,300
Suppose you come across,

103
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,000
then somewhere on the shaft.
They await you on top.

104
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,400
So I go deeper.

105
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,700
No, I do not back down.
- Should you not.

106
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Jesus, Frank. You know why I'm here.
- Will you listen?

107
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,200
I want you to tell me not come.
- I can not tell you.

108
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,500
Damn.

109
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,000
I can not even draw a map for you.

110
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,900
Are you sure of your case?

111
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,800
Frank!

112
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Without me, you save it.

113
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Look at someone else.

114
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,900
I am not in the mood for a chat.
- I can understand that.

115
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,400
That bastard has betrayed me.

116
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,400
I can tell you that nobody
more surprised than me.

117
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,000
He hit out
and I pay for Gomez?

118
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,600
I have a security guard slain,
but Hedges had him detained.

119
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,300
When I roll-out door...

120
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,600
Suppose I'll get there,
with me?

121
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,300
Take me in the piss, Perry!
I am not to vote.

122
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,100
Would you prefer to save that sandbag
or number two?

123
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,100
Save?

124
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,200
I had some brutal in mind.

125
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,500
You walk through walls, Lenny.
This is very useful.

126
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,600
Is that so?

127
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,100
Suppose that we talk
and you're not interested,

128
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,400
there is still that we
never have spoken.

129
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,400
Yes, without saying anything.

130
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Domino.

131
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,600
Three players.

132
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Well. Closures.

133
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,000
One.

134
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,600
Two.

135
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,700
Three.

136
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Locks?
- Grendel and keys.

137
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Chance.

138
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,200
I am a thief, not a magician.

139
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,400
There is another way.
- How?

140
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,200
The shower drain.

141
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Right there.

142
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,400
The same problem there.
And more walls.

143
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,600
But one. The chapel wall.

144
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,700
That lasts all night.
- Once considered to confess?

145
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Behind the confessional...
separate panels.

146
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,700
And the chapel door?

147
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,500
What about the tools?

148
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
The Lord...

149
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,300
for us.

150
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
Domino.

151
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,000
The first battle
they come after us.

152
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,600
Alarm could be louder.
- Who sets that? - We.

153
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,000
If they see that we are missing.
- It is an obstacle course.

154
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,600
If they chase us...

155
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,800
We are past the drainage as the alarm
sounds. By the time they leave...

156
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,700
We are in the laundry.
- How long before you're in the laundry?

157
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,000
Five minutes.

158
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,300
That is enough.

159
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,000
Well.

160
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,200
Next piece.
The dryer.

161
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,600
Locks?
- Older than me.

162
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,800
What about the vent cover?

163
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,100
Since you do not worry about it.

164
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,400
I normally do.
- Yes, I am sure.

165
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,400
Do you have something that cuts through steel?

166
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,800
I have everything needed.

167
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,500
Have you five minutes, Two Ton?

168
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,400
I think I have a challenger
for you have found.

169
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,000
Domino.

170
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,300
Once we have been received,
you breathe, and you do not talk.

171
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,300
That underground is an echo.

172
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Ignore you think
that just makes you crazy.

173
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,300
The things below are different.

174
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,400
The venting channel of the laundry
brings us to here, to a shaft.

175
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,700
Then we go deeper.

176
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,800
The drain.

177
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,900
We must pass through.
And then...

178
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,700
To the river.

179
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,300
What river?
- We are in the South, remember?

180
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,200
I can not swim.

181
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,400
No? We go underneath.

182
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,400
There is a reservoir below the dam.

183
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,300
This is the network connected.

184
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,200
As soon as we get to the rails,
All roads lead to Rome.

185
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,500
For 'Charing Cross' come out.

186
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,500
Why there? There are stations closer?
- Many outputs.

187
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,300
Easy in the rush hour to disappear.
- No, for the rush hour.

188
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
From five o'clock, the track under power.
630 Volts.

189
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,600
If we are not on the platform,
then we tap-dance.

190
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,700
How do you know all this?
How did he know all this?

191
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,300
Because I have 12 years.

192
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,500
For you a routine job.

193
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,700
Ok. How much time?

194
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,700
The night bell is about nine hours.
That gives us eight hours.

195
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,400
Where do we start?
- How long do you need?

196
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,800
Three days.

197
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,000
That is good for me.

198
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,900
On Friday...

199
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,100
we go away.

200
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Another thing:

201
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,900
Make sure you tonight
not killed.

202
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:53,500
Please proof that
David against Goliath, is bullshit.

203
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,300
I would not be sure.

204
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,900
Did you drop something?

205
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,800
That I had not seen.

206
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,700
No, you do not.

207
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,400
Thought you were smart, Frank?

208
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,600
Was?

209
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,900
Do you consent?

210
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,500
That you do not.

211
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,100
Shit.

212
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Rizza will not like.

213
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,500
The problem is,
that if my foot opendoe,

214
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,700
that those of you pissing.

215
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,500
You might want to regulate.
Problems.

216
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,800
What?

217
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,300
Wait a minute, Frank.
Ren is not gone.

218
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,300
I'm faster.

219
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,500
To find out Rizza,
nowhere to go.

220
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,300
Unless you do me a favor.

221
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,000
Yes, that's correct.

222
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,900
Do they still all in a row?

223
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,800
Tomorrow, when the first call, Frank.

224
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,600
In your cell, Frank, yes?

225
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,300
First bell.

226
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,300
Drop it!

227
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,300
Do not.
I do not want you ruining!

228
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,700
'Fish and Chips "with much vinegar?
Who want that?

229
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,400
You look there is to it?

230
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,500
Right?

231
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,700
A bench in the park,
the first summer...

232
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,300
A beautiful large portion
fresh fried cod,

233
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,200
wrapped in a newspaper.

234
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,100
Beautiful girls who look past jogging...
Understand what I mean?

235
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,700
No.

236
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,000
Are you okay?

237
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,700
What?

238
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,400
Tony.

239
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,600
Fuck.
- What?

240
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,500
How has he come back?

241
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,900
What does he want?
- Half a kilo.

242
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Half a kilo? This is very much worth it.
- We have alternatives.

243
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,100
Yes, I think the option;
for him to murder.

244
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,100
Rizza and get behind us.
No way. Tony has been untouchable.

245
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,800
Not Tony. Batista. We murder him
and plunder his hideout.

246
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,500
What do we do? Looking under
his mattress? Checking his pockets?

247
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,600
The guy is a professional,
underestimated him.

248
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,300
He is not Superman!

249
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,400
Nobody's hands
to Tony dirt. Nobody!

250
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,300
Blow your case?
- No.

251
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,600
So?

252
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,300
What if...

253
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,400
freedom,
for Batista would be worth something?

254
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,400
Half a kilo?

255
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,500
Should I just give you that?
- No.

256
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,100
It is an exchange.

257
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Who goes there any more?

258
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,800
Brodie.

259
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,800
And Lenny Drake.

260
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,300
Lenny Drake?

261
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,400
Half a kilo CAT
My monthly production.

262
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,400
Tony knows that.

263
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,400
So...
Tony about anything.

264
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,200
He will think that you me
have me killed or stolen.

265
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,800
And that stops me in a coffin,
I Rizza no liver.

266
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,300
It...

267
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,800
as Tony knows, Tony will know it.

268
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,000
He will not let you.

269
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,900
But if you want to act
then I trade with you.

270
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,300
CAT is a dangerous drug
but it is fatally poisoned.

271
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Do you understand?

272
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:08,100
If it looks like,
smells and tastes like CAT...

273
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,100
Who will know?
- No person shall matures to Tony.

274
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,500
Rizza...
- Rizza?

275
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,400
Who says it Rizza?

276
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,300
Junkies die every day.

277
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,100
Well.

278
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,200
We do business.

279
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,300
Shit.

280
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,500
Brodie, wait!

281
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,900
Brodie...

282
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,100
<i>Lights out. </ i></i>

283
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,100
You smoke?

284
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,700
That was the last time that I've seen.

285
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Tomorrow she is 21.

286
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,700
<i>He took a knife and cut her loose. </ i></i>

287
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:36,600
<i>And on her breast, he found these lines: </ i></i>

288
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,300
<i>Oh, what a stupid girl </ i></i>

289
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:49,500
<i>I was still, hanging myself
a butcher boy. </ i></i>

290
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:55,400
<i>Go dig my grave
well wide and deep. </ i></i>

291
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,900
<i>Put a marble stone
to my head and feet </ i></i>

292
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,500
<i>And on my grave... </ i></i>

293
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:42,200
<i>...I love died. </ i></i>

294
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,900
This is cozy.

295
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,200
Wrap him in a blanket,
he's cold.

296
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,900
Give us a moment.
- No.

297
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,500
No, he continues.

298
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,700
I love his company.

299
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,700
You have something for me or not, Frank.

300
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,600
What does Sykes here?

301
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,800
Call it peace of mind.

302
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,600
How do I know if you shut up?

303
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,000
Be glad you still stands.
- I want a guarantee.

304
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,600
What do you want?
- It is trade.

305
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,700
I want a guarantee that you keep your mouth,
otherwise there is no deal.

306
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:04,200
You make the rules.

307
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,300
Yes.

308
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,100
Try it.

309
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,700
Rizza!

310
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,100
Rizza!

311
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:37,200
It is good.
It's good, kid.

312
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,700
<i>Make the door </ i></i>

313
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,400
<i>Do it, Perry! Now </ i></i>

314
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,400
Frank...

315
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
Frank.

316
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,200
I see something.
- What?

317
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,900
He came from nothing.

318
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,000
Could you do nothing?

319
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,500
He is now a walking body.
- That we all.

320
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,400
Why?
Little has solved for us.

321
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,100
As soon as he finds Sykes,
Rizza is from his roof.

322
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,000
Rizza know nothing.

323
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,300
The only thing he knows,
is that Tony cases.

324
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,900
And Lacey?
What happens to him?

325
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,100
He will not stay down long.

326
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,000
That makes for Rizza.

327
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,800
Let him Rizza about?

328
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:03,100
What weighs more, Frank:
a tonne of bricks...

329
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,400
or a ton of feathers?

330
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
He is a dead man,
with or without us.

331
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:22,200
We are going tomorrow,
as planned.

332
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,600
Where are you going?
- It is long since I've gebiecht.

333
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,700
Let me.

334
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,800
Four hours!

335
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:24,200
Let's go, we have an hour
before the trains run.

336
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,300
Listen!

337
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,500
They have found us!
- Let's go!

338
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,300
Keep running!

339
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,700
Hi, Frank.

340
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,600
Hi, Rizza.

341
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,700
Sorry about your brother.
- Why? Did you kill him?

342
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,800
I had no reason.
- There is always a reason.

343
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,800
He was a junkie,
a dick, nobody liked him.

344
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:18,700
I do not smoke, Frank. I do not
that in my neighborhood is smoked.

345
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,300
Did your family, Frank?

346
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,500
Yes.

347
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,000
Children?

348
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,800
Clever girl.

349
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,500
Do you love her?

350
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,500
Family is important.

351
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,500
The only significant.

352
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,600
So I ask you only once.

353
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,200
I do not ask again.

354
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,700
He was the guy to tackle.

355
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,200
He had a weakness for him.

356
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,200
Tony stood at the door...

357
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,700
and what he tried.

358
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,300
Sykes...

359
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,300
attracted him to the door way.

360
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,100
I heard them fight.
Fight.

361
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,000
After a minute.

362
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:40,100
There was very quiet.

363
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,000
You have not done much...

364
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,800
and now you take it some way.
- Rizza...

365
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,200
If you lie to me once...

366
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,400
Your little there tonight again.

367
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,400
I want him to sleep in my cell.
You bring him.

368
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,500
You have an advantage, Frank.

369
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,800
You're too old, too young to die.

370
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,200
Everything good?
- No.

371
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,500
It goes well with him.

372
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,300
Stay with us, Frank!

373
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,100
Are you ready?

374
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,400
Perry?

375
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,900
Batista, Mitra,
Parkhurst.

376
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,700
Visitors Area.

377
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,700
Wait, Frank.

378
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,300
Let's go
The track is so energized.

379
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,400
Frank!

380
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,100
Frank, now hurry!

381
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,400
Help me.

382
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,500
Go, go, go!

383
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,400
Go!

384
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,500
Hurry!

385
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,800
Sit down.

386
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,700
Where are you from, boy?

387
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,900
London.

388
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,300
Old Street.
- Old Street?

389
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,300
I can imagine my street
not remember.

390
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,600
Rizza in his cell waiting for you.

391
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,700
He wants me to bring you there.

392
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,400
Go to the chapel, boy,

393
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,200
for the night bell.

394
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:48,900
And do you confess.
Give it to Brodie.

395
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:53,700
I do not understand.
- Yes, do you.

396
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,400
Why me, Frank.

397
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,700
You remind me of someone.

398
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,700
<i>Five minutes. </ i></i>

399
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,300
Where is he?

400
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,700
You know...

401
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:40,400
I got this book has certainly
read a thousand times.

402
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:53,700
If I once again could start
and could read this book again,

403
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:59,200
I would go talk with someone.
I would teach him some sense.

404
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:03,000
I would tell him
how things really are.

405
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,300
But I can not.

406
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,600
That man is a long road,

407
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,100
and only I am left.

408
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:23,200
Where is he?
- But you know what?

409
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,300
I am now Friday

410
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,300
Like my little girl.
- Free?

411
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,700
You have imagination.
- Fantasy protect us.

412
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,900
That keeps us alive.

413
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,200
You still alive,
but always less.

414
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:49,100
Inside is all yours.

415
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,200
You are the boss of everything

416
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,200
you are the king,
but look around you, what you see?

417
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,800
Everything is prepared.

418
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,600
All out.

419
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,700
You have nothing.

420
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:10,500
Nothing except cells, bars,
and a rusty metal staircase.

421
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:19,300
You'll never live
because your outside does not exist.

422
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:28,600
Nobody will remember you.
- Behave yourself.

423
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:35,200
Me act
kept alive as long as me.

424
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,300
Tell me where he is.
- Lacey?

425
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,800
It is well with him.

426
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:58,200
He is gone, Rizza.
- What did you say?

427
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,000
Way.

428
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,600
Where is Frank?

429
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,900
The kid is Friday

430
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,700
Do not walk away from me!

431
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,400
It is just what you said:

432
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,600
I'm too old...

433
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,400
Alarm!

434
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,400
Frank...

435
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,900
Frank!

436
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,100
I get no air.

437
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,700
Brodie...

438
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,100
Frank.

439
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,400
Frank.
- Frank!

440
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,000
There is no air.

441
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,500
I can not breathe.

442
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,600
...can not breathe.

443
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,200
<i>Stay with us, Frank </ i></i>

444
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:44,500
Stay with us!
- Come on, Frank!

445
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,900
Come on, Frank.
Come on.

446
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,200
We are Free
