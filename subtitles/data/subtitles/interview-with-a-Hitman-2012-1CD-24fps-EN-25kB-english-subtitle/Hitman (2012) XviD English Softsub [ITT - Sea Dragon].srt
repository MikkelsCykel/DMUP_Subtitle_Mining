2
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,656
I like The Last Samurai.

3
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,091
The integrity and respect is different.

4
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,728
The mother and child
took care of the person...

5
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,498
who murdered the woman's husband.

6
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,600
That's an intense sacrifice.

7
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,706
Respect.

8
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,711
When there's no respect,
you wouldn't be happy...

9
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,313
even if you have lots of money.

10
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,759
It's a curse.

11
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,593
By the way, why do you want to talk to
me all of a sudden?

12
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,301
What are you thinking?

13
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,596
I want to rest.

14
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,632
Good.

15
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,365
You need that.

16
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,468
- We're a bit on the hotspot right now.
- I'm going to rest but not temporarily.

17
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,415
Permanently.

18
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:26,825
<i>Maybe it's here in the Phlippines where
you can find the best in abilities...</i>

19
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,432
<i>and the best kind of people in the world.</i>

20
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,465
<i>They are all here in Manila.</i>

21
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,173
<i>This is the training ground.</i>

22
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,371
<i>You should be careful
and alert with everything...</i>

23
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,215
<i>and all the time.</i>

24
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,548
<i>Even America's Pentagon
weren't able to survive.</i>

25
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,090
<i>Our best ability to live here
is way different.</i>

26
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,192
<i>And so to fill someone's stomach.</i>

27
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,219
<i>Some stretches their bones...</i>

28
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,326
<i>some just want to sit down and eat.</i>

29
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,560
<i>Others share with someone else's
shelter and food to live.</i>

30
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,130
<i>There are only but a few good leaders
here in our country...</i>

31
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,702
<i>you can count them
in less than 10 fingers.</i>

32
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,068
<i>We despise them...</i>

33
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,537
<i>but the moment they speak on stage...</i>

34
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,711
<i>we applaud them.</i>

35
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,976
<i>Too much corruption.</i>

36
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:22,381
<i>We want to change them
but we don't want to change ourselves.</i>

37
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,123
<i>There are a lot of jobs here.</i>

38
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,759
<i>Others need to kill just to live.</i>

39
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:34,667
<i>It's sad to say but that is my job.</i>

40
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,396
<i>I have given a thought just recently...</i>

41
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,598
<i>that our mission in this life time...</i>

42
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,100
<i>is not to change the world.</i>

43
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:46,607
<i>Our missions here is to change ourselves.</i>

44
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,408
<i>I tried.</i>

45
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,879
<i>But then, maybe I have done
so many bad things...</i>

46
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,718
<i>the world didn't agree.</i>

47
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,557
Boss it's Attorney.

48
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,836
Attorney, I want you to listen carefully.

49
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,393
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

50
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,035
I want a 10 billion out of that deal.

51
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,865
Switch it to the other side.

52
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,600
<i>I can't make it in a short time.</i>

53
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,774
Attorney listen first.

54
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,116
We'll earn bigger than that.

55
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,380
Our 1 billion collectible with Robles...

56
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,084
we need that.

57
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,586
You know what I mean.

58
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,593
Good.

59
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,924
You've improved a lot Ben...

60
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,959
from the day we first trained.

61
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,029
I think your old strength has returned.

62
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,600
You know brother Ben, what you need
now is to regain your memory.

63
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,202
So how's it gonna be Ben, until next week.

64
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,304
Okay.

65
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,038
That's okay.

66
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,672
Okay.

67
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,273
Ouch!

68
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:35,941
That h u r"I:s?

69
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,077
Ben I'll go up there
co'z I think he's mad at me.

70
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,912
Don't...

71
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,326
You might hurt yourself more.

72
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,151
Okay.

73
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:46,926
Thank you.

74
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,353
Thank you.

75
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,921
Your day will come.

76
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,722
Is this the bag?

77
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,862
That's the bag.

78
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,336
You know Ben, I really kept all of that.

79
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,871
I really didn't take that out
'til you come into consciousness.

80
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,773
Good thing I kept it somewhere high...

81
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,118
that's why ﬂood by storm Ondoy
didn't damage it.

82
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,410
Your properties have almost gone out...

83
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,462
while you were unconscious.

84
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,364
I always clean that.

85
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,021
Thanks Caloy.

86
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,127
You're welcome Ben.

87
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,194
You know Ben,
what happened was really a miracle...

88
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,796
because I thought that you're not going
to wake up anymore.

89
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,500
Have you thought how the bullet slipped
your forehead.

90
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,243
How long have I been unconscious?

91
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,484
Almost 7 years.

92
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,149
The doctor said...

93
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,181
<i>- Doctor here's sir's x-ray.
- There's no damage in the brain.</i>

94
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,783
Thank you.

95
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:56,721
But there's a bit crack because of the
pressure from the bullet that hit it.

96
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,790
When he'll be awake...

97
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,358
we wouldn't know yet.

98
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,426
God knows.

99
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,429
But for now, we'll do all what we can...

100
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,731
<i>the hospital will give it's best...</i>

101
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,766
<i>but still the same thing...</i>

102
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,435
Mr. Morillo is still in the stage of coma.

103
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,569
You can go stroll around.

104
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,105
The place you used to go to
will help you a lot...

105
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:18,543
It will open the door to bring back
your memory.

106
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,379
But you should go somewhere far Ben...

107
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,883
the enemies might accidentaly bump
with you.

108
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,729
You know Caloy, I believe that all of
these things happen for a reason.

109
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,365
And I will look for that reason.

110
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,933
<i>Hey and here we go.</i>

111
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:42,867
<i>Nice.</i>

112
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,735
<i>Tilt your head.</i>

113
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,569
<i>Good.</i>

114
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,504
<i>Catch the wind. Catch the wind.</i>

115
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,772
<i>Nice.</i>

116
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,607
<i>Last two for the magic.</i>

117
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,341
<i>Beautiful!</i>

118
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:50,911
<i>Last two!</i>

119
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,743
Last two.

120
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,978
<i>Look at the camera. Good!</i>

121
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,979
<i>Keep it going-</i>

122
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,981
<i>Nice, good.</i>

123
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,916
<i>One more.</i>

124
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,419
<i>And beautiful!</i>

125
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,919
<i>Beautiful!</i>

126
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,387
<i>Perfect. Okay.</i>

127
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,155
<i>Next set-up.</i>

128
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,533
Coffee break.

129
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,559
You're one of a kind Gina.

130
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,894
You're still the sexiest
in the whole wide world.

131
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:14,032
Your really deserve
to be on top of RHM hundred sexiest.

132
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:14,999
<i>That's great Gina.</i>

133
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,139
You never failed to amaze me.

134
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,738
Thanks Xander,
I'll have a coffee break, yes.

135
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,005
Okay, I will still set-up the lights.

136
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:21,673
1 hour.

137
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,846
Shoot!

138
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,746
Hi, ma'am.

139
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,849
Hi, can I get a caramel macchiato.

140
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,523
135, ma'am.

141
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,298
I receive 200.

142
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,425
Your change ma'am.

143
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,226
Thank you.

144
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,570
You're welcome.

145
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,274
<i>Boss, the car is here. I left it.</i>

146
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,412
It's clean. They won't be able to get
finger prints anymore.

147
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,284
<i>Iced caramel macchiato for Ms. Gina.</i>

148
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,244
What the...

149
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,919
Sorry, miss.

150
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,625
Sorry.

151
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,684
No, it's okay, it's okay.

152
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,786
Miss! Can I have tissue, miss.

153
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,488
Sir, one more...

154
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,289
What did she order?

155
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,790
<i>Iced caramel Macchiato, Sir.</i>

156
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,524
Thank you. Thank you.

157
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,258
One more please.

158
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:47,892
Yes sir.

159
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:48,526
Make it two.

160
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,127
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

161
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,328
Oh, no, no. I'll order.

162
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,596
No it's okay.

163
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,630
I insist.

164
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,111
<i>I'm so sorry. I didn't mean.</i>

165
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,806
<i>- Iced caramel macchiato.
- Thank you.</i>

166
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,775
Are you sure,
maybe you want to eat something?

167
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,983
No, no. It's okay.

168
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,054
Is it okay if I join you.

169
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,983
No it's alright.

170
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,651
By the way I'm Ben.

171
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,752
Gina.

172
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,455
Sorry I really didn't mean that.

173
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,060
You got wet.

174
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,738
It's okay.

175
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,600
So that's how an angel looks like up-close.

176
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,845
I've forgiven you already.
Besides I've a got another coffee.

177
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,073
Oh hold it.
What angel are you talking about?

178
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,808
Angel from heaven?

179
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,187
Or angel of darkness.

180
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:46,146
You know I seldom meet girls
who has that good sense of humor.

181
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,591
That's one point for you.

182
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,095
<i>What happened?</i>

183
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,796
I don't know.

184
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,301
Policemen were everywhere
while I was passing by earlier.

185
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,375
Fix it.

186
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,059
They're chaotic now.

187
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,096
Okay thank you boss.

188
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,004
What is it again?

189
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,766
That's really you.

190
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,867
Who?

191
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,245
Gina Sevilla.

192
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,814
22 years old, from White Plains.

193
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,985
You're a stalker?

194
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,513
That's our bad side.

195
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,347
We'll let magazines cover our story...

196
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,583
we'll tell them the details of our lives...

197
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,689
then forget about it totally.

198
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,299
2 points.

199
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,033
2 Points!

200
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,408
Hello.

201
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,272
Okay, I'm on my way.

202
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,972
Sorry, it's my photographer.

203
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,907
Our photo shoot's not yet done.

204
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,043
I have no right to stop you
from doing your work.

205
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:23,648
And besides,
it's my first time to see an angel so sorry.

206
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,560
Sorry the angel is busy.

207
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,164
I have to go back to heaven now.

208
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,587
Nice meeting you.

209
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,590
Nice to meet you.

210
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,716
Sir, the boss is here.

211
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,489
Tomas come here.

212
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,228
Waiter.

213
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,175
Order now.

214
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,843
Come one, they've got delicious food here.

215
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:25,612
Tomas your've got great bodybuilt
right now.

216
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,959
You've seem to have been practicing a lot.

217
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,156
Your age isn't obvious.

218
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,268
It's just okay brother Mando.

219
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:46,031
The one that you promised me.

220
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,273
10 milion!

221
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,706
Are you crazy?

222
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,881
I can't give you that amount Tomas.

223
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,486
Thank you.

224
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,154
What was written in the contract...

225
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,923
that's it.

226
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:18,808
You told me that you'll give me 10 million
so I could start my own business.

227
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,635
And for my early retirement.

228
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,907
The transaction didn't push through.

229
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,816
It did push through, brother...

230
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,811
you just didn't tell me.

231
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,579
You're an idiot Tomas!

232
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,581
I promised to help you.

233
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,029
But I didn't tell you
that I'll give you 10 million.

234
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,324
What I'm as asking is...

235
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,892
not more than your capacity.

236
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,727
I am not stupid.

237
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,834
I'm not a bank
that you can hold-up anytime.

238
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,536
You really forget easily.

239
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,685
All your enemies in business...

240
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,382
<i>gambling, white slavery...</i>

241
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,956
drugs.

242
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,125
<i>All your enemies...</i>

243
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,397
you asked me to kill them.

244
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,623
<i>I killed all of them for you.</i>

245
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,868
You seemed to have won the lottery
when I became one of your men.

246
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,574
You ask me to kill all of them...

247
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,938
including my best hitman.

248
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,949
Even if I don't want to.

249
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,176
Because you've said that he knows a lot.

250
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,877
<i>So I killed him.</i>

251
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,313
I am only asking
for money brother Mando.

252
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,849
I gave you my whole life.

253
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,761
What is it now?

254
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,267
I owe you, is that right?

255
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,926
Tomas all the things I asked you to do.

256
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,461
Could have been done by my other men.

257
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,565
Your lucky I gave you a job...

258
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,668
or until now you will still be extortioning
money from chinese businessmen.

259
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,979
You've changed a lot.

260
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,178
You got rich.

261
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,751
You became boastful.

262
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:23,728
And now you became greedy.

263
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:32,240
You're no different
from the criminals I've killed.

264
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,901
So you mean that
if I didn't give what you want...

265
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,382
you'll kill me, too.

266
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,746
I'm so scared Tomas.

267
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,024
I'm so scared .

268
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,392
I don't want to get mad at you Mando.

269
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,833
Get the money ready.

270
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,812
Tomas hold it!

271
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,578
Are you threatening me?

272
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,820
Dad are you okay.

273
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,751
Are you threatening me?

274
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,732
Can you shoot that...

275
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,823
<i>because if I pull my gun...</i>

276
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,027
and face you.

277
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,703
I'll shoot you
and I'll make sure you fall down.

278
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,204
Now...

279
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,947
<i>can you shoot that.</i>

280
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,523
Just as I thought.

281
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,056
Gina where are meeting later?

282
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,163
The usual, I'll be there at 9.

283
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,262
That's early.

284
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,606
You've got a date?

285
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,765
I hope so.

286
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,042
<i>Why aren't you sure?</i>

287
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,836
<i>With your beauty.</i>

288
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,477
you can date anybody.

289
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,775
If that's gonna be someone...

290
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,077
no way.

291
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,880
And beside,
Alex, you just don't pick a date...

292
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,515
you should choose them.

293
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,360
It seem like your hoarding
from the market.

294
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,655
And you know what...

295
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,191
I met this guy at the coffee shop.

296
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,393
He looks so sweet and so nice.

297
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,567
And very sympatico.

298
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,832
Total stranger.

299
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,066
Yes. Why?

300
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,035
Are you going to oppose me again?

301
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,003
That's dangerous.

302
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,573
That makes it more exciting.

303
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,275
Going out with a total stranger.

304
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,745
<i>You're daddy wouldn't like that.</i>

305
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,013
I was just kidding.

306
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:06,689
I think he's nice and very gentleman.

307
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,795
But you should be careful.

308
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,863
Thank you but he seems different.

309
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,206
Have you agreed?

310
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,732
To what?

311
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,713
<i>To go out with him.</i>

312
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,972
It was just my fantasy.

313
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,250
But I hope to see him later.

314
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,521
<i>Nuts.</i>

315
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,016
<i>You are so weak.</i>

316
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,819
<i>- You could have hit the ball directly.
- Why don't you do it yourself?</i>

317
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,386
<i>What?</i>

318
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,822
<i>- You keep on talking.
- Hey I want to play, too.</i>

319
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,290
<i>You haven't done anything.</i>

320
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,091
<i>And you know how to answer back now.</i>

321
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,527
<i>Stop that or you might get mad
at each other in the end.</i>

322
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,061
Hey, can you be at least good at this.

323
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,507
I've been waiting here.

324
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,497
<i>Nothing.</i>

325
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,965
<i>You are no match.</i>

326
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,105
<i>Let's just drink.</i>

327
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:00,571
<i>You're turn.</i>

328
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,039
<i>And you'll see.</i>

329
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,044
<i>- Hit it now.
- Let's just fight.</i>

330
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,279
<i>- Relax.
- So we'd know who's better:</i>

331
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,419
<i>So everyone would know.</i>

332
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,957
Boss.

333
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,527
Engineer.

334
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,960
What's the news?

335
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,595
Is project almost done?

336
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,763
Sorry boss.

337
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,465
We'll be a bit delayed...

338
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,379
because of Mr. Alex Co's materials.

339
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,871
<i>We don't want to get from other supplier:</i>

340
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,506
<i>But it's in the ship now?</i>

341
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,108
<i>It's going to come after a week.</i>

342
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,243
Alright.

343
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,344
By the way Sir...

344
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,146
This Engineer Nepumuceno.

345
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,547
One of the best.

346
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:47,587
We added additional manpower
to supervise our project.

347
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,589
Alex maybe the supply
that's going to come...

348
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,160
maybe you can rush it.

349
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,336
We can.

350
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,006
We'll do our best effort.

351
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,199
Best effort.

352
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,572
You know what...

353
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,774
I don't care about what you want.

354
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,343
Whoever you want to add.

355
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,845
How many people you are going to add.

356
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,248
The date we've agreed with...

357
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,517
that's when I want to finish the project.

358
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,091
Don't give me your best effort crap.

359
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,863
If you don't like it,
I'll give it to someone else.

360
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,493
Please don't boss.

361
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:34,034
Don't worry, we'll finish it
on the date we've agreed with.

362
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:38,536
There you go.
I'll see you at the ribbon cutting.

363
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:38,936
Thank you.

364
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,610
Thank you boss.

365
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,811
<i>I've noticed, you've been playing on me.</i>

366
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,814
<i>- Dude, I've seen it.
- How come you saw it moved?</i>

367
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,216
<i>This is what happened.</i>

368
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,892
<i>- It moved, dude
- It moved, what are you?</i>

369
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,355
<i>You're cheating.</i>

370
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,427
Sorry, dude, sorry.

371
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,259
<i>Nothing will happen there.</i>

372
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,364
<i>Nothing.</i>

373
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,336
<i>Oh no you missed!</i>

374
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,044
<i>You didn't hit on anything thing.</i>

375
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,506
<i>You see.</i>

376
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,884
Who's next?

377
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,051
You're turn.

378
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,349
<i>You're all show off.</i>

379
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,420
<i>I agree.</i>

380
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,793
Mike they're so annoying.

381
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,568
Let them be.

382
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,503
They are customers.

383
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,968
Remember that customers
are always right.

384
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,574
You're turn, dude.

385
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,084
Do your best, dude.

386
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,390
Come here Alvin.

387
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,651
What are you? You keep on coming
through even with narrow space.

388
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,619
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

389
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,720
I didn't mean it.

390
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:03,722
It's narrow here.

391
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,222
<i>Sorry. Sorry-</i>

392
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,395
<i>Okay.</i>

393
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,037
I'm sorry.

394
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,541
Move now.

395
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,645
<i>Are you going to move?</i>

396
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,279
<i>Mike that's enough!</i>

397
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,917
<i>Mike.</i>

398
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,993
<i>Mike.</i>

399
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,663
<i>Don't move.</i>

400
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,967
Mike that's enough!

401
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,236
Mike that's enough!

402
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,655
- <i>You still want some fight?</i>
- Mike.

403
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,289
<i>Don't move.</i>

404
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,798
<i>Mike that's enough!</i>

405
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,434
Mike.

406
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,864
Alvin hurry.

407
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,435
PO3's here.

408
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,808
You're rude.

409
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,643
Next time, get to know whom you're
playing dumb with.

410
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,977
Si r, sorry.

411
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,753
This won't happen again.

412
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,648
Mike don't.

413
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,450
SPO3 is here.

414
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,953
You take care of him.

415
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,340
Where is Mike?

416
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,679
He's in the CR. Why?

417
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,169
You're uncle wants to talk to you...

418
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,172
He has an important thing to say.

419
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,118
Okay I'll tell him.

420
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:09,687
Vin would that be okay.

421
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,785
All of that are Mike's.

422
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,629
If you want, you can ask him.

423
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,030
Okay tell him to meet
your Uncle Tom in the bar.

424
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:27,736
<i>Okay.</i>

425
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:28,876
Okay.

426
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,486
Bullshit.

427
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,418
What is he proud of?

428
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,126
This building?

429
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,935
His drugs in the basement?

430
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,499
His white slavery?

431
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,835
His gambling business?

432
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,469
Why?

433
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,502
He won't be able to establish
all of those if not because of me.

434
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,651
He only thinks of nothing but socialization.

435
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,387
Play golf.

436
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,213
What I'm asking from him...

437
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,348
is what he promised me.

438
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,920
I am not asking too much.

439
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:28,363
Sir we received an information
that you ought to know.

440
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,636
What is it?

441
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,410
Ben Morillo alive.

442
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:41,768
Hey Robby stop kidding like that...

443
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,117
<i>I've got a lot of problems.</i>

444
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,776
Positive sir.

445
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,078
Our 2 spotters confirmed it.

446
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,514
He was seen in two different places.

447
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,859
Positive they saw Ben.

448
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,088
Do you want us to clean him up?

449
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,926
Sir we can't let him last like that.

450
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,535
Study his moves first.

451
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,704
I'll handle my brother Mando first.

452
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,242
And then he'll be the next one.

453
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,848
Keep your eyes keen.

454
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,754
Because you may just be starting to turn
your head on him...

455
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,894
that you'll realized you already have
a bullet in your head.

456
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,033
One jack please.

457
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,278
Thank you.

458
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,056
Gins my sister.

459
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,691
Alvin.

460
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,456
Gina let's talk.

461
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,057
<i>If this is just about
what daddy wants me to do...</i>

462
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,265
<i>you're just wasting your time.</i>

463
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,375
Let's go, let's talk.

464
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,842
Mike I can live independently
without his money.

465
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,248
My principles are different.

466
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,575
Damn your principles.

467
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,943
Keep it cool Mike.

468
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,220
There are a lot of people here,
it's embarrassing.

469
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,648
My order.

470
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,449
Excuse me.

471
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,186
Your principle should be on daddy's side.

472
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,723
He is your father.

473
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,127
Where is your brain?

474
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,767
In your feet?

475
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,965
Daddy wants you to handle
our family business.

476
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,434
Who do you think he'll leave that?

477
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,535
With his hitman.

478
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,447
There were quite a number of them.

479
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,239
Hi, guys.

480
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,241
You seem to be talking seriously.

481
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,516
Drinks?

482
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,219
Who's this crazy man?

483
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,349
Mike... he's my friend.

484
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,418
Don't you ever play fool with my sister.

485
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,898
Or you better hide.

486
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,322
Ben let's go.

487
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,530
Okay, see YOU GUYS

488
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,173
Did you miss me?

489
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:03,774
<i>No.</i>

490
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,976
Your face tell it all that you miss me.

491
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,513
<i>Not really.</i>

492
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,413
Major good evening.

493
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,893
Good evening major.

494
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,783
Good evening.

495
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,718
Where is Gina?

496
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,087
She already left.

497
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,726
She's with a guy.

498
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,833
How does he look like?

499
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,398
Handsome, tan...

500
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,170
but I'm better looking Major.

501
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,879
That's guts.

502
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,772
Mike is inside Major.

503
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,979
He's with Alvin.

504
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,843
Is that so.

505
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,517
Call him here.

506
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,119
Go on call him.

507
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,261
I'm asking you to do it.
You can do it. Call him.

508
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,567
Tom why did you come here?

509
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,571
Mike when will you start
to pay respect on me?

510
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,347
Uncle Tom good evening.

511
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,045
Where is Gina?

512
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,925
She's with a friend. Is there a problem?

513
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,321
There is.

514
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,728
Go home Mike.

515
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,933
The situation is hot, let's all cool down.

516
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,841
We're okay.

517
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,576
If you want you can go home now.

518
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,645
Drink beer, stand in front of the aircon...

519
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,738
I'm sure you'll feel cold.

520
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,616
Mike.

521
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,083
What's you're problem?

522
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,724
I don't have a problem.

523
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:56,560
There's no source of hotness here,
but you.

524
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,162
What do you mean?

525
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,926
I know your fight with daddy...

526
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,427
I am not sleeping in vain...

527
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,533
so don't show off here.

528
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,500
I came here Mike...

529
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,380
to make sure that you
and your siblings are safe.

530
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,272
And the feud between your dad and me...

531
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,007
that's just ours.

532
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,079
You're out of it.

533
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,614
You're dad had wronged a lot
of people Mike.

534
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,652
Don't fool me Tom.

535
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,520
You have the biggest reason
to hurt my daddy.

536
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:34,628
Uncle let's just talk about this next time.

537
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,999
I'll say it again to you Mike.

538
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,500
The feud between your dad and me
is just ours.

539
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,777
And remember this Tom.

540
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,505
Whoever the enemy of my daddy...

541
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,140
is also my enemy.

542
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,143
I hope that's clear to you.

543
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,312
Alvin.

544
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,096
Cheers.

545
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,233
Seriously I'm an architect.

546
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,697
Imaginative, adaptable...

547
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,541
<i>independent.</i>

548
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,767
Oh I see.

549
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,543
You're an architect?

550
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:25,104
Why is it instead of spending
your time making plan...

551
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,188
you're here in front of me
wasting your time.

552
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,051
Do you really have to ask that.

553
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,495
You wanna get close.

554
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,496
Closer.

555
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,204
You think I'll allow you.

556
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,666
I'm hoping.

557
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,035
Let's go.

558
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,497
This is my first time Ben.

559
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,806
Okay.

560
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,532
<i>Alvin</i>

561
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,405
Mike.

562
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,530
What's that?

563
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,600
Uncle Tom and I are just talking
about something.

564
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,807
Yes.

565
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,537
Get inside.

566
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,104
But brother.

567
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,607
Get inside.

568
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,558
You know Tom...

569
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,851
I know that I owe you big time.

570
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,187
All the bad things that I've done...

571
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,997
you cover it for me.

572
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,964
But that doesn't mean...

573
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,737
that I will love you more than my dad.

574
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,177
Don't tell me that you're my uncle.

575
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,979
And don't tell that you're a policeman.

576
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,452
I'll fight you.

577
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,381
What did you say Mike?

578
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,958
Can you say it again.

579
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:58,059
Tom if not for my dad...

580
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,831
you don't have money...

581
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,034
you don't have a house...

582
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,341
you don't have a car.

583
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,508
You're poor.

584
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,873
Yes.

585
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,519
But you know what's in exchange of that.

586
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,655
My principles.

587
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,319
My dignity.-

588
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,754
My whole life.

589
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,420
Son of a sheep.

590
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,697
Let's finish this Tom.

591
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,441
Tom!

592
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,775
Mike.

593
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,303
If you'll continue that...

594
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,750
I'll forget that you're my nephew.

595
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,932
I didn't know that,
that's what you mean.

596
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:54,611
When you told me that it's your first time.

597
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,117
But don't worry.

598
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,551
That didn't change my feelings for you.

599
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,961
Thank you Ben.

600
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,692
But you know...

601
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,126
I don't know why I did this.

602
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,933
And why with you.

603
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,398
Why then?

604
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:24,540
Maybe because
I know that you're a good person.

605
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,438
And nothing bad will happen to me...

606
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,646
when I'm with you.

607
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,611
Even if I have tattoos?

608
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,245
And a scar on my forehead...

609
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,420
because I was naughty when I were a kid.

610
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,025
I started to become independent when I
had a fight with my daddy.

611
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,869
I moved out of the house.

612
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,497
But he keeps on calling...

613
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,772
trying to persuade me.

614
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,213
That's why I kept on telling him...

615
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,644
that this is the life that I chose.

616
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,447
You're lucky...

617
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,220
you have a family.

618
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,127
I'm just waiting for daddy to wake up.

619
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,232
And accept my principles.

620
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,504
I just wanted to have a good family.

621
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,927
Hold it, I'll check. Stay here.

622
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,547
Ben.

623
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,230
<i>Put it down.</i>

624
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,442
I told you to put it down.

625
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,495
Ben?

626
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,425
<i>Gina get back inside.</i>

627
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,336
Don't.

628
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,837
Do you know them?

629
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,010
No.

630
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,484
But I know that they're not robbers.

631
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,956
That is what I've thought, too.

632
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,529
Don't you recognize any of those faces.

633
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,622
No, I don't know them.

634
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:43,726
I'm quite sure that they are the men
of my dad's enemy.

635
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:46,537
I'm sure they wanted to kill me.

636
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,743
We should leave this place.

637
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,643
Hello, sir.

638
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,911
The men that you sent for Gina missed.

639
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:05,519
The hitman that we killed but survived...

640
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,523
interfered .

641
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,862
What do you want us to do.

642
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,304
Okay sir.

643
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:28,708
You know Ben
I have something to tell you.

644
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:34,780
I know that I can't trust
even my own brothers.

645
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,810
I don't know why I feel so good with you.

646
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,315
I'll tell this only to you.

647
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,958
That I'm keeping a big amount
of daddy's money.

648
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,500
And if my brothers find out...

649
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,864
my life might be at stake.

650
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:08,205
Gina I'll do everything to protect you.

651
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,883
I also want to let you know something...

652
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,250
but I can't say it now.

653
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,689
The memories that were erased from my
mind haven't returned yet.

654
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,062
But I can promise you one thing.

655
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:36,167
I wouldn't let anything bad happen to you.

656
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,618
Hello.

657
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,719
<i>Hello, Ben.</i>

658
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,632
Caloy, what?

659
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,100
Positive Ben. Mando plotted your murder.

660
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,468
<i>Mando?</i>

661
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:40,830
<i>Yes</i> .

662
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,742
Who's Mando?

663
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,842
<i>Tom's brother:</i>

664
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,581
Mando, the brother of Tom.

665
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:54,252
Ain't he the father of Gina Sevilla?

666
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:56,545
<i>Yes Ben.</i>

667
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,492
<i>Mando Sevilla.</i>

668
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,660
Okay, come here Caloy.

669
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:09,892
Go here.

670
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,497
I'll wait for you.

671
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:38,160
Ben, I'm scared.

672
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,866
I feel like it wouldn't last long.

673
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:47,140
I'll be involved in my daddy's wickedness.

674
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,373
Maybe they'd take first revenge on me.

675
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,917
What are you thinking?

676
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,228
Mando could have children...

677
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,565
but why you.

678
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,171
You're right.

679
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,506
Somebody's going to make
your father pay.

680
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,413
That's me.

681
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,485
And you'll be involved.

682
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,484
What do you mean?

683
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,728
I once worked with your father.

684
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,569
But he ruined all my dreams.

685
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,145
You're daddy's hitman?

686
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,644
You tricked me?

687
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,677
You made me believe
that you're a good person...

688
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,817
you're an architect.

689
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,027
No one's good for your father.

690
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,222
None.

691
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,260
I planned to change.

692
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,128
Move away.

693
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,663
Leave the evilness that your father leads.

694
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,797
<i>He involved...</i>

695
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,506
he murdered my pregnant wife.

696
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,570
But he made a mistake...

697
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,278
for letting me live.

698
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,318
<i>Ben!</i>

699
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,150
Are you involving me in all of these.

700
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,420
He took away my wife and child.

701
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,493
You and your dad will pay for it.

702
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,045
<i>It seems destiny has made you cross
paths with her.</i>

703
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,549
<i>Ben looks like
I'm going to clean up a lot of mess.</i>

704
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:14,243
By the way, the brother of that woman...

705
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,378
they call him Mike.

706
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,222
He's dead.

707
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,855
He was shot.

708
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,230
Where did they take him?

709
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,172
Sir, it's confirmed.

710
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,153
Tom killed him.

711
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,796
Mike!

712
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:39,936
Mike!

713
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,709
Mike!

714
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,083
I'll kill you Tom.

715
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,915
I'll kill you Tom!

716
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,883
I'll kill you Tom.

717
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,334
Dad.

718
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,265
Dad.

719
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,435
Brother.

720
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,601
- You ungrateful!
- Dad.

721
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,048
- Dad that's enough.
- You're an idiot.

722
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,174
Dad that's enough, I didn't do anything.

723
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,376
You should be the one who's there.

724
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,578
- Idiot!
- Dad believe me.

725
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:30,579
You're not my son.

726
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,147
I just adopted you.

727
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,182
You're ungrateful.

728
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,184
- <i>Dad that's enough</i>
- <i>You're ungrateful</i>

729
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,151
<i>Stop it Dad.</i>

730
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,020
I didn't do anything bad.

731
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,222
- Dad believe me.
- Idiot!

732
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,024
- You're just my adopted.
- Dad.

733
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,159
Dad it's not my fault.

734
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,060
Give me that!

735
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,196
Dad have mercy on me.

736
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,064
- I'll kill you.
- Dad stop it.

737
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,909
You're ungrateful!

738
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,236
- Dad stop it.
- I'll kill you.

739
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,843
- Believe me, it wasn't my fault.
- You idiot.

740
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,676
Ungrateful!

741
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,409
Ungrateful.

742
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,753
- I'll kill...
- Boss calm down.

743
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,481
<i>Have pity, he's your child.</i>

744
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,760
You're right.

745
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,176
Next time don't pry.

746
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,916
Meddler.

747
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,958
What happened?

748
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,593
We were attacked by person.

749
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:52,961
Somebody sneaked up here.

750
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,163
- All our guns were stolen.
- What?

751
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,576
Son of sheep!

752
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,271
Sorry boss.

753
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,649
Sorry.

754
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,524
You idiot.

755
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,189
Son of a sheep.

756
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:21,085
Only one person stole all our guns.

757
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,794
I'm so sorry, sir.

758
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,877
<i>Don 't!</i>

759
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:21,777
I'll take off that plaster on your mouth...

760
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:25,647
but in one condition.

761
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:27,719
Don't scream.

762
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,930
Do you understand?

763
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:39,061
Ouch. What are you?

764
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,762
You're an awful person to talk with.

765
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:41,830
You snap ped it.

766
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:42,464
There.

767
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,138
You are like that.

768
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,201
Instead of thanking me...

769
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,569
you're hurting me.

770
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,638
- Would you just shut up.
- Rich people are like that.

771
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,245
You look down on us poor people.

772
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,609
Where are you going?

773
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,986
You know I am a worthless person.

774
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,289
But Ben took me in.

775
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,626
He treated me like true family.

776
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,061
He treated me like one of his kin.

777
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,530
I was surprised.

778
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,636
When he got married.

779
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:29,846
I never thought he'd find someone to love.

780
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,044
But you know...

781
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:40,283
one night, all of Ben's dreams were
disappeared.

782
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,398
Because of what your family did.

783
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,354
That's it?

784
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,011
Choose a card here.

785
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,479
Get one card.

786
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,781
I'll guess what card did you get.

787
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:47,582
Just one card.

788
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:48,383
One card.

789
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,954
You are on handcuffs

790
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,487
Let's do it like this.

791
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,890
Remember one card.

792
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:55,557
Just remember.

793
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,004
That card will disappear.

794
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,466
No more.

795
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,697
Even if you go find it one by one.

796
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,833
It's not here.

797
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,836
No more, right

798
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,504
One card isn't here.

799
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,452
The one that you chose wasn't here
anymore.

800
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,921
<i>Bastard!</i>

801
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:03,101
This old man literary let me eat the dust.

802
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,931
Don't worry, I'll let you have a snack.

803
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,578
Move!

804
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,329
That's new, I haven't seen that yet.

805
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:00,768
- <i>Mike!</i>
- Hello.

806
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:03,071
Mike, hello.

807
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,140
Can you hear me?

808
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,875
- Save me here.
- Where?

809
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:07,475
Where?

810
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,820
I'm here in Fairview.

811
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,839
<i>Caloy!</i>

812
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:28,498
<i>Caloy.</i>

813
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,941
Brother Ben.

814
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,648
What happened?

815
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,978
She was taken.

816
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:46,651
<i>Give this to Benjamin.</i>

817
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:50,356
<i>I promised to give that to him.</i>

818
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,761
Benjamin?

819
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:59,231
Who's Benjamin?

820
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:04,341
Forgive me, I kept a secret from you.

821
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,836
Caloy, what secret?

822
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:13,809
The night when armed men
attacked your house...

823
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,520
Carol was killed.

824
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:28,331
But the baby in her womb survived.

825
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,362
My child is alive?

826
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,631
Where is my child?

827
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:37,736
Caloy.

828
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:45,441
Gina knows.

829
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:18,108
Hello?

830
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:22,076
<i>Where are you hiding now Angel?</i>

831
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,845
<i>Like the old times.</i>

832
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,813
<i>I'm still better than you.</i>

833
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,749
I'll kill you.

834
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,251
I should have killed Mando not you!

835
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,720
You're wrong Angel.

836
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,623
My brother owes me big time.

837
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,366
So it's just right that I kill him.

838
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,463
Bring back Gina to me.

839
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,465
You don't need her.

840
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,969
You're wrong again Angel.

841
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,471
I need Gina more right now.

842
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:55,443
Because she will tell me
where to find my money.

843
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,616
And besides...

844
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,088
I'll use her...

845
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,519
<i>so we could come face to face.</i>

846
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,421
Just tell me where.

847
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,089
Anytime!

848
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,263
<i>I'll come.</i>

849
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,776
Why are you doing this to us, Uncle?

850
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,502
You could have told daddy.

851
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,505
Your daddy is greedy.

852
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,439
I'm just getting what is mine.

853
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,080
The one that should be mine.

854
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:31,512
Where is the money?

855
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:35,083
Tell me first where is my daddy
and brothers.

856
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,819
Don't ask me, ask Ben.

857
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,801
Ben knows.

858
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,857
Before I lose my patience.

859
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,193
Where is the money?

860
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,764
Bring it out!

861
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,011
Here.

862
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,277
Who moved it?

863
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,309
What?

864
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,044
The money is gone.

865
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,645
Where did you put it?

866
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,853
I just placed it here.

867
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,654
Are you sure?

868
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:14,555
Yes.

869
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,160
Damn!

870
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,137
Those animals!

871
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,383
Shit!

872
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,612
Shit!

873
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,623
Did you tell with someone else?

874
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,955
Ben.

875
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,599
Who?

876
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,162
<i>Tom.</i>

877
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:52,031
Is this the one you've been looking for?

878
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,714
Tom I didn't know if you recognize.

879
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,504
If I want to shoot you...

880
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,849
I could have killed you yesterday.

881
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:10,553
But I want to hear from your own mouth.

882
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,514
That your group killed my wife.

883
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:16,717
And you were the one who shot me.

884
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:21,895
You're one of a kind Angel alias Ben.

885
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,265
I've shot you on your forehead.

886
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:29,698
Now you're still breathing in front of me.

887
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,382
What are we going to do now?

888
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:41,983
We should continue
what we haven't finished.

889
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,760
We will really continue it Tom.

890
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:52,558
Co'z I won't ever forget
what you did to my wife and child.

891
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,334
You are animals.

892
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:01,496
I begged to all of you.

893
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,898
But you didn't listen.

894
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,500
Now Tom...

895
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,540
you'll regret that you taught me
everything you knew.

896
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,053
But you should be careful, too.

897
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:20,444
- Or you might... hit Gina.
- Ben!

898
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:25,087
Gina has nothing to do with our feud.

899
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:31,936
And you didn't teach me to hide
from a girl's skirt.

900
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,387
How can this old man run?

901
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,655
I thought he has rheumatism.

902
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,829
His knees are aching.

903
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,396
You're an idiot Angel.

904
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,298
I've killed you already.

905
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,133
You should have died.

906
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,478
You should have been with your family.

907
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,872
But don't worry.

908
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,740
You can catch them up.

909
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,550
They miss you badly.

910
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,084
This grandpa talks a lot.

911
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,857
Are you okay grandpa?

912
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,221
The reason why I came to life...

913
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:37,391
co'z they're waiting for you there.

914
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:39,394
You should go first.

915
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:44,098
And not in heaven, alright in hell.

916
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,666
Co'z you fit there.

917
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,771
Idiot!

918
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:50,842
Can you still chase me?

919
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:54,313
Or your knees are aching?

920
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,079
Let's go grandpa.

921
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,254
Son of a bitch,
he's gonna let me chase him again.

922
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:03,445
I can see you now. Hide at least.

923
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,985
I thought your knees
were the ones aching...

924
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,487
You also have poor eyesight.

925
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:14,728
Fool!

926
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,492
Why don't you show your head?

927
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,531
So you'd know how poor my eyes are.

928
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,251
Ben?

929
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,553
Ben.

930
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,550
<i>- Gina come here.
- Ben.</i>

931
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,318
Hurry!

932
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,128
Angel.

933
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,835
You could have been really good.

934
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:58,566
I taught you how to kill.

935
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,513
Become rich.

936
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:06,407
And I've taught you a lot of things
more than that.

937
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,514
<i>But you made one mistake...</i>

938
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:15,657
that I didn't ever teach you.

939
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:20,695
<i>To die for a woman.</i>

940
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:28,937
Uncle Tom you're an evil.

941
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:33,074
You don't have a heart!

942
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,469
You don't have a heart!

943
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,575
Why do you think your father has?

944
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,952
Don't meddle on this one Gina.

945
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,220
This is a fight between the teacher...

946
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:49,124
and his student.

947
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,699
But Tom.

948
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,956
The teacher will be gone later...

949
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,937
the student will remain.

950
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:01,262
<i>Gina listen to your uncle.</i>

951
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,174
He's right.

952
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,435
<i>What now Tom?
Are you done with your speech.</i>

953
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:11,610
Let's finish this.

954
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,855
Gina bow down.

955
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:22,151
<i>Alvin ?</i>

956
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,123
Alvin.

957
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,997
I saved you.

958
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:39,064
Are just going to stare?

959
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,504
Aren't you gonna thank me?

960
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:50,281
You and your father...

961
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:53,381
you really deserve to die.

962
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:58,616
You don't appreciate
the things around you.

963
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,126
You were like leech.

964
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,164
You know nothing but to suck.

965
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,830
Alvin what are you saying?

966
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,059
Don't talk yet.

967
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,062
Listen first.

968
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:18,499
You know,
your dad and you are the same.

969
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,174
You just want to be heard.

970
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:24,406
You don't want to listen.

971
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:28,042
When did you give me an attention...

972
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,044
<i>real love.</i>

973
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:33,547
Alvin I loved you like a true brother.

974
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:34,891
Damn!

975
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,122
Loved?

976
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,463
I am the poorest...

977
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,639
the most stupid...

978
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:53,000
- the moron.
- You should have been there.

979
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,607
You are not my son! I just adopted you.

980
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:59,211
The worthless child in our house.

981
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,756
But I told myself.

982
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:09,783
It wouldn't last long.

983
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:13,231
Our situation will all turn.

984
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:20,629
Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 2.

985
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:27,346
When there's a beginning,
there's an end.

986
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:33,281
Thy kingdom will come in no time.

987
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:40,219
What do you mean?

988
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:46,798
You know I need to employ new people.

989
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,056
You should have killed him.

990
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:50,661
Shit!

991
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,704
That's what we've agreed Tom?

992
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,296
You're wasting my time.

993
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:57,998
Don't shout at me.

994
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:59,900
Don't teach me what to do.

995
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,969
I know when to move.

996
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,038
You know?

997
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,043
Why is it until now Mike is still alive?

998
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:11,890
And then your brother Mando will follow.

999
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,448
This is not just for me, right?

1000
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,690
For the two of us.

1001
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:19,363
Uncle Tom.

1002
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:23,827
Whom your dad took advantage of.

1003
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:27,494
And Lucas who's behind you now...

1004
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,998
can easily be paid.

1005
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,834
Boss the car is here, I left it.

1006
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:36,336
This is clean, they won't be able to get
finger prints.

1007
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,572
What happened?

1008
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:42,009
The men that you sent for Gina missed.

1009
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,644
Those idiots!

1010
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:45,512
What do you want us to do?

1011
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:47,614
Don't move yet...

1012
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,322
wait for my call.

1013
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:52,825
Your kingdom is mine.

1014
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,098
What do you mean?

1015
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,908
Simple.

1016
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:12,742
Now that I have no one to share it with.

1017
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,484
This is the one.

1018
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:18,479
Lying down.

1019
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,893
And your protector Ben is gone.

1020
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,564
How's that now?

1021
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:33,427
Let's finish your suffering here on earth.

1022
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,796
You might be happier in heaven.

1023
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:40,075
Goodbye my dear sister.

1024
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:43,842
Alvin no.

1025
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:50,319
Alvin have mercy on me please.

1026
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:15,969
Ben are you okay?

1027
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,314
I thought...

1028
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:29,049
This is the necklace
that Caloy is talking about.

1029
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,018
That's the one.

1030
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,986
He'll give it.

1031
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:36,056
And I can't give it if you won't help me.

1032
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,592
Because you know the place...

1033
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:41,096
where we could find him.

1034
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,568
That hurts.

1035
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:51,915
Ben answer me truthfully.

1036
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:55,514
Did you come here for me?

1037
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:00,314
Before I answer that...

1038
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:04,195
I want to know if I'm really alive.

1039
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,353
You're still alive.

1040
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:07,554
I'm still alive?

1041
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,933
I won't let you go.

1042
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:14,868
Really?

1043
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:24,546
I also don't want to lose you.

1044
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:29,848
I once lost my loved ones.

1045
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:33,221
I won't let that happen again.

1046
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:44,626
What are you waiting for?

1047
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,006
That's the cue.

1048
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,103
What cue?

1049
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:51,309
Cue.

1050
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:54,308
Don't you watch action films?

1051
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:56,716
No.

1052
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,538
You...

1053
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:02,453
When the conversaion reached that level.

1054
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,285
What?

1055
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,249
That means kiss.

1056
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:09,522
Again.

1057
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:11,084
Yes.

1058
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:12,792
That is necessary.

1059
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,093
Help me.

1060
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,904
I'm having a hard time here.

1061
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:27,644
That's your kiss?

1062
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:31,015
That kiss is so plain.

1063
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,315
Make it better.

1064
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:34,708
You're going to die.

1065
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:37,781
It's the end.

1066
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,485
You're getting there.

1067
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:46,186
My chest is aching.

1068
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:47,757
Help me.
