1
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:14,493
<i>Awakened by the sound of an explosion...</i>

2
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:15,627
<i>...running for their lives.</i>

3
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:16,987
<i>Police are now pushing...</i>

4
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:19,953
<i>...the Feds are
telling us it is not a terror attack.</i>

5
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:21,910
<i>It is most likely an accident.</i>

6
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:25,069
<i>...the Fire Department
is calling a major emergency.</i>

7
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:26,512
<i>...wave of unexplained killings...</i>

8
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,222
<i>...that are sweeping across this city.</i>

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,240
<i>Not all things in the world...</i>

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,200
<i>...are quite as they first appear.</i>

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
<i>Every seven years in an ordinary town...</i>

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>...an extraordinary event takes place.</i>

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,840
<i>You won't know it...</i>

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,040
<i>...you won't see it...</i>

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,240
<i>...but it happens.</i>

16
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:16,362
Damn.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
- You out?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,112
Don't let it be him, Joshua.
Not him.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,840
Mr. Harlow!

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,840
What's the matter, Mr. Harlow?

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,360
Are you out of bullets?

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,480
Here, have some of mine!

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,640
No you don't, Mr. Harlow.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,760
Joshua!

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,280
To be quite frank with you...

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,680
...you're a stain on our profession.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm beyond fucking insulted.

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,680
So...

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,320
...come on out...

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
...and I'll show you...

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,480
...the only way to quit
this line of work.

32
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,560
Congratulations, man.

33
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,600
Thanks.

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm glad it was you.

35
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,080
Enjoy your life together.

36
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,120
We have a winner.

37
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,920
<i>...crime rose across the board...</i>

38
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,320
<i>...particularly gang-related gun crime...</i>

39
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,040
<i>...which is leaving residents
in a constant state of fear.</i>

40
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,560
<i>There were calls last night
for further investment...</i>

41
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,920
<i>...in the city's under-manned
police force, as often...</i>

42
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
Another day in the borough.

43
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,040
All right, you.
Come on.

44
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,080
Out.

45
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,200
You been here long enough.

46
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
- Closing time, eh?
- Opening time.

47
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
How many times have
I told you about this?

48
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
Come on, out.

49
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,560
What did I do last night?

50
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,240
It's not what you did,
it's how much you drank.

51
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,080
You're a disgrace, you know that?

52
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,480
You dirty bastard.
Right.

53
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,840
Sorry.

54
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,520
Here.
Don't forget this.

55
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,640
Now piss off, Father.
You're barred!

56
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,040
Disgusting.

57
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Fuck off.

58
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
All right. Venue's stacked.

59
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,680
Visual is coming
through. Almost got it.

60
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,120
I'm into the CCTV mainframe.

61
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,760
That is tasty and invisible.

62
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
Thank you.
Watch and learn.

63
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,080
- Rerouting.
- Thank you.

64
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,200
Rerouted CCTV footage is online.

65
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
Confirm complete camera tap.

66
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,400
Rerouted CCTV confirmed...

67
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
...on all grid sections A through to B.

68
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,880
We have coverage of the entire city.

69
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
Abso-fucking-lutely.

70
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,680
Good.
Visuals on the standby?

71
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,680
All available motion detectors
and hidden cameras...

72
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,640
...are active and responsive.

73
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,120
- Block coms.
- Blocking.

74
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,960
Emergency calls placed
on permanent hold cycle.

75
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,000
<i>Please hold while we try to connect you.</i>

76
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,280
Emergency radio frequencies
are scrambled.

77
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,800
Lock everything.
Prepare to go live.

78
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
We're up.

79
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,080
About time.
What's our status?

80
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,320
<i>Some of the long hauls
are a little late rising...</i>

81
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
<i>...but the majority are up and about.</i>

82
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,400
And the implants?

83
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
<i>The surgery teams
completed overnight.</i>

84
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,120
Good.
Make sure the cleanup crews are ready.

85
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,120
They're going to have a busy day.

86
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Ladies and gentlemen...

87
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
...welcome to the Tournament.

88
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,373
It is my honor...

89
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,873
...to be your host
for this legendary event...

90
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:14,758
...being held for the first time
here in Great Britain.

91
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,640
With more CCTV
than anywhere else on Earth...

92
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,520
...we shouldn't miss a thing.

93
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,000
Now, as you know...

94
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,000
...the stakes in this room are high...

95
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,800
...but the stakes
for our competitors out there...

96
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,000
...are the highest possible.

97
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,200
At this very moment...

98
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,200
30 of the world's greatest assassins...

99
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,680
...are preparing for
the ultimate sporting event.

100
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,880
International killers
of every imaginable discipline...

101
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,480
...will compete
for a $10 million cash prize...

102
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,000
...and the honorable title
of the "World's Best".

103
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,320
Our lovely ladies are
standing by to take your bets.

104
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
100K minimum stake.

105
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
And here are a few
of my personal favorites...

106
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,600
...you may wish to keep your eye on.

107
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
- Visuals online.
- Go to seven.

108
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,480
- Go to seven, Rob.
- And cue.

109
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,640
Lai Lai Zhen,
abandoned at birth and left for dead.

110
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,560
At 17, she was killing
for the Triads...

111
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
...and has grown up to become
the number one hitter...

112
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,238
...in the Eastern market
for the past three years...

113
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,400
...a snip at 10 to 1.

114
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Anton Bogart.

115
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,120
An outstanding athlete...

116
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,320
...he lives for the thrill of the hunt.

117
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,080
Silent, stealthy, smart...

118
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,400
...a lethal option.

119
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,520
9 to 1.

120
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,120
Yuri Petrov,
Russian special forces.

121
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,120
An incredible all-rounder
armed to the teeth.

122
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
Fists, feet, bullets, bombs...

123
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,880
...utterly merciless,
he has it all.

124
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,960
Miles Slade, the crazy Texan kid.

125
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
An outside bet...

126
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,600
...but he's mad enough
to rise the ranks.

127
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,720
Reckless, ruthless, wild...

128
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
...but guaranteed great entertainment.

129
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
This is one guy
who truly loves his job.

130
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,840
And if you thought
it couldn't get any better...

131
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
...we have a dramatic late entrant...

132
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,120
...a returning champion
who I'm sure...

133
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,120
...will add something very
personal to the proceedings.

134
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Seven years ago...

135
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,360
Joshua Harlow took
the Tournament by storm...

136
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
...and retired as a champion.

137
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,440
But this year he's back.

138
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,880
For one reason,
and one reason only...

139
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,840
...revenge.

140
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,280
Joshua's wife was brutally murdered...

141
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
...in their Miami home
four months ago...

142
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,560
...and the person who killed her...

143
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,520
...is one of this year's players!

144
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,000
Joshua Harlow is our
favorite at 2 to 1.

145
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Activate tracking devices.

146
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,640
Overlaying and synching positions.

147
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,600
- Tracking bugs online.
- Prepare to go hot.

148
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,360
Hotter than me in a swimsuit.

149
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
Cue.

150
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,240
As ever, each assassin...

151
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,600
...is implanted with a tracking device...

152
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
...so we can find them...

153
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
...and they can find each other.

154
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,320
But this year we've added
an extra pinch of spice.

155
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,920
If we don't have a winner
within 24 hours...

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,793
...our contestants will discover...

157
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:09,381
...that their tracking device...

158
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:11,944
...isn't just a tracking device.

159
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,800
Well, I know you're all very busy men.

160
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,960
30 contestants...

161
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,760
24 hours...

162
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
...one rule...

163
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,880
...kill or die.

164
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

165
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,320
The Tournament has begun.

166
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Suck me sideways.

167
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,080
I would kill
for a piece of that pie.

168
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,320
Yeah, right.

169
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,920
You'd be fucking dead
before you could lick your lips.

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,480
Besides, somebody upstairs
has designs on her.

171
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,880
Oh, yeah?
Is that so?

172
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,440
Uh-huh.
Yeah, kinda.

173
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
They go way back.
He nurtured her or something.

174
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,276
Oh, oh, oh.

175
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,480
All right, it is showtime.

176
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,160
Holy shit.
Can you do that?

177
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,720
- Wow.
- He just killed an innocent guy!

178
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
Fuck! I love this shit.

179
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,840
- Fuck!
- Keep on him.

180
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm locked on him.
Nowhere to hide.

181
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,960
Miss Hunter, it is showtime.

182
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,160
We have Tomko versus Zhen.

183
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,120
<i>That is England v. China!</i>

184
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,640
Good.
Patch it through.

185
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
Sir, we're off.

186
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,840
It's Steve Tomko and Lai Lai Zhen.

187
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,640
What the fuck are you up to?

188
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,720
Who is it?

189
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
Room service.

190
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,760
Breakfast, madam.

191
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
I just want you to know,
after I kill you...

192
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm going to fuck you.

193
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,200
Hey, welcome
to the tournament, Rob.

194
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,920
You fucking bitch!

195
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,520
First blood to Lai Lai Zhen.

196
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,440
Her odds move to 7 to 1.

197
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,441
Yeah!

198
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:31,698
<i>Cleanup crew Delta...</i>

199
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:34,374
<i>...to the Ivy House Hotel room 107.</i>

200
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,605
<i>We're on our way.</i>

201
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:36,677
I still would.

202
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,147
<i>Confirm one body...</i>

203
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:40,715
Oh, okay, party time.

204
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:43,432
We have the Frenchman
Anton Bogart...

205
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,744
...heading into a cluster...

206
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:46,473
- Developing on the high street.
- Shit.

207
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:48,948
Activating all street security cams.

208
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:52,279
Picking it up on one,
two, three police cameras.

209
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:55,587
- The cameras live?
- Cameras are live.

210
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,970
We are in on the Gypsy.

211
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,628
Fuck.
The Frenchman's gone cold.

212
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,215
I didn't see a fight.
You see him get killed?

213
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:58,869
No, I didn't see a fucking fight.

214
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,078
Doing a signal sweep.

215
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,352
Check his body heat sensor now.

216
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:02,351
I'm on it.

217
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:12,159
He's back.
What did you do?

218
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,098
Must've been a blip.

219
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:15,699
Run a complete diagnostic.
I don't like blips.

220
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,640
- Coffee?
- No.

221
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,400
There you go.

222
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
Yes.

223
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,560
No.

224
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,880
Okay.

225
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
You planning to pay for that?

226
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,800
Yeah. Yes.

227
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,320
Credit card?

228
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,200
Here, Father.
Allow me.

229
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,080
Enjoy your coffee.

230
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,240
<i>Au revoir.</i>

231
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,200
Thank you.

232
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Hello, Todd.

233
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,080
Hello, Father.

234
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,840
Sorry I haven't been around.

235
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,720
I've been busy.
How's your mom doing?

236
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,800
She died, Father.

237
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,720
I... I'm sorry.

238
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
She was asking after you.

239
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Is there anything I can do,
like help with the funeral?

240
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,600
That's okay.
I've got it all sorted.

241
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,520
Oh, fuck.
- What?

242
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,080
I think we have another blip.

243
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,640
Shooter on the rooftop just went cold.

244
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
No one near her.

245
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,800
We've got a moving signal
but no Frenchman.

246
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,720
What the hell is going on?

247
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,360
- Come on.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

248
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,360
I fucking hate blips!

249
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,080
Hail Mary, full of grace.

250
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,200
The Lord is with thee.

251
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,320
Blessed art thou amongst women...

252
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,080
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

253
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,960
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

254
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,400
...now and in the hour
of our death, amen.

255
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,440
Oh, please,
Blessed Virgin, hear me.

256
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,320
I want to be a good man.

257
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,280
I want to be a strong man.

258
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,560
But I look inside my heart
and there is nothing there.

259
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,400
There's nothing there.

260
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,280
Oh, Blessed Virgin,
please give me hope.

261
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,480
I know.

262
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,160
What?

263
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,720
Whatever this is,
please, please...

264
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,080
What's wrong with you?

265
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,440
What's wrong with me?

266
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,320
Please, hear me...

267
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,160
Why aren't you
defending yourself?

268
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,240
I don't have any money,
please.

269
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,200
- I don't have any money.
- Shut up.

270
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,840
I'm just a...
I'm just a priest.

271
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,760
Please, please...

272
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,160
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost...

273
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,680
...goodbye.

274
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,320
I'm going to enjoy this.

275
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,200
Stop!

276
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Stop.

277
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,920
Stop!

278
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,040
Please, don't struggle.

279
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,200
So much easier
when they don't struggle.

280
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,520
What are you doing?

281
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,040
Just let her go!

282
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,480
I've got a gun!

283
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,440
I've got a gun and I'll use it.

284
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Don't move.

285
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,520
Or what?

286
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,040
Just... Just stay right there.

287
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,400
Stay back!

288
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,840
You need one in the chamber.

289
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,760
- Who are you?
- I'm a priest!

290
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,200
If you lie to me,
I break your neck.

291
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,720
I'm not.
I'm not!

292
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,880
Where are your weapons?
Who do you work for?

293
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,440
Where do you receive
your orders from?

294
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,440
Rome!

295
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,360
No scar.

296
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

297
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,840
You're bleeping.

298
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,000
You really don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

299
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,920
You really are a priest.

300
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,440
Father Macavoy.

301
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
This is...
was my church.

302
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,680
Well, Father,
welcome to the Tournament.

303
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,760
Thank you.

304
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,040
They found the blip.

305
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,000
What is it?

306
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,440
It's our Frenchman.

307
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,480
- Anton Bogart?
- It seems he managed...

308
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,960
...to cut out his tracking device...

309
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,000
...and it's ended up inside that priest.

310
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,320
I see.

311
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,080
We now have one of our favorites...

312
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,440
...running around virtually invisible?

313
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,880
I'm sorry.
What shall I tell them to do?

314
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
I suggest you shorten his odds...

315
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,560
...and follow him.

316
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,560
Yes, sir.

317
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,200
Okay, maintain
visual contact with Bogart.

318
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,440
Don't lose sight of that
slippery little bastard.

319
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,400
Tracking manually.
Damn, Bogart's quick.

320
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
<i>Go to camera two. Quick, go.</i>

321
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,760
Just got to reconfigure.

322
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,720
Give me a second.

323
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,040
- Holy shit.
- What now?

324
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,480
- It's him.
- You sure?

325
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,400
Oh, there are gonna be fireworks.

326
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,640
All right, Miss Hunter,
we have Harlow.

327
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,440
<i>We have Harlow for you.</i>

328
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,160
May I have your attention?

329
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,960
You wanted
the greatest show on Earth.

330
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,899
Out for revenge...

331
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:41,891
...the greatest assassin of our time.

332
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,280
Cut the shit, Eddy.

333
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,320
Oh, shit.

334
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,560
- What are you doing here?
- I need information.

335
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,440
What have you heard?

336
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,080
I heard someone
came for you.

337
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,120
I heard it got a bit messy.

338
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,680
And I heard about your wife.

339
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,760
What did you hear? Who told you?

340
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,520
The crazy American kid, Miles.

341
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
He's your one.

342
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,920
Miles Slade, the finger guy?

343
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,600
Uh-huh.

344
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,920
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

345
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,120
Eat shit!

346
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:02,996
Well, that's one more
for the trophy cabinet...

347
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,030
...thank you very much.

348
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,880
Okay, just take it back a little.

349
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,440
Playing out to one.

350
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,400
Jeez, who steals a finger?

351
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,120
Oh, yeah.

352
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Oh, fuck.

353
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,520
That's the emergency line.
What do I do?

354
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,960
Answer it.

355
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:29,917
Hello.

356
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:34,830
Yeah, hold on.
I'll just put you through.

357
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,840
Just spoke to Lai Lai Zhen.

358
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:42,679
You tell her you wanted
to eat her pie?

359
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:46,596
- Excuse me, Senator.
- All right.

360
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:47,200
It's Lai Lai.

361
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:50,287
Make sure that redneck
settles his marker...

362
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:51,539
...before he has another coronary.

363
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:55,440
Speak.

364
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,979
<i>We have a situation with a civilian.</i>

365
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:57,960
Who are you talking to, the police?

366
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,320
Quiet.
I know you can see what's going on.

367
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,678
<i>You know the rules, Lai Lai.</i>

368
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:04,625
<i>It's kill or be killed.</i>

369
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:07,026
<i>You're like a child
running back to Daddy...</i>

370
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,951
...telling me how
the big boy stole your ball.

371
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:11,527
<i>You're on the battlefield.
There is no going back.</i>

372
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,931
And he's just one of those famous
innocent bystanders you hear about.

373
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:15,880
- Let me speak to him.
- No, stop it.

374
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,680
- This is Father Macavoy.
- I'll kill you myself.

375
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,320
- Let me speak to him.
- It's not right. He's just a priest.

376
00:33:21,361 --> 00:33:23,288
<i>Personally, I find it kind of apt.</i>

377
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:26,893
<i>Back in the day we used to throw
Christians to the lions.</i>

378
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:28,994
<i>Seems that history
is repeating itself.</i>

379
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:30,725
<i>Carry him or kill him...</i>

380
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,400
...but don't call back.

381
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,852
What's happened?
Are the police coming?

382
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:40,178
Not really.

383
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,029
Move!

384
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,840
We have to get out of here now.

385
00:34:15,656 --> 00:34:16,320
Move it!

386
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:18,720
Oh, God!

387
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:22,840
Someone help me!

388
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,120
Please, help! God!

389
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:36,477
It's stuck.

390
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:39,339
Help me with the seatbelt.

391
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,320
- It's jammed.
- Don't let me die!

392
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,480
Come here. Come here.

393
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:50,526
Wrong day to be
a good Samaritan.

394
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,800
When I say "move it",
move it!

395
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,482
- Come on!
- What's going on?

396
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:00,545
You've got a bug inside you.
They think you're a hitter.

397
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,204
This is a competition for assassins.

398
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,807
That last man standing wins.

399
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:05,628
A game where people
kill each other?

400
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,444
Yes, we have to get
the tracker out of you...

401
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:08,840
...otherwise you're a target.

402
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:11,183
Why don't we go to the police?

403
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,200
Eh? You and I.

404
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:14,562
You acted in self-defense.
I'll speak for you.

405
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:16,687
Is it my accent?
Do I stutter? Is that it?

406
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,469
The people who run this...

407
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:20,078
...they are more powerful
than the police.

408
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,964
Somebody...
- They will get you anywhere.

409
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:23,938
...do something!
- But the bodies...

410
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:25,370
...people will see the bodies.

411
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,468
There will be an explanation.

412
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,120
It won't be the truth,
but it will be what people will buy.

413
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,282
A madman with a gun,
a terrorist attack...

414
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:33,188
...a natural disaster,
a car crash.

415
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,726
That's how the Tournament
remains a secret!

416
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,106
It's insane.

417
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:38,356
Don't you watch TV, Father?

418
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:40,055
The whole world is insane.

419
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:45,640
Now move it!
Come on!

420
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:52,421
<i>Sir.</i>

421
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:54,045
Sir, can we just reconfirm?

422
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:55,764
You want to make
the priest a player?

423
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,104
<i>You want him on the system?</i>

424
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,400
Was I unclear, Mr. Hamilton?

425
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,778
No. No, sir.
It's ready. It's ready.

426
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:05,500
- This is bullshit.
- Shut up and do it.

427
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:14,977
Ladies and gentlemen,
a man of the cloth...

428
00:36:14,977 --> 00:36:16,554
...has stepped out
from the sidelines.

429
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:19,005
If any of you good people
would like to take a long shot...

430
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:20,157
...on a man with a dog collar...

431
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:21,803
...we'll take that action.

432
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:36,069
Will you hurry up?

433
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,080
It's not coming up.

434
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,875
How do you know
I've even swallowed this thing?

435
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:42,493
How else could it
be inside you?

436
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:50,442
Fuck! Fuck!

437
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:52,919
Everybody thinks I'm an assassin!

438
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:54,808
Everybody wants me dead!

439
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,201
- Yes.
- Oh, fuck!

440
00:36:56,821 --> 00:36:58,080
I don't wanna die.

441
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,708
- It's okay.
- I don't wanna die.

442
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:05,482
I don't wanna die.

443
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:09,328
- I don't know how to cope with this.
- You'll be okay.

444
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:13,231
Trust me.

445
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,413
Okay.

446
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,418
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.

447
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:27,592
Oh, officer,
thank goodness you're here.

448
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:29,439
Nice outfit, Father.

449
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,514
Get down!

450
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:39,475
Come on!

451
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:43,752
What's happening?

452
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:45,508
I'm not sure,
but we have to get out of here now.

453
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:49,747
A policeman's been killed.

454
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,636
- He's a player.
- A player?

455
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:54,234
Why would anybody want
to take part in this madness?

456
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:57,586
Cash prize, revenge,
title, excitement.

457
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:58,593
So what's your reason?

458
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,693
I've seen him before.

459
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:23,310
- In the cafe this morning.
- Are you sure?

460
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:25,463
- Positive.
- He cut it out.

461
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:45,494
Hold on!

462
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:28,820
Fuck.

463
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,408
Whoo! Here we go.

464
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:07,770
Yeah. Hi, ladies!

465
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:42,261
Hurry back.

466
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:47,480
I love you, baby.

467
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,298
Enjoy your life together.

468
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,560
Where were you?

469
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,400
<i>Joshua...</i>

470
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,440
<i>I'm deeply sorry about your loss...</i>

471
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,385
<i>...but I may have some information...</i>

472
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,086
<i>...about the person
that came after you.</i>

473
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,540
<i>I may know where
you can find them.</i>

474
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,056
Oh, shit.

475
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:57,077
We got another one
of those cluster things.

476
00:41:57,144 --> 00:41:58,104
Jesus fucking Christ.

477
00:41:58,104 --> 00:41:59,939
That's not a cluster.
That is a war zone.

478
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:02,782
Angel's titty bar?
Are you kidding me?

479
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:04,194
There's nine shooters in there.

480
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:05,353
Why aren't they
attacking each other?

481
00:42:05,453 --> 00:42:06,487
Probably so many people
in the place...

482
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:08,346
...they don't know who is who.

483
00:42:08,546 --> 00:42:10,449
All right, we got ourselves
a situation here.

484
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:13,011
We have nine players
in one location.

485
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:16,835
Repeat, nine players
in one shithole location.

486
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:47,336
Come on, bitches!

487
00:42:52,388 --> 00:42:53,967
Fuck yeah!

488
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:58,841
Come on, boys!

489
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:05,124
Yeah!


490
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:07,960
No, you don't!

491
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,360
I see you, bud!

492
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,332
Tindillini and Mitre out.

493
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:20,360
They're going down fast.
Still taking bets.

494
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:27,426
Come on, boys!

495
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:46,090
Kill him.

496
00:43:50,082 --> 00:43:51,879
You fucking son of a bitch.

497
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,720
- Ho, ho, ho!
- This is fucked up.

498
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:02,240
That's Van de Ven out of the game.

499
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:09,830
Where you at, boys?

500
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:30,672
Yeah!
Fuck, yeah!

501
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,240
Was it you, Miles?

502
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,640
Did you come after me?

503
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,840
- Stay still, honey.
- Did you murder my wife?

504
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,440
What the fuck you talking about?

505
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,360
No, you don't, honey.

506
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,800
Good night, sugar.

507
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,080
<i>We're experiencing
problems with transmitting.</i>

508
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,200
<i>All units,
we have reports of gunfire...</i>

509
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,720
<i>Sorry, we're completely swamped here.</i>

510
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,240
<i>What the hell's going on today?</i>

511
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,960
God, I need a drink.

512
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,960
You drink too much...

513
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,560
...and your eyes give you away.

514
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,760
You damage your liver.

515
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,160
That's just perfect.
That's just exactly what I need...

516
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,680
...health advice from a hit man.

517
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,720
What are we going to do?

518
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,240
We have to wait until it passes
through your system.

519
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,480
The further out of town we go,
the less accurate the tracker.

520
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,040
It will buy us some time.

521
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,920
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

522
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,360
Why are you here?

523
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,520
Why are you playing?

524
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,560
Why all the questions?

525
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,560
Why do you drink so much?

526
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,120
Why were you sobbing
like a child this morning?

527
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,160
Because I'm lost.

528
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,600
You're lost?

529
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,040
Try to be me.

530
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,600
It must be tough playing God
with people's lives.

531
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,520
I don't play God.

532
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,680
If I don't do it,
somebody else will.

533
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,280
It's just a job.
Nothing more.

534
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,400
I don't believe you.

535
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,280
Otherwise,
why didn't you just kill me?

536
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,480
I don't kill the innocent.

537
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,840
I'm so happy.

538
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,360
Did you feel that?

539
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,800
Please!

540
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,880
Where were you?

541
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,960
Can you hold that for me, buddy?

542
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,120
Huh. Howdy.

543
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,640
Look at you.

544
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,000
Joshua Harlow...

545
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,720
...greatest assassin there ever was.

546
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,560
Well, I shit ya...

547
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,160
...you're well past your best, ain't ya?

548
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,880
But, hey, look at the bright side...

549
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,240
...at least you fell at the hands
of this year's champion.

550
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,600
Have a drink, legend.

551
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,760
Trying to quit.

552
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Just to be clear, old-timer...

553
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,920
...these are the last few
moments of your life...

554
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,200
You might as well
have a drink with me.

555
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,040
Maybe later.

556
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,680
Suit yourself, superstar.

557
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,840
Go on, now, tell me...

558
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,800
...how many kills?

559
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,400
Why Mary?

560
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:09,151
Mary?

561
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:09,880
Yeah.

562
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,680
Mary who?
I killed a fucking million Marys.

563
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:14,386
You know who.

564
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,480
Miami, four months ago.

565
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,640
I wasn't home.

566
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,080
It was me you wanted.
Why did you kill her?

567
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,000
Give me a second.

568
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,040
Hey, man, let me help you.

569
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,080
That's some nasty shit.

570
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,920
Now where were we?

571
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,240
My wife.

572
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,040
Yeah. Why weren't you there?

573
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,080
You left her all alone.

574
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:02,812
If I were you...

575
00:50:06,912 --> 00:50:07,944
I'd blame myself.

576
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,120
Bad news, superstar.

577
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,880
This is really going to fuck you off.

578
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,720
It wasn't me.

579
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,400
Don't lie to me, kid.

580
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,360
I am not...

581
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,160
...a kid!

582
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:45,560
I got me a $10 million trigger finger.

583
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,760
That's as close as you'll ever come...

584
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,880
...you fucking amateur.

585
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,640
Here, let me help you with that.

586
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,320
I really wish it was me.

587
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,000
Shit, I really do.

588
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,680
But I wouldn't go take credit
for other people's work.

589
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,200
That'd just be wrong.

590
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,680
Don't you pass out on me, legend.

591
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,040
I'm going to tell you
who killed your wife.

592
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,800
It gives me great pleasure...

593
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,280
...to know...

594
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,040
...that you know who did it...

595
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:24,200
...and that you can't do
a fucking thing about it.

596
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,120
Lai Lai Zhen came after you.

597
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,240
Lai Lai Zhen.

598
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,440
Heh.
She killed your wife.

599
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,160
You're a liar.

600
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,880
Am I?

601
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,320
I think I'll have that drink now.

602
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,960
That's the spirit.

603
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,280
Toast the new champion.

604
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,240
I think we're done here.

605
00:52:57,571 --> 00:53:00,933
#Every time #

606
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:05,058
#We say goodbye #

607
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:08,367
#I die a little #

608
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:16,177
#Every time we say goodbye #

609
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:20,944
#I wonder why a little #

610
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:25,361
#Why the gods above me #

611
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:31,562
#Who must be in the know #

612
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:36,769
#Think so little of me #

613
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:42,182
#They allow you to go? #

614
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:47,149
#When you're near #

615
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:51,174
#There's such an air #

616
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:54,702
#Of spring about it #

617
00:53:55,827 --> 00:54:02,176
#I can hear a lark somewhere #

618
00:54:02,716 --> 00:54:06,334
#Begin to sing about it #

619
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:11,465
#There's no love song finer #

620
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:15,270
#But how strange the change #

621
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,130
#From major to minor #

622
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:29,880
#Every time we say goodbye #

623
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,720
You okay?

624
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,920
Oh, no.
For a minute there...

625
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I thought it was
all just a bad dream.

626
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,440
You'll be okay.

627
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,120
Oh, please.

628
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,960
Please, God,
help me through this.

629
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,840
Please give me
some strength because...

630
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,800
...because I need a drink!

631
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,200
Sorry, I was...

632
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,640
Bless me, Father, I have sinned.

633
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,480
Stakes are high,
ladies and gentlemen...

634
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,360
...a favorite will fall.

635
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,760
You're lucky I got to you
before Joshua did.

636
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,400
He's pretty pissed you killed his wife.

637
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,440
No, no.

638
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,000
Wait, wait.

639
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,680
Please, please stop.

640
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,880
Finish the fucker!

641
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,320
Don't do it!

642
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,280
Please!
I'm sorry.

643
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,320
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

644
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,960
I'm sorry.

645
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,240
Pull the fucking trigger!

646
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,600
<i>Let's get as close as we can.</i>

647
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,160
<i>Keep him locked.
We gotta wait.</i>

648
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,840
He said what?

649
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's the right thing.

650
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,960
What is it?

651
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,120
No!

652
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,720
What is it?

653
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,520
Hello?
Mill's service station.

654
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,640
It's, um...

655
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,120
...it's for you.

656
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,440
Hello?

657
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,080
Father Macavoy...

658
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,280
...we haven't met...

659
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,160
...but I feel I know you intimately.

660
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,040
<i>So you're the sick fucker
that's running all this, are ya?</i>

661
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,240
Such profanity
from a man of the cloth.

662
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,640
Now I suggest you listen to me...

663
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,200
...very, very carefully.

664
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,151
Since you deemed it
necessary to interrupt...

665
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:15,701
...what could have been
a spectacular kill...

666
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,480
<i>I feel I should clarify the rules a little.</i>

667
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,200
<i>There's a time limit
you really should take note of.</i>

668
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,760
Time limit?
What are you talking about?

669
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,200
<i>It's very simple.</i>

670
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,400
<i>You need to start killing
if you want to stay alive.</i>

671
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,800
I'm not going to kill anyone.

672
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,760
We shall wait and see.

673
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,760
It will be your faith...

674
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,200
...against your desire to live.

675
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,621
That device inside you
is so much more than a tracker...

676
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,053
...as you've just witnessed.

677
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,800
<i>There's only four hours
left of the game, Father.</i>

678
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,007
<i>If there's more than
one player still alive...</i>

679
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,345
<i>...when the clock hits zero...</i>

680
00:59:48,472 --> 00:59:49,687
<i>...everyone will meet
the same fate...</i>

681
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:50,952
<i>...as your American friend.</i>

682
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,360
So let's see if you have any real guts.

683
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,400
It's kill or be killed.

684
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,760
<i>Four hours, Father...</i>

685
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,400
...and the clock is ticking.

686
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,760
Thank you.

687
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,320
Well, that's perfect.

688
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,360
Let's bring a replay
of that up on one.

689
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,320
Jesus.

690
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,696
We have to do that to all of them...

691
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:25,680
...if the time runs out?

692
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,120
No, it takes them out automatically.

693
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,720
What's the priest doing?

694
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,760
If the sat imagery is correct...

695
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,880
...he is trying to sort his shit out.

696
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,880
Anything yet?

697
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,600
Nothing's happening. I'm too tense.

698
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,160
It's got to come out
one end or the other.

699
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,360
Can you not wait outside?

700
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,720
I'm staying put.
Now concentrate.

701
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,920
You're putting me off.

702
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,200
Can you whistle or something?

703
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,640
Okay, who's Joshua's wife?

704
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,360
It doesn't matter.

705
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,280
Okay.

706
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,160
I thought the way you reacted
when you heard...

707
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,360
Will you just leave it alone?

708
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,360
Bit of a confession
in here, really, eh?

709
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,160
Confession can be incredibly hard.

710
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,520
It's painful to admit our sins...

711
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,800
...and trust ourselves in God's care.

712
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,560
But it helps.

713
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,440
It helps...

714
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,920
...sometimes.

715
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,720
Why don't you tell me
why you're here?

716
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,960
What's it got to do
with Joshua's wife?

717
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,000
The last thing you see
in a target's eyes...

718
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,120
...is understanding.

719
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,078
Somewhere,
deep inside of them...

720
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:19,232
...they've been expecting it.

721
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,440
Mary Harlow didn't have that look.

722
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,880
She just stared at me...

723
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,840
...like you did this morning...

724
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,480
...petrified, scared...

725
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,240
...bewildered.

726
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,269
I saw in her eyes...

727
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:49,397
...that something was wrong.

728
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,120
Please!

729
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,840
My instincts told me to stop.

730
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,240
Please!

731
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,120
But I pulled the trigger anyway.

732
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,760
I didn't know it until afterwards...

733
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,880
...but she was pregnant.

734
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,280
It's haunted me ever since.

735
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,480
That's why I have
to win this tournament...

736
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,240
...so I can get enough
money to vanish.

737
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,160
And if I don't win...

738
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,960
...then I get what's coming.

739
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,720
Okay, Miss Hunter,
the final few players...

740
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,160
...seem to be converging
on the motorway.

741
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,520
We got Harlow on the move...

742
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,200
...we're tracking Bogart nearby...

743
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,920
...and the long shot, Topuzov,
is closing in fast.

744
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,560
Lai Lai Zhen and the priest
are sitting ducks.

745
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,480
We have to get out of here now.

746
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,480
- I haven't...
- Now.

747
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,000
Okay.

748
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,920
Shit.

749
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,200
Quick, get to the car.

750
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:43,760
Shit.

751
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,000
Oh, shit.

752
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,880
Come on!

753
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,760
What's going on?

754
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,960
- I'm taking your bus.
- What?

755
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,560
I'm taking your bus.

756
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,080
Drive.

757
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,440
- I can't drive a bus.
- Learn fast!

758
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,600
Fuck.

759
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,680
What about the passengers?

760
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,520
Everybody down!

761
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,120
Lai Lai!

762
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,840
Fuck.

763
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,280
They're coming up on the Frenchman.

764
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,200
How is he gonna get in on the action?

765
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,040
Lai Lai!
Come and see this.

766
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,600
I'm a little busy now.
Can you handle it?

767
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,040
It's more in your department, really!

768
01:08:19,765 --> 01:08:20,360
Jeez, they're going way too fast.

769
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,320
They're out of control.

770
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,080
That guy's got a ticket.

771
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,680
Maybe not.

772
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,160
Holy shit.
Lai Lai's taking a beating.

773
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,920
Open the door!

774
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,800
Lai Lai!

775
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,880
Lai Lai, what are we gonna do?

776
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,920
Drive!

777
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,600
What have I done?

778
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,040
You saved me.

779
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
I'm gonna be sick.

780
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,160
Shit.

781
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,680
Okay, that is confirmed, sir.

782
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,320
Bogart is down and the priest
has officially left the game.

783
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,840
What about Joshua?

784
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,280
Father...

785
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,240
...what are you doing still here?

786
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,440
I cannot protect you anymore.

787
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,720
Please go.

788
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,840
I don't wanna go.

789
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,800
Why not?

790
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,240
You didn't abandon me...

791
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,120
...so I'm not going
to abandon you, yes?

792
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,320
We should go.

793
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,400
Come on.

794
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,480
Only five minutes remaining,
ladies and gentlemen.

795
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,760
Let me remind you...

796
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,280
...if we don't have a winner
when the time runs out...

797
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,080
...we will pay out on the current favorite,
Joshua Harlow.

798
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,600
No cameras.

799
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,520
They cannot see us in here.

800
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,320
What did you say?

801
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,240
There are no cameras in there.

802
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,720
- What about satellite?
- They're indoors.

803
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,000
Did I speak to you?

804
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,160
There are 30 people in there
who paid $10 million.

805
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,480
We're in the final few minutes.

806
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,600
I want everything and anything...

807
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,080
...pointed at that fucking church!

808
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,880
Wow, that really helps.

809
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,360
Okay, okay.

810
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,600
If we can't show what,
we can at least show where.

811
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,400
We'll give 'em something to watch.

812
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,560
You have to get to a hospital.

813
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,280
I want you to pray with me.

814
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,640
Of course.

815
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,520
You said your prayers?

816
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,520
I hope you said goodbye.

817
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,280
Please, this is God's house.

818
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,440
No killing in God's house.

819
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,600
God?
Why, Lai Lai?

820
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,200
Did someone send you...

821
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,920
...or was it personal?

822
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,120
- Just kill me.
- No, no, no.

823
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,640
Get it over with.

824
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,840
Why?

825
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,400
Why'd you come after me?

826
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,240
Why'd you come after me?

827
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,800
I didn't come after you.

828
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,320
What?

829
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,960
I wasn't there for you.
I was there for her.

830
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,560
The contract was on your wife.

831
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,400
Why?

832
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,960
Why would anyone
want to kill Mary? Why?

833
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,920
I don't know why.

834
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,280
We never know why.

835
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,800
Please, please.
Joshua, please.

836
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,160
She's not to blame.

837
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,880
She's not to blame for any of this.

838
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,320
She's a device, like a tool.

839
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,600
- She didn't want to kill your wife.
- No, shut up!

840
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,760
- She didn't want to kill...
- Shut up!

841
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,520
Mary was my life.

842
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,440
Mary was my life!
Who hired you?

843
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,560
She was your life.
She was your life.

844
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,720
Don't dishonor her now with death.

845
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,200
Who hired you?

846
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,520
- You're dishonoring her with death!
- Shut up!

847
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,600
Who hired you?

848
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,320
You know who hired me.

849
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,520
Joshua, what would Mary do?

850
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,720
What would Mary have you do?

851
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,120
We have a winner.

852
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,920
Ladies and gentlemen...

853
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,148
I want to present to you...

854
01:18:19,826 --> 01:18:22,079
...the two-time winner
of the Tournament.

855
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,440
Please be upstanding...

856
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,600
...for the greatest assassin
of our time!

857
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,400
Joshua.

858
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,320
I know everything.

859
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,640
Why?

860
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,440
What?

861
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,840
I put on a good show, didn't I?

862
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,040
You can keep all this money that I won...

863
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:15,240
...if you just tell me
why you murdered my wife.

864
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,640
You're delirious, Joshua.

865
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,200
I'm dying, but you're sweating.

866
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,800
Now why is that?

867
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,840
What's the matter,
you afraid to admit it?

868
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,360
Come on.

869
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,880
Come on, we're all killers here!

870
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,600
You need a doctor.

871
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,840
You're being absurd.

872
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,000
Why? Why did you murder my wife?

873
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,360
Or are you too fucking gutless?

874
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,320
Why?

875
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,040
Because it was necessary.

876
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,600
You didn't want to come
back to the Tournament.

877
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,960
I wasn't going to accept that.

878
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,160
You're the reigning champion.

879
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,040
Look at you, Joshua!

880
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:10,240
You're a warrior, gladiator.

881
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,760
Men like you don't die
in your beds...

882
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,560
...they fall on the field.

883
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,075
They give the crowd...

884
01:20:20,603 --> 01:20:21,780
...a glorious death.

885
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,760
Why?

886
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,160
Why?

887
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,880
Because if I'd have just asked...

888
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,080
...you'd have said no.

889
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,842
You needed
a little motivation...

890
01:20:46,677 --> 01:20:47,529
...pressure...

891
01:20:50,162 --> 01:20:51,661
...on that little
chink in the armor.

892
01:20:55,087 --> 01:20:55,905
Close your eyes.

893
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:57,814
You and your wife...

894
01:20:58,594 --> 01:20:59,660
...will be together soon.

895
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,960
I love you, baby.

896
01:21:08,256 --> 01:21:09,786
Joshua, wait! Wait!

897
01:21:12,995 --> 01:21:13,757
Joshua!

898
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:17,931
We'll see her together.

899
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,640
Jesus, he took her tracker out.

900
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,840
Override.
It's gonna blow.

901
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:22,040
So, uh, I'm going to go home.

902
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,880
Yeah, me too.

903
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,960
<i>Terror stepped up a notch today.</i>

904
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,283
<i>Bombs are believed to have gone off...</i>

905
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:37,523
<i>...in both a city center church...</i>

906
01:22:37,523 --> 01:22:39,455
<i>...and a popular
strip bar on the outskirts...</i>

907
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,173
Our little town has been tested...

908
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,748
...played witness to events
beyond comprehension...

909
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,207
...besieged by darkness.

910
01:22:49,661 --> 01:22:50,560
<i>...many major road accidents...</i>

911
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,040
<i>...the worst of which
a mile-long motorway pileup.</i>

912
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,440
And yet, here we are again...

913
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,440
...our spirits renewed...

914
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,040
...reborn.

915
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,960
<i>...the debilitating
lack of any CCTV footage...</i>

916
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:11,440
<i>...to increase
surveillance to blanket proportions.</i>

917
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,312
I'm reminded of the words...

918
01:23:12,312 --> 01:23:14,633
...of the American writer
Robert Nathan...

919
01:23:15,588 --> 01:23:20,528
...when he said,
"We must give thanks to the sorrow...

920
01:23:21,265 --> 01:23:22,081
...that shows us pity...

921
01:23:24,019 --> 01:23:26,773
...to the pain
that teaches us courage...

922
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:31,339
...and to the mystery
which is a mystery still. "

923
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,440
Let us pray.
