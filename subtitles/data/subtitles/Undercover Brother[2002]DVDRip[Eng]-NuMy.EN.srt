00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,218
After a generation of struggle...

2
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,127
changed the face of our nation,...

3
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,291
African Americans entered the '70s...

4
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,163
with new found hope.

5
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,896
I am...
- I am...

6
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,927
Somebody!
- Somebody!

7
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,370
Vibrant leaders emerged...

8
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,239
and black culture reached
its high point,...

9
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,709
influencing all facets
of American life.

10
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,110
But progress slowed
in the decades that followed.

11
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,712
Black culture began to lose
its distinctive flavor.

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,522
And as the millennium drew to
a close disaster struck.

13
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,031
These seemingly random events
were in fact orchestrated...

14
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,795
by The Man, a villain obsessed...

15
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,827
with turning back the clock
on race relations.

16
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,771
Just when it seemed
the funky spirit...

17
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,603
of the '70s
would be lost forever,...

18
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,236
a new hero emerged.
His name, Undercover Brother.

19
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,382
Give it to me.
Need it, got to have it.

20
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,783
Say!

21
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,639
It ain't no thang.

22
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,445
Yeah.

23
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,287
A bird gonna shit on my windshield?!

24
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,953
Not on my Cadillac!

25
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,986
I'm gonna chop your feathers off
and put you in Chinatown!

26
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,499
They gonna make
Peking Pigeon out of you!

27
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,296
Damn!

28
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,298
Unbeknownst to Undercover Brother,...

29
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,033
there was a secret organization
dedicated to truth,...

30
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,268
justice, and the Afro-American way.

31
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,710
They had never crossed paths
until now.

32
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,831
Headquarters, come in.

33
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,390
Good work, Sistah Girl.

34
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,996
Data from the mainframe
ready to commence.

35
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,007
She's transmitting! Are we up and ready?
- Yes, sir.

36
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,202
And I've hacked into
the bank security system.

37
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,870
You've got soul.

38
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,144
We're in.

39
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:14,279
The computer!
Another idea stolen from the black man.

40
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,584
Did you all know that
George Washington Carver...

41
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,921
made the first computer
out of a peanut?

42
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,323
A peanut?

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,624
A peanut!
- Shut up and get back to work!

44
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,755
I've spent six months
setting up this operation...

45
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,526
and I want to see everything...

46
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,694
off-shore accounts,
dummy corporations, money laundering.

47
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,102
If we can cut off his funds,...

48
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,436
we may finally be able
to stop The Man.

49
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,450
Waited a long time for this.

50
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,177
What the hell?
- What the hell?

51
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,917
What the...
- Dissed.

52
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,290
Ah, solid.
- Hey!

53
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,056
What the hell are you doing, old man?

54
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,765
Headquarters...

55
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,208
Is there another agent on this case?
- Hell, no!

56
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,871
Damn it, who is that guy?

57
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,972
I'll cross-reference the bank's
security camera with our database.

58
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,148
Come on, Uncle Ben!

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,230
It's Macy Gray
with pork-chop sideburns!

60
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,664
Who's bad?

61
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,114
Ohh! Right up the pooper!

62
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,955
Right on, sweet sistah.

63
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,426
Damn it, who is he?!

64
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,458
Sistah Girl, abort mission!

65
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,535
Damn it.
Who was that guy?

66
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,282
Solid.

67
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,777
Solid.

68
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,853
Too funky for myself.

69
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,885
Mr. Feather, The Man wants to see you.

70
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,651
Fabulous.

71
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,327
And now, the Channel 8 News with
Wendy Marshall and Chuck Marlboro.

72
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:49,425
There's growing speculation that former
defense secretary and war hero,...

73
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,994
General Warren Boutwell,
will run for President.

74
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,506
He is considered
the first African-American...

75
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,132
with a legitimate chance of winning.

76
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,144
Wendy? Yeah, he is a strong
candidate, Chuck.

77
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,043
He's so well-spoken.
I've noticed that.

78
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,243
General Boutwell seems to have
a lot of support all across the nation.

79
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,444
Yes, and not just
in the urban areas.

80
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,183
In fact, the decorated
four-star general and Vietnam vet...

81
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,020
is regarded
as one of the country's...

82
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,855
most well-respected
public figures.

83
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,190
Thank you very much.

84
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,253
A staunch advocate
for civil rights,...

85
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,424
Boutwell has never backed down
from controversial issues.

86
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,731
Indeed, if ever there was a straighter
arrow than Warren Boutwell,...

87
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,566
we'd be hard-pressed
to find him.

88
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,766
Well, if he does declare
his candidacy,...

89
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,071
this certainly will be
an exciting race.

90
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,044
Race? I'm not
touching that one.

91
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,412
First, our children hip-hop
all over the suburbs.

92
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,508
Now Boutwell might be President?!

93
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,681
They are taking over
every aspect of our culture!

94
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,156
Don't you agree, Mr. Feather?
- Word.

95
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,252
For sheezy, my neezy.
- What did you say?

96
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,958
I said... for sure.

97
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,898
Yes, indeedy.

98
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,958
I have a cold.

99
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,233
I want the White House
to stay white.

100
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,637
Eliminate him!

101
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,767
But, sir, if we kill him,...

102
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,403
we'll only be
making him a hero.

103
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,411
Do you have a better idea?

104
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,579
Our friends at Multinational Inc.
have been developing a new drug...

105
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,214
with some very interesting
side effects.

106
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,561
I think we may have found
the perfect guinea pig.

107
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,374
The so called Afro Bandit
struck Multinational Bank.

108
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,571
However, it appears
no money was stolen.

109
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,706
Authorities questioned
singer Macy Gray,...

110
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,979
but she was released
for lack of evidence.

111
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,111
Well, would anybody
like to explain exactly...

112
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,917
what the hell happened
at the bank?!

113
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,254
His name is Undercover Brother.

114
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,019
Apparently, he was erasing
mortgage records...

115
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,624
so that low-income families
wouldn't lose their homes.

116
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,758
Great.

117
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,736
A "Soul Train" reject
with a Robin Hood complex.

118
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,295
Now I've heard everything.
- Hey, hey, hey, now.

119
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,171
At least he got the job done.

120
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,609
That's the kind of man we need around here.
- The keyword being "man"?

121
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,408
Hold on.
I didn't say that, you did.

122
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,142
Man-man.

123
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,309
The General's
press conference is starting!

124
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,012
We interrupt this broadcast
to take you live...

125
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,543
to a press conference
by General Warren Boutwell,...

126
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,987
in which he is expected
to announce...

127
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,151
that he is a candidate
for presidency of the United States.

128
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,026
I wonder if he'll run
as a Democrat or an Independent.

129
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,657
Never know. Might be a Republican.
- Oh, please.

130
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,001
What kind of self-respecting black
man would run as a Republican?

131
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:41,070
Name one thing the Republican party
has done for black people. One!

132
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,075
Well, they were
the party of Lincoln.

133
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,838
They stood against
the tyranny of oppression...

134
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,538
by leading the call
for the Civil War,...

135
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,241
and forced passage
of the Emancipation Proclamation,...

136
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,543
which freed the slaves.

137
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,151
All right,
name two things lately.

138
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,154
Damn it, it doesn't matter
what party!

139
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,748
This could be the first step
on the road to putting...

140
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,021
an African-American
in the White House.

141
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,995
It's a great day
for black people of all races.

142
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,699
Good morning.
- Think about it!

143
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,068
I've thought long and hard about how
I can best serve my country...

144
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,834
now that I'm no longer in uniform.

145
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,001
Well, today...

146
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,170
I am proud to announce...

147
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,042
that I will be...

148
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,642
opening a chain
of fried chicken restaurants.

149
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,952
General Boutwell!

150
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,022
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,892
So, you're passing up a chance
to be President...

152
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,361
to open a chicken joint?

153
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,422
A man like me doesn't have
any business in politics.

154
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,900
They say you should
always do what you know.

155
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,028
And what I know
is good fried chicken.

156
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,005
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,133
Don't you think your supporters
in the African-American community...

158
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,906
will be particularly disappointed?

159
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,038
Not after they taste
the General's fried chicken.

160
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,714
Surrender, Colonel,
here comes the General.

161
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,151
Will there be side dishes?
- Sweet potatoes...

162
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:06,619
Black-eyed peas, Mashed potatoes, macaroni...

163
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,924
cornbread and the General's
special... hot sauce!

164
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,228
That's all for today.

165
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,359
Thank you very much.
Nice to see you all.

166
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,734
General, what about desert?

167
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,041
You know, he does have a point
about that Colonel.

168
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,567
I never trusted the Colonel!

169
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,479
Slaves cooked that chicken!
Ain't no white man know...

170
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,710
about no 16 herbs
and spices and giblets!

171
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,912
Smart Brother,
if you so damn smart,...

172
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,945
Why don't you explain
what just happened?

173
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,150
If I wanted to hear something stupid,...

174
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:43,423
I'd ask this skinny black ass!
- In your face!

175
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,396
Skinny black... Hey!

176
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,696
We got to find out exactly what happened
to the General, and fast!

177
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,634
I'll get right on it.
Whoa, hold on.

178
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,638
Not that fast. We need
some new blood on this case.

179
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,005
What? Who? You can't just hire
some fool off the streets.

180
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,011
Watch me.
Get me Undercover Brother!

181
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,943
Ooh, too funky for myself.

182
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,006
You were the only man
outside the palace.

183
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,812
I was outside.
- Jimmy!

184
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,116
But I wasn't the only one.
- Jim Kelly!

185
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,750
It is not possible.
- Watch out for the hand!

186
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,552
Gets you every time!
Spinning back-kick!

187
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,805
I think I'll lay down...

188
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,175
and get me a little bit
of sleep.

189
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,841
Don't touch the hair!

190
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,649
Okay, Bruce Leroy, turn around.

191
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,523
Slowly.

192
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,623
If you gonna shoot me,
shoot me.

193
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,300
Thank you, Jesus.

194
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,474
Dig it.

195
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,147
You that Sistah Girl
from the bank, huh?

196
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,083
I guess you like
what you saw earlier.

197
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,260
Look, baby,
let's stop fooling around.

198
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,092
Your body's slammin',
let's get to jammin'.

199
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,628
Excuse me?

200
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,964
Oh, nothing relaxes a brother after
a hard day of going undercover...

201
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,833
like a little piece of the cookie.

202
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,997
Goddamn.
My cookie would break you in half.

203
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,671
Maybe, but that would be
some long division.

204
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,512
Long.

205
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,984
You hit me pretty good,
but I wasn't ready.

206
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,682
Now, any time you think you want to
get feisty or throw down...

207
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,991
So, Sistah Girl,...

208
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,497
if you're not here
for Undercover Lover,...

209
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,624
you must be here
for Undercover Brother.

210
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,931
What, pray tell,
can I do for you today?

211
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,769
Okay, we're here. Now be cool.

212
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,104
This place is top secret.
- Solid.

213
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,971
Man, you know you ain't right.

214
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,614
I'm gonna need my custom shears
for this masterpiece.

215
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,484
Careful. Puncture him and the
hot air's liable to kill you.

216
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,351
Take a seat.
- Don't mind if I do.

217
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,121
We're gonna hook you right up.
- Holy funkadelic!

218
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,459
This is some kind of secret
organization you have here.

219
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,855
Look at all this hi-tech
spy equipment.

220
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,926
You got clippers,
you got T.C.B. activator.

221
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,996
I mean, your only competition
must be the K.G.B.

222
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,672
Or the F.B.I.

223
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,811
Who the hell are you, woman?
You're the Grim Reaper!

224
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,344
I don't want to go to hell!

225
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,289
I ain't never did
nothing but good!

226
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,657
I swear to God
I ain't done nothing wrong!

227
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,266
Oh, come on.

228
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,796
The flashing light and fan
make the drop seem worse than it is.

229
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,141
I knew that.

230
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,952
Entering secure area.

231
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,955
Stand here.

232
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,980
Right here?

233
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,405
Blackness confirmed. You got soul.

234
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,273
What I'm about to show you
few people have ever seen before.

235
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,654
Would Agent Jefferson please pick up
the black courtesy phone?

236
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,758
Agents report to the ready room.

237
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,787
Agents report to the ready room.

238
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,764
Welcome to the Brotherhood.

239
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,633
Solid.

240
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,603
Yes, I know.

241
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,667
I really don't want to talk about
this over the telephone.

242
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,043
Perhaps we could meet
at a secret location?

243
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,708
Okay. No, that sounds great.

244
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,240
All right. Revolution.
Take care.

245
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,219
"The revolution will not be televised."

246
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,781
This is Undercover Brother.
- Hey, how you doing?

247
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,088
Good morning!

248
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,959
Good morning?
Get on the desk!

249
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,294
You brought a spy around me?!

250
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,697
Spy in the building!

251
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,565
Don't touch the 'fro.
- Back up off!

252
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,561
Back up off me!
- Let me tell you something about the word "good."

253
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,632
Good is an ancient Anglo-Saxon word.

254
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,009
Go-od, meaning
the absence of color,...

255
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,911
i.E... .
"It's all good,"...

256
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,576
which it is,
or "Good Will Hunting,"...

257
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,915
meaning, "I'm hunting niggas!"

258
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,081
So if you say "good morning" to me,
you're saying,

259
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,456
"I'm gonna kill your black ass
first thing in the morning!"

260
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,087
Is that that damn Undercover Brother?!
- You in trouble.

261
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,097
Where the hell have you been?!

262
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,224
This is a job, not some kind
of damn summer camp!

263
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,097
And I'm tired of you
disrespecting me!

264
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,764
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire your sorry ass!

265
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,774
Because I don't work for you?

266
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,435
Shut up!

267
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,446
Save your smart comments
for the chunky brother in the smock!

268
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,471
Now get in my office!

269
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,461
Congratulations, Mr. Feather.

270
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,300
Thank you, Mister...

271
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,238
The Man.

272
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,403
As you can see,
the General is totally under our control.

273
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:09,904
Yes, our little experiment was a success.

274
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:14,908
In fact, I've decided to use the General
to launch "Operation Whitewash."

275
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,411
Fabulous. I'll inform Multinational
to step up production.

276
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,756
The only thing standing
in our way is the Brotherhood.

277
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,251
And they won't be a problem,
will they, Feather?

278
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,390
No, sir.

279
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,626
Good.

280
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,294
Uh, will they, Feather?

281
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,173
New one from Britney...

282
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,009
What am I doing?!

283
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,723
And that's why we believe
there's got to be...

284
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,600
some connection between
the General's announcement and The Man.

285
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,367
Come on, y'all.
Y'all telling me there's really a Man?

286
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,671
What do you think,
Undercover Brother?

287
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,302
If that is your real name.

288
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,575
You think things
just happen by accident?

289
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:54,686
No! Sometimes people, mostly white
people, make things happen.

290
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,312
That's where we come in...

291
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,689
and our never ending struggle
against The Man,...

292
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:06,763
a.k.a. Whitey, a.k.a. Mr. Charlie,
a.k.a. Honky McGee.

293
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,268
So, the conspiracies we've believed
for all these years are really true?

294
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,294
The N.B.A. really instituted...

295
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,569
the three-point shot
to give white boys a chance?

296
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,870
Absolutely.

297
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,503
So the entertainment industry
really is out to get Spike Lee.

298
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,979
Is that right?
- Come on, man!

299
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,949
Even Cher got an Oscar.

300
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,507
Cher-rr!

301
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,418
And O.J. really didn't do it?

302
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,418
Let's just move on, shall we?

303
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,996
Holy moly, looks like
the Source Awards in here.

304
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,999
It does now.

305
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,058
Hurting.
- Who's that?

306
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,069
Oh, this is Lance, our intern.

307
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,695
Lance, this is Undercover Brother.

308
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,205
What's happening?

309
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,607
Whas-ssup?!

310
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,109
Okay, how did the white boy get
a job here at the Brotherhood?

311
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,947
Shit. What can I tell you?
Affirmative action.

312
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,577
What? Here we go.

313
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,110
Oh, boy.
Open up the window.

314
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,350
It's getting all racial
up in this piece.

315
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,920
Look here, Undercover Brother,
now that you're working for us,...

316
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,226
you're gonna need to memorize
our rules and regulations.

317
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,132
Trim the hair, and for God's sake,
get rid of the clothes.

318
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,432
Slow your roll, Chief.
You know, I respect...

319
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,529
what y'all are doing here
at the Brotherhood,...

320
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,235
but I'm a firm believer in everybody
should do their own thang.

321
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,583
Okay, he should never
do his own thang.

322
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,693
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

323
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,157
I said, "You'd better open
the bank and give me my money."

324
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,532
Yeah?
"It's my money.

325
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,366
I don't care whose bank it is!"
Right.

326
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,998
I know whose money is in it.
I'm keeping it real.

327
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,508
That's all I'm saying.
- Hi, Conspiracy Brother.

328
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,271
"Hi"? What you mean, "Hi"?

329
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,336
Like, "Hi, y'all
want to be white?"

330
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,008
High, like the white man
wants to keep us? Huh?

331
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,447
You don't smell
no weed on me, did you?

332
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,477
Hey, brother, can I get a list...

333
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,489
of the words
that trigger these fits?

334
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,115
Man, you really need to relax.

335
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,785
Go see a movie.
- A movie?

336
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,521
A movie. Come on, man!

337
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,791
So I can fall in love
with some cute black man...

338
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,458
that teaches white people everything
they know about the shrimp industry...

339
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,331
before they kill him
30 minutes into the movie?

340
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,496
"Hey, why don't you walk down
that tunnel, black man?

341
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,699
Hey, black man,
turn on the generator.

342
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,300
This dinosaur is out there.
Hey, black man, look out.

343
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,641
He's got a gun!"

344
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,407
Oh! I'm hit!

345
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,414
But my vest caught it, bitch!

346
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,041
Yes, I'm alive!

347
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,713
I told you to keep your finger
off the trigger of that thing!

348
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,153
I'm cool, everybody.

349
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,781
Undercover Brother, please.
- Go on back to work.

350
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,553
Sorry about all that.
- I shit on myself!

351
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,150
I have a couple of things for you.

352
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:53,062
Here are your shoes. I took the
liberty of making a few modifications.

353
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,160
And now, am I correct in assuming
that the Cadillac...

354
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,500
that was double-parked in
the parking lot belongs to you?

355
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,268
Smart Brother,
that is not just a Caddy.

356
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,298
That is a Cadillac Coupe DeVille.

357
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,140
Y'all don't give a shit about me!
I need a sponge bath.

358
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,778
That's an orange soda dispenser.

359
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,546
And a crossover amp
and subwoofer for your eight-track.

360
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,577
Ah, man. Smart Brother,
you's a bad mother...

361
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,181
Shut your mouth!

362
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,953
Enjoy, huh?

363
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,353
All right.

364
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,454
Big car, big hair, big necklace.

365
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,227
Someone is clearly overcompensating.

366
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,827
First of all, you forgot about
my big, black, fuzzy balls.

367
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,770
And secondly,
this is not a necklace,...

368
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,870
it's a medallion
given to me by my father...

369
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,643
so I never forget who I am
or what I stand for.

370
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,548
I don't need no gold.
Don't need no jewels.

371
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,554
The medallion keeps me cool.
You dig?

372
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,150
Sistah Girl, Undercover Brother, come in.

373
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,328
What it is, Chief?

374
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,455
We've just discovered that
the General is playing golf...

375
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,329
with some of Multinational's
head honchos.

376
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,665
Now, you get yo ass down there
and see what you can find out!

377
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,398
And by the way, Undercover Screw Up,...

378
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,032
don't let me catch your black ass
in the news again.

379
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,139
You hear me?!
I want you to blend in!

380
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,610
Chiefie, baby,
I'm a master of disguises.

381
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,239
I can blend in like a good weave.

382
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,455
Say, where's that caddy?
- I don't know.

383
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,150
Oh, there he is.

384
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,723
Jah mon, rasta.

385
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,807
Nice shot.

386
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,109
Sistah Girl, the camera's up.

387
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,089
Would anyone like
some fried chicken?

388
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,595
Mr. Feather.

389
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,332
Undercover Brother?

390
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,340
We're definitely
on the right track.

391
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,104
That's the number one
flunkey of The Man.

392
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,669
I'm gonna report to the Chief,
find out what he wants to do.

393
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,181
That cat'll be long gone
by that time.

394
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,046
This thing's going down now, baby.

395
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,245
This is strictly
an observational mission.

396
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,015
We are not authorized
to take action.

397
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,147
Well, observe this.

398
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,181
Action is what
Undercover Brother's all about.

399
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,326
Hmm. Rasta man.

400
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,675
Oh, the mind control
formula is complete.

401
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,305
Who's there?
- Kung!

402
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,340
Kung who?

403
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,213
Kung fool!

404
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,567
Ow, my wrist.

405
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,066
Help! Thief!
There's a thief here!

406
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,807
What the hell is your problem?
- Give me back my things!

407
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,645
Thief!
Hey, give me that back!

408
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,455
Hold it!

409
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,980
Holy Motown.

410
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,100
Come on.
- You don't want to mess with me, man!

411
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,035
I had 'em, baby.
Yeah, I saw.

412
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,774
Come on, let's go!

413
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,849
Come on!

414
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,418
Stop where you are!
This is security!

415
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,924
Do not move!
- Quick! This way!

416
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,550
Aw, hell, they moved.

417
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,298
Do it.
Code 37.

418
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,604
Is he crazy?
- Okay, slow down!

419
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,651
Slow, slow, slow.

420
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,984
Hey, slow down
over there, people!

421
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,981
Hold the wheel, baby.

422
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,963
No! No!
- Oh, no!

423
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,329
Oh, jeez!
Too fast!

424
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,163
Losing control!

425
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,830
There's got to be another way out of here.
- Hold it!

426
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,212
Thanks for the lift.

427
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,957
A spectral analysis has ironically confirmed
traces of poultry on Mr. Feather.

428
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,893
This proves that
The Man must be behind...

429
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,021
Multinational Inc. 's deal
with the General.

430
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,725
I don't get it. What does The Man
got to do with fried chicken?

431
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,462
Is that his big plan,
to get black people to eat junk food?

432
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,834
Open your eyes, Undercover Brother!

433
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,398
This has to do with
discrediting the General.

434
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,375
That is the white man's tactic.

435
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,378
He don't want no black President.

436
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,845
You've seen it all through history.

437
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,814
They never give black men credit.

438
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,841
Jesus Christ... black man.

439
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,685
Babe Ruth... black man.

440
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,355
Madonna!

441
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,323
Sleeps with black men.

442
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,556
Think about it.

443
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,724
So the General sold out to The Man.

444
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,563
I don't think it's that simple.

445
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,627
When you're dealing
with The Man, it never is.

446
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:45,002
Our only choice here
is to infiltrate Multinational Inc.

447
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,637
Then we can find out
what happened to the General.

448
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,341
It'll be a very dangerous assignment.

449
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,517
It'll be your most
vigorous training yet.

450
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,212
You're gonna have to think and act...

451
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,687
just like a tight-butt white man
with a 401K plan...

452
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,349
and a country club membership.

453
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,324
So pay attention.

454
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,664
Here...

455
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,997
have a bite of this...

456
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,228
sandwich.

457
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,134
How did you know I was hungry?

458
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,002
I ain't eat nothing this morning.

459
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,207
You trying to kill me?
- If you're going to pass in white America,...

460
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,307
you are going to have
to learn to like mayonnaise!

461
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,544
No!
Listen...

462
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,644
if you're ever forced
to eat this mayonnaise,...

463
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,349
simply press the button
on this side of the watch.

464
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,018
It delivers a rather liberal
spritzing of hot sauce.

465
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,358
One blast should be enough
to make Caucasian food edible.

466
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,954
Well, it works on grits.

467
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,631
Now, since time
is of the essence,...

468
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,660
I developed a device
that allows you...

469
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,729
to absorb the whole
of white culture...

470
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,708
in mere seconds
using subliminal imagery.

471
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:56,078
I call it... Caucasiavision.

472
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,912
Hey, I feel like George Clinton.

473
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,144
Turn it on.

474
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,732
No!

475
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,169
Make it stop!
Make it stop!

476
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,503
Don't you give up on me!

477
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,805
I see white people.
It's too much!

478
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,177
Too much!
Caucasian overload!

479
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,810
Caucasian overload.
Breathe.

480
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,477
Caucasian overload!
Breathe.

481
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,011
Breathe. Breathe.

482
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,854
That's too much white
for one brother to take.

483
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,225
You did good.

484
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,423
We need to make sure
the process worked,...

485
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,696
so I called in an expert
on white culture.

486
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,509
"In season three of 'Friends',...

487
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:12,249
what object of Julia's did
Ross see on his bedside table...

488
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,281
the night he kissed Rachel?"

489
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,494
Her saline solution.

490
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,101
He's ready.

491
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,507
Hi, there.

492
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,843
How are you doing?

493
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,688
What do you say there?

494
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,291
Howdy. May I help you?

495
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,818
I sincerely hope so.

496
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,831
Today's my first day at Multinational.

497
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,163
Oh, my. Jackson.

498
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,667
Anton Jackson.

499
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,897
And no, not one
of the Jackson Five.

500
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,599
Here we go. You're in suite 54.
Tobacco division.

501
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:11,107
We need some fresh, hip strategies
to expand our market share.

502
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,640
As it turns out,
I have just the product.

503
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,450
Here's one of your cigarettes.

504
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,785
Take a good look at it.

505
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,621
It's pale, small,
a little on the limp side.

506
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,990
It's basically inadequate.

507
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,188
It can't possibly give much
pleasure to the user.

508
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,789
It sure can't.
- I mean, ask yourselves,...

509
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,027
how many black people
are gonna want to smoke this?

510
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,298
Not the one I know.
- You have to effectively position...

511
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,304
your product within the black consumer.

512
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,136
May I present to you The Fatty?

513
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,202
Hmm? It's got that
hand-rolled look and feel...

514
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,645
that's so popular
with today's black youth.

515
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,640
It's big. It's full
of long-lasting pleasure...

516
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,051
To be enjoyed again...

517
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,387
I could use a smoke.

518
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,827
Yeah? Good.

519
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,125
It's time to say goodbye
to Anton Jackson...

520
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,105
and say what it is
to Undercover Brother.

521
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,145
Now, that's a long way down.

522
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,439
Come in, Brotherhood.
Are you digging me?

523
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,069
Undercover Brother.

524
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,410
I'll transmit some
computer files about the General.

525
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,472
See what you can do with it.
- Right on.

526
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,483
The chief wants you to stay undercover
until we decode this information.

527
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,494
I can dig it.
- But be careful.

528
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,655
If they're onto you,
they might set up a trap.

529
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,289
I know this is the wrong time,...

530
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:45,067
but I wanted to let you know,
I'm thinking about you, girl.

531
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,468
I'm bouncin'.
Shakin' a spot.

532
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,735
Gone.
- Bye.

533
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,901
Bye.

534
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,546
Mr. Elias, there's been a breach!

535
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,912
That afro!

536
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,042
I'd recognize it anywhere.

537
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,416
The Brotherhood is making their move.

538
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,387
Just as I expected.

539
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,551
It's time to release
our secret weapon.

540
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,221
I call it...

541
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,425
Black Man's kryptonite.

542
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,142
How's it going there?

543
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,879
What the hell?

544
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,487
Oh, dear.

545
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,456
Oh, what am I gonna do?

546
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,459
My gosh.

547
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,824
Look at this mess.
Oh, dear.

548
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,797
I'm so sorry.
Let me help you.

549
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,427
Jeez, that's sweet of you.

550
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,495
If I mess up my boss' report,...

551
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,006
he's gonna have a conniption
with a capital K.

552
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,909
Penelope Snow.

553
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,743
Anton Jackson.

554
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,749
I'm so sorry. Here.

555
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,809
Thanks, Anton.
You're so sweet.

556
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:12,414
And cute, too.
In a Theo Huxtable kind of way.

557
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,589
Are you new here?

558
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,026
Yeah, it's my first day.
Mine too.

559
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,927
Really?
- Yeah, I just moved here...

560
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,932
bringing nothing by my hopes
and my dreams.

561
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,958
But sometimes the big city
can be so...

562
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,934
...big.

563
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,533
A girl needs friends, Anton.

564
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,805
Would you like to be my friend?

565
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,448
I didn't know you had such
a beautiful voice.

566
00:39:55,659 --> 00:40:00,119
You know, you and I
have tons in common.

567
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,962
I know what it feels like
to be discriminated against.

568
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,458
I mean, just because a girl
has a healthy sexual appetite,...

569
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,404
doesn't mean
she can't do her job.

570
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,067
They look at you...

571
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,975
and all they see
is a threatening black man.

572
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,879
And they look at me,
and all they see...

573
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,475
are my full breasts
and my narrow waist...

574
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,247
that tapers
to my pert backside.

575
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,652
It's just not fair.

576
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,020
Here you go, folks.
- Yum.

577
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,592
And here's the extra mayonnaise you ordered.
- Yum, yum.

578
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,463
Enjoy.
- This is the best stuff.

579
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,733
Have you eaten here before, Anton?

580
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,738
No, I haven't.
It's my first time.

581
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,603
Oh, take a bite of my sandwich.

582
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,468
Come on, Anton.

583
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,638
Just one little bite.

584
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,021
Scrumptious.

585
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,726
Oh, Anton, I can't wait to see
you in these corduroys.

586
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,793
You're gonna make me blush.

587
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,362
And you might not see it!

588
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,840
May I help you, sir?

589
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,644
Hello, fellow person of color.

590
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,408
How's it going today?

591
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,910
What's going down?
- What are you doing with that girl?

592
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,476
What girl?
- That girl!

593
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,317
Oh, the white woman.

594
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,982
I'm undercover.

595
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,924
When you go undercover, you have
to do things you wouldn't normally do.

596
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,693
No matter how difficult, how dangerous,
how good it might have felt.

597
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,722
Like having sex with white girls?

598
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,996
Damn it, woman,
would you just back off?!

599
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:48,994
Attention angry black man in khakis.

600
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,065
Golly, I must have tripped
or something.

601
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,509
Hi, Ton-ja.

602
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,843
Listen...

603
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:00,180
I was wondering,
do you have any dickies?

604
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,775
'Cause I couldn't find them.

605
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,480
Really?

606
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,456
Perhaps we're all sold out.

607
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,458
Aw, that's too bad.

608
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,050
Come on, Anton.

609
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:15,390
I saw a mock turtleneck at Eddie
Bauer that's perfect for you.

610
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:18,094
Thanks for all your help.
Bye-bye, Ton-ja.

611
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,826
Bye-bye.

612
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,108
And action!

613
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,349
I want you...

614
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,184
to buy my new
fried chicken, that is.

615
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,820
Sure enough.

616
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,655
I used to work for the Pentagon,...

617
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,820
now I help you to get
your chicken on.

618
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,659
And for a limited time only,...

619
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,665
order an eight-piece Nappy Meal,...

620
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,499
and get a 32-ounce
malt liquor absolutely free.

621
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,582
Lord have mercy.

622
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,130
Introducing the Nappy Meal from G.F.C.

623
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,658
This chicken is the bomb.

624
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:31,004
At the General's,
we do chicken right-on!

625
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,440
Will you look at that?

626
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:37,504
The General's lost his damn mind.

627
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,641
He's making a fool
out of himself over this crap.

628
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,185
What?
It's catchy.

629
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,989
Reminds me of the Fresh Prince.

630
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,620
I like him. He raps happy.

631
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,165
Excuse me, sir.
This is a restricted... good God!

632
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,760
Heya, Chiefster. Lance.
- Nice pants.

633
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,270
Undercover Brother?
- Undercover Brother?

634
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,136
What happened to you?
- He had sex with a white girl, that's what!

635
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,439
Was it everything I dreamed of?
It was good.

636
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,139
She had pink nipples?
Big ones.

637
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,374
Yeah, big ones.
- Yeah.

638
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,906
Her carpet matched her drapes?
- Excuse me?

639
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,354
No, man. You can't be doing that.
- What were you doing?

640
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,627
White girl or no white girl,
where the hell have you been?

641
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:26,625
Not there, 'cause that's where people
who swear go. Thank you very much.

642
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,962
You sound like
a 14-year-old white chick.

643
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,934
I don't think so, Sister Girl.

644
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,995
It's Sistah Girl, dude.

645
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,200
Maybe on Planet Ebonics.
But where I come from,...

646
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,607
we like to pronounce
our E's and our R's,...

647
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,406
thank you very much.

648
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,970
E's and R's?

649
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,175
Ebonics, huh?
I be thinking...

650
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,549
that somebody in this room
is selling out.

651
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,451
I say we kill him.
Shut the door, nigga.

652
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,615
Shh, it's gonna be
all right, baby. Don't look!

653
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,921
I'm sorry, dawg, but you need...
Hey, buddy,...

654
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,486
if I hadn't read that article in
Vanity Fair on anger management,...

655
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,499
I'd put away this guava-
mango-broccoli smoothie...

656
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,058
And put my foot in your patootie.
- Patootie?

657
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,002
Now maybe you guys
don't like the new me,...

658
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,005
but I don't give a gosh darn.

659
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,301
For all I care,...

660
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,274
you can all get
the beejeebies out of here.

661
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,607
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must be going.

662
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,135
"Frasier" is on.

663
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,341
"Frasier"?

664
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,048
Beejeebies?

665
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,079
He said he would stick his foot...

666
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,853
up my so-called "patootie."
Damn it.

667
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,519
I knew this could happen.

668
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,826
You can only keep an agent
undercover for so long...

669
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,297
before he loses his identity.

670
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:39,325
Hell, no man can resist
low interest loans...

671
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,496
and non-fat lattes forever.

672
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,130
And white women.

673
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,902
So wait,
let me get this straight.

674
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,466
Whenever a black guy does well,...

675
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,138
starts wearing Dockers,
buys a few Celine Dion records,...

676
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,146
and sleeps with a white chick,
you automatically say he's sold out?

677
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,444
That's enough!

678
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:56,850
Always trying to shut
the white man down.

679
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,048
That's right!
That's right!

680
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,081
Oh, that ain't right.
- What's the word?

681
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,924
I was able to decode
the data from Multinational Inc.

682
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:09,225
The General is under the influence
of a psycho- hallucinogenic drug.

683
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,564
It's a mind control drug, sir.
Very powerful.

684
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,399
Very easy to use.

685
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:16,272
Good Lord.

686
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:20,367
With something like that, The Man could
control every black person in America.

687
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,937
Theoretically, yes, but it would take years
to administer the doses individually.

688
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:27,884
To be efficient, you'd need to
develop a huge distribution system.

689
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,183
The chicken!

690
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,422
I hate to say it,...

691
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,625
if Undercover Brother
don't get his shit together,...

692
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,156
this may be one battle
we might lose to The Man.

693
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:50,229
Smart Brother, am I gonna die?

694
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,251
Honey?
Yeah?

695
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:05,221
Is this Michael Bolton's
version of that thong song?

696
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,120
No, but I want that one.

697
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,786
I hear he got all the funk
that Sisqo missed.

698
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,295
Do you like this?

699
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,456
You know, usually I'm not
into the heavy stuff,...

700
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,625
but this is kinda catchy.

701
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,328
It is, isn't it?
- Yeah.

702
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,399
I made us some sandwiches.
- Extra mayo for me, please.

703
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,312
Freeze, sucka!

704
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,683
Put down the mayonnaise...
slowly.

705
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,449
It's that colored girl, Ton-ja.

706
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,787
Now, Buffy the Black Man Slayer,
step away from the brotha.

707
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,731
Bye, brother.
- Come on.

708
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,734
Bye.
- Move it.

709
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,259
Be careful.
- Let's go.

710
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,603
Why? So you can tell me
what a sellout I am again?

711
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,632
Oh, I don't judge people
by how they dress,...

712
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,701
or what music they listen to.

713
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,771
But I remember a brother
who wasn't afraid to be himself,...

714
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,648
who taught me to follow
my own funky path,...

715
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,982
stand up for
what I think is right.

716
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,951
Remember this?

717
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,794
Ignore her, Anton.

718
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,195
I'm all the single white female
you'll ever need.

719
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,632
I want to. Really, I do.

720
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,501
All day, but I can't.

721
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,535
I must be true to myself.

722
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,044
Look at that white girl.
Are you crazy?

723
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,308
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

724
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,747
Corduroys are so comfortable.

725
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,343
Got to get funky.

726
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,691
I can't throw this away.

727
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,670
'Cause like this medallion...

728
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,640
this brother's here to stay.

729
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,835
What's up, Sistah Girl?
Look at you!

730
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,245
What took you so long?

731
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,307
You don't think the heels are too much?
- No, it's funktabulous.

732
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,114
'Cause I was gonna go...
- Hold it right there...

733
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,644
Undercover Brother.
Drop it!

734
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,553
This woman just can't get...
- I meant the gun.

735
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:39,536
That's White She-Devil,
The Man's secret weapon.

736
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,237
Sorry.

737
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,584
It's time to...
platform out of here.

738
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,988
Damn duck shoes.

739
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,155
Looks like we're in hot water.

740
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,257
Or hot sauce.

741
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,733
Come on!
Come on.

742
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,104
Come on.
It's not fair.

743
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,938
'N Sync!

744
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,443
Backstreet Boys!

745
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,844
And Boyz II Men!
We really sing!

746
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,144
Elton John!
Billie Jean King!

747
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,630
Come on, White She-Devil.
I been waiting.

748
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,063
Come on, baby.
Come on!

749
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,256
No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

750
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,422
Bitch!

751
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,487
You know how much this shit cost?

752
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,328
How much did this shit cost,
you disco queen?!

753
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,831
All of this!
- How dare you!

754
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,570
Touch it. Now looky here.

755
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,614
Toast to the booty!
Booty toast.

756
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,289
Wait! Look at that.

757
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,005
The water's cold.
Water cold!

758
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,848
Nothin' like safe sex,
you know what I'm saying?

759
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,882
Look at that.
Look at that there.

760
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:06,889
Bitch!

761
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,224
You enjoy yourself?

762
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,653
Would you stop fooling around?

763
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,827
Got to get my cool back!

764
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,633
Can you play something funky
for a brother to drive to?

765
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,085
Drive!
Drive this thing!

766
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,020
Baby, it was made in the '70s.

767
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,283
This ain't no Ferrari.

768
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,567
Damn.
Look out, baby.

769
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,440
You should have run
her narrow ass over.

770
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:21,086
So, this has all been
some kind of jive game...

771
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,058
to get me out of the way?
- That's right.

772
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,084
I was sent to destroy you...

773
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,062
and everything
the Brotherhood stands for.

774
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,441
Damn it.

775
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,746
Falling in love with you
wasn't part of the plan.

776
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:57,120
Oh, Undercover Brother,
you're too much man for me.

777
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:02,220
Baby... sometimes I'm too much
man for my own damn self.

778
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,468
Mr. Feather,
your status report, please.

779
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,566
All the pieces of Operation Whitewash
are in place.

780
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,907
Good. It's time
to extend the reach...

781
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:19,211
to black leaders in sports, the arts,
entertainment and business.

782
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,683
Soon all aspects of society...

783
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,879
will once again be dominated
by The Man.

784
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,916
It's time to strike the final blow
against the Brotherhood.

785
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:33,523
So, when I return to the lair,
Undercover Brother better be dead.

786
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,827
Are we clear?
- Very good, sir.

787
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:39,265
With Undercover Brother dead, the
Brotherhood had best step correct,...

788
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,032
or their next move
will be their last.

789
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,370
Goodbye.

790
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,279
Can I ask you something?

791
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,304
Did I just say,

792
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,442
"They had best step correct"?

793
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,418
Yes, sir. You did.

794
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,851
You see what's happening?

795
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,947
You see how we're
being corrupted by their...

796
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,015
hip-and-now fashion,
and their cool slang...

797
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,186
you can't help but use.
"Don't be dissing me!"

798
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,923
No!
- "It's all that!"

799
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,194
You go, girl!
What's the dillio?

800
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,565
Who let the dogs out?

801
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,263
Whatcha talk about, Willis?

802
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,135
You know what I'm saying?!

803
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:19,736
Little by little we're blending
and merging until one day...

804
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,869
we're all going to be
one united people...

805
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,675
living and working
and dancing together,...

806
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:28,343
like the news or "Ally McBeal,"
or the people that work at Saturn!

807
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,081
And we've got to stop it
before it's too late!

808
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:40,592
You heard The Man. As of now,
Operation Whitewash goes global.

809
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,738
Jay-Z is doing Lawrence Welk's
Greatest Hits?!

810
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,971
John Singleton to remake
"Driving Miss Daisy"?!

811
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,946
Terry McMillan?
"How Stella Got Her White Man Back"?

812
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:59,778
Double damn it!

813
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,444
Black people all over
the world are losing their damn minds.

814
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,952
And look...

815
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,582
they've all been exposed
to the General's fried chicken.

816
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,285
Smart Brother, how's it coming
with this antidote?

817
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,624
I found one. But it only works
on one person at a time.

818
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,823
We have to stop
this thing at the source.

819
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,795
Undercover Brother, you're back!

820
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,707
Hell's wrong with you bringing
a white girl in my house?

821
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,473
She's working with us now, Chief.

822
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:33,706
With my extensive and intimate
knowledge of The Man's organization,...

823
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,843
I can help you stop his evil plan.

824
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,477
Okay.

825
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,148
Smart Brother,
take White She-Devil to the lab...

826
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,851
and find out exactly
what she knows.

827
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,054
You know, you're cute in
a Theo Huxtable kind of way.

828
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,494
Really? Usually I get Al Roker.

829
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,158
"Here's what's happening
in your neck of the woods."

830
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,566
Chief, various brother agents,
I owe all of you a huge apology.

831
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,096
I just watched this show...

832
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,166
"Roots"?
Maybe you've heard of it?

833
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,203
It taught me such
a profound lesson about bigotry.

834
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:07,114
I have sat on the sidelines
of race relations long enough.

835
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,950
I want to march down
that field of oppression...

836
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:17,483
and kick that ball of bigotry right
over the goalpost of intolerance.

837
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,323
Son, you talk a lot of shit.
- Yes, I do.

838
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,360
But you down.

839
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,832
What?
Are you kidding?

840
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,001
You're going to let the white boy
join just like that?

841
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,237
I was in secret agent school
for three years!

842
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,508
Three years.
I paid for them classes myself.

843
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,175
You made me.
- Chief. Chief.

844
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,081
I performed a full range
spectral analysis...

845
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,949
on Miss White She-Devil's
brain waves.

846
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:48,687
Then, I unlocked her subconscious
using a special form of hypnosis.

847
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,590
Then, I gently brushed her hair.

848
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,596
Then, I reached deep within...

849
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:58,360
her tight little pockets and I found
a list of The Man's targets.

850
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,459
Good Lord.

851
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,801
They're going after James Brown
tomorrow night at the Grammys.

852
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,569
We need to stop him.
Find the General and give him the antidote.

853
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,076
That's right.
It's goin' to the streets. Hey, y'all!

854
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,102
It's revolution up in this bitch!

855
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,444
Set the alarm to def-con five!

856
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,382
It's on, baby. It's on.

857
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,578
Good work, White She-Devil.
- Thanks.

858
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,248
Oh, you in too.
What the fuck?! Chief!

859
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,656
I never see that bitch
in my secret agent classes!

860
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,626
I'm still paying the loans off, man!

861
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,128
I sleep on a pissy mattress.

862
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,789
I ain't got good food to eat!

863
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,957
I borrow money for my weed!

864
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,797
I quit.
That's it.

865
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,804
Y'all don't got Conspiracy Brother
Jones to kick around anymore!

866
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:38,102
Give me a pillow case!
I'm joining the Klan.

867
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,605
Brother, we all love
your solo enthusiasm,...

868
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:43,805
but this is about
working together.

869
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,007
Now, I've been a solo star
shooting the shots...

870
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,142
that I thought
would win the game.

871
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:51,910
But in workin' with y'all,
I've come to realize...

872
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,446
that only a team wins
a championship.

873
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,923
Teamwork! That's right.

874
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,259
That's right.
I'm sorry, everybody.

875
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,093
Teamwork!
Now, let's go!

876
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,962
Hustle, hustle!
Come on, white girl!

877
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,608
Best of luck tonight.

878
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,273
Have a great time.

879
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,782
We know The Man plans
to make his move tonight.

880
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,444
Now, Lance,
we're counting on you.

881
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,612
Don't get distracted,
be focused.

882
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:27,350
Stick close to the target
at all times.

883
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,153
Roger. Will do.

884
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,640
Ladies and gentlemen, James Brown.

885
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,213
How you doing?
- James Brown.

886
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,546
I want to see my fans.
- No, it's okay.

887
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,245
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

888
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,116
Perimeter search.
I'm on it.

889
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,246
What is that boy doing?

890
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,892
What's going on here?
- Hey, Jimmy.

891
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,919
What?

892
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,228
Now, I feel good.

893
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,234
God, man!

894
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:13,963
Lance. Lance!

895
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,971
The hardest working man
in show business.

896
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,799
Go get him.

897
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:26,513
Thank you, James Brown.

898
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,776
No! Hey!
I just got promoted!

899
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,754
Hello, Mr. James Brown.

900
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:43,925
Hello-ooo, Mr. James Brown.

901
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,328
Good God!

902
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,467
You will soon be administered
a drug that will make you...

903
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,415
The signal's stopped.

904
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,180
It's James Brown touchdown!

905
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,244
That's James Brown?
- That's mustard.

906
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,587
I can't believe I let him
get away. I am so stupid.

907
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,753
You got to stop
beating yourself up.

908
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,093
We got to work together
as a team, okay?

909
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,031
Yeah, man.
Let the team do it.

910
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,099
I'm playin' with him.

911
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,264
Stop playin'.

912
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,433
Damn.

913
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,800
You need to lighten up.

914
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,040
You know what I'm sayin'?

915
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,378
Just be careful with this.
If you smoke too much,...

916
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,611
it's going to have you
all paranoid and shit.

917
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:37,915
It takes time to build up
a tolerance like mine...

918
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,717
What? Did you hear that?

919
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,815
Hey, y'all,
did you hear something?

920
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,258
Shh, quiet!
There it goes again.

921
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,435
Incoming vehicle!

922
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,131
Don't you move!
- Hold it!

923
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,037
Don't you move!

924
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:02,636
Identify yourself!
- I'm with Island Fortress Cleaning Service, sir.

925
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,703
Oh, okay.
Thank you.

926
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,238
You so sweet.
- Just the janitors.

927
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,773
Let 'em through!

928
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,802
Lance. Lance!

929
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,766
So, Mr. Godfather of Soul...

930
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,839
life as you've known it
will soon cease to exist.

931
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,717
Sorry.

932
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,484
Any final requests?

933
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,593
Say it loud.

934
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,425
Say it loud!

935
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,228
What's he doing?

936
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,002
Say it loud!

937
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,438
Say it loud!

938
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,010
Say it loud!

939
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,955
Say it loud!
- I'm black and I'm proud!

940
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,195
Hey, man, I want to get up
and do my thing now.

941
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,609
I feel good.

942
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,542
It's time for the big payback.

943
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,347
Very clever, Mr. Undercover Brother.

944
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,481
Can you dig it?

945
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,621
Everything we'll need
to take it to The Man.

946
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,027
Hey, this isn't Taco Bell.

947
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,557
Can you find out
where the General is?

948
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,396
Just give me 10 minutes.

949
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,002
You've got one.

950
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,567
Intruders!

951
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,235
The Brotherhood has breached
the communications room!

952
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:17,041
Everything's a party over here
with you people, isn't it?

953
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,139
That's not all.
The Man is on his way here.

954
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,979
What? Now?

955
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,953
His helicopter will be here
in five minutes.

956
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,419
Mr. Elias,
would you kindly take care...

957
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:31,085
of the nuisance
in the communication room?

958
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:33,254
Yes, sir.
Come on, let's go!

959
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,025
Yes, sir.
Right away.

960
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,589
What have you done with the General?
- General?

961
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,464
Could you come in here, please?

962
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,731
General, if it's not
too much of a bother,...

963
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,901
would you mind terribly,
killing this man?

964
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,305
Thank you.

965
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,643
So I can always have something
to remember you by.

966
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,416
Come on, hurry up.

967
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,383
I wouldn't move if I were you.

968
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,723
Damn!
Oh, shit.

969
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,352
Get off of me.
- Sorry.

970
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,625
Excellent work,
White She-Devil.

971
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,928
Come here, baby.

972
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,833
Damn, that girl gets around.

973
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,505
How can you do this to me?

974
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:28,446
Once you've had Undercover Brother,
there is no other.

975
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,119
No, it's once you go black,
you don't go back.

976
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:37,057
It's the honky patrol.

977
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,526
Let me do this.

978
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,029
Ah, look who got the gun now.

979
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,724
Yeah. What's up?!
- Hi.

980
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:43,857
Shut up!
- What?

981
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:46,197
I said shut up, whitey!
I got the power.

982
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,935
Keep working.

983
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,964
This is a girl thing.

984
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,447
Breakdance.
- Break, what?

985
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,354
I said, breakdance.
Come on.

986
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,948
Take it!

987
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,459
That's right.
That's good.

988
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,223
Come on.
Kid 'n Play.

989
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,991
Kid and who?
- Come on.

990
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,496
That's right.
Getting funky.

991
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,132
Oh, yeah.

992
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,038
I like black people.

993
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,711
Oh, fight.

994
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:34,079
Watch yourself.
Show 'em what you're working with.

995
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:40,151
White She-Devil, represent!

996
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,662
I got him.

997
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,823
I got him!
Vector four, section seven.

998
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:54,025
Come on, General,
you got to give me that gun.

999
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,602
Nonsense!
General, kill him!

1000
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:11,781
Undercover Brother, are you okay?

1001
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,812
Everything's cool
now that you're here.

1002
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:18,149
Y'all gonna make me lose
my mind up in here!

1003
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,631
See what I've been dealing with?

1004
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:24,132
Yeah.

1005
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,797
Situation complete.
We'll see you soon, Chief.

1006
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,371
Atomic core, eh?

1007
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,668
Let's see what this so-called
button does.

1008
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,947
Attention,
atomic core set to overload.

1009
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,544
My bad.

1010
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,487
Here, General, take the antidote.

1011
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,851
Oh, what happened to me?

1012
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,690
Damn!

1013
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:58,393
You guys get the General out of here.
I'm going after The Man.

1014
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:01,426
Let's get while
the getting's good.

1015
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,994
There'll be another day
to fight The Man.

1016
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,029
We can't give The Man
another damn day!

1017
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:08,271
But Sistah Girl's right.
We got to get the hell out of here, man.

1018
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,210
We're gonna die!
We're all gonna die!

1019
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,737
Dig it! Dig it hard!
- Daddy!

1020
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:15,375
There's times for falling apart,
and there's times for getting funky.

1021
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,612
This is one of those funky times!

1022
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,917
So, what's it going to be?!

1023
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,719
Are you ready to play
some funky music, white boy?

1024
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,292
Solid.

1025
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,994
Lay down the boogie.

1026
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,964
It's time to take it to The Man.

1027
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,907
I guess this means you
and I are like brothers now, huh?

1028
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,807
I feel black.

1029
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,142
Man, you look white!

1030
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,546
Don't touch me!

1031
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,049
Come on, General.
Let's go.

1032
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,812
Let's go!
Let's get out of here!

1033
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,786
Come on!
- Go. Come on, nigga.

1034
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:56,584
Atomic core overload in five minutes.

1035
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,923
Please exit in an orderly fashion.

1036
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,485
Stop him!

1037
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:20,177
Earth, wind and fire!

1038
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,978
Shaquille O'Neal!

1039
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:26,852
Sisqo!
- No-ooo!

1040
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,462
I just bought those.

1041
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,024
Sorry about that.

1042
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:54,779
It's all over, man!

1043
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,586
You want some drama?

1044
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,454
Then bring it.

1045
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:06,759
Lance, protect the General
at all costs.

1046
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:10,356
Atomic core overload in three minutes.

1047
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,798
Let me talk to them.
I'm white.

1048
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,040
We don't want any trouble.

1049
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,838
What are you going
to do about it?

1050
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,811
Sissy.

1051
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:29,707
I am not a sissy!

1052
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,259
Come on!

1053
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,344
Lance.

1054
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:05,080
He shouldn't have called me a sissy.

1055
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,617
Not bad, whitey.

1056
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,650
But if it was me, I would have ripped
his spine out of his ass!

1057
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:16,131
Let's go! We got less than a minute
before this place blows!

1058
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,083
General, sir, are you all right?
- Yes.

1059
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,992
There he is!
Undercover Brother!

1060
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,928
He's only got a few seconds!

1061
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:27,887
You mess with the 'fro,
you got to go.

1062
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,881
I believe this belongs to me.

1063
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,767
So long, Undercover Brother.

1064
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,928
He's failed me.

1065
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,097
Leave him.

1066
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:47,131
Hey! Don't be dissing me!

1067
01:15:56,718 --> 01:16:00,085
Hey! Let me in!

1068
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,585
Let me up!

1069
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,406
That Feather went out like a sucka.

1070
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,411
Punk ass bitch played himself.

1071
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,709
Let's bounce, dawg.

1072
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,808
No! He doesn't have
his parachute!

1073
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,395
Come on over here. Hug me.

1074
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:36,416
Undercover Brother, you the baddest.

1075
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:38,942
Didn't I blow
your mind this time?

1076
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,386
Didn't I?

1077
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:43,050
Didn't you cause about a bazillion
dollars worth of damage?

1078
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,956
And I sure as hell ain't
covering for you!

1079
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,654
I don't give a damn
how sexy you look...

1080
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,094
floating down in your little pants!

1081
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,360
And as for the rest of you...

1082
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,762
I just want to say...

1083
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,773
how very proud I am
of all of you.

1084
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:05,010
Undercover Brother, the world is
safe once again thanks to you.

1085
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,571
No thanks to me, Chief.

1086
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,413
I couldn't have done it
without Sistah Girl.

1087
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,214
You know what they say,

1088
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,380
"Behind every great black man..."

1089
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:16,050
Is the police.

1090
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,059
A bunch of slow white athletes?

1091
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:19,219
No.
- A cute butt?

1092
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,729
Probable cause?
- No!

1093
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,357
A strong black woman.

1094
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,264
Strong black woman.
- That's right.

1095
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,700
Oh, yeah.

1096
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:31,329
It would've been cool to have a
Latino, a Native American, Asian,...

1097
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,807
even a Jewish guy in the mix.

1098
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:37,805
The point is, by working together
as one, we got the job done.

1099
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:41,509
No doubt, that's what
the Brotherhood is all about.

1100
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,015
Solid.

1101
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,817
Look out, y'all,
fallin' rocks!

1102
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:50,916
Shotgun!

1103
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:53,359
Having stopped Operation Whitewash,...

1104
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:57,627
the Brotherhood distributed
an antidote to the mind control drug...

1105
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,258
to black people nationwide.

1106
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,098
And though The Man escaped,...

1107
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,331
the Brotherhood had found their hero.

1108
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,305
Thanks to Undercover Brother,...

1109
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,503
the world was once again
a funky place.

1110
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:38,771
Damn, who is that?

1111
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:41,213
Hold that thought
and that feelin', baby.

1112
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,513
Just let it percolate.
I'll be right back.

1113
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,281
Hurry up, baby.

1114
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,257
Hi.

1115
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:56,695
Uh, White She-Devil,
what you doing here?

1116
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:59,131
Remember? You told me
to come over.

1117
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:03,136
And me and you and Sistah Girl
could make Oreos.

1118
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:05,638
Sweet and black on both sides...

1119
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:09,074
with a dreamy white filling
in the middle.

1120
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,442
Then I realized...
you can't make Oreos.

1121
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,538
So, I bought some.

1122
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,050
Some people got jungle fever.
She got the flu.

1123
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,749
You know.
- U.B.!
