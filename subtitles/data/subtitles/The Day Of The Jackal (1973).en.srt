00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,434
August, 1962,
was a stormy time for France.

3
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:31,533
Many people felt that
President Charles de Gaulle...

4
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,015
had betrayed the country
by giving independence to Algeria.

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,814
Extremists, mostly from the army...

6
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:41,720
swore to kill him in revenge.

7
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,555
They banded together
in an underground movement...

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,564
and called themselves the OAS.

9
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,275
The ministers meeting is over!

10
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,665
They are very late.

11
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:22,872
The time elapsed from the first
to the last shot was seven seconds.

12
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:27,317
In all, more than 140 shots were fired.

13
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:30,049
Several bullets pierced the presidents car.

14
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,615
One came within an inch of his head.

15
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:37,893
But, as if by a miracle, neither
he nor anyone else was hurt.

16
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:40,735
Six months later..

17
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:45,141
Most of the conspirators
have been caught and tried.

18
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,045
Their leader, Col. Bastien-Thiry,
has been sentenced to death.

19
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:54,075
At the last moment, his lawyer
tries for a stay of execution.

20
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:13,244
The appeal for clemency has been turned down.

21
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:15,873
There is nothing more one can do.

22
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,351
- I am sorry.
- There is no need.

23
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,187
For heavens sake, don't you
realize you're going to be shot?

24
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,692
You don't understand.

25
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:28,493
No French soldier is going
to raise his rifle against me.

26
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:42,541
Here is the 8.00 news for today, March 11, 1963.

27
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:46,418
An hour ago, in the courtyard
of the Fort Efree, outside Paris...

28
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,426
Lieutenant Colonel Bastien-Thiry
was executed by firing squad...

29
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:54,363
for leading the attempt on the life
of General de Gaulle last August.

30
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,697
The OAS now seems completely demoralized...

31
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:00,331
by the splendid performance
of our national security forces.

32
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:03,809
Already it is known that the new
chief of operations of the OAS...

33
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:07,315
Colonel Mark Rodin, a former
paratroop commander in Algeria...

34
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:11,149
is on the run and hiding somewhere in Austria.

35
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,418
Todays execution must surely mean
that the OAS is finished...

36
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:16,790
once and for all.

37
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,334
What are the finances like, Rene?

38
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:31,605
No wonder our people are giving up.
They've lost faith.

39
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:33,649
We've failed them every single time.

40
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,811
- We won't fail again!
- What can we do?

41
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:38,913
- We're paralyzed.
- Every cop in France knows us.

42
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:44,362
- Informants are all around us.
- We must find a foreigner.

43
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,266
- A foreigner? Why?
- A contract killer.

44
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:51,738
One that hasn't worked in France
won't have a police record.

45
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,902
- He can come and go as he pleases.
- That sort of person costs money.

46
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:57,479
Yes.

47
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:01,076
I'll find the right man.

48
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,980
They were going to meet again
in three months in Vienna.

49
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:09,691
In the pension you both know..
Pension Kleist. June 15.

50
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,624
It's a limited market.

51
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,664
I've compiled 11 dossiers over the last three months.

52
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:18,463
Only those four men seemed anywhere near right.

53
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:21,631
Now that you've read the files, what do you think?

54
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:23,971
- One Englishman did all these jobs?
- I don't believe it.

55
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:27,138
- It's true.
- He did that fellow in the Congo?

56
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:31,152
- And Trujillo?
- That's our man then, isn't it?

57
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,654
I should say so.

58
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,624
I'm glad you agree on the final choice.

59
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:38,855
- Because he'll be here any moment.
- What?

60
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,660
He's arriving this afternoon from London.

61
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:11,236
Wolenski.

62
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:22,815
A normal precaution, you understand. Come in.

63
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:36,730
We are not terrorists, you understand.
We are patriots.

64
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:39,603
Our duty is to the soldiers
who died fighting in Algeria...

65
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:42,509
and the three million Frenchmen
who have always lived there.

66
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,912
So you want to get rid of him?

67
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,515
Speaking as a professional, do you think its possible?

68
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:54,690
It's possible. The point is getting away with it.

69
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,355
Speaking as a professional,
that's an important consideration.

70
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,196
But, in principle, you'd say it could be done?

71
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:05,705
Yes. With enough time and planning.

72
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,040
Would be much more difficult than most other targets.

73
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:12,777
- Why more?
- de Gaulle has the best security.

74
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,650
Their information is first-class.

75
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:18,817
You see, gentlemen, not only
have your own efforts failed...

76
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:20,952
but you've queered the pitch for everyone else.

77
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,625
- How dare you suggest-
- You can't afford to be emotional.

78
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,693
It's why you've made so many mistakes.

79
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:29,705
But if we decided to employ a professional-

80
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:31,708
You have to employ a professional.

81
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,835
Your organization is so riddled with informers...

82
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:37,006
that nothing you decide is a secret for long.

83
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:40,411
The job would have to be done by an outsider.

84
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:43,753
The only question is by whom and for how much?

85
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,588
Will you do it?

86
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,097
Yes.

87
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,499
- How much?
- This is a once-in-a-lifetime job.

88
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,595
- I could never work again.
- How much do you want?

89
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:56,436
- Half a million, in cash.
- What?

90
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,500
Half in advance and half on completion.

91
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:01,638
- Half a million francs?
- Dollars.

92
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,480
- Are you mad?
- You'll get France in return.

93
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:06,543
I'd have thought it a reasonable price.

94
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:10,957
If you can't manage it,
there's nothing more to be said.

95
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:12,221
We accept.

96
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,961
- How many people know about this?
- Just the four of us.

97
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:23,338
Let's keep it that way.
This job depends on absolute secrecy.

98
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,071
No notes must be kept.

99
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,910
If any one of you is captured,
I shall feel free to call it off.

100
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:31,544
I suggest you stay in a safe place
under guard until the work is done.

101
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,590
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

102
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:37,787
The planning will be mine.
No one else will get the details...

103
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:39,921
and you will hear nothing from me again.

104
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:42,967
This is the name and account
number of my bank in Switzerland.

105
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,062
When they tell me the first
$250,000 has been deposited...

106
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,631
I'll move, provided I'm ready.

107
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:53,010
- I'll not be hurried in any way.
- Agreed.

108
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,346
All I want from you is a telephone number in Paris...

109
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:58,013
that I could call about changes in de Gaulles plans.

110
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,922
The contact mustn't know
who I am or what this is about.

111
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:03,722
- Send me the number by mail.
- How do you expect us to find...

112
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:06,959
- half a million dollars so soon?
- Use your network to rob banks.

113
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,058
One last thing.

114
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,741
What code name will you use?

115
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,577
- Why not the Jackal?
- Why not?

116
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:23,419
From now on, you'll be working
completely alone.

117
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:28,426
Not completely. One will have
the cooperation of de Gaulle.

118
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:32,932
He won't listen to his security
and stay out of the public eye.

119
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:37,435
A pleasant journey home, Mr. -
Mr. Jackal.

120
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:19,581
960,000 francs?
This has got to stop!

121
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,424
You're the Chief of Action Service.

122
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:24,159
You've had three weeks to find out
if the OAS is behind this.

123
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:27,329
- If they are, what are they up to?
- It is the OAS, General.

124
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:30,772
But the ones we've caught are small fry.

125
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:33,606
They've been ordered to do it,
but they don't know why.

126
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,011
The minister has been after me again.

127
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,608
We've questioned known OAS people.
They know nothing.

128
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,280
- Not even the high echelons.
- What about the informers?

129
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:43,951
Nothing. But we found out this morning...

130
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:46,620
that Rodin and the other two are in Rome.

131
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,789
They arrived on June 18.

132
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:51,300
They've taken the two top floors
in the Hotel Garibaldi.

133
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:54,430
- You're watching them?
- Twenty-four hours a day.

134
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,952
Birth certificate, please.
Paul Oliver Duggan.

135
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:31,965
Born in the parish of
Sambourne Fishley, April 3, 1929.

136
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,901
Fill in the form. You'll find the 1929s up those stairs...

137
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,030
- and left at the first gallery.
- Right. Thanks.

138
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,271
Thank you, sir.

139
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:29,648
Excuse me, please.
How many krone to the pound?

140
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,812
The official parity rate is 19.34.

141
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,572
Hello.
Two bottles of Hairpin, please.

142
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:54,912
One in chestnut brown and one in gray.

143
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,221
I've only got Clairol, dear.

144
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,853
That's fine. And also a tin of solvent.

145
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:17,541
- It is here.
- Is it?

146
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,397
Hello.

147
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:34,058
Yes.

148
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:36,160
Hello, Zurich?

149
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:38,536
Mr. Kola, this is he.

150
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:42,567
That's right. Account number 50664.

151
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,841
The moneys been deposited.

152
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,348
How much?

153
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,039
Attention please.

154
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:10,707
Air Italia announces the departure
of Flight 127 to Genova.

155
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,250
Now boarding at Gate 5.

156
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,610
The Hotel Garibaldi is owned
by a Frenchman with OAS sympathies.

157
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:39,413
Extra Action Service staff have
been sent from Paris to Rome...

158
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:42,182
to keep watching them around the clock.

159
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:49,060
Rodin, Montclair and Casson live at the top floor alone.

160
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:51,259
On the next floor down are the bodyguards:

161
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:54,100
ex-paratroopers or foreign legionnaires.

162
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,072
- How many?
- Eight.

163
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,234
Theyre afraid of being kidnapped.

164
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,836
I know Rodin. He's not a man to be afraid.

165
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:04,112
The lift doors on the top floor are welded together...

166
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,517
and everything has to go through the bodyguards.

167
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:10,184
Not one of them has set a foot
outside the hotel for five weeks.

168
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,024
The only contact with the outside world is one man:

169
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:15,930
- Adjutant Wolenski.
- Tell me about him.

170
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,935
Bersie, run the film, please.

171
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:25,135
This is Wolenski.

172
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:28,114
He goes to the post office
every morning and afternoon.

173
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:37,488
See that? You'll have to cut his
hand off to get the mail from him.

174
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,840
He always waits until the collection van arrives...

175
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:55,110
before he posts any letters.

176
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,618
Then he picks up the mail.

177
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,257
All their mail comes to general delivery...

178
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,826
and is addressed in the name of Partrier.

179
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:13,898
Wolenski, of course, can identify himself as such.

180
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:19,605
Colonel Rolland here.

181
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:23,552
I want everything you've got on a foreign legionnaire.

182
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:26,989
- His name is Viktor Wolenski.
- If the OAS is planning something...

183
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,722
then their agents must be working on it now.

184
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:32,788
You must find out who they are
and where they make contact.

185
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,265
I let myself in.

186
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:03,137
I'll make us some coffee.

187
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,443
Denise.

188
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:13,875
I ask you to get rid of these for your own safety.

189
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:16,388
I'll do it tonight.

190
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:18,823
Maybe I should do it for you now.

191
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:23,722
They know all about your fiancé.

192
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:38,013
I have an assignment for you
that sounds very important.

193
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:40,349
It's not very pleasant.

194
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:42,990
Go on.

195
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:52,792
They want you to get involved
with an Elysee Palace official...

196
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,308
someone fairly close to de Gaulle.

197
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,208
It might be dangerous.

198
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,907
It's certainly distasteful.

199
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,455
- Who is this official?
- I'll show him to you in a week.

200
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:41,292
- Good afternoon.
- Yes, please come in.

201
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,306
- You think you can do it?
- Certainly.

202
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:51,208
I can take an existing gun, make the modifications.

203
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:54,611
It must be very light in weight,
and it must have a short barrel.

204
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:58,642
A short barrel. That's a pity.

205
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,852
Lastly, there must be a silencer
and a telescopic sight.

206
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,799
Over what range will you fire?

207
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:12,805
I'm not sure yet, but probably
not more than 400 feet.

208
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:16,139
- Will the gentleman be moving?
- Stationary.

209
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,442
Will you go for a head shot or a chest shot?

210
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,073
Probably head.

211
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,085
What about the chances of a second shot?

212
00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:25,917
I might get the chance, but I doubt it.

213
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:28,151
I'll need a silencer to escape.

214
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:32,627
Then you'd better have explosive bullets.

215
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:36,966
- I can prepare a handful for you.
- Glycerin or mercury?

216
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,632
Mercury, I think.

217
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,975
It's much cleaner.

218
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:47,039
- More Campari?
- No, thank you.

219
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:50,315
It seems then, the gun must be
carried past Customs...

220
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,413
without arousing suspicion.

221
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,663
Recognize that?

222
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,527
The whole thing should be composed of a series...

223
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,200
of hollow aluminium tubes which screw together.

224
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:09,734
The top one holds the rifle strut.

225
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:12,840
The one below, the bolt with the breech inside it.

226
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:15,818
The shoulder rest of the rifle
doubles for both purposes...

227
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:18,356
- without changing in any way.
- That's excellent.

228
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:21,792
The last two sections house
the telescopic sight and silencer.

229
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:23,296
Here.

230
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:29,095
It's very remarkable.
It's so simple.

231
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:31,538
I shall need the gun in about two weeks.

232
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,079
If you could meet me here August 13...

233
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:39,778
then you could try out the gun
and discuss last minute details.

234
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,342
Very well. August 13.

235
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,753
Now the question of your fee.

236
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:54,828
I have to ask a fee of 1,000$
for this kind of a job, you see...

237
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:56,999
and, say...

238
00:25:57,074 --> 00:26:01,307
another 100$ or 200$ for the raw materials.

239
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,349
Done.

240
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:08,116
I'll pay you half the fee now and the rest on delivery.

241
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:43,600
What do you think?
Marvelous, eh?

242
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,900
I knew you didn't come to Genova
for a driver's license.

243
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,374
Anyone in London could've done that.

244
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,709
The problem is I won't have time
to play around with makeup.

245
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,410
- I'm not much good at it anyway.
- Forget about makeup.

246
00:26:56,485 --> 00:27:00,320
The important thing is the skin.
It must look gray and tired.

247
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,794
We used a trick in the army to
fake illness and get out of duty.

248
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:08,629
- Can you get some cordite?
- I suppose so.

249
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,636
You swallow a couple of small pieces of cordite.

250
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:15,197
Itll make you feel sick and turn the skin a gray color.

251
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:17,745
After about an hour, you'll feel all right again.

252
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:21,146
- Your skin'll look gray longer.
- I'll try it.

253
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:26,680
- What about the French documents?
- French identity cards all right.

254
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:29,489
The other one, I don't think
I've seen what they look like...

255
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,994
let alone copy it.

256
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:33,464
I'll get a colleague in France to pick someone's pocket...

257
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,002
so I can make a duplicate.

258
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,905
Give me more time, more money.

259
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,533
How much more?

260
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,842
Five hundred.

261
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,849
Three hundred pounds?

262
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:52,657
- Half now, half on delivery.
- When will I hear from you?

263
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:55,193
I'll be returning to Genova on August 14.

264
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:59,029
Be in the same place where we met tonight at 6:00.

265
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,193
Must be a big job you've got.

266
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:03,636
There are certain things I wish to make clear.

267
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,971
When you've finished, you will
hand over the negatives...

268
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,806
and all the prints of the photographs you've taken.

269
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:10,710
You will also forget the name of Duggan...

270
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:14,343
and the name on the French
documents you're going to produce.

271
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,354
Is that understood?

272
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:48,743
Taking it easy?
I wish I had your job.

273
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,188
All my tenants are on holiday.
What time is it?

274
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:55,022
- Half past 5:00.
- I must hurry.

275
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:57,029
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

276
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:57,351
That's him. See?

277
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,086
In the light coat. He's the Elysee Palace official.

278
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,458
Hell pack his wife and children off to the Loire Valley...

279
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:06,930
for the annual holiday.

280
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,968
You haven't got much time.

281
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:12,565
I need Wolenski.

282
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,508
Arrange to get him across the border.

283
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,639
What? Never mind the Italian government.

284
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:21,308
Once he's inside France...

285
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:24,183
bring him to Paris immediately.

286
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,682
You're being very foolish, Viktor.

287
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:22,695
You know yourself, they always talk in the end.

288
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:27,498
You've seen it with your own
two eyes in Indo-China.

289
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:32,505
And in Algeria, of course.

290
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:38,682
Tell us what they're waiting for in that hotel!

291
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:53,360
What are they planning?
Who have they been meeting with?

292
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:57,704
Nobody? Not a soul?

293
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:03,273
Then where were they before they went to Rome?

294
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:08,147
Tell us, Viktor.

295
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:18,832
Go back a bit.

296
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:20,997
Hold it. Stop.

297
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:28,414
Question: Rome, Viktor.
Why did they go to Rome?

298
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:30,951
- No answer.
- Check.

299
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,614
Question:
Why are they in Rome?

300
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,819
- Answer: Secret.
- Check.

301
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:40,797
Question: Where did they stay in Vienna, Viktor?

302
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:42,800
- No answer.
- Check.

303
00:35:42,868 --> 00:35:44,803
Was it a house?

304
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:49,673
I am asking you, was it a house?

305
00:35:49,744 --> 00:35:52,270
Answer:

306
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:55,318
K- K-Kleist.

307
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,326
Go on.

308
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:08,824
Question: Who is Kleist?
What does he do?

309
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:15,738
What did they do to the bastard?
I can't understand a word.

310
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:17,676
- Put it on the speakers.
- Where from, sir?

311
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:20,012
"Who is Kleist?"
That bit.

312
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:27,017
Who is Kleist?
What does he do?

313
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:42,701
Jack? Jackie?
Would that be Jackie?

314
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,215
Jackie?
That's not possible.

315
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:47,717
Go back, and this time turn up the sound.

316
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:16,846
Heel, Rex! Rex, come here!

317
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:32,373
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

318
00:37:32,444 --> 00:37:35,039
Do you want me to call for an ambulance?

319
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:40,219
- Are you sure?
- I'll survive.

320
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:44,720
There. See?

321
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:50,066
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, my dear.

322
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,166
- Sorry to drag you away, Colonel.
- Nonsense.

323
00:37:57,243 --> 00:38:00,236
The tape is on your machine
in case you want to refer back...

324
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:03,010
and here is the transcript.

325
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:24,130
Jackal.

326
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:27,428
I thought Wolenski used it as a swear word...

327
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,436
but it doesn't sound like him.

328
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:33,140
Fair.

329
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:40,484
Excuse me, Colonel. The foreigner-

330
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,646
Could it be a fair foreigner?
A blonde?

331
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,129
Is Kleist the foreigner?

332
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:59,001
Colonel, its 4:30.

333
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,289
The plot described above constitutes, in my view...

334
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:15,296
the most dangerous single conception...

335
00:39:15,364 --> 00:39:19,131
that the terrorists could possibly have devised...

336
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:22,969
to endanger the life of President de Gaulle.

337
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,943
If the plot exists as described...

338
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:30,881
and if a foreign-born assassin,
whose code name may be "Jackal"....

339
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,479
has, in fact, been engaged
for this attempt on the life-

340
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:38,994
- Sorry.
- On the life of the president...

341
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:42,589
it is my duty to inform you,
Minister, that in my opinion...

342
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:45,659
we face a national emergency.

343
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:47,831
New paragraph.

344
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:52,003
The above report is top secret
and intended for your eyes only.

345
00:39:52,078 --> 00:39:55,014
Written at 0800 hours...

346
00:39:55,082 --> 00:39:58,883
August 14, 1963.

347
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:02,447
Address to the Minister of the Interior.

348
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,689
Have the dispatch rider stand by...

349
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:08,028
and forget everything you've heard.

350
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:15,010
- Well?
- If what Rolland says is true...

351
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:20,218
the whole network of our agents
inside the OAS is no good to us.

352
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:26,892
The president must be told.

353
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:29,403
I'll ask for an interview.

354
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:31,565
Get me the Elysee Palace.

355
00:41:55,372 --> 00:41:57,967
Minister.
One moment, sir.

356
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,973
The Minister of the Interior.

357
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,502
There you are.

358
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:27,070
It's all there.

359
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:32,285
The driving license and the French
identity card were easy enough...

360
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:36,757
but that third card was a big headache.

361
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:39,260
It's nicely dog-eared, isn't it?

362
00:42:40,663 --> 00:42:43,292
- Have you forgotten something?
- Sorry?

363
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:48,102
The original driving license I said I wanted back.

364
00:42:49,842 --> 00:42:52,073
I thought we might have a chat about that.

365
00:42:57,185 --> 00:43:00,314
The fact is, the original driving license is not here.

366
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:03,723
But don't worry. It's put away in a very safe place.

367
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:06,388
Nobody can get at it but me.

368
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:11,232
- What do you want?
- I'm coming to that.

369
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:14,069
What I propose is simply a little trade.

370
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:16,439
I give you the original driving license...

371
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,241
and all those negatives I took of you...

372
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:21,249
for a certain sum of money.

373
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:23,785
- How much?
- A thousand pounds.

374
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:28,417
Isn't it worth that to get those documents back?

375
00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:31,326
I suppose so.

376
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:35,095
An English gentleman can always
be trusted to see sense.

377
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:39,105
I can find the first 500 by noon
tomorrow, but we don't meet here.

378
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:40,937
There's nothing wrong with this place.

379
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:42,943
It's very quiet and private.

380
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:45,105
There's everything wrong with this place.

381
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:49,949
Forget about that. Nobody comes
here unless they're invited by me.

382
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,959
One has to be very discreet,
you know, in my little sideline.

383
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:38,952
- I asked for aluminium.
- I tried the aluminium...

384
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,294
but it bent like tissue paper.

385
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:43,960
I had to use stainless steel.

386
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:46,630
But its all right. It looks the same.

387
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:50,473
- Where can I practice?
- There's the Montemorro Forest.

388
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:52,478
You could be there and back in a day.

389
00:45:52,546 --> 00:45:55,311
- Excuse me.
- I won't need the case.

390
00:45:55,383 --> 00:45:57,318
Silencer, please.

391
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,085
Strut.

392
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:10,429
- And the sniper scope.
- Here.

393
00:46:15,843 --> 00:46:17,607
Trigger.

394
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:19,271
Trigger, please.

395
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:42,139
Beautiful piece of work.
It's really excellent.

396
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:48,981
These are for practice. I took out six of them...

397
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:51,022
to convert to explosive tips.

398
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:55,288
Let me have one.

399
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:14,101
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

400
00:47:14,177 --> 00:47:15,769
Please sit down.

401
00:47:17,514 --> 00:47:20,609
I trust that you've all read Colonel Rolland's report?

402
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:25,783
I delivered a copy to the president this afternoon.

403
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:29,295
Unhappily, in the interest of the dignity of France...

404
00:47:29,362 --> 00:47:32,696
he feels obliged to impose enormous limitations on us.

405
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,794
He refuses to alter in any way...

406
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:38,636
the summer schedule of his public appearances.

407
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:41,303
- Good heavens.
- The search for this Jackal...

408
00:47:41,378 --> 00:47:44,143
will be conducted in absolute secrecy.

409
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:47,482
Needless to say, you are all sworn to total silence...

410
00:47:47,553 --> 00:47:49,521
and won't discuss this matter outside this room.

411
00:47:50,624 --> 00:47:54,493
- But, Minister-
- But its impossible!

412
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:58,158
The president was absolutely adamant.

413
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:01,762
What extra security precautions
do we take, Minister?

414
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,636
None.

415
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:07,440
General Colbert. Any success in Vienna?

416
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:11,951
Inquiries were made by our agents
at the Pension Kleist.

417
00:48:12,018 --> 00:48:14,954
They showed photographs
of Rodin, Montclair and Casson...

418
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,614
to the desk clerk.

419
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,788
Some money changed hands.
He stated that he recognized them.

420
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:23,229
They had arrived on June 14.

421
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,858
Were there any visitors?

422
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,804
One man the next afternoon.

423
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,308
He left half an hour later.

424
00:48:31,377 --> 00:48:33,471
The only description the clerk could give...

425
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:36,311
was the man was well-groomed...

426
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,716
in his early thirties and had fair hair.

427
00:48:40,556 --> 00:48:42,490
Surely a better description can be found.

428
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:43,992
From whom?

429
00:48:47,398 --> 00:48:48,922
Rodin, for instance.

430
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:52,331
I hardly think hed accept an invitation...

431
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:54,566
from any of our departments, Colonel.

432
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:04,110
Commissioner Berthier, any suggestions?

433
00:49:04,186 --> 00:49:06,120
We're in trouble on this one.

434
00:49:06,188 --> 00:49:08,623
Our agents inside the OAS can't pin him down...

435
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:11,287
since not even the OAS know who he is.

436
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:14,628
Action Service can't destroy him.
They don't know who to destroy.

437
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,635
Territorial surveillance can't
pick him up at the border...

438
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,796
because they don't know what he looks like.

439
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:21,807
The gendarmes, all 48,000 of them,
can't pursue him.

440
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,810
They don't know who to pursue.

441
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:27,508
The police can't arrest him.
We don't know who to arrest.

442
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:31,979
Without a name, all other
proposals are meaningless.

443
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:34,081
The first task then is to find it.

444
00:49:34,158 --> 00:49:38,095
With a name, we get a passport and a face.

445
00:49:38,163 --> 00:49:40,826
With a face, we get an arrest.

446
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,496
But to find his name, and to do it in secret...

447
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:46,837
is a job of pure detective work.

448
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:50,675
Commissioner, who is the best detective on the force?

449
00:49:53,082 --> 00:49:54,880
The best detective on the force...

450
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:58,218
is my own deputy commissioner,
Claude Lebel.

451
00:50:03,397 --> 00:50:04,830
Claude!

452
00:50:09,637 --> 00:50:11,799
Berthier wants to see you.

453
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:14,309
- What? Now?
- He's sent a car.

454
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,808
Dont be back later than 9:00.

455
00:50:34,437 --> 00:50:36,531
Commissioner Lebel.

456
00:50:40,778 --> 00:50:42,712
Good evening.

457
00:50:44,717 --> 00:50:48,176
Remember, you have full powers in this investigation...

458
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,519
and the resources of every
department represented here...

459
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:52,218
entirely at your disposal.

460
00:50:52,293 --> 00:50:56,857
My instructions are simply: no publicity and do not fail.

461
00:50:56,933 --> 00:51:01,303
Keep your copy of the report. Any questions?

462
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:03,500
No, Minister.

463
00:51:03,575 --> 00:51:05,975
In that case, I'll not detain you.

464
00:51:08,214 --> 00:51:09,978
Thank you, Commissioner.

465
00:51:16,391 --> 00:51:19,327
Collect the reports, and put them in my private safe.

466
00:51:19,395 --> 00:51:20,829
- Yes, Minister.
- Good night, gentlemen.

467
00:51:20,897 --> 00:51:23,298
- Good night.
- Thank you.

468
00:51:37,252 --> 00:51:40,188
You'll have to drop whatever you're doing. Everything.

469
00:51:40,256 --> 00:51:42,019
Clear the desk completely.

470
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:44,526
You want a new office?

471
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:48,031
From now on it's headquarters
for this job, nothing else.

472
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:51,194
The minister said he wants a progress report by you...

473
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,398
every evening from now on.

474
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:56,375
- Here. 10:00 sharp.
- Oh, God.

475
00:51:56,444 --> 00:51:57,877
I know.

476
00:51:57,945 --> 00:52:01,404
You've just got to find him before he gets to de Gaulle.

477
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:04,510
- I wonder if he has a timetable.
- I'm sure he has.

478
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:06,522
The trouble is, only he knows it.

479
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,186
He might go for a hit tomorrow
or maybe not for a month.

480
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,855
You've just got to work flat out until you locate him.

481
00:52:12,931 --> 00:52:16,869
After that, we can have Action
Service do the rest, the thugs.

482
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:21,170
Obviously, you've got to have
a heavy mob for a thing like this.

483
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:25,680
Anyway, just go and find this Jackal, will you?

484
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,343
What?

485
00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:32,184
- I'll need help.
- Who?

486
00:52:32,256 --> 00:52:34,851
Young Caron, and he'll have to be told.

487
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:37,987
- I'll have to get clearance.
- All I want is Caron.

488
00:52:38,064 --> 00:52:39,531
That's all.

489
00:52:45,607 --> 00:52:49,875
You know what they'll do to you
if you don't catch him in time?

490
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:52,881
I've been given a job, so we'll just have to do it.

491
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,884
But no crime has been committed yet.

492
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:58,047
Where are we supposed to start
looking for the criminal?

493
00:52:58,123 --> 00:53:00,251
We start by recognizing that, after de Gaulle...

494
00:53:00,326 --> 00:53:02,817
we are the two most powerful people in France.

495
00:53:02,897 --> 00:53:04,455
Now make notes.

496
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:08,498
Get my secretary transferred until further notice.

497
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:12,166
You will be my secretary
and assistant rolled into one.

498
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:15,507
I want a bed in here with linen and all the usual...

499
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:19,016
including something to wash in and shaving things.

500
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,348
Also, get a percolator and lots of coffee.

501
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,356
- Right, sir.
- Get onto the switchboard.

502
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:27,360
I want a good telephonist, the best they've got.

503
00:53:27,428 --> 00:53:30,694
I need ten outside lines open around-the-clock.

504
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:33,031
If there's any nonsense, refer them to Berthier.

505
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:35,536
This job gets top priority at all times.

506
00:53:35,605 --> 00:53:37,699
Do you want anything from them immediately?

507
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:39,539
A person-to-person link to the heads...

508
00:53:39,611 --> 00:53:42,045
of the homicide divisions of the following countries:

509
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:44,742
Holland, Belgium, Italy...

510
00:53:44,817 --> 00:53:48,083
West Germany and South Africa.

511
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:50,090
The FBI in the United States...

512
00:53:50,158 --> 00:53:52,592
and Scotland Yards Special Branch in Britain.

513
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,255
- How many is that?
- Seven.

514
00:53:55,331 --> 00:53:57,926
Get the head man at home or in the office.

515
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,095
Ask them to take a call from me tomorrow morning...

516
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:02,868
and see that there's 
no one listening in.

517
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:05,205
In the meantime, I'm going down to general records...

518
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:09,009
to check if this Jackal
has ever operated inside France.

519
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:13,521
Sir, how do you know the Jackal
comes from any of these countries?

520
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:17,685
I don't. But he must be on file somewhere.

521
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:41,274
- Sorry I'm late, darling.
- What kept you so long?

522
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:45,374
- There was a long meeting.
- I've been waiting for hours.

523
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:49,480
Yes, I'm sorry about the hour, but-

524
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:54,621
Yes, Washington, I know its
7:00 there. It's midnight here.

525
00:54:54,696 --> 00:54:57,291
What?

526
00:54:57,367 --> 00:55:00,098
Could you call him at the club, please?

527
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:02,706
I didn't go out.

528
00:55:02,774 --> 00:55:05,265
I just sat waiting for you to call.

529
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,744
It was impossible. There was a crisis on.

530
00:55:07,813 --> 00:55:10,578
Crisis? What crisis?

531
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:12,084
Never mind.

532
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:20,922
- What crisis?
- It was nothing.

533
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:24,425
What crisis?

534
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:30,866
Mr. Mallinson.

535
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:35,814
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
It's Paris. Inspector Caron.

536
00:55:35,883 --> 00:55:38,318
I don't wish to sound rude, but wouldn't it be better...

537
00:55:38,386 --> 00:55:42,448
if routine inquiries could be
conducted through proper channels?

538
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:46,463
- Preferably when we're all awake.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Mallinson.

539
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:48,965
It is very urgent.

540
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:51,502
Commissioner Lebel didn't wish to make a formal request.

541
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,631
He was rather hoping that you'd
cooperate with us unofficially.

542
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:59,306
All right. I'll take the commissioner's call at 8:30.

543
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:01,406
Fine. Good night.

544
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:04,578
What's left of it.

545
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:07,749
- Who was that?
- The old boy network.

546
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:02,495
Yes?

547
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:05,327
- Denise.
- Valmy here.

548
00:57:05,399 --> 00:57:07,334
They found out about the Jackal.

549
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:12,773
All I found in central records...

550
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:15,836
was that in the ten last years there've only been...

551
00:57:15,914 --> 00:57:18,007
four contract killers in France.

552
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:22,020
We've got three. The fourth is
serving time in Africa somewhere.

553
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:24,853
So our man must be from abroad.

554
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:28,293
Surely, he's come to someone's attention somewhere.

555
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:32,796
- Who do I speak to first?
- Scotland Yard...

556
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:35,360
Special Branch.

557
00:57:35,438 --> 00:57:38,931
Assistant Commissioner Mallinson.

558
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:43,209
There's no name. Nothing to go on, I'm afraid.

559
00:57:45,953 --> 00:57:49,549
All this unofficial secrecy is pretty irregular, isn't it?

560
00:57:49,624 --> 00:57:54,221
- Makes my task difficult.
- Yes, I know.

561
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:57,733
I've never heard of a political killer in this country.

562
00:57:57,801 --> 00:58:01,067
- It's not our style, is it?
- It's more your department...

563
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:04,337
- so I'll leave it in your hands.
- Yes, but-

564
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:07,106
Try to get it out of the way by tomorrow.

565
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,706
I'm understaffed as it is.

566
00:58:09,784 --> 00:58:11,809
Yes, sir.

567
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,358
What's the cost?

568
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:37,652
Give me the foreign office, would you, please, luv?

569
01:01:37,723 --> 01:01:39,658
Extension 905.

570
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,397
Hello, Barrie?
Brian Thomas.

571
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:52,841
Could you meet me in an hour at the usual place?

572
01:01:59,152 --> 01:02:02,020
Weve been plowing through
the files till we're cross-eyed.

573
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:04,080
None of them fits the description.

574
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:06,753
But before we drop it, I had a thought.

575
01:02:06,828 --> 01:02:08,922
If this contract killer did all his work abroad...

576
01:02:08,998 --> 01:02:11,432
hed be quite respectable in England, wouldn't he?

577
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,265
- So?
- Your people operate abroad.

578
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:16,773
I thought you might have tabs on a bloke like that.

579
01:02:16,841 --> 01:02:18,776
I'll have a look.

580
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,606
Brian, call for you.

581
01:02:29,891 --> 01:02:31,825
Thomas.

582
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:33,828
Yes, that's right.

583
01:02:35,566 --> 01:02:38,296
Is this some sort of bloody joke?

584
01:02:40,205 --> 01:02:41,797
What? Now?

585
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,170
Personally?

586
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:47,145
Yes, I'll-

587
01:03:10,677 --> 01:03:13,340
- The Prime Minister?
- The Prime Minister, sir.

588
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,976
He said if there's the remotest possibility...

589
01:03:16,051 --> 01:03:18,144
of General de Gaulles life being threatened...

590
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,622
by a person of these islands, then it is to be stopped.

591
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:24,820
He's given me full powers and top priority.

592
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:27,491
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Of course not, sir.

593
01:03:27,566 --> 01:03:29,831
I've got to drop whatever I'm doing.

594
01:03:29,903 --> 01:03:34,170
I shall need six of your best men straightaway.

595
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:37,803
Where's the notification for this?
Where's the proper authority?

596
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,148
Yes!

597
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:48,021
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

598
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:59,169
Nothing more than taproom gossip, I'm afraid.

599
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:01,436
Do you remember Trujillo?

600
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:05,107
You mean the dictator of some
republic in South America?

601
01:04:05,182 --> 01:04:08,276
Yes, Dominica. He was killed in 1961.

602
01:04:08,353 --> 01:04:12,620
We got word that an Englishman
may have been mixed up in it.

603
01:04:12,692 --> 01:04:15,127
Just an unconfirmed report, mind you.

604
01:04:15,195 --> 01:04:19,132
- Did he have a name?
- Charles Harold Calthrop.

605
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,297
He was the Caribbean rep
for a small armaments firm.

606
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:27,639
According to the rumor, he was a fantastic shot.

607
01:04:27,711 --> 01:04:30,647
He disappeared after the assassination.

608
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:32,809
Nobody knows where he went.

609
01:04:34,553 --> 01:04:37,648
- Is that all there is to go on?
- Afraid so.

610
01:04:37,724 --> 01:04:39,317
Just a name?

611
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:44,194
What makes you think it might be him?

612
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:47,862
Your friends code name is Jackal, right?

613
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:53,343
Jackal in French is chacal.

614
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:56,711
See? Now it might just be a coincidence...

615
01:04:56,782 --> 01:04:59,718
but the first three letters
of his Christian name, Charles...

616
01:04:59,786 --> 01:05:04,315
and the first three letters of Calthrop make up-

617
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:22,315
That's all the Charles H. Calthrops
way back to 1958.

618
01:05:22,382 --> 01:05:24,816
- How many does that make?
- Twenty-three.

619
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,817
Will you please tell Commissioner Lebel...

620
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:34,159
there is a faint possibility, very faint...

621
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:38,498
the name is Charles Harold Calthrop.

622
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:41,334
That's right. We've checked
with the passport office.

623
01:05:41,406 --> 01:05:44,672
Twenty-three passports were issued
to Charles H. Calthrops...

624
01:05:44,744 --> 01:05:46,679
during the past five years.

625
01:05:46,747 --> 01:05:50,013
We've interviewed 12 of them so far.

626
01:05:50,085 --> 01:05:52,953
Nothing at all, but I'll keep you posted.

627
01:05:53,022 --> 01:05:54,957
Do you have a garage for rent?

628
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,602
Excuse me.

629
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:53,269
Would you happen to know
where Mr. Charles Calthrop is?

630
01:07:53,345 --> 01:07:55,109
- Mr. Calthrop?
- Yes.

631
01:07:55,181 --> 01:07:58,948
I think he's abroad. He often is, you know.

632
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:00,611
Thank you.

633
01:08:00,687 --> 01:08:02,713
We better get a search warrant.

634
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:20,778
What's happening?

635
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:30,799
Come in.

636
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:36,007
We've been through the lot, sir.
He's away, all right.

637
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:40,178
Let's see what you've got.

638
01:08:58,904 --> 01:09:01,931
- What's this?
- His passport.

639
01:09:02,008 --> 01:09:03,942
We checked it. It's him.

640
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:07,606
Look. The Dominican visa.

641
01:09:07,682 --> 01:09:11,245
There's no exit stamp though.
He must have got out on the sly.

642
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:14,780
You haven't grasped it yet, have you?

643
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,623
Yes, this is our man, all right. Definitely.

644
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,793
But hasn't it occurred to you
that we're holding his passport?

645
01:09:21,868 --> 01:09:25,566
If he is out of the country, what's he traveling on?

646
01:09:26,874 --> 01:09:29,901
- He might be somewhere in the U.K.
- Yes, he might.

647
01:09:29,978 --> 01:09:31,412
Then again, he might not.

648
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:35,542
He's Charles Harold Calthrop.
Here's his passport photo.

649
01:09:38,389 --> 01:09:40,721
I'll circulate photos to each of you after the meeting.

650
01:09:41,894 --> 01:09:46,730
Excellent. Thank you, Commissioner.

651
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:50,662
It may be this Calthrop
has already entered the country.

652
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:53,970
He may be staying at a hotel.
Phillison.

653
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:55,977
- Minister?
- I want every hotel card...

654
01:09:56,045 --> 01:09:58,378
for the past 72 hours checked by the police.

655
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:00,541
The same goes for you, Pascal,
with those cards that are filed...

656
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:02,677
- for the greater Paris area.
- Yes, Minister.

657
01:10:02,754 --> 01:10:05,986
Circulate to your staffs
this mans name and photograph.

658
01:10:06,058 --> 01:10:10,462
He must be arrested on sight,
and my office notified at once.

659
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:12,260
I want every border post...

660
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,963
airport, seaport, fishing village alerted.

661
01:10:16,038 --> 01:10:18,633
- General Colbert.
- Minister?

662
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,141
Calthrop is probably still abroad.

663
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:23,305
- Get your agents working on that.
- Yes, sir.

664
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:26,009
In the meantime, complete silence must be maintained...

665
01:10:26,084 --> 01:10:28,815
until we're sure the man's in this country.

666
01:10:28,888 --> 01:10:32,017
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

667
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,504
Commissioner Lebels office.

668
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:46,008
Yes.

669
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:53,010
Thank you.
Good-bye.

670
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:59,018
No one called Calthrop has crossed
any border point legally...

671
01:10:59,094 --> 01:11:01,029
since the start of the year.

672
01:11:01,097 --> 01:11:04,123
And no hotel has taken in a guest under that name.

673
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,635
Maybe he's given up and gone into hiding.

674
01:11:06,703 --> 01:11:10,800
If the British found Calthrops passport in his flat...

675
01:11:10,876 --> 01:11:14,141
it's because he no longer needed it.

676
01:11:14,214 --> 01:11:16,682
Don't count on that man making too many errors.

677
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,844
He's not the type.

678
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:23,987
I'm beginning to get a feeling about the Jackal.

679
01:11:25,228 --> 01:11:29,188
He may be abroad, traveling on a false passport.

680
01:11:29,266 --> 01:11:33,033
What you're going to do now is
go down to the passport office.

681
01:11:33,104 --> 01:11:37,007
Get every passport application
for the last three months.

682
01:11:37,076 --> 01:11:39,341
- But, sir-
- I don't care who's closed.

683
01:11:39,413 --> 01:11:41,507
Wake the buggers up.

684
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:44,848
Then take all those papers down to Somerset House...

685
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,013
get started on checking the applicants names...

686
01:11:47,089 --> 01:11:50,857
against death certificates, not birth certificates.

687
01:11:50,928 --> 01:11:54,695
If you find an application filed
by someone who died as a child...

688
01:11:54,766 --> 01:11:58,203
the one who filed it might be our man.

689
01:11:58,271 --> 01:12:00,205
If you don't find anything in the first three months...

690
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:03,300
go back another three and another three.

691
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:04,811
Off you go.

692
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:44,529
Yes?

693
01:12:44,598 --> 01:12:46,566
How's it going, Hughes?

694
01:12:48,436 --> 01:12:53,534
How many applications?
8,041?

695
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:55,544
You'll be there a week.

696
01:12:55,612 --> 01:12:58,207
How about I send you some more staff?

697
01:13:00,151 --> 01:13:02,211
Bloody holiday season.

698
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:14,168
About 4,000 more to go, Mr. Thomas.

699
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:18,003
But if we work through lunch,
we should be finished tonight.

700
01:13:58,827 --> 01:14:01,524
Superintendent Thomas, Special Branch.

701
01:14:03,099 --> 01:14:07,059
Hughes here, sir.
Paul Oliver Duggan.

702
01:14:07,137 --> 01:14:10,905
Born April 3, 1929, in Sambourne Fishley.

703
01:14:10,977 --> 01:14:13,537
Applied for passport July 14 of this year.

704
01:14:13,613 --> 01:14:17,381
Passport mailed July 17 to an address in Paddington.

705
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:21,014
That will probably turn out
to be an accommodation address.

706
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,523
Why?

707
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:28,054
Duggan died at the age of two
and a half on November 8, 1931.

708
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,674
Passport, please.

709
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,183
One moment.

710
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,541
- Mr. Duggan?
- Yes?

711
01:15:22,979 --> 01:15:25,278
What's the purpose of your visit to France?

712
01:15:25,349 --> 01:15:27,341
Tourism.

713
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,105
- You buy this in Italy?
- No, its hired.

714
01:15:44,174 --> 01:15:46,836
I shall be returning it to Genova in about a week.

715
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,072
Papers, please.

716
01:15:52,351 --> 01:15:54,183
Got any luggage?

717
01:15:55,521 --> 01:15:58,491
- In the boot.
- Bring it inside.

718
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:38,776
Thank you.

719
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:07,814
Once we've found his new name...

720
01:17:07,882 --> 01:17:10,146
Lebel shouldn't have any trouble catching him.

721
01:17:10,219 --> 01:17:11,811
It's not that simple.

722
01:17:11,887 --> 01:17:15,654
Over two million foreigners
are in Paris at this time of year.

723
01:17:15,725 --> 01:17:17,990
I'm very sorry, Minister.

724
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:22,499
Commissioner Lebel requested this meeting...

725
01:17:22,568 --> 01:17:25,129
because he has new information
on the British suspect.

726
01:17:25,205 --> 01:17:26,638
Commissioner.

727
01:17:26,706 --> 01:17:29,870
Calthrop is traveling on a false passport...

728
01:17:29,944 --> 01:17:33,507
in the name of Paul Oliver Duggan.

729
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:38,021
The passport number is 29491.

730
01:17:38,088 --> 01:17:40,319
The photo will reach us in a few hours.

731
01:17:40,391 --> 01:17:42,416
What do we do now?

732
01:17:42,494 --> 01:17:45,896
The Duggan passport was issued on July 30.

733
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:48,400
No need to go further back than that.

734
01:17:48,468 --> 01:17:50,562
Special Branch in Britain is trying to trace him...

735
01:17:50,638 --> 01:17:54,075
through the passenger lists
of all airlines and ferries.

736
01:17:54,143 --> 01:17:56,475
If they pick him up in Britain, they'll detain him.

737
01:17:56,545 --> 01:17:59,538
If we locate him inside France, we arrest him.

738
01:17:59,616 --> 01:18:04,487
If he's found in a third country,
Action Service will deal with him.

739
01:18:04,556 --> 01:18:06,319
- Commissioner-
- In the meantime...

740
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:09,725
I'll be grateful if you would do this my way.

741
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:31,686
Good morning, sir.
Paris, please. Molitor 5901.

742
01:18:31,758 --> 01:18:33,693
Carrier number one, please.

743
01:18:49,113 --> 01:18:52,379
The Jackal is blown.
Wolenski talked before dying.

744
01:18:52,451 --> 01:18:54,443
Repeat: The Jackal is blown.

745
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:19,355
Room 14.
Thank you, Mr. Duggan.

746
01:21:01,619 --> 01:21:03,747
I'll have coffee in the lounge.

747
01:21:20,778 --> 01:21:24,215
Do you mind my sitting here?

748
01:21:26,952 --> 01:21:28,419
Thank you.

749
01:21:38,801 --> 01:21:41,566
Boring, arent they?

750
01:21:41,638 --> 01:21:44,403
The magazines.

751
01:21:44,475 --> 01:21:47,570
- I find them fascinating.
- What?

752
01:21:47,646 --> 01:21:51,413
Articles on pig breeding and combine harvesters?

753
01:21:51,484 --> 01:21:54,750
I'm enthralled by combine harvesters.

754
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:58,062
In fact, I yearn to have one, as a pet.

755
01:22:09,476 --> 01:22:10,910
Yes.

756
01:22:12,147 --> 01:22:15,584
When did you say? This afternoon.

757
01:22:15,651 --> 01:22:17,745
Repeat that again.

758
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:22,088
A white Alfa Romeo sports two-seater...

759
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:26,758
license number GE 1741.

760
01:22:28,168 --> 01:22:32,606
Duggan crossed the border
at Ventimiglia four hours ago.

761
01:22:32,673 --> 01:22:34,938
Call London and tell them well handle it from now on.

762
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:37,605
- Where is he?
- How should I know?

763
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,946
This damn secrecy.
We'll have to wait for the hotel cards.

764
01:22:41,018 --> 01:22:44,819
It's madness. There's nothing we can do about it.

765
01:22:47,059 --> 01:22:49,550
No, of course I don't live in the Alps.

766
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:52,292
I went there for a visit, that's all.

767
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:54,301
Climbing?

768
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,998
Good Lord, no.

769
01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:01,237
I spent the day at the cadet
academy in Barcelonnette...

770
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:04,907
amongst a lot of jaundiced military types...

771
01:23:04,982 --> 01:23:07,645
watching my son receive his commission.

772
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:11,957
He's nineteen.

773
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:17,924
I never know when you're being serious.

774
01:23:17,999 --> 01:23:21,834
- It's true, unfortunately.
- Why "unfortunately"?

775
01:23:24,441 --> 01:23:26,239
I see nothing unfortunate-

776
01:23:26,311 --> 01:23:30,043
I'm not begging for compliments, Mr. Duggan.

777
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,615
- Will you have a liqueur?
- No, I must go to bed.

778
01:23:37,792 --> 01:23:40,785
I have to leave very early tomorrow morning.

779
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:43,457
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

780
01:23:45,702 --> 01:23:47,796
Good night, Mr. Duggan.

781
01:26:05,183 --> 01:26:08,119
I've got to leave in a couple of hours.

782
01:26:08,187 --> 01:26:10,452
I've a long way to go.

783
01:26:10,524 --> 01:26:13,460
You've got to go back to your room.

784
01:26:13,528 --> 01:26:15,963
Your husband meeting you?

785
01:26:18,033 --> 01:26:20,127
No, he isn't there.

786
01:26:50,742 --> 01:26:52,369
Good morning.

787
01:26:52,444 --> 01:26:54,811
Excuse me, madam.

788
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,514
Only three new guests last night.

789
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:05,888
All right. Put them in the rack for Nice.

790
01:27:11,603 --> 01:27:13,538
Cards ready yet?

791
01:27:31,662 --> 01:27:33,927
Hello? Nice?

792
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:37,401
Yes. Repeat, please.

793
01:27:41,008 --> 01:27:43,910
Stay by the phone until
I call back. Don't do a thing.

794
01:27:43,978 --> 01:27:47,073
I don't want him disturbed yet,
but isolate the place.

795
01:27:47,149 --> 01:27:49,914
Let no one in or out and stop all phone calls.

796
01:27:51,821 --> 01:27:54,916
He's been staying in this hotel
near Grasse since last night.

797
01:27:54,992 --> 01:27:57,757
- He's registered for two days.
- Shall I put out an alert?

798
01:27:57,829 --> 01:28:00,230
Not yet. He'll kill anybody
who tries to intercept him.

799
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,118
We'd better get there right away.

800
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,681
You have an Englishman named Duggan staying here.

801
01:28:57,757 --> 01:28:59,726
- Where is he?
- Mr. Duggan's gone, sir.

802
01:28:59,794 --> 01:29:02,628
He left this morning, just after 11:00.

803
01:29:05,367 --> 01:29:09,465
Assemble the staff and guests.
Don't let anyone get away.

804
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:11,167
Get the manager.

805
01:29:14,746 --> 01:29:17,011
That's strange. He was booked for two days...

806
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:21,145
then just after 11:00,
he asks for his bill and leaves.

807
01:29:21,221 --> 01:29:25,488
He's got five hours start.
Put out an alert for the car.

808
01:29:44,418 --> 01:29:47,718
But Madame de Montpelliers bed
was slept in by two people?

809
01:29:47,789 --> 01:29:50,224
Yes, sir. Definitely.

810
01:29:50,292 --> 01:29:52,557
You can always tell.

811
01:29:52,629 --> 01:29:55,393
And you saw them in the lounge together?

812
01:29:55,466 --> 01:29:59,733
That is correct, sir.
I served them coffee and liqueur.

813
01:29:59,805 --> 01:30:02,468
They seemed very engrossed.

814
01:30:02,542 --> 01:30:05,306
- In what?
- In each other, sir.

815
01:30:05,378 --> 01:30:08,644
What did Mr. Duggans luggage
consist of when he left?

816
01:30:08,716 --> 01:30:11,151
- Two bags.
- Nothing else?

817
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:13,814
No parcels or packages of any kind?

818
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:17,327
Just the two bags. I carried them to his car.

819
01:30:17,394 --> 01:30:19,158
That will be all.

820
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:22,997
- You photographed everything?
- Yes.

821
01:30:23,069 --> 01:30:26,164
Go over his room for fingerprints.
Send the stuff to Paris.

822
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,902
I'll have a talk with the lady.

823
01:30:50,437 --> 01:30:54,204
There's more news.
They have a description of your car.

824
01:30:54,275 --> 01:30:56,471
Keep out of sight for a few days.

825
01:33:15,293 --> 01:33:17,887
- How's the lady?
- Very disturbed by all this.

826
01:33:17,962 --> 01:33:19,897
You told her nothing?

827
01:33:40,525 --> 01:33:43,461
I know nothing at all
about Mr. Duggans whereabouts.

828
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:45,760
We only met in the lounge of that hotel.

829
01:33:45,832 --> 01:33:49,064
- He joined me for coffee.
- What did he want?

830
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:53,574
What did you talk about?

831
01:33:53,642 --> 01:33:56,578
Social chitchat. I imagine
he was trying to impress me.

832
01:33:56,646 --> 01:33:58,581
Why do you think that?

833
01:33:58,649 --> 01:34:02,177
Commissioner, please, we're not children.

834
01:34:02,253 --> 01:34:03,845
No, madam.

835
01:34:05,758 --> 01:34:09,354
When you both met later,
was it only in your bedroom?

836
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:15,537
- "Later"?
- Afterwards. After the coffee.

837
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:24,707
Madam, be in no doubt as to
the seriousness of your position.

838
01:34:42,339 --> 01:34:45,070
We met in my bedroom. That's all.

839
01:34:46,978 --> 01:34:50,437
I'd never seen this man until yesterday.

840
01:34:50,516 --> 01:34:53,077
He doesn't even know my real name.

841
01:36:08,958 --> 01:36:12,360
I regret to say that we have lost track of him.

842
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:15,662
Temporarily, I hope. But he simply disappeared.

843
01:36:20,306 --> 01:36:22,434
Could that mean he's changed his mind?

844
01:36:22,509 --> 01:36:24,443
We've obviously scared him off.

845
01:36:24,511 --> 01:36:26,605
Is it possible he's decided to give up?

846
01:36:26,681 --> 01:36:31,278
His only chance to escape is
to get across the border fast.

847
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:37,256
I think he's still in France.

848
01:36:38,831 --> 01:36:40,423
He may be waiting.

849
01:36:40,499 --> 01:36:42,968
- Waiting for what?
- I don't know.

850
01:36:43,036 --> 01:36:46,473
But I don't think we can assume
that he's given up.

851
01:37:52,459 --> 01:37:53,892
Good morning.

852
01:38:14,321 --> 01:38:16,916
Madam, there is a gentleman-

853
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,425
Surprised?

854
01:38:19,494 --> 01:38:21,292
Thank you, Michal.

855
01:38:23,499 --> 01:38:27,266
- Do that later, Ernestine.
- Yes, madam.

856
01:38:37,684 --> 01:38:39,710
- Yes, I am surprised.
- Why?

857
01:38:39,787 --> 01:38:41,983
Your husband's still away, isn't he?

858
01:38:44,226 --> 01:38:46,161
Why did you come here?

859
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:48,164
To see you.

860
01:38:49,233 --> 01:38:51,168
I had to.

861
01:38:51,236 --> 01:38:52,999
But why?

862
01:38:56,142 --> 01:38:57,906
Does it matter?

863
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:44,302
Make a search of hills, farmhouses, cafes and hotels...

864
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:47,968
in a ten-kilometer radius from the scene of the crash.

865
01:39:48,043 --> 01:39:51,810
Look for a fair-haired, young
foreigner with two suitcases.

866
01:39:51,881 --> 01:39:54,874
He may have been injured and gone into hiding.

867
01:40:07,836 --> 01:40:11,273
The police were here yesterday looking for you.

868
01:40:15,545 --> 01:40:19,778
Did they say they were coming back?

869
01:40:21,186 --> 01:40:24,315
Only that I should phone if-

870
01:40:28,195 --> 01:40:32,656
I know you stole that car.
It has a local license plate.

871
01:40:37,741 --> 01:40:41,178
I know it must be very serious. I don't mind.

872
01:40:41,246 --> 01:40:43,840
You can tell me what you've done.

873
01:40:43,915 --> 01:40:46,180
You can stay here. It's safe.

874
01:40:46,252 --> 01:40:50,349
But you must tell me, Paul. I won't say anything.

875
01:44:03,763 --> 01:44:05,857
Good-bye, Mr. Duggan.

876
01:44:27,629 --> 01:44:30,223
Your coffee, madam.

877
01:44:58,135 --> 01:44:59,727
Madam?

878
01:45:41,191 --> 01:45:44,286
Good morning. A single ticket to Paris, please.

879
01:45:44,362 --> 01:45:46,455
- What class?
- Second.

880
01:45:47,866 --> 01:45:51,769
- How soon will the train be here?
- In an hour.

881
01:45:51,838 --> 01:45:55,400
- Platform one.
- Thank you.

882
01:46:12,131 --> 01:46:13,759
Your papers.

883
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:24,240
- Danish?
- Please?

884
01:46:24,313 --> 01:46:26,781
- Denmark?
- Yes.

885
01:46:26,849 --> 01:46:28,442
What is your business here?

886
01:46:28,519 --> 01:46:31,512
I'm a schoolteacher on holiday.

887
01:47:18,183 --> 01:47:19,616
Madam?

888
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:49,333
Commissioner, Madame de Montpellier
has been murdered!

889
01:48:49,401 --> 01:48:51,495
- Do they know who did it?
- It sounds like Duggan.

890
01:48:51,571 --> 01:48:55,269
He arrived at her place yesterday,
but disappeared again with her car.

891
01:48:55,343 --> 01:48:58,780
There's no need for secrecy.
It's a straight murder hunt now.

892
01:48:58,847 --> 01:49:02,841
Put out a general alert for Duggan.
Describe the car.

893
01:49:16,944 --> 01:49:20,779
6:30 time check. Listen, I've found that car.

894
01:49:26,589 --> 01:49:29,184
The gendarmes by the railway
station say only three men...

895
01:49:29,259 --> 01:49:31,524
boarded the midday train to Paris.

896
01:49:31,596 --> 01:49:33,029
Two were locals...

897
01:49:33,098 --> 01:49:37,036
and the third was a teacher
traveling on a Danish passport.

898
01:49:37,104 --> 01:49:42,202
Age: about 34. Five feet ten, brown hair, blue eyes.

899
01:49:42,276 --> 01:49:43,869
He can't remember the name.

900
01:49:43,946 --> 01:49:47,713
What time is that train due at Austerlitz station?

901
01:49:47,784 --> 01:49:49,217
Ten past 7:00.

902
01:49:50,454 --> 01:49:52,820
Come on!

903
01:50:33,811 --> 01:50:36,507
- You know a good Turkish bath?
- Of course.

904
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:38,014
Take me there.

905
01:52:17,745 --> 01:52:21,546
It's obvious that the Jackal
has been tipped off all along.

906
01:52:21,617 --> 01:52:24,382
And yet he's decided to go ahead, regardless.

907
01:52:24,454 --> 01:52:28,551
He's simply challenged the whole lot of us.

908
01:52:28,626 --> 01:52:32,529
Are you suggesting there's a leak
from inside this room?

909
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:36,234
I can't say.

910
01:52:36,303 --> 01:52:40,900
We think the Jackal is now in
Paris with a new name and face...

911
01:52:40,976 --> 01:52:43,969
probably masquerading as a Danish schoolteacher.

912
01:52:50,021 --> 01:52:53,082
- Minister?
- Can you estimate...

913
01:52:53,158 --> 01:52:56,184
how many Danes might have
entered Paris this afternoon?

914
01:52:56,262 --> 01:52:58,355
Probably several hundred at this time of the year.

915
01:52:58,431 --> 01:53:00,366
We must check on the men personally.

916
01:53:00,434 --> 01:53:03,871
I'll have every hotel visited
at midnight and 3:00 a.m.

917
01:53:03,939 --> 01:53:05,702
All registration cards will be collected.

918
01:53:05,774 --> 01:53:08,539
Every likely Dane will be investigated.

919
01:53:08,611 --> 01:53:10,375
Good.

920
01:53:10,447 --> 01:53:12,381
In the meantime, I'll try to persuade the president...

921
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:14,714
to cancel all public appearances.

922
01:53:58,643 --> 01:54:00,703
You're getting all steamed up.

923
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:03,214
I think so.

924
01:54:03,283 --> 01:54:07,220
- I haven't seen you here before.
- No, I'm on holiday from Denmark.

925
01:54:07,288 --> 01:54:10,554
Really? I know Copenhagen very well.

926
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:15,063
Unfortunately, I come from Silkyborge.

927
01:54:15,131 --> 01:54:17,100
It's a very small town.

928
01:54:20,972 --> 01:54:23,601
My name is Jule. Jule Bernard.

929
01:54:24,677 --> 01:54:26,873
Lundquist. Per Lundquist.

930
01:54:28,315 --> 01:54:30,784
Perhaps you would like
to come for a drink at my home?

931
01:54:30,852 --> 01:54:32,753
I live quite nearby.

932
01:54:33,822 --> 01:54:36,087
That would be nice.

933
01:54:41,332 --> 01:54:45,099
So this Jackal has a Danish passport, right?

934
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:47,264
Mm-hmm.

935
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:51,607
- He must have got it somewhere.
- Yes.

936
01:54:56,352 --> 01:55:00,949
If he's had to dye his hair,
it looks as if he stole it.

937
01:55:01,024 --> 01:55:03,960
Yes, go on.

938
01:55:04,028 --> 01:55:06,964
Since his trip to Paris in July,
he's been based in London.

939
01:55:07,032 --> 01:55:10,298
The chances are he stole it
in one of those two places.

940
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:14,966
What would you do if you were
a Dane and lost your passport?

941
01:55:15,042 --> 01:55:17,807
I'd go to the consulate.

942
01:55:17,879 --> 01:55:20,474
- Are you calling Thomas?
- Yes.

943
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:24,043
- Then the Danish Consul in Paris.
- Good.

944
01:55:35,068 --> 01:55:37,503
- How is it going?
- Not well.

945
01:55:37,572 --> 01:55:40,337
678 Danes arrived in Paris yesterday.

946
01:55:40,409 --> 01:55:44,346
We're interviewing every man
about five feet eight.

947
01:55:44,414 --> 01:55:47,680
No Danish schoolteacher has turned up though.

948
01:55:47,751 --> 01:55:51,654
- Have the list sent to my office.
- Right.

949
01:55:52,725 --> 01:55:54,522
You are quite right, sir.

950
01:55:54,594 --> 01:55:57,120
A Danish schoolteacher had his passport stolen...

951
01:55:57,197 --> 01:56:00,634
at London Airport on July 12.

952
01:56:00,702 --> 01:56:04,969
Name: Per Lundquist of Copenhagen, age 33.

953
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:09,775
Five feet ten, chestnut brown hair, blue eyes.

954
01:56:09,847 --> 01:56:12,749
That's it! That's the one!
Per Lundquist.

955
01:56:12,818 --> 01:56:16,812
Look him up. Yes?

956
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:21,605
- There isn't one.
- What?

957
01:56:21,677 --> 01:56:23,612
One moment, Superintendent.

958
01:56:38,832 --> 01:56:40,596
I don't understand it.

959
01:56:40,668 --> 01:56:44,935
There isn't a Lundquist
on the hotels list. Not one.

960
01:56:50,915 --> 01:56:55,546
The following conversation was
recorded at 6:15 this morning.

961
01:56:55,621 --> 01:57:00,219
The number being dialed
was identified as Molitor 5901.

962
01:57:04,633 --> 01:57:07,569
- Hello.
- Yes?

963
01:57:07,637 --> 01:57:09,902
- Denise.
- Valmy here.

964
01:57:09,973 --> 01:57:11,907
They know he's a Danish schoolteacher.

965
01:57:11,975 --> 01:57:14,410
They're visiting every hotel in Paris.

966
01:57:15,948 --> 01:57:18,246
The contact was arrested an hour ago.

967
01:57:18,317 --> 01:57:21,651
Unfortunately, the information came from this room.

968
01:57:24,325 --> 01:57:26,260
Whose voice was that?

969
01:57:30,366 --> 01:57:33,598
I regret to have to inform you, Minister...

970
01:57:33,671 --> 01:57:37,108
that it was the voice of a friend of mine.

971
01:57:37,175 --> 01:57:39,940
She's staying with me at the moment.

972
01:57:42,683 --> 01:57:44,116
Excuse me.

973
01:57:53,563 --> 01:57:57,227
- I feel we owe you an apology.
- Thank you.

974
01:57:59,037 --> 01:58:03,407
I must report that the president
will not change his mind.

975
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:05,068
Excuse me.

976
01:58:05,144 --> 01:58:08,637
It's occurred to me that we've
got two days to catch the Jackal.

977
01:58:08,716 --> 01:58:11,413
What? Why? How do you know?

978
01:58:11,486 --> 01:58:13,580
It was silly of me not to have seen it before.

979
01:58:13,656 --> 01:58:17,423
The president has no engagements
outside the palace...

980
01:58:17,494 --> 01:58:20,328
- today, tomorrow or Saturday?
- Nothing.

981
01:58:20,398 --> 01:58:22,765
And what is Sunday, August 25?

982
01:58:22,835 --> 01:58:25,201
Of course!
Liberation Day!

983
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:27,432
That's what he's been waiting for.

984
01:58:27,507 --> 01:58:29,442
We have a little over 48 hours.

985
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:32,274
We must have been blind, gentlemen.

986
01:58:32,347 --> 01:58:35,943
All we need is the passport
photograph of Per Lundquist.

987
01:58:36,019 --> 01:58:39,717
Copenhagen promised to send it
by this evenings conference.

988
01:58:43,028 --> 01:58:45,623
There is one thing.

989
01:58:45,698 --> 01:58:47,962
How did you know whose telephone to tap?

990
01:58:48,034 --> 01:58:50,799
I didn't, so I tapped all of them.

991
01:59:01,985 --> 01:59:04,614
Are you home already?

992
01:59:13,901 --> 01:59:17,770
We now have the passport
photograph of Per Lundquist.

993
01:59:17,839 --> 01:59:19,933
The ban on publicity is off.

994
01:59:20,009 --> 01:59:23,104
This is now a straight murder hunt.

995
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:26,776
Lundquists photo will appear
in the papers tomorrow morning.

996
01:59:26,851 --> 01:59:30,310
Well have news flashes on TV every 30 minutes.

997
01:59:30,389 --> 01:59:32,324
Every policeman and CRS man in Paris...

998
01:59:32,392 --> 01:59:34,155
will be on the street to check the papers...

999
01:59:34,227 --> 01:59:36,992
of anyone remotely resembling the suspect.

1000
01:59:37,064 --> 01:59:39,625
Every detective will be
called off his job to help.

1001
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:43,138
- How many men does that make?
- Almost a hundred thousand.

1002
01:59:45,374 --> 01:59:47,309
- Commissioner Lebel.
- Yes?

1003
01:59:47,377 --> 01:59:50,643
My congratulations
on the splendid job you've done.

1004
01:59:50,715 --> 01:59:53,310
We shall take over from now on.

1005
01:59:53,385 --> 01:59:57,254
We need detain you no longer.
And, again, thank you.

1006
02:00:40,046 --> 02:00:42,811
- Did you see it?
- See what?

1007
02:00:42,883 --> 02:00:47,321
- Your face on the TV just now.
- What do you mean?

1008
02:00:47,389 --> 02:00:51,326
I was passing a TV rental shop,
and I saw your face.

1009
02:00:51,394 --> 02:00:53,829
- Never.
- Yes.

1010
02:00:57,168 --> 02:00:59,103
Dont turn it off.

1011
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:03,935
- What was it about?
- I don't know...

1012
02:01:04,010 --> 02:01:06,104
but I swear it was you.

1013
02:01:08,349 --> 02:01:09,783
See?

1014
02:01:15,526 --> 02:01:19,122
We apologize for interrupting
with the following announcement.

1015
02:01:19,197 --> 02:01:21,131
Police are still searching for the murderer...

1016
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:22,963
of Madame de Montpellier.

1017
02:01:23,035 --> 02:01:27,132
His name is Per Lundquist,
and this is his photograph.

1018
02:01:27,207 --> 02:01:31,144
If you have seen this man,
contact the police immediately.

1019
02:02:08,227 --> 02:02:11,129
For Gods sake, wake up, will you?

1020
02:02:12,533 --> 02:02:14,967
The minister wants to see you!

1021
02:02:37,065 --> 02:02:40,661
We can't find him. He's vanished.

1022
02:02:40,736 --> 02:02:43,262
Just disappeared off the face of the Earth.

1023
02:02:44,574 --> 02:02:47,510
I don't think we had any idea what kind of man...

1024
02:02:47,578 --> 02:02:51,310
- you have been pursuing.
- What about tomorrow?

1025
02:02:51,383 --> 02:02:54,785
The president rekindles the eternal flame at 10:00.

1026
02:02:54,854 --> 02:02:58,120
High mass is at 11:00.

1027
02:02:58,192 --> 02:03:01,185
There's only one public ceremony
in the afternoon at 4:00.

1028
02:03:01,262 --> 02:03:05,792
He will present liberation medals
to veterans of the resistance.

1029
02:03:05,869 --> 02:03:07,803
What about crowd control?

1030
02:03:07,871 --> 02:03:11,638
Crowds will be kept back further than ever before.

1031
02:03:11,709 --> 02:03:15,647
Steel barriers go up several hours
before each ceremony.

1032
02:03:15,715 --> 02:03:18,810
Every house inside the barrier ring
is searched from top to bottom...

1033
02:03:18,886 --> 02:03:20,478
including the sewers.

1034
02:03:20,554 --> 02:03:24,821
Police will be issued special
lapel badges at the last moment...

1035
02:03:24,893 --> 02:03:28,831
in case he tries to masquerade as a security man.

1036
02:03:30,567 --> 02:03:33,002
There'll be marksmen inside Notre Dame...

1037
02:03:33,071 --> 02:03:36,166
even among the congregation.

1038
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:39,838
The priests celebrating mass will
be searched for concealed weapons.

1039
02:03:43,918 --> 02:03:47,184
Well have firemen and marksmen on every rooftop...

1040
02:03:47,256 --> 02:03:48,849
along the procession route.

1041
02:03:48,925 --> 02:03:51,685
Dumont has drafted a number of especially tall officers...

1042
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:54,983
to hedge around the president without him noticing.

1043
02:11:39,876 --> 02:11:42,812
- Can I pass, please?
- What for?

1044
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:44,974
I live there.

1045
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:48,282
I have a room at 154.

1046
02:11:50,523 --> 02:11:51,957
Papers.

1047
02:12:14,155 --> 02:12:15,918
All right.

1048
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:17,423
Thank you.

1049
02:12:43,192 --> 02:12:44,626
Excuse me, madam.

1050
02:12:44,694 --> 02:12:47,288
Would you be so kind
as to give me a drink of water?

1051
02:12:47,363 --> 02:12:50,458
Of course. Come in. Please come in.

1052
02:12:50,534 --> 02:12:53,971
It's hot, waiting for the ceremony.

1053
02:12:55,808 --> 02:12:57,743
Are you getting a medal today?

1054
02:12:57,811 --> 02:13:01,077
I got mine two years ago with one of my-

1055
02:18:27,861 --> 02:18:29,294
Top floor!

1056
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:35,311
What do you think you're doing?

1057
02:19:36,549 --> 02:19:38,984
- Who are you?
- Charles Calthrop.

1058
02:19:39,053 --> 02:19:40,988
This is my bloody flat.

1059
02:19:41,056 --> 02:19:44,151
I think you better come down to the Yard, sir.

1060
02:19:44,227 --> 02:19:46,320
Too bloody right, I will.

1061
02:19:49,767 --> 02:19:51,702
There's no question of Her Majesty's government...

1062
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:55,605
ever concealing the fact that
this Jackal was an Englishman.

1063
02:19:55,675 --> 02:19:58,236
So far as one can see, there was a period...

1064
02:19:58,312 --> 02:20:00,440
when an Englishman came under suspicion...

1065
02:20:00,515 --> 02:20:03,075
but he has now been cleared.

1066
02:20:03,151 --> 02:20:06,121
Certainly, the Jackal
masqueraded as an Englishman...

1067
02:20:06,188 --> 02:20:10,149
but he also masqueraded
as a Dane and as a Frenchman.

1068
02:20:10,227 --> 02:20:12,821
There's no way of proving his identity at all.

1069
02:20:12,897 --> 02:20:14,832
But if the Jackal wasnt Calthrop...

1070
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:17,529
then who the hell was he?

1071
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,094
