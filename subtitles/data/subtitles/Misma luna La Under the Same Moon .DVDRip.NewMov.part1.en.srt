<i>The "Migra!" The "Migra!"</i>

3
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,517
- Are you okay, Rosario?
- Shh, shh.

4
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,658
She's getting away.

5
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,558
<i>Welcome to America, Juanito.</i>

6
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,417
Are you up?

7
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,355
What would I do without you?

- Hey, baby!
- Creep!

12
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,382
Bye, gorgeous.

13
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,519
<i>- You're going to the phone?
- Sure.</i>

14
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,460
- It's Sunday.
- See you later.

15
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,064
- Wanna buy?
- No, thanks.

<i>Gum, gum for a peso!</i>

17

<i>Chewing gum...</i>

18
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,492
Yeah, I saw her yesterday at home.

19
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,900
Same time, of course.

20
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,458
We'll take a cab.

21
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,727
Sure.

00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,873
- Carlitos?
- Mommy!

23
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,504
Happy birthday, sweetie!

24
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,511
Maybe I should start calling you Carlos.

25
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,810
Granny says I'll have a mustache soon.

26
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:57,045
- I'm nine.
- Did you get the gift I sent you?

27
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,057
I've got them on.

28
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,889
- There's something else coming, okay?
- What is it?

29
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,463
- You'll see, at your party.
- I'm ready to go to L.A., Mommy.

30
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,304
- I know, baby.
- I speak good English now.

31
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,138
I'm working very hard
so you can come soon.

32
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,612
You always say that.

33
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,482
I know, but it won't be long now,
okay?

34
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,314
Not long... But when?

35
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:36,460
I don't know, sweetheart.
It's so hard to get papers.

36
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,520
And you know how
the other lawyer robbed us.

37
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,759
If I can't go there,
then you come back here.

38
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,767
Four years is too long.

39
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,610
You need anything, sweetie?

40
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,438
You.

41
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,552
Tell me where you're standing.

42
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,990
I'm-You know already.

43
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,822
Tell me anyway.

44
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, I'm standing at
a phone booth by the bus stop.

45
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,002
Is the pizza place still there?

46
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,038
Yeah. It's here.

47
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,807
<i>And there's a Laundromat
where I wash my clothes every week.</i>

48
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,574
<i>They even know me by name.</i>

49
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,809
<i>- Really?
- Can you believe it?</i>

50
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,818
<i>- You know what else is here?
- What?</i>

51
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:39,483
<i>- A store that sells party stuff.
- Where the mural is?</i>

52
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,689
<i>Yes, there.
That's where I'll buy the stuff...</i>

53
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,698
<i>for all the parties
I'm gonna throw for you...</i>

54
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,759
You have 20 seconds left on your call.
- Carlitos...

55
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,907
I love you with all my heart.

56
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,102
I love you more than
all the earth and all the sea.

57
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,510
And all the stars and all the sky.

58
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,416
Will you call me next Sunday, Mommy?

59
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,615
Of course I will, sweetie.
10:00 a. m. Sharp like every Sunday, okay?

60
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,749
I love you so much. Enjoy all your-

61
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,654
You're so sweet.
Thanks for coming.

62
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,698
Leave the girl alone "Compadre. "
What a flirt.

63
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,330
- Look.
- Is that it?

64
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,600
- Uh-huh.
- Wow.

65
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,142
Hey, Chito!
How cool is that?

66
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,237
- It's awesome!
- That's one big piñata.

67
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,147
Yeah, my mom sent Granny
extra money to buy it for me.

68
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,151
You deserve it, son.

69
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,312
Carlitos, get my medicine please.

70
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,125
Ugh. Why are they here?
Those sons of-

71
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,025
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

72
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,189
- How you doin', Benita?
- Fine.

73
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,789
Came by to give the boy a hug.

74
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,131
- We're so fond of him.
- Is that so?

75
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,438
Well, we're gonna go put
the candles on the cake.

76
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,706
- Got any matches?
- By the grill, if there's any.

77
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,105
Excuse us.

78
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,717
Don't let them get to you.
It's bad for your health.

79
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,717
What's up, Carlitos?

80
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,727
Give me five.

81
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,561
- Happy birthday, kiddo.
- Thanks.

82
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,896
No, no. Hold it!

83
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,863
You thought about what I said?

84
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,906
<i>C'mon, Carlitos!</i>

85
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,532
My granny is gonna get better.

86
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,239
Your granny is very sick...

87
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,838
and who knows when
your mother's coming back.

88
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,750
Someone has to take care of you.

89
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,980
My granny takes good care of me.

90
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,215
Besides, what do you care?

91
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,355
- Leave him alone.
- No. It's what we're here for.

92
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,056
Besides, he's old enough
to know the truth.

93
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,326
Not now, Manuel. It's his party.

94
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:44,108
Look, Carlitos.
Josefina and I are your aunt and uncle.

95
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,544
Neighbors. Not family.

96
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,547
Your dad is my brother.

97
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,944
- I don't have a dad.
- Yes, you do! His name is Oscar.

98
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,648
He lives in the U.S.
In a city called Tucson.

99
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,212
Go outside, son.

100
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,954
<i>Hurry, Carlitos!</i>

101
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,520
<i>Carlitos, Carlitos!</i>

102
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,088
You're up!

103
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,327
<i>Oh, so now we're family?</i>

104
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,565
<i>If I remember, you all denied
your brother was his father.</i>

105
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,572
<i>That was a long time ago, Benita.</i>

106
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,767
I'm too old for this bullshit.

107
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,037
I know exactly what this is about...

108
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,136
and it's got nothing to do
with Carlitos.

109
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,776
I guess you don't know
about the $300...

110
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,784
Rosario sends every month, right?

111
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,950
Get out!

112
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,755
# Hit it, hit it, hit it
Careful with your aim #

113
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,259
- Come on!
- Manuel-

114
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,892
<i>- #Because if you lose it,
you will lose your way #</i>

115
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:46,904
<i>#Now you hit it once
now you hit it twice #</i>

116
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,135
<i>#Now you hit it three times
and your time is up #</i>

117
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,959
Did you enjoy your party?

118
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,031
Did you like your gifts?

119
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,877
If you don't want to talk,
we won't talk.

120
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,783
Why didn't you tell me about my dad?

121
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:40,556
Your mother was going to tell you
when you got a little older.

122
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:49,025
- Is it true what Manuel said?
- What did he say?

123
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,830
That Mom won't be back
any time soon.

124
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,344
Is she coming back or not?

125
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,343
Don't cry.

126
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,751
<i>Carlitos, you are a Reyes...</i>

127
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,086
and we Reyes are strong.

128
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,428
Come here.

129
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,000
Promise me you won't let them
take me away from you!

130
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,733
I'd kill them first!

131
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,908
<i>We're back...</i>

132
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,350
<i>with a new program
and it's a pleasure.</i>

133
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:46,950
<i>Good morning!
Time to get up if this is your alarm.</i>

134
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,290
<i>- Up, up, up!
- Are you up?</i>

135
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,399
<i>You have to go to work, man!</i>

136
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,902
<i>For those of us who came
to the U.S. To work! Work!</i>

137
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,461
<i>Work to make ends meet!</i>

138
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,134
- So how did the dress turn out?
- The girl was happy.

139
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,338
- How much did her parents pay you?
- $53 dollars...

140
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,677
With that I have about $2,000-

141
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,978
2,300 more or less.

142
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,882
The new lawyer said he would
take your case for $4,000, right?

143
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,889
Yes.

144
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,984
So you've only got about...

145
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,163
48 more dresses to go.

146
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,998
Yeah.

147
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,969
What's the matter?
What did I say now?

148
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,643
We should just get a couple
of"gringos" to marry us.

149
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,021
It'd be cheaper and faster.

150
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,275
Oh, God.

151
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,339
You'd never do it, would you?

152
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,542
I've done a lot of stupid things
in my life.

153
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,553
I don't want to do another one.

154
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,731
<i>More fun with Cucuy de la Manana!</i>

155
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:42,170
<i>In the news, California's Governor
Arnold Chuarche- That guy-</i>

156
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,573
<i>decided to veto once again...</i>

157
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,737
<i>a bill that would have allowed
more than two and a half million...</i>

158
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,304
<i>"undocumented"to drive freely.</i>

159
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:56,287
<i>The Governor of California insisted
he would not pass a law...</i>

160
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,324
<i>that threatened public safety.</i>

161
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,849
<i>Well, he is a threat to us!</i>

162
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,953
<i>Isn't it true?</i>

163
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,760
<i>What's it to him?
He's an immigrant who...</i>

164
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,063
<i>came here from farther away
than we did!</i>

165
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,535
<i>- Which makes him a jerk!
- A turkey!</i>

166
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,438
<i>Man, I'm telling you.</i>

167
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,035
<i>Don't run into him.
He might run over you with his bike!</i>

168
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,371
Hi.

169
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,452
We missed you yesterday.

170
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,625
- You two have a nice day.
- Thanks.

171
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,126
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

172
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,496
You're such a fool.

173
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,427
Don't start with that again!

174
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,906
What's the matter with you?
Paco is a great guy.

175
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,636
He's got a good job and he likes you.
What more do you want?

176
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,579
Your life doesn't have to stop
because your son isn't here.

177
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,139
I mean, we're screwed,
but we're not dead!

178
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:03,382
That's not it. Besides,
you party enough for both of us.

179
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:07,482
Wait a second.
I'm just looking for Mr. Right.

180
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,254
There's nothing wrong with that!

181
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,489
And so should you.
Loosen up, tight-ass!

182
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,444
- How's it going?
- Good.

183
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,449
Whoa! Are those new?

184
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,644
Yeah, my mom sent them
for my birthday.

185
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,281
Man,
you're so lucky to have a mom...

186
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,518
who buys you such cool stuff!

187
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,661
I know.
Come on, let's go.

188
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,066
- How did it go yesterday?
- Good, I sold lots of gum.

189
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,628
- Coming to the wrestling match?
- Nah! Gotta work.

190
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,716
<i>Are all three of you crossing?</i>

191
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,083
God has set us on this path.

192
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,179
<i>- A truck is leaving at 11:00.
- Tonight?</i>

193
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:19,464
What's the problem?

194
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,304
<i>No, no problem. It's just
we didn't think it would be so soon.</i>

195
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,672
- So, who's driving?
- What the hell do you care?

196
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,847
<i>Look, honey.
You've got two choices.</i>

197
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,351
You either get on that truck
or you swim across...

198
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,649
and see if you make it.

199
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,915
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

200
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,923
Are you Carmen?

201
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,587
Doña Carmen, if you don't mind.

202
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:56,896
Um, my brother and I,
we are legal U.S. Citizens-

203
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,903
From the United States.

204
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,939
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

205
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,531
Um, can you tell her that-

206
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,545
that, um, we can take babies across?

207
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,707
- They wanna know-
- I understood!

208
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,272
Tell them to go to hell!

209
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,787
<i>- Sorry, no business.
- No, wait. Did you tell her?</i>

210
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,119
- Did she understand?
- Did we understand?

211
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,092
<i>Damn Chicanos,
can't even speak their own language!</i>

212
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,629
- What is she saying? What did she just say?
- You better leave.

213
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,630
- Did she understand?
- Yes.

214
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,188
Did you understand what I said?

215
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,599
Martha, let's just go talk to that
coyote your friend told us about.

216
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,297
<i>David, wait. Senora.</i>

217
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,637
<i>I'm offering to help you.</i>

218
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,642
- Please, you better leave.
- Let's go.

219
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,543
- Let's go.
- Please.

220
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,912
- Come on, Sis.
- Okay, but if she changes her mind...

221
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,645
will you just call me here?

222
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,415
I'm leaving my card with him.

223
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,322
Just call me. Just tell her.

224
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,326
- I told you.
- Well, you weren't much help.

225
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,954
What do you expect me to do?

226
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,956
They think they're better than us
just because...

227
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,298
they were born on the "other side"?

228
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,997
You've used Chicanos to take
babies to their mothers.

229
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,132
Yeah, ones I know, not strangers.

230
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,508
Besides, those are two
very green mangoes.

231
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,513
And with those scared faces...

232
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,982
the "Migra" will spot them
a mile away.

233
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,918
So... do we have a deal?

234
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,513
Okay, let's go.

235
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,493
So, it'll be $2,000 to get you across...

236
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,029
<i>or $2,500 if you also want
job contacts.</i>

237
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,366
All right, Carlitos...

238
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:40,930
tell me what you want
for your birthday.

239
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,473
The same thing I wanted last year,
and for Children's Day...

240
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,641
- Three Kings Day and Easter.
- I know where you're going with this!

241
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,048
You want me to get you across.
But I won't.

242
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,020
Are you crazy?
You have no idea how dangerous it is!

243
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,257
- I have money.
- I don't pay you that much.

244
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,727
Been saving some of the money
my mom sends every month.

245
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,161
- I've got $1,200.
- How much?

246
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:16,537
- $1,200.
- Wow, that's a lot.

247
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,076
I'm supposed to be
the businesswoman here!

248
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,710
- You could give me a discount.
- No, no, no.

249
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,646
I promised your mother
and your grandmother...

250
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,515
I would never get you across.

251
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,683
If they found out you're even working
for me, they'd pull my hair out.

252
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,692
You're nuts. No way.

253
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,403
Granny...

254
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,342
do you want tea or hot chocolate?

255
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,950
Granny.

256
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,420
Granny, don't pretend
you're still asleep.

257
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,686
Granny.

258
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,286
Granny!

259
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,569
<i>Wake up.</i>

260
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,982
Granny? Granny?

261
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,143
Granny.

262
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,653
Wake up, Granny. Please!

263
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,350
Please, no!
Please, no.

264
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,497
Please, no!

265
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,167
For Chito.

266
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,110
<i>My godfather will take care of you.</i>

267
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:34,303
<i>I'm gonna go find my mom
before she forgets about me.</i>

268
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,186
<i>Help me get there before Sunday
so she won't worry.</i>

269
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,393
I'll miss you so much, Granny.

270
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,276
<i>I'll get it.</i>

271
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,423
<i>Who's at the door?</i>

272
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,914
<i>Why can't you come home?</i>

273
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,480
Is she there?
I can hear her voice.

274
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,719
Hello? Hello?

275
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,630
Do you need anything else
before I leave?

276
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,140
- You did the upstairs bathroom?
- Yes, ma'am.

277
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,802
What about the plants outside?
They need to go into bigger pots.

278
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,546
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. McKenzie,
but you didn't mention the plants.

279
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm quite sure I did.

280
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,415
Well, if you'd show me which ones,
I'll do them first thing in the morning.

281
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,425
<i>Why can't you do them now?</i>

282
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,656
Well, I go to another home
in the afternoons.

283
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,926
Well, then, never mind.

284
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,533
<i>I suppose I'll have to do it myself.</i>

285
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,968
I can do them in the morning.
Don't worry.

286
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,474
Forget it. Forget it.

287
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,249
<i>How was Cruella De Vil today?</i>

288
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,047
Same as always.

289
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,644
Poor woman.
With a husband like that.

290
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,849
Yeah.
You're going to the Snyders' now?

291
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,152
<i>Yeah, I have to pick Tommy
up at school.</i>

292
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,363
What you got there?

293
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,922
A study guide for the citizenship exam.

294
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,468
If the lawyer works out,
I'll have to take it.

295
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,470
I don't know any U.S. History though.

296
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,836
It's easy.

297
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,736
First they screwed the poor Indians.
Then they screwed the slaves.

298
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,541
- And now they're screwing us Mexicans!
- Amen!

299
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,284
Ah, here's my date.

300
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,188
Wait. Wait.

301
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,560
He's trying to be a rapper,
needs to look like one.

302
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,331
Very convincing.

303
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,962
Well, I'm off.
See you at home.

304
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,804
<i>- Be careful.
- Yeah.</i>

305
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,291
I'm gonna get going.

306
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,555
- Say hi to Tommy.
- Okay.

307
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,006
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yeah.

308
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,380
<i>What's up, buddy?</i>

309
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:43,120
Okay, um, you pay now?
The money?

310
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,059
Here. Could you just count that?

311
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,765
Okay. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

312
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,538
- It's all here.
- Here. Help me with this.

313
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,121
Are you kidding me?
They're gonna check this.

314
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,058
I don't know about this.

315
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,764
I can do it.

316
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,734
<i>- Watch your head.
- Okay.</i>

317

<i>You okay?</i>

318
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,444
<i>Get the bag in the back.</i>

319
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,538
I have a bad feeling about this.

320
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,167
This isn't really the time to be having
bad feelings, David. We're here.

321
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,805
- I just don't think it's worth it.
- Is it worth your tuition?

322
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,383
You want to drop out of school,
or you want to get the money?

323
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,888
It's your choice.

What if he passes out?

331
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,826
<i>- Shh. He's not gonna pass out.
- What if he does?</i>

332
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,727
Too hot.

333
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,356
You have to be quiet, Carlitos.

334

Not yet.

346
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,965
- Open the trunk, please.
- What do we do?

347
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,306
Do me a favor.
Run the plates for me.

348

- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank-Thank you, Officer.

356
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,814
Good.

357

<i>Welcome to the United States of America.</i>

<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

360
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,569
Uh, are you aware that
your tags are expired?

361
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,436
<i>- And you owe several hundred dollars in parking tickets.
- What?</i>

362
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,907
<i>Looks like you'll be
spending the night here in El Paso.</i>

- Well, you know how it is.

366
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,180
<i>Yeah. But you can afford
to take a trip to Mexico.</i>

367
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,381
- Let's pay right now.
- Give me that money.

368
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,254
- Ma'am, please, can we just please pay now?
- Officer, please.

369
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,849
Ma'am, we can pay them now.

370
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,862
<i>Sir, will you just let us
pay for the tickets now?</i>

371
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,956
There's a cheap motel in El Paso
two blocks from the D.M.V.

372
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,127
You can pay for your parking tickets there.
The D.M.V. Opens up at 8:00 a. m.

373
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,297
Miss, there's just no way that I could
give you the money for the tickets?

374
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,898
- No, you can't. Sorry.
- Get out of the car.

375
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,239
<i>- Can we go with the car to El Paso?
- Take your belongings with you.</i>

376
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,040
Lock the doors.
Roll those windows up.

377
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,741
- Come on. Gotta get out.
- We need to keep our car.

378
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,249
<i>Come on. You're holding my line.
We don't got all day.</i>

379

Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

<i>What the hell were you thinking, David?</i>

383
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,130
"I'm sorry" is not
good enough right now.

384
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,300
...as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

385

but deliver us from evil.</i>

390
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,097
Time to go to sleep, okay?

391
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,232
- Good night, Tommy.
- Good night, Rosario.

392
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,798
Good night.

393
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,779
Rosario.

394
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,212
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry we're late.

395
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,944
- How was it?
- Oh, you know how banquets are.

396
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,718
Oh, my goodness.
Are you already asleep?

397
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,529
I don't think so.
You're trying to fool me, aren't you?

398
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,241
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:21,183
Well, actually, I forgot he offered
to give me a ride. I'm sorry.

400
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,653
- It's okay.
- Thank you for the ride anyway. Thank you.

401
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,589
- Good night, Rosario.
- Good night.

402
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,389
- Good night, Mr. Snyder.
- Good night, Paco.

403
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:37,000
- What are you doing here?
- Alicia said you were working late.

404
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,002
Come on. I'll take you home.

405
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,402
You should just date Alicia.
She's a lot more fun.

406
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,844
Ain't that the truth!
But I've always liked the quiet ones.

407
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,010
So, are you coming?
Or should I walk you home?

408
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,189
Okay, fine.

409
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:21,034
I know I said I liked them quiet...

410
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,046
but not mute!

411
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,286
Are you thinking about your son?

412
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,828
What you're doing
takes courage, Rosario.

413
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,575
The last time I talked to him,
he sounded angry.

414
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,113
I don't want him to grow up
with that anger.

415
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:03,046
It's just... I'm hurting him more
by being here, away from him.

416
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,489
He doesn't know why I left.
He only knows I left him.

417
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,529
That's why I want to be with my son.

418
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,126
Right now.

419
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,762
So, what are you waiting for?

420
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,170

Well, do what people do here.

00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:14,155
You don't know?
Yes, you know. I'm gonna tell you.

464
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:18,183
<i>You're gonna pay up!
That's what you're gonna do.</i>

465
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,062
Because I sure didn't drive
all around town for nothing!

466
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,692
Where are we going?

467
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,491
Don't move.

468
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,714
- Come on.
- Let go of me!

469
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,723
Be good!

470
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,291
<i>Let go of me!</i>

471
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,372
- What are you doing, Güerro?
- Mind your own business, Reina.

472
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,410
- I'm not goin'-
- C'mon, c'mon, get outta here!

473
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,240
- I'm not goin' anywhere.
- Move, you idiot!

474
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,543
- Reina!
- I said move!

475
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,550
And you get the hell out of here!
You're all messed up!

476
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,143
- I don't know you, woman!
- But I do know you!

477
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,916
- You son of a bitch!
- No kid, no deal.

478
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,924
- No kid, no deal.
- The kid owes me money.

479
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,619
<i>- No kid. No deal.
- How much?</i>

480
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,390
- A hundred bucks.
- Here, here.

481
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,590
- That's not a hundred-
- Go get high as a kite!

482
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,396
Jerk!

483
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,603
Reina, you're such a busybody!

484
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,074
You okay?

485
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,711
Careful with your green cards.

486
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,344
And the maps I gave you. Okay?

487
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,508
- You guys are set.
- Thank you, Doña Carmen.

488
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,743
What are you doing
with Carlitos's Walkman?

489
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,751
What's it to you?

490
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,878
I gave it to him,
that's why I'm asking.

491
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,686
- He left it for me.
- What do you mean left it?

492
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,217
His grandma died,
so he went looking for his mother.

493
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,456
He crossed over.

494
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,906
The dinner is in the oven, Mrs. McKenzie.
See you tomorrow.

495
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,472
<i>Actually, I want to
talk to you about that.</i>

496
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,609
<i>I'm going to let you go.</i>

497
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,549
Excuse me?
Did I do something wrong?

498
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:37,151
No, no, no, no. I've just decided
I'd like to try someone new.

499
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,029
Someone new?

500
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,398
But I really need this job,
Mrs. McKenzie.

501
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,699
But you have another job
already, don't you?

502
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,705
Well, yes.
But I need both jobs.

503
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,707
I need to send some money to my kid.

504
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,108
Oh, for God's sake, Rosario.
You'll find something else.

505
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,443
'Cause you're young.

506
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,223
Well, I need to get paid
for the last couple of days.

507
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,225
I don't think so.

508
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,353
But I've worked half the week.
You can't do this.

509
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,894
What are you going to do,
call the police? Here.

510
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,598
Ah, I just remembered.

511
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,507
You're an illegal, aren't you?

512
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,511
Not a good idea.

513
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,979
<i>Five...</i>

514
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,042
<i>six...</i>

515
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,211
<i>seven...</i>

516
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,489
<i>eight...</i>

517
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,991
nine, ten...

518
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,550
eleven!

519
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,962
So, are you going to
take me to the bus?

520
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,867
Not a chance! Not after
what happened this afternoon.

521
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,636
You're too young to travel alone.

522
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,611
Mmm.

523
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:05,614
It's just... I have to be there
by Sunday morning.

524
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:08,173
Well, then we'll have to
think of something.

525
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,486
<i>- Where are you, Donita?
- Hello!</i>

526
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,251
<i>- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon, Mrs. Reina.</i>

527
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,349
<i>Hello.</i>

528
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,893
Who are they?

529
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,520
Illegals, like you.

530
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,761
<i>Watch out.
The main man has arrived!</i>

531
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,433
What smells so good, Reina?
Meatballs!

532
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,701
<i>Caray!</i>

533
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,780
And who are you?

534
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,442
Carlos Reyes, at your service.

535
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,350
Leonardo Sanchez Nava,
nice meeting you too, buddy.

536
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,649
Your tenants are getting
younger every day.

537
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,721
Wash your hands!

538
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,264
- Go on, dirty bastards.
- Help me set the table.

539
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,722
Come on.

540
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,133
Do we look like
the seven dwarfs to you?

541
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,137
Damn, this is good!

542
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,272
And it'd be even better with a beer.

543
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,078
<i>- Yeah, a cold one.
- Hey!</i>

544
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,422
Don't get Reina mad.
You know the rules.

545
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,013
No booze.

546
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:24,185
We just gotta take it...
like men.

547
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,321
<i>Unless... my "Chivas"are
playing against "America!"</i>

548
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,499
<i>There you have it. Cheers!</i>

549
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,765
<i>Move back, move back!</i>

550
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,899
<i>- Let me see!
- Watch it there!</i>

551
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,777
<i>- There he goes!
- Shoot, shoot!</i>

552
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,882
Goal!

553
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,549
...a classic! The "Chivas" score!

554
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,783
You thought they'd beat us!

555
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,759
A fluke, buddy. Just a fluke.

556
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,194
The meatballs!

557
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,740
- That's who we're picking up.
- Them?

558
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,478
<i>- Who's this?
- We're taking him to L.A.</i>

559
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,785
- We still got three jobs to do!
- So he'll come with us.

560
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,760
To the fields?

561
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,230
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?

562
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,499
- Then you're being stupid!
- Okay, let's get going!

563
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,300
If you don't like it,
get another ride. C'mon!

564
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,501
Okay, move over.

565
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,506
Make room, buddy.
Watch it!

566
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,817
- Watch it! Cool it!
- Move the backpack.

567

<i>#He came from the sky

<i>Listen, everyone. Put on the hats.</i>

571
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,296
Boxes are over there.
Questions?

572
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:18,138
- No.
- Then, get to work!

573
