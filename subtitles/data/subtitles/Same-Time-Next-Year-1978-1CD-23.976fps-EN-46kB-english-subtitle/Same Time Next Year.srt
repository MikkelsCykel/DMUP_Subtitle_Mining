I'm sorry.
It's all right.

153
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,080
No sense crying
over spilt milk.

154
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,083
Yeah, you're right.

155
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,461
How comewe feel
so terrible?

156
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,382
Because we're two decent,
honest people, and this thing
is tearing us apart.

157
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,176
I mean, I know
it wasn't our fault,
but I--

158
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,097
I keep seeing the faces
of my children and the look
ofbetrayal in their eyes.

159
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,766
I keep thinking
about mymarriage vows,

160
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,811
the trust my wiFe
has placed in me...

161
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,857
and all the eXperiences
we've shared together.

162
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,067
And you know
the worst part of it all?

163
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,278
What?

164
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,949
While I'm thinking
all this,

165
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,493
I have this fantastic
hard-on.

166
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,792
I reallywish
you hadn't said that.

167
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,628
I'm sorry. I think
we should be totally honest
with each other.

168
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,882
It's not that.
It's that I have to
go to confession.

169
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,724
You know--

170
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,895
W-We're both crazy.
You know that, don't you?

171
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:17,983
I mean, this sort ofthing
happens every day
to millions of people.

172
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:23,030
You don't use actual names
in confession, doyou?
No.

173
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,125
Doris, may I
askyou something?

174
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,170
Sure.

175
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,881
Would you go to bed
with me again?

176
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,258
Oh, George, I can't.

177
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:46,345
Why not?
'Cause we'd just
feel worse afterwards.

178
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,473
Oh, no. I'm over that now.
I just remembered something.

179
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,975
What?
The Russians
have the bomb.

180
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,394
We could all be dead
tomorrow.

181
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,272
George, I think
you're clutching
at straws.

182
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,150
Doris, don'tyou
understand?
No.

183
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,028
We're two
grown-up people.

184
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:07,533
We have absolutely nothing
to be ashamed or afraid of.

185
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,578
[Loud Knocking]

186
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,208
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

187
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,877
[Knocking Continues ]
What are we gonna do?

188
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,547
What are we gonna do?
[Knocking]

189
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,799
Uh-- Coming!
My hat. My bag.

190
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,134
What?
My hat! My bag!

191
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,888
Be right there.

192
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,059
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Where are you going?

193
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,898
Okay.

194
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,776
- Don't go in the bathroom.
- Why not?

195
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,113
That's the first place
they'd look.

196
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,073
Oh!

197
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,749
Oh, hello.
[Man ] Oh, goodmorning,
Mr. Peters.

198
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,503
- I've gotyourbreakFast.
Didyou have a good night?
- Yes. Fine, fine.

199
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:05,507
Uh, y-you know,
I think I heard
an owl out here.

200
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,971
[ George Continues Talking,
Indistinct ]

201
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:24,776
I'm a C.P.A. When you work
hard allyear, it's great
to get back to nature.

202
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,404
I really loved it.
That's right.

203
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,033
Wel l, thank you,
Mr. Chal mers.
You're welcome.

204
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,118
Have a nice day, now.
Thankyou. You too.

205
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,455
- Enjoy the view.
- Yes, I will. I'lljust
wanderaround bymyselF.

206
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,962
Doris?

207
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,385
Doris?

208
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,767
Have you got
a woman in there?

209
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:02,064
It's okay.
It was old Mr. Chalmers
with my breakfast.

210
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,859
I was very calm.
He didn't suspect a thing.
He didn't ask about the girdle.

211
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,820
- What?
- Girdle.

212
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,033
Oh, great!

213
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,619
Now he probably thinks
I'm a homo.
Oh, well.

214
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,956
What do you care?
I stay here
everyyear.

215
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,375
Oh, yeah? How come?

216
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,253
I have a friend
who went into the wine
business near here.

217
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:28,715
I fly out the same weekend
everyyear to do his books.
From New Jersey?

218
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,385
He was my first client.
It's sort of
a sentimental thing.

219
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,387
Oh, I see.

220
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,935
Uh, Doris, I'd like
to tell you something.
Okay.

221
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,938
You probably think
I do this sort ofthing
all the time.

222
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,692
I know I must appear
very smooth and glib
and seXual.

223
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,904
But since I've been married,
this is theveryfirst time
I've done this.

224
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,951
Ah, sure. Don't worry.
I could tell.

225
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,580
Listen, would you mind
ifl had a little
ofyour breakfast?

226
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,499
Sure.
I'm not hungry.
Thankyou.

227
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:07,171
Even when I was single,
I was no goodat quick,
superfiicial affairs.

228
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,048
I always had to like
the person-- What do you mean,
you could tell?

229
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,594
- I n what way
could you tell?
- What? Oh.

230
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,804
Uh, well, it was
just little things,

231
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,266
you know, like when you tried
to takeyour pants off
overyour shoes...

232
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:23,103
and t-- tripped
and hityour head
on the coffee table.

233
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,939
Just little things
like that.

234
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,570
It's great to be
totally honest with
another person, isn't it?

235
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,906
It sure is.

236
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,034
Doris, I haven't been
totally honest with you.
You haven't?

237
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:43,081
- I told you I was a married
man with two children.
- You're not?

238
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm a married man
with three children.

239
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,841
I thought it would make me
seem less married.

240
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:56,512
All right,
I didn't think it through,
all right?

241
00:18:56,428 --> 00:19:00,432
There's been like a lead weight
inside me all morning.

242
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:03,685
I mean,
denying little Debbie
like that!

243
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,942
I was under a certain stress
or I wouldn't have done it.

244
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,737
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Y-You understand?

245
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:17,824
Sure. We all do
dopey things sometimes.

246
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,707
Well...
[ Sighs ]

247
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,544
I really should be going.

248
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,505
The nuns are gonna bewondering
what happened to me.

249
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:40,138
Nuns?
Did you say nuns?

250
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,725
Yeah, somehow
itjust didn't seem right
to bring up last night,

251
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:47,938
but I was on myway
to retreat.

252
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:49,982
Retreat?
Yeah.

253
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,025
See, it's right near here.

254
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,821
I go everyyear at this time
when Harry takes the kids
to Bakersfield.

255
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,073
What's in Bakersfield?
His mother.

256
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,075
It's her birthday.

257
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,954
Doesn't she mind
thatyou don't go?
No, she hates me.

258
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,666
'Cause I got pregnant.
Her son had something
to do with that.

259
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,669
Yeah, she blocks that
out ofher mind.

260
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,255
See, he was
in his firstyear
of dental college...

261
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:17,509
and he had to quit
and take a job selling
waterless cooking.

262
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,888
So now everyyear
on her birthday,
I just go on retreat.

263
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,806
To think about God?

264
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,268
Well, him too, sure,
but also about myself...

265
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:30,230
'cause, see, I got pregnant
when I was just 1 8,

266
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,901
so I've never really
had any time to just think.

267
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,612
You know,
I mean, about,

268
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,656
well,
what I think about.

269
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,744
Never mind.
I don't know what
I'm trying to say.

270
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,372
Sometimes I think
I'm crazy.
Why?

271
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,876
Oh. Well,

272
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,378
okay,
like, take my life.

273
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:58,258
Now, we live in
a two-bedroom dupleX
in downtown Oakland,

274
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,678
and we have
a 1 948 Studebaker,

275
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,306
a blond, three-piece
dinette set,

276
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,266
Motorola TV.

277
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,936
We go bowling
at least once a week.

278
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:12,022
I mean, what more
could anyone ask for?

279
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,150
But sometimes...

280
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,236
things get me down.

281
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,489
Oh, I don't know.
It's dumb.

282
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,161
I don't think
it's dumb.

283
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,622
You don't?
No.

284
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,754
You know, I can really
talk toyou.

285
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,631
It's just amazing.

286
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,969
I find myselfsaying things
toyou that I didn't
even know I thought.

287
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:45,180
I noticed thatyesterday
right afterwe met
in the restaurant.

288
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,683
We had instant rapport.
Did you notice that too?

289
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:51,854
No, but I know
we really hit it off.

290
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,482
See, Harry's not much
of a talker, you know.

291
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,819
How 'bout yourwife?
Do you two get
to talk a lot?

292
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,366
Uh-- Uh, Doris,
it's only natural...

293
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,452
that we should be curious
about each other's
husband and wife,

294
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,581
but-but rather
than dwelling on it
and letting it spoil everything,

295
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,791
why-- why don't we--
why don't we do this?

296
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,043
I'll tell you two stories
about mywife--

297
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,172
one showing the worst side
ofher, the other showing
the best side ofher.

298
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,799
You do the same thing
aboutyourhusband,
and then let's Forget it.

299
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,926
Okay.
I'll go First.

300
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,012
I'll start with
the worst side.
Okay.

301
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,391
Phyllis knows about us.
Oh, you said that before.
How could she know?

302
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:33,020
She's got this thing
in her head!
Like a plate?

303
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:37,733
A plate?
Oh, my uncle
has one ofthose.

304
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,693
He was wounded
in the war,

305
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,654
and they put
this steel plate
in his head.

306
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:47,075
Now he says
he can always tell
when it's going to rain.

307
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,372
I'm in big trouble,
Doris.
Why?

308
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:55,792
Because I find
everything you say
absolutely fascinating.

309
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,588
Come on! Tell me
aboutyourwife's
steel plate.

310
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:04,218
No, no, it's not a plate.
It's more like a bell.
A bell.

311
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,971
I could be a million miles away.
Ifl look at anotherwoman,
it goes offlike an alarm.

312
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,890
Oh, I see.

313
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:14,645
I just know that last night
at eXactly 1 :22 a.m.,
she sat bolt upright in bed...

314
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,440
with her head
going ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding!

315
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,400
Howdoyouknow
it was 1:22?

316
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,403
Because I have peripheral
vision, and I noticed
mywatch said 4:47.

317
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,365
Oh.

318
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:30,619
Well, okay, now,
tell me, um, something
nice about her.

319
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:37,376
Well... she made me
believe in myself.

320
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,257
It's probably hard foryou
to imagine this, but there was
a time I was very insecure.

321
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:47,803
How did she do that--
makeyou believe
in yourself?

322
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:49,638
She married me.

323
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,891
Oh. Yes, well, that was
very nice ofher.

324
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,228
Oh, no, no, no.
I meant bolstering you up
and all, you know?

325
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:59,690
Okay, your turn.
Tell me the worst story first.

326
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,650
Okay. Um--

327
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,697
Ooh, this is hard.
To pick one?

328
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,740
No, to think of one.

329
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,244
See, Harry's
the salt ofthe earth.
Everybody says so.

330
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:15,289
Look, you owe me
at least one rotten story.

331
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:17,249
Oh, okay.

332
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:20,794
Uh--

333
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:24,965
Well, I don't know.
This isn't really rotten,
but-- Okay?

334
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,925
All right.

335
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,220
Now, this was on
our fourth anniversary.

336
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:33,473
We decided that we'd
have some people over
to help celebrate.

337
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:36,518
So Harry doesn't
usually drink,

338
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:40,564
but that night
he had three beers.

339
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,275
It was after
the Gillette fights.

340
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,572
Well, I just overheard him
talking to some ofthe guys,

341
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,657
and he said that his--

342
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,952
his time in the army
were the bestyears
ofhis life.

343
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:59,208
What's wrong with that?
A lot of guys feel that way
about the service.

344
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,043
Harrywas in the army
for fouryears,

345
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:04,588
and three of'em were spent
in a Japanese prison camp!

346
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,261
Okay. Now doyou
want to hear the story
about the good side ofhim?

347
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,555
Not particularly.
Aw, come on.
You have to.

348
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,600
I don't wantyou to get
the wrong impression ofhim.
Okay, iFyou insist.

349
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,686
I do. Okay.

350
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,940
Harry's this, like,
big, heavyset kind of guy,
you know--

351
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,734
I reallywish
you hadn't told me that.
Why?

352
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:29,404
Oh! No, don't worry.
He's gentle as a puppy.

353
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,616
Anyway, uh, last year
he got this great idea...

354
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,160
that he'd take Tony out
to fly a kite.

355
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,120
See, Tony's
our four-year-old.

356
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,749
And so theywent out
to the park to fly a kite,
but there wasn't anywind.

357
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:45,003
So it's about an hour later,
and I was on myway home
from the laundromat.

358
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,880
I passed by...

359
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,175
and I see Tony
sound asleep in the car.

360
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,219
I look out in the park.

361
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,055
There's Harry all alone
in the park,

362
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,432
all red in the face
and out ofbreath,

363
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,060
and he's just pounding
up and down...

364
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:04,857
with this huge kite
dragging on the ground
behind him.

365
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,279
Oh, I don't know.
Itjust really got to me.

366
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,447
Yeah, I know.

367
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,868
Helen has
some nice qualities too.
Who's Helen?

368
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,828
Mywife.

369
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:20,789
You said her name
was Phyllis.

370
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,128
I know. I lied.

371
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,381
Phyllis! Helen!
What's the difference?
I'm married!

372
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:32,718
Look, I was nervous.
I was afraid you'd try
to look me up or something.

373
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:36,096
I didn't want to
leave any clues.

374
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,975
Is your name
really George?
Well, of course it is.

375
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:43,187
You think I'd lie
about my own name?

376
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,899
Yes.
That would be crazy!

377
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,903
Well, you're
pretty crazy.

378
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,534
It's funny, isn't it?

379
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:02,623
Here we are in a hotel room,
gazing into each other's eyes.

380
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:07,419
We're both married,
and we have siX kids
between us.

381
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,589
Do you have
any pictures?

382
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,926
What?
Pictures ofyour kids.

383
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:16,929
Yeah, but I don't think
this is the time or place.

384
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:20,724
Come on, come on.
Ifyou show meyours,
I'll showyou mine.

385
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,770
I keep mine
in this little folder
we got free from Kodak.

386
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:28,023
Where's yours?
You have to take
the whole wallet.

388
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,740
Ahh!

389
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,243
Ohh.

390
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,663
Is that the oldest one
with the glasses
and baggy tights?

391
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:45,666
Yeah, that's Michael.
Funny-looking kid,
isn't he?

392
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:49,002
No. What does he
wanna be, Superman?

393
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,088
No, Peter Pan.

394
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,131
I'm kinda worried
about him.

395
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,136
Why is this one's face
all scrunched up?

396
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,681
That's Paul.
That was taken
on a roller coaster.

397
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,808
Isn't it
natural looking?

398
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:06,144
Right after that
he threw up.

399
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:09,356
Yeah, he's really, um--

400
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,901
I guess he-- I guess
he takes after Harry.

401

No, both of us, really.

What's your
little girl's name?
Debbie.

403
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,535
That was on her second birthday.
We were trying to get her
to blow out the candles.

404
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:26,665
She's got her hand

NeXt week they're gonna
connect the sewers.
[ Laughing ]

447

It's not eXactly the life
ofScott and Zelda,
but we're surviving.

448
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,209
Uh, let's go over there.

449
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:00,462
Scott and Zelda, huh?
You started reading.

450

Oh, you don't know
the half ofit.

451
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:05,592
I've joined
the Book ofthe Month Club.
Good foryou!

00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:09,012

the alternate selections.

Thankyou.

Good evening,
Mr. Peters, ma'am.

455
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,854
Hello, Mr. Chalmers.
Nice to seeyou again.

456
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,897
Good to be back.

457
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,156
Well, how 'boutyou?
Areyou still
in NewJersey?

458
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,074
No. We moved
to Connecticut.
Really?

459
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:32,828
We bought a barn
and converted it.
Oh, what's it like?

460
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,581
Drafty.
[ Laughing ]

Helen's got
the decorating bug now.

462
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:41,336
I have this mental picture
ofher at my funeral,

463
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,423
as they're closing the lid
to my coffin, throwing in
two fabric swatches...

464
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:49,344
and yelling out,
"Which one doyou like?"
[ Laughing ]

465
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:53,265
That's the bad story
about her.
What else is new?

466
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:55,184
Oh, how's Michael?

467
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:58,604
[ Sighs ]
Crazy as ever.

468
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:02,399
He had this homework assignment
to write about what he did
on his summervacation.

469
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,068
Trouble was, he wrote
what he actually did.
What?

470
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,237
Tried to get laid.
[ Laughs ]

comic detail about
his unfortunate tendency...

to get an erection
on all forms of public
transportation.

473
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,832
The school
almost suspended him.

474
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,168
You're crazy about him,
aren'tyou?

475

He's a veryweird kid,

You know what?
I think that one
really gets toyou.

Come on, now.
Admit it.

478
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:37,267
All right, I admit it.
He's a nice kid.

479
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:40,354
There.
Was that so hard?

480
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:48,362
Mmm.
What was that for?

481
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:53,367
For everything.

482
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:56,495
For this.

483
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,748
For one beautiful weekend

Well, tonight,
of course.

I wish Daddy could
find it foryou,

Was that Debbie?

Her tooth came out,
and she can't find it,

and she's afraid
the tooth fairy
won't know.

Oh, God, that thin,
reedy little voice!

Sure, that cheerful look
on your face doesn't
fool me for a minute.

You think this is funny?

00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:41,201
Doris, my little girl, said,
"I loveyou, Daddy,"

520
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,580
and I answered her in a voice
still hoarse with passion.

I get the picture, George.

Don'tyou ever
feel guilty?

Sometimes.
Well, you never
say anything.

00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:56,967
Well, I just handle it
in a different way.
How?

Privately.

526

really brings you up short.

I mean, look at this.
Look at me. Look.

528
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:10,230
I tell you, Doris,
when she started talking
about the tooth fairy,

529
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:13,317
that affected me
in a very profound manner.

530
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:17,613
On top ofwhich,
I have indigestion
you won't believe.

531
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,698
It hit me that hard,
you know?

532
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:23,494
I have three children too,
you know, George?

What doyou
want me to do?

534
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:28,916
It would be terrific
ifyou stopped talking
about it.

535
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:32,377
It is only making you
feel worse.
I can't feel worse!

That pure little voice--
No, you're right.

No, forget it.
Change the subject.

So t-tell me
about the good story
about Harry.

He went bankrupt.

540
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,644
How can you go bankrupt
selling TV sets?

541
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,064
Harry has one little failing
as a salesman.

542
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:56,985
It's a compulsion
to talk people out ofthings
that they can't really afford.

the killer instinct.

Actually, it's one
ofthe things about him
that I like best.

Oh, listen. Something
just occurred to me.

546
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:10,082
Instead of my leaving at
my usual time, would you mind
ifl left a little earlier?

When didyou have in mind?
There's a plane
in half an hour.

00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:20,259
You want to leave
23 hours early?

549
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:23,262
There's a connecting flight
from San Francisco
in 90 minutes.

550
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,222
I know how you feel.
Really, I do.

551
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,184
I wouldn't suggest it
ifyou weren't a mother
and didn't understand.

552
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:32,104
It wouldn't even occur to me
if-ifthis crisis
hadn't come up.

553
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:35,566
I don't mean
Just the tooth Fairy.

554
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,485
She could have swallowed
the tooth.

555
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:42,614
It could be lodged
God knows where.

Uh... have you seen
my hairbrush?

doingyou a big Favor.

wouldn't be very good company.
I'm thinking oFyou too.

You probably understand.

You feel somewhat
rejected, ri ght?

561
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:19,109
I understand.
Really, I do.

562
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:24,448
I just want you to know
that my leaving has nothing
to do with you and me.

563
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:28,285
This is an emergency!
I have a sick child
at home!

Will you stop?

565
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:35,459
This has nothing to do
with the goddamn
tooth Fairy!

566
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,336
You are simply
feeling guilty,

567
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:41,381
and you wanna get
as far from me as possible.

568
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:44,092
All right!
I feel guilty, yes!

569
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,053
Is that so strange?

570
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,096
Doris, we're cheating.

571
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,766
Once a year
we lie to our families...

572
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,310
and sneak offto a hotel
in California...

573
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,729
and commit adultery!

574
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,982
Not that I want to
stop doing it.

575
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:03,028
Butyes, I feel guilty.
I admit it.

576
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,947
You admit it?

577
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:07,449
You take out ads.

578
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,536
I'll betyou stop strangers
on the street!

579
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:14,540

a scarlet "A" embroidered...

onyourjockeyshorts.

581
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,961
You go around
like an open nerve saying,

582
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:22,172
"Yes, I'm cheating,
but look how guilty I feel,

583
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,925
so I must really be
a nice guy."

584
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:29,847
Then-- Then to top it all,
you have the incredible
arrogance...

585
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:32,975
ofthinking you're
the only person in the world
with a conscience.

586
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,561
Well, that doesn't makeyou
a nice guy, George!

587
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,606
You know what
that makes you?
A horse's ass!

I liked you a lot better
before you joined
the Book ofthe Month Club.

589
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,874
Yes, I'll just bet
you did.

590
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,794
- Look, can we
discuss this in the car?
- The car?

591
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:04,339
I really hate to askyou,
Doris, but I need a lift
to the airport.

592
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,121
Cheer up, Doris.
It's not the end ofthe world.
I'm not leaving you permanently.

No, I don't think
you will.

595
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,462
Just because I have to
leave early oneyear,

596

the thing that bugs me
the most about Helen...

749
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,839
is that she broke
my pecker.

Who's the fifth?

her mother has given him
the bulletin for the 6:00 news.

We haven't
discussed it much.

760
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:38,135

she regards it as a lapse
in one's social responsibility.

for congratulations.

"It's all inyourhead. "

of my pregnancy,

- There's kind of an
ironic twist to all this.
- What?

785
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,647
I didn't graduate
from high school the first time
because I got pregnant.

it's a bit odd becoming
a schoolgirl atyour age.

being the only one in your class

What madeyou do it?
Actually, it was a dinnerparty
that made me decide.

967

Harry's boss invited us over
for dinner, and I just freaked.
Why?

968
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:04,853
Well, I'd spent so much time
at home with the kids
that I reallywasn't sure...

969
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:09,525
I was capable of carrying on
an intelligent conversation with
anyone over the age offive.

970
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:14,112
So, anyway, we went,
and I got seated
right neXt to the boss.

971
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:17,616
But, you know,
I surprised myself. I mean,
he talked and I talked.

972
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:20,160
It was just like
a regular conversation.

973

I thought everything
was cool,

974
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:25,541
till I noticed that
he was looking at me
in kind ofa weird way.

975
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:29,545
I looked down at his plate
and discovered that all the time
we had been talking,

976
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:33,549
I'd been
cutting up his meat
for him.

That's when I decided
that I'd better get
out ofthe house.

978
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:42,432
Yeah, but why school?
Oh, I don't know.

979
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:48,021
I felt restless and undirected,
and I thought school would
give me some answers.

a better idea?

01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:36,959
Helen's fine,
just fine.

1036
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:42,589
Hmm. Why don'tyou
tell me a story that shows
how really rotten she can be?

1037
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,759
That's not likeyou.

1038
01:13:45,759 --> 01:13:48,971
I know, but it seems
like we need something
to bring us together.

1039
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:54,226
I thought a really lousy story
about Helen would makeyou
appreciate me more.

1040
01:13:56,145 --> 01:14:01,108
Okay. As you know,
she has this funny sense
ofhumor.

1041
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,652
By funny, I take it
you mean peculiar.
Right.

1042
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:07,197
And it comes out
at the most inappropriate times.

1043
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:12,286
I had just signed this client--
very proper,
very old money.

1044
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,456
Helen and I were invited
to his house for cocktails
with him and his wife.

1045
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:19,042
Well,
it was all pretty awkward,

1046
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:22,546
but we managed to get
through the drinks all right.

1047
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:26,633
Then, as we were leaving,
instead ofwalking
out the front door,

1048
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:30,012
I walked
into the hall closet.

1049
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:34,308
Well, that wasn't so bad.
Anybody could've done that.

1050
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:37,936
My mistake was
I stayed in there.

1051
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:42,733
You stayed in the closet?

1052
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:45,736
I wasn't sure anybody
had seen me go in.
Aha.

1053
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:49,406
I guess I figured
I'd stay in there
until they'd all gone away.

1054
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:53,243
All right. Maybe
I didn't think things through.

1055
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:57,956
I was there a minute before
I realized I had probably
misjudged the situation.

1056
01:14:57,831 --> 01:15:01,960
And then when I came out,
the three ofthem
were just staring at me.

1057
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:07,216
Well, it was pretty awkward,
but I probably could've carried
it off eXcept for Helen.

1058
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:11,094
- You know what she did?
- What?

1059
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:16,016
- She peed on the carpet.
- [ Laughing ]

1060
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,648
She did what?
Well, not right away.

1061
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:25,442
First,
she started to laugh.

1062
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:28,987
Her face was all screwed up.
She was holding her sides.

1063
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:34,076
Tears were streaming
down her cheeks. And then
she peed all over the carpet.

1064
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,080
What did you say?

1065
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:40,082
I said, "You'll have to
eXcuse mywife.

1066
01:15:40,082 --> 01:15:43,001
Ever since her last pregnancy,
she's had a problem."

1067
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,754
Then I offered
to have the rug cleaned.

1068
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:51,260
- Did that help?
- No. They said they had a maid,
and it wouldn't be necessary.

1069
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:54,096
[ Continues

You think this is funny?
Listen.

1071
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:07,359
I've been meaning
to tell you this
for a long time.

1072
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:10,904
I just love Helen.

1073
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:17,286
Would she come off
anyworse ifl told you
I lost the account?

1074
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:21,290
Oh, George, when
did you get so stuffy?

1075
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:25,294
Stuffy?
Yeah.

1076
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:29,756
Am I stuffy because
I don't like mywife to
urinate on my client's carpet?

1077
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:34,303
Well, I didn't mean
just that, honey, but--

1078
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:38,849
Well, look atyou.
You just scream
establishment.

1079
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:42,394
I am not a faddist.

1080

- I mean I have no desire to

1083
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:57,284
Well, I wasn't just
talking about fashion. I was
talking aboutyour attitudes.

1084
01:16:57,075 --> 01:17:00,454
My attitudes are the same
as they always were.
I haven't changed at all.

1085
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:05,000
Oh, yes, you have.
You used to be kind of,
well, crazy and insecure...

1086
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:09,254
and a terrible liar,
but awfully human.

1087
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:13,133
Nowyou-- I don't know.
You just seem so sure
ofyourself.

1088
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:21,850
- That's the last thing I am.
- Oh, yeah?

1089
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,895
Ipickedup one oF
Helen's magazines the other day,
and there was this article...

1090
01:17:24,812 --> 01:17:29,316
telling women what sort
of orgasms they should have.

1091
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:32,736
It was called "The Big 'O."'

1092
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:35,531
You know what really
got me about that?

1093
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:39,493
This was a magazine
my mother used to buy
for its fruitcake recipes.

1094
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:43,288
Well, the times,
in fact, are a-changing,
darling.

1095
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:46,041
Too fast.

1096
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:52,631
I don't know.
Twenty, thirtyyears ago,
we had standards.

1097
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:56,009
Maybe theywere black
and white, but at least
theywere standards.

1098
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:58,262
Now--

1099
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,183
It's so confusing.

1100
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,605
Well--

1101
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:12,943
That's at least a step
in the right direction.

1102
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:17,447
When did I suddenly
become so appealing?

from pompous to confused.

for a man like that?

No. We'll
discuss it right now.

- Why did you vote for him?
- Because I have a son who wants
to be a rock musician.

1126
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:52,751
What kind of reason is that?
The best one I can come up
with in my condition.

1127

a whole lot better than that.

to end the war, okay?
Sure, by destroying the country.

You know, it's amazi ng
how good it can be
after 2 1 years, isn't it?

1181
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:09,067
Well, iFyou add up
all the times we actually
made it together,

1182
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,988
we're still
on our honeymoon.

[ Kissing ]
[ Kissing ]

1184
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:19,244
Did I tell you
I'm a grandmother?
No.

1185
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:22,080
But I think
you picked a weird time
to announce it.

1186
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:28,587
Congratulations.
Thankyou.

1187
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:33,342
Anyway, you're
theyoungest-looking grandmother
I've had a peak eXperience with.

1188
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:37,137
Well, my mother thanks you.
My father thanks you.

1189

My hairdresser thanks you.
And my plastic surgeon
thanks you.

When Harry says,
"You're not the girl I married,"
he doesn't know how right he is.

1191
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:55,781
Didn't Harry
likeyour old nose?
Harry
thinks this is my old nose.

1192
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:58,492
He never noticed?
No.
Isn't that pathetic?

1193
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:03,080
I mean, a new dress
or something, I could
understand, but a whole nose?

1194
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:06,333
Well, to be totally honest,
I don't see any difference
either.

1195
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:10,420
Well, I don't care.
It's sure different
From myside.

Makes me
Feel more attractive.

1197
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:17,261
Anyway, that's this year's
bad story about Harry.

1198
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:20,055
Have you got one
about Helen?

1199
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:24,184
Well, there was
this loud party neXt door.

1200
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:27,271
Helen couldn't sleep.

1201
01:26:27,187 --> 01:26:31,150
And, uh, she didn't wanna
take a sleeping pill...

1202
01:26:31,066 --> 01:26:36,446
because
she had to get up at 6:00
in the morning.

1203
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:40,534
So she took a couple
of pills and stuffed them
in her ears.

1204
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:43,078
What?

1205
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:46,248
During the night,
the pills melted.

1206
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:49,668
Then the neXt day, while
the doctorwas digging the stuff
out ofher ears,

1207
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:53,964
he said, "You know,
these can be taken orally."

1208
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:59,511
Helenjust laughed.
She didn't care.

1209
01:26:59,428 --> 01:27:03,182
I'll tell you something.
Ifthat's the worst story
you can tell about yourwife,

1210
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:05,392
you must
be a very happy man.

1211
01:27:05,392 --> 01:27:08,562
Well, let's just say
I've discovered the potential
for happiness.

No, honey.
It's 60 guests, not 1 6.

1215

There's no problem.
We've catered parties
for her lots oftimes. It--

1216
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:36,131
I know,
but she puts little tables
around her swimming pool,

1217
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:39,426
and then there's room
on the patio for the buffet.

1218
01:27:39,343 --> 01:27:42,638
Right.
It's a brunch.

1219
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:46,809
Right. That's okay.
Sure.

1220
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:49,603
Uh, Liz,
did Harry call?

1221
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:57,778
Okay. You know
where to reach me, huh?

1222
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:05,452
I'm sorry.
It was a busyweekend,
and I had to leave a number.

1223
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:10,374
Does Harry knowyou're here?
No. Harry still thinks
I go on retreat.

1224
01:28:10,207 --> 01:28:12,251
Don't worry.

1225
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:15,921
I'm not worried.
Yeah? Then why
are you frowning?

1226
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:19,508
I'm getting bad vibes again.
Again?

1227
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:24,930
Yeah. When you first
walked in, I picked up
on your high tension level.

1228
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:27,933
Then afterwe made love,
I sensed a certain
anXiety reduction,

1229
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:33,480
but, uh, now I'm getting
deFinite negative Feedback.

1230
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:35,399
When did you go
into analysis?

1231
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:39,820
- How did you know
I was in analysis?
-J ust a wild guess.

1232
01:28:39,695 --> 01:28:42,990
What made you start?

1233
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:47,578
My value system changed.
One day, I took a look
at my $1 50,000 house...

1234
01:28:47,411 --> 01:28:53,083
and the three cars in the garage
and the swimming pool
and the gardeners,

1235
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:56,461
and I asked myself, "Why?"

1236
01:28:56,378 --> 01:29:00,215
I mean, did I really
want the whole status trip?

1237
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:04,928
So I decided to try
to find out what I did want
and who I was.

1238
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:08,390
Soyou went from analysis
to Esalen to Gestalt...

1239
01:29:08,307 --> 01:29:12,936
to encounter groups
to transactional
to nirvana, huh?

1240
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:16,190
Just because some people
are trying to widen
their emotional horizons...

1241
01:29:16,106 --> 01:29:18,734
doesn't make the eXperience
any less valid.

1242
01:29:18,734 --> 01:29:21,904
I've learned a lot.
So I've noticed.

1243
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,948
For one thing, you've learned
to talk as though you're
reasoning with somebody...

1244
01:29:24,907 --> 01:29:28,202
about to jump
from a high ledge.

1245
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:33,248
Okay, okay. I know sometimes
I tend to overcompensate
for my emotionalism.

1246
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:38,795
Occasionally,
there's a loss of spontaneity.
I'm working on that.

1247
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:43,091
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
What else haveyou learned?

1248

told you that 20 years ago.

reacting toyourvoyage
ofself-discovery?

1252
01:30:02,069 --> 01:30:05,572
Well, at first,
she tended to overreact.
Oh, yeah? In what way?

1253
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:09,034
She threw a grapefruit
at me in the supermarket.

lay this on you.

First time she
gave me a rectal eXamination,

she said,
"Am I hurting you
or areyou tense?"

1278
01:31:57,184 --> 01:32:01,730
I said, "I'm tense."
She said, "Areyou tense
because I'm a woman?"

1279
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:05,984
I said, "No. I get tense
when anybody does that
to me."

See what I mean?
Well, I don't know
about that,

- Well, I don't know
ifl lost him...

Total honesty is the key
to everything.

Areyou being
totally honest with Helen?

- Oh, yeah? Haveyou told her
about us?

1309

to handle it.

Well, at least
it's a start.

all that other garbage?

01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:35,759
What kind of crap is that?
All right.
You've got a point.

1318
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:39,555
So how doyou feel
about all this?
You're doing it again!

1319
01:34:39,429 --> 01:34:43,892
[ Sighs ]
Okay. I think--
Don't tell me howyou think.

1320
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:47,855
Tell me howyou feel.

1321
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:51,024
Like I've been kicked
in the stomach.

1322
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:53,318
What else?

1323
01:34:54,611 --> 01:35:00,701
Angry. Hurt. Betrayed.

1324
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:03,954
And, okay, a little guilty.
But I'll tell you something.

1325
01:35:03,871 --> 01:35:07,082
I really resent the fact
that he's making me
feel guilty.

1326
01:35:06,999 --> 01:35:09,459
Whydoyou Feel resentment?

1327
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:13,630
Well, look.
I didn't marry Harry because
he had a good head for business.

1328
01:35:13,505 --> 01:35:18,010
Okay. So it turns out
that I do, or maybe I was lucky.
I don't know.

1329
01:35:17,843 --> 01:35:23,974
The point is, I don't love him
any less just 'cause
he's a failure as a provider,

1330
01:35:23,765 --> 01:35:28,479
so why should
he love me less just 'cause
I'm a success?

1331
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:31,565
Haveyou told him
you still love him?
Love him.

1332
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:36,862
What's he think
I've been hanging around
for 27 years for?

1333
01:35:36,778 --> 01:35:40,407
Wouldit beso hard
to let him knowyou understand
howhe Feels?

1334
01:35:40,282 --> 01:35:43,452
Right now it would,
yes.

1335
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,871
Do you
want him back?

1336
01:35:47,289 --> 01:35:50,751
I don't know.

1337
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:55,047
But ask me again tomorrow,
and I'll probably
give you a different answer.

1338
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:56,924
Why?

1339
01:35:59,092 --> 01:36:02,554
Because tomorrow
I won't have you.

1340
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:13,649
- I'm always with you
in spirit.
- Thanks a lot.

1341
01:36:13,524 --> 01:36:17,986
It's kind of difficult
to putyour cold feet
on somebody's spirit,

1342
01:36:17,861 --> 01:36:21,114
especiallywhen
they're 400 miles away.

1343
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:30,374
Is that a proposal,
Doris?

1344
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:34,962
Areyou interested?
Areyou?

1345
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:40,676
I've always thought
we'd make a nice couple.

1346
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:44,263
You didn't
answer the question.

1347
01:36:44,221 --> 01:36:47,891
I was the one
who proposed.

1348
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:53,730
Well, don't look
so panicky, George.

1349
01:36:53,647 --> 01:36:57,609
I was only
three-quarters serious.

1350
01:37:01,822 --> 01:37:05,534
Well, when
you're completely serious,
ask me again.

1351
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:09,705
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

1352
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,623
No.

1353
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:20,632
Thankyou.
You hungry?

1354
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:23,927
Yes.
Well, you're in luck.

1355
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:28,640
Because today,
your lunch is being catered
by the chicest,

1356
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:32,478
most eXpensive
French delicatessen
in all ofSan Francisco.

1357
01:37:32,394 --> 01:37:36,440
How did we swing that?
The owner's
got a thing forya.

1358
01:37:36,273 --> 01:37:39,151
It's out in the trunk
of my car.
Can I help?

1359
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:42,404
Why, you could
set the table and
turn on some nice music...

1360
01:37:42,321 --> 01:37:44,406
and when I come back,
make me laugh, huh?

1361
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:47,242
I'll try.
Don't worry.

1362
01:37:47,201 --> 01:37:51,288
Ifyou can't
make me laugh,
just hold my hand.

1363
01:38:07,262 --> 01:38:10,849
[Telephone Ringing]

1364
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:15,562
Hello?

1365
01:38:15,521 --> 01:38:19,525
Uh, no, she's not here
right now. Who's this?

1366
01:38:21,777 --> 01:38:24,738
Harry? Um--

1367
01:38:24,696 --> 01:38:29,868
Uh, would you--
would you just hold on
for a minute, please?

1368
01:38:43,465 --> 01:38:45,551
Hello?

1369
01:38:47,177 --> 01:38:51,557
Harry, we're two
mature adult human beings,
and I've decided to be honest.

1370
01:38:53,433 --> 01:38:57,563
No. Doris is not here
right now, but I'd like
to talk toyou.

1371
01:38:59,231 --> 01:39:03,902
Because I know thatyou
and Doris are having a pretty
rough time right now, and--

1372
01:39:05,946 --> 01:39:09,366
Uh, we're
very close friends.

1373
01:39:09,324 --> 01:39:13,787
I've known Doris
for 20 years, and I feel
that through her, I knowyou.

1374
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,878
We've been meeting
this same weekend
for 20 years.

1375
01:39:24,465 --> 01:39:28,385
The retreat?
Uh, yeah.

1376
01:39:28,302 --> 01:39:32,681
I'll, uh--
I'll get to that
in a minute, but, um,

1377
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:35,809
first I'd like
to tell you something,
Harry.

1378
01:39:35,767 --> 01:39:38,687
She loves you.

1379
01:39:38,604 --> 01:39:44,067
Well, I just know. Look.
Maybe ifl told you a story
she told me this morning,

1380
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:46,695
maybe it would helpyou
understand.

1381
01:39:46,653 --> 01:39:52,159
Uh, a few months ago,
Doris was supposed to act
as den mother...

1382
01:39:51,992 --> 01:39:56,580
foryour 1 0-year-old daughter
and her Indian Guide group.

1383
01:39:56,455 --> 01:40:00,876
And Doris
was a little late.
She was hung up at the store,

1384
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:03,337
and she got home
about two hours late.

1385
01:40:03,295 --> 01:40:08,717
When she walked into the house,
she looked in the living room,
and you know what she saw?

1386
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:12,888
A rather overweight,
balding, middle-aged man
with a feather on his head...

1387
01:40:12,805 --> 01:40:17,100
sitting cross-legged
on the floor, very gravely
and gently...

1388
01:40:16,934 --> 01:40:20,771
telling a circle
oftotally absorbed girls
what it was like...

1389
01:40:20,687 --> 01:40:24,900
to be in a World War II
Japanese prison camp.

1390
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:30,948
And she turned around
and went outside
and got in her car...

1391
01:40:30,823 --> 01:40:34,993
and thanked God
for being married to a man
likeyou.

1392
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:43,377
Areyou still there, Harry?

1393
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:51,260
Yeah, well, look.
Sometimes married people get
into an emotional straitjacket,

1394
01:40:51,051 --> 01:40:56,014
and it's kind ofhard
for them to eXpress how they
truly feel about each other.

1395
01:41:01,603 --> 01:41:05,983
Total honesty
is the key.

1396
01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:08,652
Yes, I've known Doris
for 20 years,

1397
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:11,530
and I'm not ashamed to admit
that it's been one
ofthe most intimate,

1398
01:41:11,488 --> 01:41:15,826
satisfying eXperiences
of my life.

1399
01:41:16,743 --> 01:41:18,996
My name?

1400
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:27,629
My name is
Father Michael O'Herlihy.

1401
01:41:27,463 --> 01:41:32,176
Right. Oh.

1402
01:42:25,437 --> 01:42:28,857
It never changes, does it?
About the only thing
that doesn't.

1403
01:42:28,774 --> 01:42:32,361
I find that comforting.

1404
01:42:32,277 --> 01:42:35,155
Even old Chalmers
hasn't changed.

1405
01:42:35,113 --> 01:42:38,659
He must be 75
by now.

1406
01:42:38,534 --> 01:42:44,289
You rememberwhen we first met?
Even then, we called him
old Chalmers.

1407
01:42:44,122 --> 01:42:47,000
He must've been
the same age then
that we are now.

1408
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:50,754
That I don't
find so comforting.

1409
01:42:50,671 --> 01:42:53,549
We were veryyoung.
Yeah.

1410
01:42:53,465 --> 01:42:57,719
Have we changed much?
Oh, sure we have.

1411
01:42:57,594 --> 01:43:02,099
I grew up with you.
Remember all those dumb lies
I used to tell?

1412
01:43:01,974 --> 01:43:06,061
Yeah. How about me?
Have I grown up too?

1413
01:43:05,936 --> 01:43:10,274
I had the feeling
you were already grown up
when we met.

1414
01:43:14,403 --> 01:43:17,531
Why is it every time
I look atyou, I want
to put my hands all overyou?

1415
01:43:17,406 --> 01:43:22,619
That's another thing
that hasn't changed.
You always were a seX maniac.

1416
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:31,170
I'll start a fire.
Okay.

1417
01:43:31,086 --> 01:43:33,672
You know,
I figured out with the cost
offirewood today,

1418
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:38,594
it's cheaper
to buy furniture,
break it up and burn it.

1419
01:43:38,427 --> 01:43:42,473
Are things that tight?
No. I'm okay.

1420
01:43:42,389 --> 01:43:45,642
I've been doing
some teaching at U.C.L.A.
Ah.

1421
01:43:45,559 --> 01:43:49,771
What? Music?
Accounting.

1422
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:52,024
With the way things
are happening out there,

1423
01:43:51,982 --> 01:43:55,944
it seems that figures
are still the onlythings
that don't lie.

1424
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:00,616
Doris, why'd you
sell your business?

1425
01:44:01,909 --> 01:44:05,829
How did you know
about that?
I'll tellyou later.

1426
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:10,292
What madeyou do it?
A chain bought me out.

1427
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:13,545
It was just the right offer
at the right time.

1428
01:44:13,504 --> 01:44:19,468
But what do you do
with yourself now?
Oh, I read and watch TV....

1429
01:44:19,259 --> 01:44:24,181
and visit my grandchildren,
play a little golf.

1430
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:27,893
You know,
all the jet set stuff.

1431
01:44:27,726 --> 01:44:30,604
I thought
you loved working.

1432
01:44:30,521 --> 01:44:33,774
Well, there
was another factor.

1433
01:44:33,732 --> 01:44:37,194
Harry had a heart attack.
It turned out
to be a mild one,

1434
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:40,489
but he needed me
at the time, so--

1435
01:44:40,405 --> 01:44:43,909
Besides,
it's not like I'm
in permanent retirement.

1436
01:44:43,784 --> 01:44:48,539
There's a local election
in a couple of months, and
I've been approached to run.

1437
01:44:48,413 --> 01:44:51,750
On what ticket?
Independent.

1438
01:44:51,667 --> 01:44:54,128
Figures.

1439
01:44:54,128 --> 01:44:56,713
Harry's okay now?
Oh, yeah.

1440
01:44:56,672 --> 01:45:01,176
He runs four miles a day
and has a body
like Mark Spitz.

1441
01:45:01,009 --> 01:45:06,265
Unfortunately,
he still has a face
like Ernest Borgnine, but--

1442
01:45:09,184 --> 01:45:14,356
How's everything
with you and Harry
emotionally?

1443
01:45:17,818 --> 01:45:20,821
Comfortable.
Comfortable?

1444
01:45:20,737 --> 01:45:23,782
Well, that's
not such a bad state
to be in.

1445
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:27,911
That word's been given
a bad reputation
by theyoung.

1446
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:33,542
Where's your luggage?
Still in the car?

1447
01:45:33,459 --> 01:45:37,254
I didn't bring any.
I can't stay.

1448
01:45:38,755 --> 01:45:41,800
Why not?
Look, I have a lot
to say...

1449
01:45:41,717 --> 01:45:47,139
and a very short time
to say it, so I'd
better start.

1450
01:45:47,014 --> 01:45:50,225
In the first place,
it turns out that...

1451
01:45:50,142 --> 01:45:53,270
Helen found out
about us 1 0 years ago.

1452
01:45:58,775 --> 01:46:03,405
When did you learn that?
Two months ago.

1453
01:46:04,781 --> 01:46:07,826
And she never
confronted you with it
before?

1454
01:46:07,784 --> 01:46:11,705
No.
What made her
tellyou now?

1455
01:46:11,622 --> 01:46:15,876
She didn't. We have
a very close friend, Connie.

1456
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:19,171
- Did-- Have I
ever mentioned her?
- No.

1457
01:46:19,087 --> 01:46:21,757
Well, Connie told me.

1458
01:46:21,715 --> 01:46:26,553
All those years,
and she never even hinted
that she knew.

1459
01:46:30,849 --> 01:46:34,144
I guess that's
the nicest story
I've ever told about her.

1460
01:46:34,061 --> 01:46:39,316
- Yourwife
is an amazing woman.
- She passed away, Doris.

1461
01:46:44,905 --> 01:46:48,700
I lost hersix months ago.

1462
01:46:50,327 --> 01:46:53,539
It was veryFast.

1463
01:46:57,376 --> 01:47:02,381
I'm sorry to blurt it out
like that. I couldn't think
of a graceful way to tell you.

1464
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:06,510
It's so strange.

1465
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:11,765
I never even met Helen,
and I feel like I've
just lost my best friend.

1466
01:47:15,102 --> 01:47:18,564
Are the kids okay?
The kids are great.
If it weren't for them,

1467
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,317
I don't know if I'd
have gotten through
this whole thing.

1468
01:47:22,234 --> 01:47:25,112
I wish you'd tried
to reach me.
Well, I did.

1469
01:47:24,987 --> 01:47:28,115
That's how I found out
you'd sold the store.

1470
01:47:28,031 --> 01:47:31,743
They gave me
your home number, and I--

1471
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:35,747
I let the phone
ring four times,
and then I hung up.

1472
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:38,375
But I felt better
knowing you were there
ifl needed you.

1473
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:44,131
Oh, I wish
you'd spoken to me.
Well, I didn't want to intrude.

1474
01:47:43,964 --> 01:47:47,551
I didn't think
I had the right.

1475
01:47:49,553 --> 01:47:52,473
That's just terrible.
We should've been together.

1476
01:47:54,516 --> 01:47:58,395
You know,
I've been thinking
about us a lot lately,

1477
01:47:59,813 --> 01:48:04,818
everything we've
been through together,
things we've shared,

1478
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:08,030
times we've
helped each other.

1479
01:48:07,988 --> 01:48:11,575
Did you know we
made love 1 1 3 times?
What?

1480
01:48:11,492 --> 01:48:17,206
I figured that out
on my Bomar calculator.
[ Scoffs ]

1481
01:48:16,997 --> 01:48:21,251
I think it's wonderful
when people know each other
that well.

1482
01:48:21,168 --> 01:48:24,213
You know,
there's nothing aboutyou
I don't know.

1483
01:48:24,087 --> 01:48:27,424
You take two sugars,
right?
No. One.

1484
01:48:27,341 --> 01:48:30,260
Okay. Uh--

1485
01:48:30,177 --> 01:48:34,473
Oh, well, okay.
Maybe I don't know
everything about you.

1486
01:48:36,058 --> 01:48:39,478
You know,
I don't know who your
favorite movie stars are.

1487
01:48:39,394 --> 01:48:42,523
And I couldn't
remember the name
ofyour favorite perfume.

1488
01:48:42,439 --> 01:48:46,318
- I racked my brain,
and I couldn't think ofit.
- That's funny.

1489
01:48:46,235 --> 01:48:48,403
It's My Sin.

1490
01:48:53,534 --> 01:48:57,955
But I do know
that in 26 years, I've never
been out oflove with you.

1491
01:48:59,414 --> 01:49:03,043
I think
that's incredible.

1492
01:49:04,795 --> 01:49:08,924
So what doyou say, Doris?
You wanna get married?
[ Gulps ]

1493
01:49:08,841 --> 01:49:12,761
Married? We shouldn't
even be doing this.

1494
01:49:12,636 --> 01:49:15,514
I'm serious.

1495
01:49:19,351 --> 01:49:23,355
Oh, my God. You are.

1496
01:49:23,188 --> 01:49:28,026
Well, what'd
you think I was,
just a summer romance?

1497
01:49:30,696 --> 01:49:34,283
A simpleyes willdo.

1498
01:49:35,367 --> 01:49:39,371
There is no such thing,
my love.

1499
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:45,627
What is it?

1500
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:50,257
I was just thinking
ofhow many times I've dreamed
ofyour asking me this.

1501
01:49:50,132 --> 01:49:56,013
You know, that's pulled me
through a lot ofbad times.
I wanna thankyou forthat.

1502
01:49:55,804 --> 01:49:59,099
What did you say
those other times?

1503
01:50:00,184 --> 01:50:03,228
I always said yes.

1504
01:50:03,187 --> 01:50:07,649
Why areyou hesitating now?
Doyou realize I'm offering
you the opportunity...

1505
01:50:07,524 --> 01:50:10,611
to marry a man
who has known you
for 26 years...

1506
01:50:10,527 --> 01:50:14,281
and can't walk byyou
without wanting to
grabyour ass?

1507
01:50:14,156 --> 01:50:16,617
You always
were a sweet talker.

1508
01:50:18,118 --> 01:50:20,245
Doris,
will you marry me?

1509
01:50:24,124 --> 01:50:26,585
I can't.

1510
01:50:27,503 --> 01:50:29,963
Whynot?

1511
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,427
I'm already married.

1512
01:50:35,385 --> 01:50:38,931
You feel you have
to staywith him because
he needs you?

1513
01:50:38,847 --> 01:50:44,061
No. No.
It's a lot oFthings.

1514
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:47,940
Affection.

1515
01:50:47,898 --> 01:50:50,442
Respect.

1516
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,570
And a sense
of continuity.

1517
01:50:53,529 --> 01:50:57,157
I mean, we share
all the same memories.

1518
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,453
It's comfortable.

1519
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:07,376
Goddamn it. I was
the one who broughtyou
back together siXyears ago.

1520
01:51:07,167 --> 01:51:10,712
Why did I do
such a stupid thing?
Whywas I so generous?

1521
01:51:10,629 --> 01:51:15,217
Becauseyou Felt the same way
then about Helen as I do now
about Harry, that's why.

1522
01:51:15,092 --> 01:51:17,970
And besides, ifyou hadn't,
you might've been stuck with me
for good,

1523
01:51:17,928 --> 01:51:21,223
and that idea
scared you to death.

1524
01:51:24,893 --> 01:51:28,397
You always could
see through me,
couldn'tyou?

1525
01:51:28,313 --> 01:51:31,441
But that's okay, 'cause...

1526
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:35,863
I've always loved
what I've seen.

1527
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:41,160
Well, I wantyou now.

1528
01:51:43,245 --> 01:51:47,583
You can still
have me once a year,
same time, same place.

1529
01:51:47,499 --> 01:51:50,627
Doris, I needa wiFe.

1530
01:51:52,004 --> 01:51:55,549
I'm just not the kind of man
who can live alone.

1531
01:51:55,466 --> 01:52:00,846
What I'm trying to say
is that withoutyou, I'll
probably end up with Connie.

1532
01:52:03,265 --> 01:52:07,352
Look, she knows all
about us, and, uh, she's not
the kind of person...

1533
01:52:07,227 --> 01:52:11,148
who would go along
with it.

1534
01:52:11,064 --> 01:52:14,651
I guess what I'm
trying to say is that...

1535
01:52:16,737 --> 01:52:19,907
we'll never
see each other again.

1536
01:52:33,962 --> 01:52:37,341
Doris, for God's sake,
marry me.

1537
01:52:46,934 --> 01:52:49,394
I can't.

I could say that would
makeyou...

- What about Connie?
- Connie is 87 years old.

1551
01:55:42,776 --> 01:55:45,946
What?
Look. I wanted you
to marry me,

1552
01:55:45,863 --> 01:55:49,741
and I figured ifyou thought
somebody else wanted me,
I'd stand a better chance.

Okay. Maybe I didn't
think things through.
