1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,040
Play ball!

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,880
I got it! I got it!

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,880
Here we go!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,200
Strike!

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
Oh, come on.
Why do I always get stuck with the loser?

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,440
He stinks.
Darn it!

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,960
Too bad.
Hustle! Hustle!

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,040
Yankee Irving again!
Tough luck.

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,640
Why do we always end up
with Yankee?

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,480
Excuse me.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,200
I got it!

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
Whoa!

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,440
You show them, Warbuckles!
Way to run it out!

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,200
- Go, go, go, go!
- Run, Philly, you can do it!

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,080
Come on, Freckles!
Keep the ride going, buddy!

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,520
Next batter!
- Me?

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,800
Oh, man!
Tough luck!

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,640
Irving, here's your big shot.

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,480
This is just like Game Seven
of the '26 Series. Babe came to the...

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,240
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, you're not Babe Ruth, okay?

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,680
Now look, you've got no strike zone,
so he's guaranteed to walk you.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,440
Batter up!
- Just don't swing.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
- He's gonna whiff. Bring it in.
- Easy out, easy out.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,640
- Let him walk you.
- Don't swing at it, Irving!

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,160
Yeah, don't swing!

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,520
If I don't swing,
how are you gonna know I can hit?

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,880
Don't swing, Irving!

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,440
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
hey, batter, batter, swing!

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Strike one!
- What did I just tell you?

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,280
Come on.
- You've got no strike zone!

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
Strike two!
- Just take the pitch!

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,360
Don't swing!
Don't swing, Irving!

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,160
Don't swing at it, Irving!

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,480
Now batting, number one,
Yankee Irving!

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,520
Ah!

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,760
Nice job, whiff.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,840
That's it.
You're never playing on my team again.

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,240
Give it up.
Go home.

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
Yeah, don't come back.
Come on, let's get out of here.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,560
Loser.

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
Honey! Dinnertime!

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,440
Huh?

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Hmm.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
Hmm.

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,480
Guess nobody wants you
in the game either.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
Hey, Irving, you stink!

47
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
The Movietone News:

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,000
Bringing you the news
just days after it's happened:

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,600
In sporting news, the Yankees continue
their splendiferous winning streak:

50
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
It's Game Three of the World Series:

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,200
Bottom of the ninth,
the Yankees down by three,

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,880
bases loaded,
Babe Ruth steps up to the plate:

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
Will the Sultan of Swat save the day?

54
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,680
You betcha!

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,360
So what's Napoleon Cross,
owner of the Chicago Cubs,

56
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,520
going to do now?

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,800
With his best bat, Darlin', in his
hands,

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,320
Babe Ruth is unstoppable:

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,600
Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth.

60
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,400
Babe Ruth and his best bat, Darlin'.

61
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,000
He's everywhere!

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Every newsreel, every newspaper
talks about Babe Ruth.

63
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,680
Look at all this stuff! Babe Ruth
sippy cup, Babe Ruth silver dollars,

64
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,240
Babe Ruth underpants,
obviously for the larger child.

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,960
What's he got that I haven't got?

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,280
He's got a World Series trophy!
And I want one!

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,680
- Is that too much to ask?
- No, not at all.

68
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Why don't you put me back in, Mr. Cross?
I'll help you win that trophy.

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm working on a new pitch. I call
it...

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,400
Are you ready?

71
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,680
The booger ball.

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,240
No, Lefty,
even with your most outrageous cheating

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,080
you're no match for Babe Ruth.

74
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Cheating? Me? Babe Ruth's the cheater.

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,320
I bet he's got some lucky
voodoo charm or something.

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
That's cheating.

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,000
You're right, Lefty.
Babe Ruth does have a lucky charm.

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,080
What is it, what is it, what is it?
It's his bat.

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,800
So what do we do?
I'll tell you what we do.

80
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,440
We take away his bat. Let's do the
math.

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,880
- Going into the light.
- Babe without bat is nothing.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Without that bat, he's just big and
fat!

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,080
Put that on a T-shirt.

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Yeah, I like it.
It's good stuff, it's good stuff.

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,400
Only one problem.
How we gonna get Babe Ruth's lucky bat?

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,200
- Not "we," you.
- But, Mr. Cross, I...

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,200
Get me that bat. And I think
the only way to get it is to steal it.

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,360
Otherwise, you're out!

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,280
Hi, honey, how was your day?
- Hey, Mom.

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,480
- Is Dad home yet?
- Not yet.

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,520
- He's working late.
- Again?

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,360
- Dinner will be ready soon.
- Not hungry.

93
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,080
Why do I always get stuck
with the loser?

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Yankee Irving again!

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
He's working late:

96
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,640
That's it:
You're never playing on my team again:

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,680
You're not Babe Ruth, okay?

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Why do we always get stuck
with Yankee?

99
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,160
You think you could take your thumb
out of my eye?

100
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,240
Whoa!

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Huh?

102
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
What?

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
- Are you talking?
- I am.

104
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,800
One smart fella, he felt smart.
Two smart fellas, they felt smart.

105
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,600
Three smart fellas, they all felt smart.
I'm talking.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait a second. Where are you going?

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,160
Back to the sandlot,
where I was peacefully decomposing.

108
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,480
Hey, watch it there, grabby hands!

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,320
Don't make me go all
crazy eight ball on you.

110
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,320
Whoa!

111
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,360
Where did you go?

112
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,760
Hey, Fuzzy, how do I get out of here?

113
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
- This kid is nuts.
- I just wanna talk.

114
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
And I just wanna leave.

115
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Hey, genius, it just so happens
you left a gaping hole in the infield.

116
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,640
Sayonara:

117
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,720
Your living room is a little cramped.
And dark.

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,560
Huh?

119
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,440
I'm rollin' in style!

120
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
Whoa!

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,040
Nobody gets their mitts on Screwie.
I'm going back to the sandlot.

122
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,520
Ouch!

123
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Why can't I break a window?
Every other ball can break a window.

124
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,160
Gotcha.

125
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,160
- What's going on in here?
- Mom, look, a talking baseball.

126
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,360
He never gets tired of that one.

127
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh, my gosh, a talking baseball.
Well, I think I hear the meatloaf talking.

128
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,760
- It's saying, "Yankee, time for dinner. "
- Talking meatloaf?

129
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,440
Food can't talk. Except for beans.
They can make themselves heard.

130
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,240
- Go get cleaned up.
- She can't hear you?

131
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,080
I don't know. Let's see. Help!
I've been kidnapped by a deranged child!

132
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Yup, you're right. She can't hear.

133
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,160
Please don't skimp on the soap.
You smell like a week-old hot dog.

134
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,280
Oh!

135
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,640
Kid, quit it.
That's my protective coating of dirt.

136
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,280
I wish Dad was here.

137
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,640
Oh, sweetheart, you know
he's got to work the extra shifts.

138
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,680
I know, but I really need to see him.

139
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Tell you what,
why don't you take him his dinner?

140
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,520
- Really?
- Just this once.

141
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,040
You know you're not supposed
to be there while he's working.

142
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
Thanks, Mom.

143
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Great. So just drop me in the sandlot
on the way to see your daddy, and...

144
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,160
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

145
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,000
Making sure
you don't go anywhere.

146
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,320
- Not the underpants drawer!
- Don't worry. They're clean.

147
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,840
Not anymore.

148
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,040
Wow!

149
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,080
Now batting for the New York Yankees,
number one, Yankee Irving!

150
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey, Dad.

151
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,880
What are you doing here?

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,560
I wanted to see you. I brought you
dinner.

153
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,840
Great. What are we having?

154
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,920
Mom's mystery meatloaf.

155
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Hmm.

156
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,320
Meatloaf. Let's start with dessert.

157
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
So, what's new?

158
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,320
Dad, you're not gonna believe this.

159
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Oh, no? Try me.

160
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,280
I found a talking baseball.

161
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,160
Oh, really? Does he have a name?

162
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,360
I call him Screwie.

163
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh, yeah? Where'd you find it?

164
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
At the sandlot.

165
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,640
Did you play ball today?

166
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,840
Yeah, but I don't think
I wanna play anymore.

167
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,480
Hey, I thought you loved baseball.

168
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,280
Well, I think I'm in a slump.

169
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,520
Hmm.

170
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,800
You know, I was watching the team
practice the other day, and it struck me,

171
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,000
here are guys who make a living
playing baseball.

172
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,520
They play every day, and even on
the day after they lose a game,

173
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,360
they're still standing at the plate
swinging that bat.

174
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,960
And you know
how they got to be so good?

175
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,240
They just keep swinging?

176
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Come on, I got something to show you.

177
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,120
Babe Ruth!

178
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,280
Is that Darlin'?

179
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,120
Yup. Sure is.

180
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,800
Babe had that bat custom made
three years ago.

181
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,400
That was the first year
he hit 50 home runs.

182
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,840
That's right. People say she was made
from a thousand-year-old tree

183
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,320
growing on the side of Mount Olympus.

184
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm pretty sure it was made in
Kentucky.

185
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Hey, come on, pal, we should head
home.

186
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,520
Oh, come on, Dad,
just another minute, please?

187
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
I tell you what, you can stay here
for a few more minutes

188
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,280
while I put my things away.

189
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,240
- Meet you at the back gate. Deal?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,200
Yankee, don't touch anything

191
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,920
and make sure you close the door
when you leave.

192
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,960
I promise.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

193
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,440
- You! What are you doing?
- Nothing.

194
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,760
- I was just helping my dad mop up.
- Scram!

195
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,840
What are you looking at?

196
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,360
Here you go!

197
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,640
Kid! Kid! Hey, kid! Wake up!

198
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
You're turning me into a spitball.

199
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,360
How long you been taking
trombone lessons?

200
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,280
Good morning.

201
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,480
I thought you were giving that up.

202
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,480
My dad says you should never
give up something you love.

203
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,160
- Has he ever seen you bat?
- Hey!

204
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,960
So, you know a lot about baseball,
right?

205
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,840
I mean, since you are one.

206
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,560
I know one thing about baseball, it
stinks.

207
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
And you saw me play baseball, right?

208
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,800
Make that two things.
It stinks and so do you.

209
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,320
Well, then maybe
you can give me some pointers.

210
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,440
I could point you to another hobby.
How about marbles or kite watching?

211
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,080
You can watch people fly kites.

212
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,040
How can you hate baseball?
You are a baseball.

213
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
Kid, look,
baseball's only gonna break your heart.

214
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,760
Did you know I made it to the majors?

215
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,000
- You were in the majors?
- Oh, yeah.

216
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,600
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Sun was shining,

217
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,200
forty thousand fans screaming
as I'm tossed to the mound.

218
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,040
It was like a dream come true.

219
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,120
All I ever wanted was to be home run
ball.

220
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,480
And on the very first pitch, crack,
I'm on my way going, going,

221
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,760
foul.

222
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,680
That's right, kid, foul ball.

223
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Right out of the park.

224
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,920
Dreams and everything vanished.
And did anyone ever come look for me?

225
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,520
No. They left me out there to rot.

226
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,120
So believe me when I tell you,
baseball is a field of broken dreams.

227
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,840
Trust me, I know.

228
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,720
Mr. Robinson.
- Good morning, Stanley. Mrs. Irving.

229
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,440
I'm sorry to bother you
so early,

230
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,280
but we have a real problem here.

231
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,040
What sort of a problem, sir?

232
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,040
This is Officer Bryant.
- Hello.

233
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,200
Someone broke into
the Yankees' locker room.

234
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,800
Oh, no.
- Babe Ruth's bat is missing.

235
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,200
You were the only one there
with the keys, Mr. Irving.

236
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,680
What are you implying?

237
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Did you see anyone else
in the locker room last night?

238
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,640
- Wait. There was a security guard.
Yankee...

239
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,680
Dad, after you left the locker room
a security guard came in

240
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,960
and told me to get out.

241
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,680
- You took your son into the locker room?
- It was just for a minute.

242
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you mind if I look in his room?

243
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,040
- Excuse me, my son is not a thief.
Irving.

244
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,400
Thank God you're here. This kid is
crazy.

245
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,000
First he put me in the underpants drawer,
then he pushed me underwater,

246
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,920
then he forced me to eat meatloaf.

247
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,280
This is a disaster.
- Meatloaf!

248
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,880
The Series is only half over.
- Are you listening?

249
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,080
What am I gonna tell the Babe? We need
to pack all the gear for Chicago today.

250
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,520
The bat's not here.

251
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,040
Son, if you know what happened
to the bat, you need to come clean now.

252
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,200
- But that's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Stanley, this is a real mess.

253
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,200
I... I know, Mr. Robinson.

254
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
As the General Manager
of the New York Yankees,

255
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,000
I have no other choice. You're fired.

256
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,640
- Fired?
- Mr. Robinson, please.

257
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,600
Stanley, someone has to be held
responsible. It was your shift.

258
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,080
If Babe's bat is found, then I'll
reconsider, but, until then, I'm sorry.

259
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
Stanley, what are we gonna do?
We're gonna be out on the streets.

260
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,680
- I'll get another job. I'll get two jobs.
- There are no jobs.

261
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,600
Yankee, you were alone in that
locker room. Now the bat's missing.

262
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,800
- Stanley...
- Emily,

263
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,800
there was no security guard on duty.

264
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,880
Yes, there was. Maybe he took the bat.

265
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,080
That's enough.
Son, what happened to the bat?

266
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,520
I don't know.

267
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,800
- Go to your room.
- Why don't you believe me?

268
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,040
Go to your room.

269
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,400
What was all that?
What's with the coppers?

270
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,480
- Someone stole Babe Ruth's bat.
- Good.

271
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,800
- Screwie, my dad got fired.
- Not good.

272
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,640
Why would someone steal
Babe's lucky bat?

273
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,920
The Yankees are gonna lose
the Series for sure.

274
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,040
Whoa, kid, you're watching
way too many newsreels.

275
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,480
That lucky bat stuff
is a bunch of malarkey.

276
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,200
How do you know?
You were only in for one pitch.

277
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,480
Ooh, that hurt.

278
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,400
That guard had to take the bat.

279
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,240
Why would a Yankees security guard
steal Babe Ruth's bat?

280
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,160
Now, if it were a Chicago Cubs
security guard, that I could believe.

281
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,960
Wait a minute.

282
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
Hey, hey, hey, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

283
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,760
I still can't breathe.

284
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Hey, I knew I'd seen that face before.

285
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,240
What are you babbling about?

286
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,680
The security guard was Lefty Maginnis,

287
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,120
pitcher for the Chicago Cubs.

288
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,960
Lefty's the biggest cheater
who ever stepped on a mound.

289
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,840
Lefty stole the bat so Babe can't hit.

290
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,360
The Yankees will lose the Series.
I've got to tell Dad.

291
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,280
Yeah, and don't forget to mention
that you heard it

292
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,000
from your friendly neighborhood
talking baseball.

293
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Kid, this is just a crazy theory

294
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,320
and even if it were true,
no one's gonna believe you.

295
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,640
You don't have any proof.

296
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,080
- Then I'll get some proof.
- How?

297
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,040
Most of the Cubs are heading for Chicago.
What're you gonna do?

298
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,920
Sneak out of the house,
go down to Penn Station,

299
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,880
and search every single passenger?

300
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,000
- Right.
- Oh, no.

301
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,720
If we go to Penn Station,
we may catch him there.

302
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,560
I got to learn to keep my mouth shut.

303
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,080
Whoa! Oh!

304
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,560
This can't work. You're just a kid

305
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,320
and this is the real world,
not some fantasy land

306
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,160
- filled with gumdrop fairies and...
- You're coming with me.

307
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,360
Yeah, I think maybe not,
but thanks for the invite.

308
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,960
Screwie, I have to do this for my dad.

309
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,200
All right, don't look at me...
Don't look at me like that.

310
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,160
Stop it, stop...
Okay, fine, let's make a deal.

311
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,280
I'll help you to find the bat
if you take me back to the sandlot,

312
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,080
- and leave me to rot in peace. Deal?
- Deal.

313
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,400
Hmm.

314
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,960
Oh, whoa!

315
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,000
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

316
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,160
Uh-oh.
What do you mean by "uh-oh"?

317
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,000
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

318
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
- Okay, we're fine.
- I'm okay.

319
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,240
Not fine!

320
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,160
My head! My butt! My head! My butt!

321
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
Oh!

322
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
- So far, so good.
- Are you okay?

323
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,760
- You were screaming pretty loud.
- I wasn't screaming.

324
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
I was laughing.

325
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
Ha! See? Ha, ha, ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Laughing.

326
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,600
There's a million people here.
How we gonna find Lefty?

327
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,800
Just keep looking, all right?

328
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,200
Flyer service to Niagara.
Track 18.

329
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,080
We gotta hurry.

330
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
Why don't we come back in 10 years?
When you're taller.

331
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,880
Make way, there, folks.
Coming through, coming through.

332
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,360
See anything yet?

333
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,680
I see a sock, a candy wrapper,
a Life Saver covered in lint.

334
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,400
- Hmm. Pineapple.
- Screwie. This is no time to fool around.

335
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,080
Now do you see anything?

336
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,760
I see thousands of people
going about their business,

337
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,200
none of which is ours.

338
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,960
There's only one train to Chicago,
so Lefty will have to be on it.

339
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,560
- We're gonna stake it out.
- "Stake it out"?

340
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,720
What, what, what,
now you're with the FBI?

341
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,280
All aboard
for the County Peabody Express:

342
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,920
Better off rotting up
in that sandlot.

343
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,600
I got to get stuck
with J. Edgar Hoover Junior, here.

344
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,000
How are we gonna cover the whole train?
There's like 50 cars and 100 passengers,

345
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,120
and... Holy Mackerel!

346
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,800
Bingo. That's got to be Babe's bat.

347
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,880
Okay, we found him. I'll give you that.
But anything could be in that case.

348
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,880
A trombone, a wooden leg, a pogo
stick.

349
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,360
Well, there he goes,
so I guess we'll never know. Too bad.

350
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
- Come on, boys.
- All aboard!

351
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,560
Hey, wait, wait.
Where are you taking me?

352
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,240
Take a head count
when you get inside, okay?

353
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,480
- I think that's him.
- Let's call the cops.

354
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm not sure. Take a closer look.

355
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,040
- Wow!
- Is it him?

356
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,600
There's a horse jumping off a diving
board.

357
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,040
Wait, I think that's Eleanor
Roosevelt.

358
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
Screwie, is it Lefty or not?

359
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,440
Take a quick look as you roll yourself
back.

360
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,880
Roll myself back from...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

361
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,000
Ow, what a headache! Nope. No.

362
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,800
Hello.

363
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,280
No.

364
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,920
Did you see him?

365
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,280
Third row, aisle seat.
Where are you going?

366
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,720
Good. You got it,
now take me back to the sandlot.

367
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,520
Oh, no!

368
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,520
Huh?

369
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,560
Uh-oh.

370
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,800
Oh, rats!

371
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, no!

372
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,120
Good. That thing's brought us
nothing but trouble.

373
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
Hey, you!

374
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,920
Stop right there.

375
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,600
I'm a ball.

376
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm probably gonna survive this,
but you, you're a squishy little kid.

377
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
Whoa.

378
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,440
Screwie.

379
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,000
Yankee, help me!

380
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,840
Give me back my box, kid.

381
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,480
Huh?

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,080
Oh!

383
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,800
Huh?

384
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Oh, yeah, the kid's still got the
moves.

385
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
Sir, I need to see your ticket!

386
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,680
Whoa!

387
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
Whoa!

388
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,840
Whoa!

389
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,760
Whoa!

390
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,280
Kid, you're gonna get such a time-out.

391
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,440
The fun's over, you little punk.

392
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,840
Screwie, hang on!

393
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,440
Gotcha!

394
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,520
Hey, you...

395
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,600
Hit him! Use your elbow.

396
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,400
Kicking is good.

397
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,040
Oh, that can't feel good.

398
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,320
Doesn't really hurt so bad.

399
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,680
Wait. Yes, it does hurt.

400
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,960
Here it comes. Oh, yeah.

401
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,640
Oh!

402
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
But I need to get to New York.

403
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,720
New York? That way.
You can buy yourself a ticket inside.

404
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,800
Oh, great.

405
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,000
No tickets, no train, no sandlot.

406
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,440
What could be worse?

407
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,880
Well, at least I got the bat.

408
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,720
- Oh, here she goes again.
- Help me, somebody. Help me.

409
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm not supposed to be here.
Help me!

410
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,160
Whoa, sister, relax.

411
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,320
You're a hunk of wood,
not the Hope Diamond.

412
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
Do you know who I am?

413
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,120
I am Darlin', honey. I'm the Babe's
bat.

414
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,480
Born of a 1000-year-old tree
on the side of Mount Olympus.

415
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,440
Struck by lightning,

416
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,280
and carved by monks using
the horn of a unicorn.

417
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,200
Since when do monks make baseball
bats?

418
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,440
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, of course not.

419
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,200
In fact, I was made
from the hide of Seabiscuit,

420
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,920
and stitched together by Betsy Ross!

421
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,880
Screwie was in the Major Leagues, too.

422
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,640
He'd have been a home run ball,
if he hadn't fouled out.

423
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,680
- Oh.
- Kid, don't.

424
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,280
A foul ball? Really?
Well, isn't that impressive.

425
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,280
I've hit thousands of guys
that were better than you.

426
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,240
You know, you bats are all prima
donnas.

427
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,480
You only come out
three or four times a game,

428
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,120
carried to the plate and back.

429
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,080
"Oh, don't let me lay in this dirt.
Where's my batboy?"

430
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,680
Well, here's what you know.

431
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,280
I don't need anybody to carry me around.
I can handle myself. Put me down.

432
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,640
- Put me down!
- Whoa!

433
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,440
Okay.

434
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,440
So long, farm team.

435
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,920
Excuse me.

436
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,080
Two.

437
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,520
You know something?

438
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,240
If you think
I'm rolling all the way to Chicago,

439
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,560
you've got another thing coming.
You may pick me up.

440
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,320
Lf, in fact, you're rescuing me,

441
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,000
then I assume that you are returning me
to my rightful owner, Mr. Babe Ruth,

442
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,760
who, as I'm sure you're aware,
is currently in Chicago

443
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,760
playing in the World Series.

444
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,000
You have heard of the World Series,
haven't you, ball?

445
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,360
Oh, yeah,
I've heard of the World Series.

446
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
But we ain't going to Chicago,
we're going to New York.

447
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
New York? Why?

448
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
I just told you Babe is in Chicago.

449
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,960
When Lefty stole you, my dad got
fired.

450
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,960
If I take you to New York,
then he'll get his job back.

451
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,880
Oh, no, no, no.
You gotta take me to Babe.

452
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,600
Hey, table leg,
don't put any crazy ideas into his head.

453
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,400
We are not going to Chicago.
We are going to New York.

454
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,400
That's it. The baseball has spoken.

455
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,360
- But...
- I said, "The baseball has spoken. "

456
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Fine, that's all right with me.

457
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,480
I just happen to know that
Mr. Babe Ruth is a generous man,

458
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,040
and I'm sure he could get
your daddy's job back.

459
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,880
Maybe even with a big raise.

460
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,400
But y'all want to go to New York,
we'll go to New York.

461
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,800
Only you can make that decision.

462
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh, Stanley, where could he be?

463
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,040
This is all my fault.

464
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,760
I was too hard on him.

465
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,480
How will we ever find him?

466
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,200
I think it's time to call the police.

467
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,640
Ouch! Ouch!

468
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,920
Is that our train?

469
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,040
I don't think so.

470
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,960
Oh.

471
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,520
I know that smell.

472
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Kid, kid, wake up.

473
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,160
Wake up.

474
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,160
- Hey, what do you...
- Quiet.

475
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,480
Lefty's here.

476
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,960
Oh, no.

477
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,880
Get it back some...

478
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,960
Oh, he's gonna be sorry.

479
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
I'll have a non-fat mochaccino,
please.

480
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,800
Quiet, tentpole. It's the bad guy.

481
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,120
...use his head for batting practice.

482
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,840
Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.

483
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,080
Babe Ruth, stop hitting yourself.

484
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,560
Seriously, why are you
hitting yourself, Babe?

485
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
- What?
- Hello, Mr. Cross, it's Lefty Maginnis.

486
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,360
Ah! Lefty.

487
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,560
I've been expecting your call
for several hours.

488
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,440
- From now on, we have to talk in code.
- What?

489
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,680
Are you on the way to Cairo?

490
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,480
- I thought you wanted me in Chicago.
- It's ode-kay, you idiot-ay!

491
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,080
Do you have
our little wooden friend with you?

492
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,640
Yeah, yeah, I've got the bat right
here.

493
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,640
Listen.

494
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,960
- And no one even suspects us.
- Us?

495
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
Raoul, there is no "us. "

496
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,800
If you get caught,
I don't know anything about this.

497
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,320
- Absolutamente not.
- No, Mr. Cross, I just meant

498
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,600
they blamed it on some janitor and his
kid.

499
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,760
Get this. They fired the guy.

500
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,960
We're... I mean, I'm in the clear.

501
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,480
So, now that I have the bat
I'm pitching in the Series, right?

502
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,840
Not so fast, Raoul.

503
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,680
When you make the delivery,
we can discuss your compensation.

504
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,040
- Oh, but Mr. Cross.
- I look forward to seeing the package.

505
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
Oh, what's wrong, little Babe Ruth
bobble-head? You don't approve?

506
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
You look a little groggy. Are you?

507
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,200
Well, perhaps you can use
a seventh-inning stretch.

508
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Yeah.

509
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,960
Ow.

510
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,040
Ow.

511
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,800
Wait till I get...

512
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,680
- Bottom of the ninth, kid.
Train!

513
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,320
Yankee!

514
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,160
Holy cow!

515
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,480
Mama!

516
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,720
Now, what?
We're going to Chicago, silly.

517
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,200
We head for New York,
right, kid?

518
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,360
I don't know. Just let me think.

519
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,120
Why don't we flip a coin?

520
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,720
Heads, we go to New York.
Tails, we burn the bat.

521
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,880
Now, that was rude and uncalled for.

522
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,720
What's that?

523
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,920
- Wolves?
- Wolves?

524
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,240
We're in Pittsburgh.

525
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,640
Wolves are too scared
to come to Pittsburgh.

526
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,040
Oh, kid.
- Screwie!

527
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,880
Help! Help!
Run, Yankee.

528
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,080
Forget him. Run. Save me.

529
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,520
Don't eat me.
You don't know where I've been.

530
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,200
The stench!
I bet even dogs think you have dog breath.

531
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,280
Ow!

532
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,560
- Hey.
- Screwie.

533
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,800
Screwie.

534
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,360
Remember, protect me at all costs.

535
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,320
All right, all right.

536
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,200
I'm doing the best I can with what I
got.

537
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,720
- Who are these guys?
- I think they're pirates.

538
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,160
- In Pennsylvania?
- Pittsburgh Pirates, okay?

539
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,240
Huh?

540
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,000
Sorry.
I was just looking for my ball.

541
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,160
Oh, you mean this?

542
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,480
- Whoa.
- Hey.

543
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,440
- Daisy, easy with that.
Come on, play dead.

544
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,880
Sit, sit. Oh, for crying out loud.

545
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,520
Don't worry, she won't go far.
Not with dinner almost ready.

546
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,960
Louie, I think we have a guest.

547
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,240
Mmm. This is good.

548
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,040
What's your name, son?

549
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,040
- Yankee Irving, sir.
- Yankee?

550
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,120
Yankee Irving. I like that name.

551
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,880
Hey, kid, it's a pleasure to meet you.

552
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
Hey, hey, quit it, will you?

553
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,240
Hmm. Mmm.

554
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,680
- Are you guys...
- Bums?

555
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,160
No.

556
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,720
- No, we're not bums.
- I'm a bum.

557
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,080
Yes, Jack's a bum.

558
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,080
But the rest of us
have just fallen on hard times.

559
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,960
Perfect.

560
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,600
Don't move a muscle, Jack.

561
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,480
:: For the
New York Yankees:::

562
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,480
I got it! Hey, guys, the game is on!

563
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,440
The game. Babe.

564
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,920
- Finally.
- Game's on!

565
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,280
Let's see if he can pull off a
miracle:

566
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
- Hit it.
- You can do it.

567
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,800
- Oh, come on, Babe.
- It's switched the defense: Strike two:

568
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,160
- No, no.
- Oh, no.

569
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,400
- Babe, come on.
- I can't listen to this.

570
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,600
- I can't listen to this.
- Come on, come on, come on.

571
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,080
- Come on, Babe.
- You can do it.

572
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,560
:: It all comes down
to this pitch:

573
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,760
Come on, Babe.

574
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,320
- Babe settles into the box:
- Come on, Babe. Come on, Babe.

575
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,280
Here's the wind up: Here's the swing:
Strike three:

576
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,000
- Oh, no.
- Not again.

577
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Struck out:::

578
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,960
Oh, no.

579
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,200
: In this fifth game of the World Series:
- See, I told you he needed me.

580
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,640
Babe's never struck out this many
times.

581
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,600
I should've returned you by now.
This is all my fault.

582
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
- Hey, buck up, Yankee.
- There's always another game tomorrow.

583
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,000
And the Babe,
the Babe always bounces back.

584
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,960
Oh, come on, son.

585
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,320
Babe's got a big old heart.
He won't let us down.

586
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,720
Look, when Babe was a kid,
he had nothing.

587
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,720
Then he picks up a bat, he starts
swinging,

588
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,080
look where it got him.

589
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,760
If Babe can do it, so can we.

590
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,080
Hey, guys, you hear that?

591
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,080
That's the 10:15 Manhattan Express
headed straight for New York.

592
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,080
All right, let's pack it up.
We're moving out.

593
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,320
It's about time.

594
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,240
Whoa!

595
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,200
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

596
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,440
That's it.

597
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,960
- Yankee!
- Come on, kid.

598
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,400
Come on, Yankee!

599
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,240
Grab on!

600
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,520
Yankee, come on!

601
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,160
Come on, son!

602
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,680
Yankee, come on, run. Keep running.

603
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,120
No, keep running.

604
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,440
Keep on running.

605
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,520
- Why is he not running?
- I don't know.

606
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,880
Sorry, guys, I can't go.
I've got to give Babe his bat back.

607
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,280
- What did he say?
- He said he's going to get his backpack.

608
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,760
- Bye.
Yankee, what're you doing?

609
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,600
You heard those guys. Babe's their
hero.

610
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,480
Babe's everyone's hero,

611
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,520
and I can't let them down,
and I can't let my dad down.

612
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,640
- We're going to Chicago.
- Oh, thank you.

613
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,920
Thank you.
I knew you were gonna see this my way.

614
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,400
This is great. We had a deal, Yankee.

615
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,920
And you, you rotten two-by-four,
this is all your fault.

616
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,120
You tricked him.
You messed everything up.

617
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,200
Face it, leather face, you're beat.

618
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,760
Fine, I can't trust you.
I'll go back to New York on my own.

619
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,760
Whoa!

620
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
Yankee!

621
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,680
I guess a couple of days in Chicago
couldn't hurt.

622
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,080
I've been curious
about their deep-dish pizza,

623
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,760
but after that I'm heading back
to the Big Apple.

624
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,200
You know, I was just a splinter
when I first read about it.

625
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,600
So after Babe and I
were presented to the court,

626
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,680
the Queen invited us to try our hand
at an English sport.

627
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,040
And there was this cheeky cricket bat
who kept trying to look down my tape

628
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,640
and I... Why are we stopping?

629
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,840
'Cause I'm tired and hungry.

630
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,000
- You guys ever eat?
- No.

631
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,240
I've got to maintain this very trim
figure.

632
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,520
Trim? Ha!

633
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,760
From where I'm sitting, I see lots of
grain.

634
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,040
- Are you saying I'm plump?
- I'm saying you're fat, bat.

635
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,000
Excuse me, I have been examined
by scientists around the world,

636
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,400
who can't figure out
how I can look this good

637
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,800
- and swing so well.
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.

638
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,480
Have these scientists done research
about your big mouth?

639
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,800
- Can you say the same, Scarface?
- I'm not gonna sit here

640
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,760
- and listen to this.
I don't think so.

641
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,880
- Hey, look, a baseball.
- Hey, look, the missing link.

642
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,280
Put me down.

643
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,960
Hey...

644
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,240
- Give him back.
- Him?

645
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,200
What did you do? Name it?

646
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,680
What's he got?
A little bed or something?

647
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,080
- Do you dress him up?
- Give him back.

648
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,880
- Give him back.
- Hey, Yankee.

649
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,320
- Help!
- Oh, let him have him, Yankee.

650
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,320
All he does is complain anyway.

651
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,440
We can find a ball with a better attitude.
Like a tennis ball.

652
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,960
They're all warm and fuzzy.

653
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,720
- You, give him back that ball!
- Get lost, Marti.

654
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,960
- Take that!
- Yeah, mind your own business.

655
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,440
Hey, kid,
you gonna let a girl fight for you?

656
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,720
No.

657
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,480
But I'll let her help.

658
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,120
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Let's get your ball back.

659
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,560
Looks like we're fighting two girls.

660
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,920
Ow.

661
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,760
You got him
right in the head.

662
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,640
The kid's not even ducking.

663
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,000
Watch out.

664
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,880
- You gotta start dodging these apples.
- I'm trying.

665
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
No, you're not.
Don't look where they're going.

666
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,880
You gotta watch
where they're starting from.

667
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,200
- Yeah, that's it.
- Okay.

668
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,080
What're you looking at me for?
Watch the apples.

669
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,120
Don't you make me break out
my whuppin' stick.

670
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,400
Incoming!

671
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,680
I've been hit. I feel like a Danish.

672
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,200
Come on.

673
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,760
Ow!

674
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
All right, just take your stupid ball.

675
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,120
Yeah!

676
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,840
Oh!

677
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,000
Medic!

678
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,720
Hold me, I'm so cold.

679
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,160
Come on.

680
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,560
Ow!

681
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,240
- Thanks for helping me back there.
- No problem.

682
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
You were really starting
to get the hang of it.

683
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,120
That Tubby Tyler
will be picking apple seeds

684
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,000
out of his teeth for a week.

685
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,520
- Whoa, you can really throw.
- "Fastball" is my middle name.

686
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,360
My daddy taught me to pitch
when I was four years old.

687
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,120
- Really?
- Come on, I'll show you.

688
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,680
- Hey, Mom, this is Yankee.
- Hi.

689
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,560
- Hello.
- Pleased to... Whoa!

690
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,280
Holy mackerel.

691
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
My heavens!

692
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,080
This is my dad right here.

693
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,080
He's a pitcher for the Cincinnati
Tigers.

694
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,160
Your dad is Lonnie Brewster?

695
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,960
Lonnie "The Rooster" Brewster?

696
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,320
- The king of the curve ball?
- That's right.

697
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,920
He can pitch to me anytime.

698
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,080
- I think I'm gonna pitch my lunch.
- Whoa.

699
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,760
No-hitter in Cleveland.

700
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,320
That was the ten-inning game
that he threw twenty strike-outs.

701
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,640
- Grand slam in Milwaukee.
- Yeah.

702
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
That was the game were my dad made

703
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,440
- two triple plays.
- Triple plays.

704
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,960
- Your dad's incredible.
- Yeah, he sure is.

705
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,360
- He's my hero.
- My dad works at Yankee Stadium.

706
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,960
Really?

707
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,080
Do you ever dream of playing
at Yankee Stadium?

708
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
Oh, yeah, all the time.

709
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,560
But I'm kind of in a slump right now.
I'll never be good enough.

710
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,040
Yankee, did you run away from home?

711
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,600
I'm not running away. I'm on a
mission.

712
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,520
This is Babe Ruth's bat.

713
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,280
That's not Darlin', is it?

714
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,120
Yeah. I have to get her to Babe,
in Chicago, right away.

715
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,360
Hey, maybe my dad can help.
His team is heading there tomorrow.

716
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,440
- Hello. May I help you?
- Hello.

717
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,880
I've been worried sick about my son.

718
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,240
You know,
since he's my son and everything.

719
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,160
Just give this to my dad.
He's playing in Toledo.

720
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,280
- Thanks.
Yankee, your dad's here.

721
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,520
Dad?

722
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,720
Come on, son. Time to go.

723
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,680
- He's not my dad!
- MARTl: Run, Yankee.

724
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,120
- Out of my way.
- Marti!

725
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,840
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

726
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,240
You stop it right there, Mister.

727
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,200
Whoa!

728
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,560
Whoa!

729
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,520
Just you wait
till the police get here.

730
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,560
Oh!

731
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,760
MARTl: Run, Yankee!

732
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,600
Run, Yankee. Run!

733
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Give me the bat. Give me the bat.

734
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,960
Give me that bat.

735
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,560
Okay, kid, you've had your fun.

736
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,320
- Now give me the bat back.
- No.

737
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,400
I'm taking her to Chicago,
and giving her back to Babe.

738
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,120
- You tell him, Yank.
- I stole this thing fair and square.

739
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,280
My dad's gonna get his job back.

740
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,600
Yeah, well, I want my job back.

741
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,600
I'm a pitcher. I pitch.
What does a janitor do? Janit?

742
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,640
Oh, oh, my nose...

743
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,840
Oh!

744
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,480
Take that, you bum.

745
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,080
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

746
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,720
Marti, I just want to say...

747
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,840
Mmm-hmm?

748
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,840
- I want the bat.
- Yankee,

749
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,440
- let's get out of here.
- The bat.

750
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,800
- Go find my dad.
- Where's the bat?

751
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,080
- See you later, Yankee.
- Where's the bat? Where's the bat?

752
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,560
Thanks, Marti!

753
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,680
Gimme the bat.

754
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,360
Why can't you stay
on your side of the pack?

755
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,640
Because if I stay on that side,
I'll get all wet

756
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,120
- and I don't wanna get all swollen.
- You know, you're right.

757
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,880
- You are getting swollen.
- Where, where?

758
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,240
In your big fat bat head.

759
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,240
Oh, you are gonna get it.
You and that horse you came off of.

760
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,200
Oh, is that a threat?
Give me your best swing.

761
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,680
My best swing,
and your stitches are gonna need stitches.

762
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,920
Will you two just knock it off!

763
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,160
- Well, what's wrong with him?
- I'll tell you what's wrong with him.

764
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,560
He's a ten-year-old kid,
stuck in the middle of nowhere

765
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,080
with a selfish bat
who treats him like a pack mule.

766
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,600
- I do not treat him like a pack mule.
- Oh, yeah?

767
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,640
Ever thank him for saving you from
Lefty,

768
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,080
or carting you all the way back
to Chicago?

769
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,600
I...

770
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,800
Yankee, it occurs to me
that I have not properly thanked you

771
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,600
from saving me from that ruffian,
Lefty Maginnis,

772
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,880
and carrying me all this way.

773
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,040
- That's okay.
- No, it most certainly is not.

774
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,080
My mama would just be mortified
at my behavior,

775
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,080
and I just want to tell you how much
I appreciate what you're doing for me.

776
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,880
Yankee, is there something else
bothering you?

777
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,960
- I miss my mom and dad.
- You know what?

778
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,600
Sometimes, Babe misses his family
when he's on the road, too.

779
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,960
Why?

780
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,440
He's surrounded by reporters
and fans and everything.

781
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,760
That's true, but they're not there
'cause they're his friends.

782
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,040
They just hang around 'cause he's
famous.

783
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,360
You know something?
You remind me a lot of Babe.

784
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,880
- Oh, please.
- Really?

785
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,400
Oh, yes. You know, I believe
he's gonna like meeting you.

786
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,240
Thanks, Darlin'.

787
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,320
No, no. Thank you, Yankee.

788
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,080
Oh, brother.
You could pour this stuff on pancakes.

789
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,480
Here's the windup, and the
pitch.

790
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,720
It's a home run! The crowd goes wild!

791
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,120
They're going nuts in Chicago!

792
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,600
I'd like to thank
all the little people.

793
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,920
But especially myself!

794
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,920
- What?
- Mr. Cross.

795
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,600
- It's Lefty.
Lefty, my boy, the plan is working:

796
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,200
The Series is virtually in the bag.

797
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,480
- Where are you?
- Where am I? I'm on the:::

798
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,080
I'm on the phone in Toledo, Ohio.

799
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,320
I... I just needed to change trains.

800
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,360
Do you have the at-bay with you?

801
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,200
The bat is...
It's on its way to Chicago, boss.

802
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,440
If the bat's on its way,
but you're in Toledo,

803
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,880
I'm feeling like you're not being
completely honest with me, Lefty:

804
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,480
You don't have the bat, do you?

805
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,440
- I'm... I...
- You moron!

806
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,120
There's one game left in this Series:

807
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,440
If I don't have that bat in my paws
before it starts,

808
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,600
you don't have a job, Lefty: All
right?

809
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,880
You know what I think?

810
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,360
- I think there's trouble with this line, boss.
- Hello?

811
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,600
- I think the phone isn't working!
- Operator: Operator?

812
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,800
- Can you hear me, boss?
- Operator:

813
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,680
- Hello! Hello!
- Lefty, hello?

814
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
- What a jerk!
What was that, Lefty?

815
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,160
- I said the phone doesn't work.
- Lefty:

816
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,320
- Work!
- Who has the bat?

817
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,240
- Doesn't work!
- I said who has it, Lefty?

818
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,920
- Work! Work! Work!
- Hello?

819
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,080
Fine:

820
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,880
Would you autograph
my program, please?

821
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,080
Sure thing, miss.

822
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,320
Hey!

823
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Hey, now. Hey. Hello. Oh, hi!

824
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,920
- Hello, thank you so much.
- Hey, bat girl, they're not cheering for you.

825
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,560
Oh, but they should be.

826
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,480
Gee, Mr. Brewster,
would you sign this for us, please?

827
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,680
- Sure. Sure, kids.
- Thank you.

828
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,200
- Yes!
- There you go.

829
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,800
You keep on rooting for us, all right?

830
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,880
- Thank you, Mr. Brewster.
- Thank you.

831
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,960
- See you soon...
- Excuse me, Mr. Brewster?

832
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,680
Cap, let's go.

833
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,080
All right, Hank. All right.

834
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,560
Yankee fan, huh?

835
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,880
Your boys gonna be able
to pull themselves out of the fire?

836
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,200
- What do you mean?
- Yankees lost again last night.

837
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,280
- Got beat bad.
- Oh, no!

838
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,320
- Lost again?
- Yup. The Series is all tied up.

839
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,160
Only one game left.

840
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,320
All right, Willie.
Let's get something going here.

841
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,320
- Watch your head, son.
- Whoa!

842
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,760
I could have caught that
with my eyes closed.

843
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,920
What are they doing?

844
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,080
Oh, my gosh! They're mimes.
Get me out of here.

845
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,440
Never seen anyone
play shadow ball before, huh?

846
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,920
Keeps us on top of our game.

847
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,760
Hey, everybody. This is Yankee Irving
and he's riding with us to Chicago.

848
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,720
How're you doing, Yankee?

849
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,040
- Hey, Willie, are we still playing?
- Yankee here's gonna pinch hit for me.

850
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,800
- You think you can handle it?
- I can hit anything Hank can throw.

851
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,680
Get on up there, hip-pockets.
Welcome to the big leagues, son.

852
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,440
- Batter up.
- Yankee...

853
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,120
Hey, just a minute, y'all.

854
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,160
Look here, son,
your stance has got all kinds of style.

855
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,120
Yeah, you look good.
You just ain't gonna hit nothing.

856
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,400
Half of hittin' is balance.

857
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,400
You get your feet set right and
you could hit anything you can reach.

858
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,400
Keep your knees bent

859
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,760
and your head down.

860
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,760
I'm not sure I can take much more of
this.

861
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,200
- Hey, hey.
- Yank's got a baseball right here.

862
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,320
What happened to the invisible ball?

863
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,920
Oh, relax, you knuckle ball.

864
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,880
How can something so round
be so square?

865
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,040
- Whoa!
- Balance, that's the key to hittin' the ball.

866
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,840
Now you're getting it.

867
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,160
Whoa!

868
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,040
I'm afraid of heights!

869
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,160
I got it, I got it, I got it.

870
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,440
That was kind of fun,
but don't do it again, okay?

871
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,520
What am I saying? That was fun.

872
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,480
Whoa! Come on.

873
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,120
Come on, put some pepper on me.

874
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,960
I want more. Give me more!
I'm a screwball!

875
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,080
He looks like a pro.

876
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,600
- Look at you. You've got great form.
- Really?

877
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,840
Look at me, Yank.

878
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,840
Coming through. Look at this.

879
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,480
Yippety-do! Come on, come on, come on.

880
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Okay, now you go ahead,
you show them how to do it.

881
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,720
Here comes the gas.

882
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,880
This is easy. I can do this.

883
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,720
- That's the way you swing it!
- All right. Yeah!

884
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,040
- Did you see me? I did it!
- We're having fun now.

885
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,600
Oh, this boy means business.

886
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,280
This is a little tiny Babe
right here.

887
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,640
Wow.

888
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,640
Look, son.
The Yankees always stay at this hotel.

889
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,280
You're gonna be okay here.

890
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,400
I want you to go inside
and call your daddy.

891
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,040
I will, Mr. Brewster.

892
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,440
- And thanks for everything.
- So long, slugger.

893
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,760
Bye-bye now, Yankee.
- Bye, guys. See you later.

894
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,160
I'll be seeing you, hip-pockets.
Take care, kid.

895
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,680
Good luck.

896
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,080
Oh! Ah!

897
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,800
Wow.
Some joint.

898
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,000
Poor Babe.
He must be devastated without me.

899
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,400
Hey, Babe! Hey, Babe!
Hey, Babe!

900
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,240
Hey, how are you folks? Good to see
you.

901
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,960
Babe Ruth.

902
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,120
That's Babe!
That's my Babe! Look at Babe!

903
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,560
Get him to sign me.
Maybe I'll be worth something someday.

904
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,040
Hey, good to see you.
How've you been?

905
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,960
Hey, Babe. When are
you Yankees gonna turn it around, huh?

906
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,680
Hey, baseball is full of surprises.
Anything can happen.

907
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,960
Hey, Babe,
smile for the camera.

908
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,440
I believe the ragamuffin convention
is in the alley behind the hotel.

909
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,800
But I need to see Babe.

910
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,040
As do several hundred other baseball
fans.

911
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,160
I thought you said this is...
- Hey.

912
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,480
Hey, Lou.
Get a load of this kid.

913
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,280
- You little ruffian!
- I told you...

914
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,560
- No, no. Let me go. I just got to see Babe.
- This hotel is not for snotty-nosed brats...

915
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,360
Hey, Mr. D. Bring that kid back over
here.

916
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,000
Hey, kid, you hungry?

917
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,160
But Mr. Ruth, this hotel is for guests
only.

918
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,160
Yeah, well, he's my guest.

919
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,720
- Yes, sir, but...
- Bring him a banana split or something.

920
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,440
- Bring me one, too.
- Hey, what're you doing?

921
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,720
Hey, oy. Yankee! She, she...

922
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,000
But she... Darlin'!

923
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,920
Hey, Yankee... Hang on, Darlin'!

924
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,480
This looks like a job for Superball!
Up, up and away!

925
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,200
- So, what's your name, kid?
- Yankee Irving, sir.

926
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,520
Hey, you got spunk, you know that?

927
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,920
He reminds me of me back in the day.

928
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,080
Babe, I need to talk to you about
Darlin'.

929
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,000
Well, they don't get it right in the
papers.

930
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,560
Darlin' and I, we...
We had something special.

931
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,320
You know, kid,
I'd never say this to anyone,

932
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,840
but it was almost like I could tell her
right where I wanted to hit the ball

933
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,600
and she'd make it happen.

934
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,840
- Kind of crazy, right?
- Babe, I have Darlin'.

935
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,360
You have Darlin'?
All right then, hand her over.

936
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,520
Get your hands off her!

937
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,320
Ow!

938
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,880
The dumber they are, the harder they
fall.

939
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,600
I was once the prettiest pine in the
forest.

940
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,600
Babe always used to say,
"Darlin' you could be a Christmas tree. "

941
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,520
Beautiful story, princess.
Now let's get out of here.

942
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,320
You roll, I'll steer.

943
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Huh?

944
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,400
Hey, what is this? Some kind of joke?
That's not my bat.

945
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,720
And unless you have a pound of roast beef,
that's not even lunch.

946
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,800
Babe, I just had her.
She was right here in my backpack.

947
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,000
Lefty Maginnis stole her.

948
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,840
I brought her all the way back here
from New York.

949
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,320
I got to find her.

950
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,240
Just roll... Just...

951
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,760
- Yank.
- Darlin'!

952
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,200
- Hurry, Yank.
- You got to get... You!

953
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,400
Hello.

954
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,560
Help! Help!

955
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,600
Help!

956
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,120
Help! Help!
- Drive the car!

957
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,280
So tragic.
The indomitable, the unflappable,

958
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,480
the amazing Babe Ruth's last turn at plate
and no magic bat to rely on.

959
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,360
Will he go down in three pitches,
do you think?

960
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,880
- Yank, don't listen to him.
- Yeah. He's just an angry little troll.

961
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,600
He doesn't need a magic bat.

962
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,040
Really? And yet you tried so hard
to return it to him.

963
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,240
What do you say we listen to the radio
and see what's happening?

964
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,560
And it looks like the Cubs
have the Championship in the bag:

965
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,240
The Yankees trail the Cubs
six to nothing with no men on:::

966
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,040
- Come on, Babe.
- Babe Ruth is at the plate:

967
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,040
Come on.

968
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,280
Here's the pitch: Swing, and strike
three:

969
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,760
That's going to send Babe
back to the bench:

970
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,680
Oh, my Babe.

971
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,040
Which now looks more like
a funeral parlor: The Yankees look beat,

972
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,560
and with only two outs to go,
they probably are:

973
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,480
Well, I believe that's gonna do it
for your Yankees, Yankee.

974
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Oh... I suppose
this bat's not much of a threat now.

975
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,840
I hope you get splinters everywhere.

976
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Of course there's always next year.

977
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,680
Maybe I'll take her
to my cabin on the lake.

978
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,000
There're some beavers there
that'd love to make her acquaintance.

979
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,480
Give it a little nibble.

980
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,160
I suppose I should be heading down to the
field to accept my World Series trophy.

981
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,200
You just stay put, little Yankee.

982
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,040
I'm sure your parents have given up
looking for you by now.

983
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,800
The orphanage should be here
any minute to pick you up.

984
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,000
Just walk in saying,

985
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,480
"I'm the boy who lost Babe Ruth's bat
and cost him the World Series.

986
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,360
"How're you folks doing?"

987
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,840
Sleep on that, Yankee.

988
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,120
So what's the plan, Yank?

989
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,960
- There is no plan, Screwie.
- You mean we're winging it?

990
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,440
- Great. What do we do first?
- Nothing.

991
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,400
There is nothing we can do.
Don't you get it? It's over.

992
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,520
Babe struck out. We failed.

993
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,560
You were right, Screwie. I'm just a
kid.

994
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,880
I should have just quit.

995
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,880
That's it? You're laying down your
bat?

996
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,080
You know, when I landed in that
sandlot,

997
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,760
I thought, "That's it.
There's nothing left to do but rot. "

998
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,520
But then you came along.

999
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,760
And there was all this...
This jumping on trains,

1000
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,360
and the thing with the apples
and playing ball with the Tigers.

1001
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,040
You made a believer out of me.

1002
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,200
I wasn't right, kid. Not at all.

1003
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,840
So what, the Yankees lose a game?
Is that why you did this?

1004
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,360
So Babe can set his millionth record?

1005
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:38,000
Did Babe teach you how to throw?
Is Babe gonna pay your family's rent?

1006
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,200
Why did you do this, Yankee? Why?

1007
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,680
- To help my dad.
- Then the game's not over, Yankee.

1008
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,520
Are you gonna keep swingin'?

1009
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,040
I thought baseball
was a field of broken dreams.

1010
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,680
I'm not talking about baseball.
I'm talking about family.

1011
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,720
- Darlin', we gotta...
- I heard everything he said.

1012
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,840
Yankee, I would be honored to help
save your Daddy's job.

1013
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,480
And here I thought you were
a hard-hearted old crank.

1014
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,440
- All right...
- And now I come to find out

1015
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,960
that under that tough leather shell
is just a gooey caramel center.

1016
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,680
- Enough already.
- Fine.

1017
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,040
Unless, of course,
you've got something else you wanna say.

1018
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,000
You did good, baseball.

1019
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,040
Thanks, bat.

1020
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,960
- So how're we getting out of here?
- The window.

1021
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,640
- It doesn't open.
- Don't you get it? Baseball. Window.

1022
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,640
Smasharoonie.

1023
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,840
Screwie, are you sure?

1024
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,400
Look at me.
I'm covered in stitches already.

1025
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,480
Now, let's smash some glass!

1026
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,040
Okay, I think
we're softening up the glass a little.

1027
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,160
Try again.

1028
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,760
Play ball!

1029
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,040
Screwie, where are you?

1030
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,400
Don't worry about me. Get to the Babe.
I'll be all right.

1031
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,040
Hey, a foul ball.

1032
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,040
I just can't shake that, can I?

1033
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,640
Whoa!
Hey, watch it, watch it! Hey!

1034
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
Whoa!

1035
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,120
You see, baseball is about teamwork,
a certain level of dignity...

1036
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,160
What the?

1037
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,720
Hey, kid!
Stop that kid.

1038
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,760
Don't go down there.

1039
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,440
Lou, that kid, I... I know that kid.

1040
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,560
You remember that kid. That's the...
That, that... It's that kid.

1041
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,680
Wait a minute:

1042
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
There seems to be some sort of
commotion developing in the stands:

1043
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,200
The ushers are chasing someone
through the crowd:

1044
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,040
I can't quite see who it is:

1045
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,160
Well, the ushers appear to be chasing
a boy carrying a baseball bat:

1046
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,360
He looks to be about 10 years old:
He's wearing a Yankees baseball cap,

1047
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,960
And let me tell you, folks,

1048
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,720
he's really giving the Cubs personnel
a run for their money:

1049
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,080
Hey, kid!

1050
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,120
Strike three! What the hey?

1051
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,760
- Move! Move!
- Come on! Come on!

1052
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,120
Aren't you playing, huh, Yank?

1053
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,080
Hey, kid. What are you doing here?

1054
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,320
Come here, get off the field!

1055
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,640
- I just need to get this to Babe.
- Hey, hey.

1056
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,560
Hey, what're you trying to do?

1057
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,960
Well, well, well. I'm...
It's really my Darlin'.

1058
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,400
- It's my Babe.
- Babe, here she is.

1059
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,720
- Just like I told you.
- No! Stop! Umpire.

1060
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,560
I demand you call this game immediately,
if not sooner, 'cause of shenanigans.

1061
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,720
Yeah, not so fast, short stuff.
Your man Lefty stole my bat.

1062
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,880
Is that your bat? I didn't...

1063
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,600
- Tell him, Babe. You tell him.
- What?

1064
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,680
That's the most absurd thing
I've ever heard!

1065
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,600
Isn't that a penalty? Shouldn't they
forfeit?

1066
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,880
Yankees, you got two minutes
to get your batter in the box

1067
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,040
or you'll forfeit the game.

1068
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:22,160
All right, right.
Hold your... Hold your horses.

1069
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,040
It's not okay. We're in bad shape.
- Yankee. Yankee.

1070
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,160
Do you notice where you're standing, boy?

1071
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,160
Home plate in the middle
of the World Series.

1072
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,560
Now how does that feel, slugger?

1073
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,920
You're looking good, Yankee.

1074
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,920
- Don't you think so, Babe? Babe? Babe!
- Darlin'.

1075
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,600
- Big man, look over here!
- Darlin'.

1076
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,240
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling to Babe.

1077
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,880
Yeah, look at this team.
We look like we're already beat.

1078
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,040
Who can we put at the plate
that will set this place on its ear?

1079
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,760
Keep this team from
throwing in the towel.

1080
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,560
Look at the boy
standing on home plate.

1081
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,760
Ain't he something? Listen.

1082
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,680
Hey! You hear me talking to you?

1083
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,280
- Huh?
- Why don't you put him in the game?

1084
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,640
Babe, look at us.

1085
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,840
I know who's gonna bat. Him.

1086
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,360
Babe, forget it. This isn't Little League.
It's the World Series.

1087
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,800
He's just a kid.

1088
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,000
This kid brought Darlin' from New York
to Chicago all by himself.

1089
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,360
If he can do that, he can do anything.

1090
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,600
Come on, guys. This is baseball.
Anything can happen.

1091
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,120
What do you say?

1092
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,520
Hmm.

1093
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,960
All right, Yankees. Time's up.
Who's your hitter?

1094
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,280
- Him. There's our hitter.
- Huh?

1095
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,040
- What?
Play ball!

1096
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,160
I... I don't know about
this.

1097
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,080
You are about to bat in the World
Series!

1098
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,800
I guess you guys really are desperate.

1099
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,840
I know, I have no strike zone,
so don't swing.

1100
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,720
Of course you swing.
Here, you can use my Darlin'.

1101
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,320
But, Babe,
nobody's ever used Darlin' but you.

1102
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
Yeah, well...

1103
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,560
I don't want her to hear this,
but it's not really the bat,

1104
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,320
it's the batter.

1105
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,880
Now go get them, kid.

1106
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,440
So what's happening? What did I miss?

1107
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,000
- Yankee's gonna pinch hit.
- What?

1108
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,840
I mean, what a great idea! Wow!

1109
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,920
Who came up with that one?
Because that's a beauty, boy.

1110
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,680
- Screwie!
- You can do it, Yankee,

1111
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,080
and I'll be right here the whole time
to talk you through it.

1112
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,360
Batter up!

1113
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,600
Whoa! Scratch that.
I'll be right here.

1114
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,080
I thought it was supposed to be Babe,
not a baby.

1115
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,320
Well, sports fans,
the Yankees have put

1116
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,680
a 10-year-old boy in as the pinch
hitter:

1117
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,520
- A boy? What, are they kidding?
- Oh, I'm being given a name

1118
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,920
for the young rookie:

1119
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,880
- It's Yankee Irving:
- Yankee Irving?

1120
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,440
Now batting for the New York Yankees,
number one, Yankee Irving:

1121
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,960
- That's my boy!
- Yankee?

1122
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,680
They're putting him in the game.
Yankee. Yankee.

1123
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,800
Okay, Lefty, all you have to do
is strike the kid out.

1124
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,080
Just finish it!

1125
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,360
Okay, kid, you're about to lose
a whole lot of baby teeth.

1126
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,080
Settle in, Yank. You can do this!

1127
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,000
Don't just stand there, you gotta
swing.

1128
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,000
Strike one!

1129
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,760
Okay, now you know
he's throwing strikes. Be ready.

1130
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,600
He can do it.

1131
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,280
Watch me, now, watch me!
Curveball! Curveball! Swing!

1132
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,720
- Strike two!
- Darn!

1133
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,080
Come on now, sugar.
I cannot swing myself.

1134
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,200
Yank!
Yankee.

1135
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,200
Yankee, we're here!
We're here!

1136
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,600
- Yank!
- Yank, we're here!

1137
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,400
Mom? Dad?

1138
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,640
- Just swing!
- Just swing!

1139
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,200
You get your feet set right,
you can hit anything you can reach:

1140
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,720
MARTl: Keep your eye on the ball:

1141
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,280
If Babe can do it, so can you:

1142
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,680
- Oh, my.
- Time for the booger ball.

1143
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,720
I can't believe you just blew
your nose on me.

1144
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,200
Come on, Yankee.

1145
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,640
Take your time. Focus!

1146
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,400
Uh-oh.

1147
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,680
I'm going! I'm going! I'm not going.

1148
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,080
Run!

1149
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,320
And he hit it!
The kid hit the ball!

1150
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,720
Go, go, go, go, go.

1151
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,160
It's a short blooper
and Irving is sprinting to first base!

1152
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,600
I said I got it.

1153
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,720
It sails right past Taylor,
the first baseman:

1154
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,920
Go for second! Go for second!

1155
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,880
Irving rounds first base
as Taylor and Cuyler chase it down:

1156
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,280
Slide, Yankee!

1157
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,560
Irving is rounding second
and is barreling towards third,

1158
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,600
but I don't think he's gonna make it,
folks:

1159
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,240
Go, Yankee, go!
- Come on, Yankee! Go!

1160
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,040
Move it! Move it!

1161
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,120
Lefty Maginnis is covering::: Holy
cow!

1162
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,720
- Irving just:::
- Look at that kid go, huh?

1163
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,720
- Come on, Yankee!
- Go, Yankee, go!

1164
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,680
Oh, this is gonna be close, folks:

1165
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,520
Hedley has come up with the ball
and looks to home plate:

1166
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,560
- The fun's over, you little runt!
- Trip him! Somebody!

1167
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,440
- The boy is not slowing down!
- Not this time, punk!

1168
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,640
Slide!

1169
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,920
Or not slide!

1170
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,760
Safe!

1171
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,600
- Way to go!
- All right, Yankee!

1172
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,280
How about that kid, huh?

1173
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,680
Oh, no! No!

1174
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,520
That's a little Tiger if I ever seen
one.

1175
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,040
He did it! That's my Yankee!

1176
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,280
Yankee! Yankee! Yankee!

1177
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,560
Hey, Yank! We're coming down!
We're coming down!

1178
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,880
That's my friend!

1179
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
Ow! Ow!

1180
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,240
Oh, that's me.

1181
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,520
- We did it, Darlin'.
- No, you did it.

1182
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,400
Like Babe said,

1183
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,320
"It's not the bat, it's the batter. "

1184
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,800
Listen to them, kid! They love you!

1185
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,000
They're cheering for you, too,
Screwie!

1186
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,280
Can you believe it? I'm a home run
ball!

1187
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,320
Yahoo!

1188
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,840
You always were.

1189
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,440
Way to go, kid.

1190
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,760
Thanks, Babe.

1191
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,520
Yankee.
Yankee.

1192
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,200
- Yankee.
- Yankee.

1193
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,720
Mom! Dad!

1194
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,480
- I did it, Dad. I did it.
- I always knew you could do it.

1195
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,600
- You just kept swinging.
- Just like you taught me, Dad.

1196
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,360
Yankee's home run sparked
the New York rally that scored seven runs:

1197
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,440
Babe himself drove in four:

1198
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,440
And when the Cubs came to bat,

1199
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,160
they went down, one, two, three:
Just like that:

1200
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,640
The Yankees won the World Series:

1201
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,720
And it just goes to show you,

1202
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,880
you can be the smallest,
you can be the weakest,

1203
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,360
you can be the worst player on the
field,

1204
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,880
but when people tell you you're no good,
and say you should give it up,

1205
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,560
you know what you do?

1206
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,000
You just keep on swinging:

1207
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,840
- Hello!
- Hey!

1208
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,360
Yeah!

1209
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,680
Uh-oh.

1210
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,720
All right, all right. That's enough.

1211
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,840
All right, Yankee.
That's enough, that's enough.

1212
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:41,840
