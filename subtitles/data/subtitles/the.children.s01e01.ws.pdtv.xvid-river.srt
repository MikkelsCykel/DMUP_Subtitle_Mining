You got a number?

00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,315
Number nine.

Call emergency assistance.

Through there, lying there.

00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:04,275
I couldn't get through.
I couldn't see for sure.

10
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,195
Too late.

00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,035
Cam?

12
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,315
Stop here, sir.
What's happened?

13
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:51,275
What's happening?

14
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:32,395
Done?

15
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:37,315
A particularly shitty chapter in my
life closed.

16
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:41,235
Jack! Hey, son, at last.

17
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:43,755
I'll take this in my car.
Nice of you to join us.

18
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,315
Anyway,

19
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:50,355
goodbye to the single life, eh?

20
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:52,435
Staying the night?

21
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:55,235
No. First night at Sue's house. Nice
big bedroom.

22
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,275
Mum is picking me up at ten.

23
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,315
Oh. Well...

24
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:01,355
At least you're celebrating with us.

25
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,715
Are you all right?

26
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,995
I'm getting a kitten.

27
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,955
Nice one.

28
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:33,235
You got a lot.

29
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:35,515
Them boys won't take long to
demolish it.

30
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,555
Ready when you are.

31
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:39,595
Jack!

32
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,555
Fodder!

33
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,635
Is he OK?
He's fine.

34
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,835
Great.
It's been his home, too, Cam.

35
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,755
Us blokes don't see things the same
way you girlies do.

36
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,075
And he'll miss having you all to
himself. Oh, do give over.

Superb.

39
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,555
Hey, look at that.

40
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:13,795
That's great. Lovely.

41
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,875
I love that, Jacko.

42
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,155
Can we find a little corner for it
somewhere? Course we can.

43
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:21,235
Pride of place.

44
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:23,155

Thank you.

47

To us.
And my kitten.

48
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:44,795
Do you think it's going to work out?

49
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,835
Between you and me?

50
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,795
It'll be a disaster.

51
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,915
Be serious.

52
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,875
Course it will.

53
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,315
Course it will.

54
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:03,995
Sweetheart.

55
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:05,955
Of course it will.

56
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,115
I didn't see her face.

57
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,315
I can't be sure it's her.

59
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,595
Oh, no.

00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:27,995
Are you sure
it's Mary picking you up today?

62

00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:20,035
Shit.
Anybody home?

00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,955
It's only Cam.

84
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:03,315
But my work doesn't count.
I've got a governors' meeting.

85
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,875
I can hardly let them down.
When did you ever?

86
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,115
I'm not asking for a whole precious
evening. Just so I can cash up.

87
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:11,195
Are you deaf or just stupid?

88
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:14,555
I'm looking after a seven-year-old.
Who is not my problem.

89
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:17,315
Or your problem.
Your son is your problem.

90
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,395
All right, I'll call Sue.

91
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:22,355
What the hell has it got to do
with her? She's still at work.

92
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:26,315
She can nip down to outpatients and
keep an eye on him. Stuff bloody Sue.

93
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:30,235
This is nothing to do with bloody
Sue. Your son is...

94
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,075
Bastard.

95
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,675
Hung up.

96
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,195
Just go, Mum.

97
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:49,235
You can go and cash up or whatever.

98
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,395
Waiting time, two hours.

99
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,075
I'll still be here
when you get back.

100
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,315
Are you sure you'll be all right?

101
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:25,355
Hello there.

102
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,315
Your dad phoned.

103
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,875
We thought we'd got over all that,
didn't we?

104
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:35,515
Mum go back to work?

105
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,955
Parking.

106
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,395
Has anyone seen you?

107
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:47,835
My mum is sorting it.
I could...

108
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:49,915
No. Thanks.

109
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:52,035
You can go. Mum will be back in a
minute.

110
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,595
OK. You sure?

111
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,675
She wasn't there. I had a good look
round the car park.

112
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,395
You could spare five minutes.

113
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,915
Hi, Mum. It took them three hours
just to find a doctor last time.

114
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,955
He'll cope.

115
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:12,035
Can I watch EastEnders?

116
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,515
Let me think. No.
Did you ask about kittens?

117
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,515
Oh, sorry, darling.

118
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:19,515
You just have to be patient.

119
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,875
Good evening, gents.

120
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,595
Build you up.
Thanks.

121
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:36,955
Don't think I need it though,
the belly on me.

122
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:40,395
If you're looking for compliments...
It'd be a nice change.

123
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:42,675
Evening, everyone.
Can we make a start?

124
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,715
Lots to get through.

125
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,675
Apologies for absence.

126
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,955
What did Mary do for your tea?

127
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:52,995
Cheese sandwich and an apple.

128
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,595
Oh. She's getting better.

129
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,475
Argh!

130
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:14,515
All finished.

131
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,515
Just get your breath back.

132
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,675
He's in bed and fine.
I was hoping to see him.

133
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:32,035
You'll just have to wait till the
weekend.

134
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:34,755
Oh, I'd really like that framed
photo back, please.

135
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:37,115
I'm sure you would.
But Jack gave it to me.

136
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:40,875
It wasn't his to give. I had the
enlargement done and had it framed.

137
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,195
And I took it.
Well, I would, wouldn't I?

138
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:46,115
Seeing as you've never been to a
single match ever, have you?

139
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:48,115
Piss off, arsehole!

140
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,515
Jack!

141
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,315
See you on the weekend, son!

142
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,739
When is Family Liaison turning up?

143
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,699
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

144
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,259
That'll be the mother home, then.

00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,259

146
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,299
Has anyone phoned Paul?

Paul Brooks' Lunch Box.

148
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,419
A regular lunchtime show.

149
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,139
I'm sick of covering for holidays and
sick leave.

150
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,099
They might think you're a bit old
for the wild, zany, young approach.

151
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:27,819
But the show demographic
doesn't say that at all.

You know that photo of Jack?

157
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,579
I put it in his room.

158
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,539
Well, I'll never see it there.

159
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,259
Oh, right, sorry. I didn't think.

160
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:08,379
I just thought he'd like..

161
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,419
We'll find somewhere else for it.

162
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,779

163

No, not at all.

166
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,939
You are.

167
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,499
You're a very peeved peevish person.

00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,539
I'm sorry, sausage.

175
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,579
Oh, bad dad.

176
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:56,619
Mention to your mum...

00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:58,659
that I am. (CHUCKLES)

178
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,699
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

179
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,259
Bye!

180
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,979
You'll be seeing her in a minute.

181
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,819
Is she bigger?
Yeah, bigger by the second.

182
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,139
But is she still tiny?

183
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,859
Yeah. She's not turned into a toddler
overnight, you know.

184
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,899
How's life been?

185
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,939
Are you OK?

186
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,979
Is he all right, this Cameron?

187

I've sorted out some toys.

Look.
Oh, excellent.

189
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:38,299
What's the son like? Jack is it?

190
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,779
Horrible. He's always on his stupid
X-Box and he won't get off the TV.

191
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,859
Still, you don't see much of him.

192
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,579
He goes to his dad at weekends
and you go to yours.

193
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,619
Is he my brother now?

Hmm?

195

Jade Clulow's got a half sister,
two extra daddys and a dog.

What, three daddys?

198

came to the swimming gala.

Hello, sweetheart.

She was worried
she'd be all grown up.

203
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,539
I got her something.

That's very kind of you.

205
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,539
She's had so many gifts.

206
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:25,379
Not to keep. Just to look at.

207

How lovely.

208
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,659
When I get my kitten,
she can come to my house

(SIGHS) Oh, dear.

There must be
an easier way than this.

about bathing Sally with her.

would be you clearing out that pit

00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:16,035
You cow! You're going the right way
for a good slapping!

328
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,675
And who's gonna do that?
My sad, old loser mum?

329
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:21,515
That's right. So sad she's got
nothing better to do

330
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:24,355
but tidy up after nasty, smelly
little boys!

331
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:26,955
Who hoovers this pit?

332
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:30,035
Who has to move these disgusting
things

333
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:33,355
just so that she can pick up your
manky knickers?

334
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,915
Everyone's got them.

335
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,955
All my mates.

336
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:56,995
We...

337
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:59,035
We swap them.

338
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,835
You... You have to...

339
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:03,795
You know.

340
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:07,435
I don't even like them.

341
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:16,355
Mum?

342
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:23,075
Oh, Jack.

343
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:30,235
You're such a bloke.

344
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:38,195
Don't turn into
someone like your dad.

345
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:44,555
I thought you said I already was.

346
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:47,995
Well, just promise me that you won't
pick up a woman

347
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:51,475
when she's young and sexy and drop
her when she isn't.

348
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,435
Shall I get some fish and chips?

349
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,635
MAN: In you go, son.

350
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:28,635
(SLURRING) Mum!

351
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:31,675
It's me. I...

352
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,195
Sorry.

353
00:29:36,195 --> 00:29:39,275
All I did was go for a ride.
I couldn't get any sleep.

354
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:41,515
And I thought that if I got some
fresh air...

355
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:44,715
In the middle of the night?
Anything could happen to you.

356
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,515
Like she cares. She chucked me out.

357
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:49,555
Fabulous. Great.

358
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,635
Lovely start to a new rel...

359
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:54,275
Why the hell couldn't you
just behave yourself?

360
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:01,995
You can go in Dan Hunter's class for
the day.

361
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,715
I can't even do my project.

362
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,315
She said I wasn't allowed to bring
my computer.

363
00:30:44,315 --> 00:30:46,395
That's a good sign.

364
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:49,115
Means she knows you're not gonna be
away too long.

365
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,075
No. She said it was full of porn

366
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:53,315
and I'd get locked up if anyone else
saw it.

367
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:57,355
And is it?

368
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,315
Full of porn?

369
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:03,315
Well, what do you think?

370
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:05,395
Well done, Jack.

371
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:08,195
You've just lost yourself your
computer.

372
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:10,795
You're just like her.
Just stay where you are.

373
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:12,755
Get off!

374
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:21,635
Sorry, girls.

375
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:36,115
It's not porn.

376
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:38,915
It's just... It's just a few sites.

377
00:31:38,915 --> 00:31:40,875
Like, blogs and that.

378
00:31:42,715 --> 00:31:45,635
And all this riding around in the
middle of the night.

379
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,675
Why?

380
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:49,635
Where do you go?

381
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,835
Nowhere.

382
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:00,115
See, the...

383
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:02,075
the thing is...

384
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,195
..when they caught me,

385
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:07,155
the plods...

386
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:13,315
..I was a bit drunk.

387
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:15,595
Oh. This gets better.

388
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:17,675
It was only cider.

389
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:20,275
I don't care if it was bloody wine
gums.

390
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:22,315
You're 14 years old.

391
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,395
A child. And you're out.

392
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:27,115
On your own at three
in the morning drunk?

393
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,875
What the fuck does your mother think
she's doing?

394
00:32:54,402 --> 00:32:56,362
Emily, are you all right?

395
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,482
Emily!

396
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:01,442
Lying there.

397
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:15,842
GIRL: What you found?

398
00:33:15,842 --> 00:33:17,802
Look.

399
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:24,562
Are you supposed to put that on your
face?

400
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:27,202
Yeah. You're gonna
look like some kind of fairy.

401
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:32,962
What is this?

402
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:43,402
Sexy.

403
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:49,162
I know what this is.

404
00:33:51,402 --> 00:33:53,482
For ladies.

405
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:56,242
When they get a headache,
they put it up their bum.

406
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:00,442
You shouldn't be listening.

407
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,402
Whatever.

408
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:06,682
You can't just dump our kid on
someone else indefinitely.

409
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:09,002
ANNE: 'Then grow up
and get your own place.'

410
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:11,722
Oh, let's not start all this again,
eh?

411
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:14,322
As usual, you're over-reacting.

412
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:17,242
Most lads get hooked on some bloody
chat room or other

413
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:19,322
and then they grow out of it.

414
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:22,642
'It's not just the porn.
It's the police, the tempers...'

415
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:24,482
Look, you can't rob me blind every
month

416
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:27,242
and then just dump him on me
as soon as it gets difficult.

417
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:29,242
'Who says?
According to my solicitor...'

418
00:34:29,242 --> 00:34:31,402
Me paying your bloody mortgage says!

419
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,882
And if I can just...
Becca has to go home now.

420
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:36,842
Hang on. I'm on the phone, Emily.

421
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:39,082
Becca's mum said she had to be home
by four.

422
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:42,882
Jack!

423
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:46,442
Take the girls back to Rebecca's!
I don't know where she lives.

424
00:34:46,442 --> 00:34:49,242
It's just across the park.
They'll show you. Go on.

425
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:55,522
Sorry.
'You've not wasted any time.'

426
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:58,282
What? 'Already got him looking after
her brat.'

427
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:00,082
Look, if you can't cope,

428
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:02,602
I'll take him for a bit longer at the
weekend, but...

429
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:05,482
'Don't you butt in, Cameron,
get used to the idea.'

430
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:07,562
Listen to me, you mad bitch,

431
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:10,042
it was you that insisted on
residence!

432
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:13,682
I'll tell you what, Anne. I stop
paying the mortgage as of today!

433
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:16,722
Right? I'll start paying it again
when you take him back!

434
00:35:38,642 --> 00:35:42,682
Oh, hanging around with those kids?
What's it to do with you?

435
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,362
You a perv?
Fuck off. My dad's shagging her mum.

436
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:47,442
Right. Jack.

437
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:49,442
I know all about you.
You what?

438
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,482
Into porn big time.

439
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,442
You wanker.

440
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,922
He's here.

441
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,802
Oh, go on. You're single, free.

442
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:07,842
You're only 40, for God's sake.

443
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:09,802
38 if you don't mind.

444
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,682
How's it going?

445
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:16,162
So is your lad footballing this
weekend, then?

446
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:18,642
Erm...no.

447
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:20,682
Well, um...

448
00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:23,522
He's with his dad, isn't he?

449
00:36:23,522 --> 00:36:25,482
Is he, then?

450
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:43,562
(EXAGGERATED HEAVY BREATHING)

451
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:52,962
Jack!

452
00:37:03,362 --> 00:37:05,442
(SHRIEKS)

453
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:08,642
I looked round and you'd gone.
I was right in front of you.

454
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:12,962
Only, I saw this fat, old perv.

455
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:17,042
Great, big, fat old man.

456
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:19,002
All these warts.

457
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,122
He was... He was breathing heavily.

458
00:37:22,122 --> 00:37:24,122
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

459
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:29,402
He'll be one of them paedophiles.

460
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:31,402
He was looking through the bushes.

461
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:34,442
I heard him.

462
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:44,162
(TV ON)

463
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,962
EMILY: Mummy!

464
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,562
Mum!

465
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,562
(EMILY CRYING)
Hello?

466
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:58,562
Mum.

467
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:00,642
What's wrong?

468
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:02,682
Emily.

469
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:05,722
She just had a nightmare.
Where are the clean sheets?

470
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,762
Oh, sweetheart.

471
00:38:07,762 --> 00:38:10,082
Mummy, I had a bad dream.
All right, son?

472
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:12,762
Baby. Do you want a cuddle?

473
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:14,802
Yes.

474
00:38:14,802 --> 00:38:16,842
There, there, it's OK.

475
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:18,842
It's OK.

476
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:23,322
The head of department can't keep
turning up late.

477
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:26,762
Come on, Em. You have to get used to
a bit of teasing.

478
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,722
Just like Cameron has to accept us,
we have to accept Jack.

479
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,722
It's only fair.

480
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:37,282
What happens if Sally grows up
and decides she doesn't like you?

481
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,282
How would you like that?

482
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:41,122
Going to stay with your dad

483
00:38:41,122 --> 00:38:43,602
with Sally whining about you all the
time? Eh?

484
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:48,482
It's not that bad actually, Emily.

485
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:51,962
Your life is pretty good
if you did but realise it.

486
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,402
You might think you are mighty
bollocks,

487
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:02,482
but you frighten that kid once more
and you are past tense.

488
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:05,602
I haven't fucking touched her.
I don't use that word with you,

489
00:39:05,602 --> 00:39:07,682
so you can drop it with me.

490
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:10,122
You're already into porno
and God knows what.

491
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:12,962
Mum's just looking for an excuse.
She wants to chuck me out

492
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:15,522
so she can get pissed every night
with her mates.

493
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,842
Don't be ridiculous.
Every night, Dad.

494
00:39:17,842 --> 00:39:21,362
She goes out and gets rat-arsed
and then sits at the table crying.

495
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:23,402
I had to put her to bed one night.

496
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,362
Shit.

497
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:35,122
Why do you always drop your bloody
bombshells when I'm driving?

498
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:46,082
14-year-old putting his mother to
bed.

499
00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:50,802
No life for a teenage boy.

500
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,562
He has to come to us.

501
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,602
Full time.

502
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:04,242
That wasn't the deal
when you took me on.

503
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:06,922
We'll add a codicil to the contract.

504
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:10,482
Come on, Cam.

505
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,682
It's what we've always said.

506
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:15,642
The kids mustn't suffer.

507
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:26,042
For all sorts of reasons,

508
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:28,002
this marks a new start for all of us.

509
00:40:32,802 --> 00:40:34,842
So, when do I get to see Mum, then?

510
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:37,842
Weekends. Weekdays. Whenever.

511
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:41,682
We're all in the same town, son.
We're not enemies.

512
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:44,642
What about my kitten?
I've got miles to go to school.

513
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,482
It's on the way to my work.
Not that far.

514
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,842
We're going to start doing things
together, too.

515
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:55,642
Yeah, starting tomorrow. Bowling?
Girls versus boys?

516
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:58,322
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
No Daddy this week, darling.

517
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:02,362
I did tell you.

518
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:29,042
Em OK about it?

519
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:31,082
Fine.

520
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:33,162
How about Jack?

521
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:35,882
(WHINING) It's so unfair.
I can't see my mates.

522
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:39,002
I can't do football, and I can't
and I can't and I can't...

523
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,922
No need to trample each other.
Emily.

524
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,882
There she is.

525
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:07,322
I missed you, pumpkin.

526
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:34,242
When will she wake up?

527
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:36,202
Not for a bit, I hope.

528
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:40,242
There's some er...

529
00:42:40,242 --> 00:42:42,202
colouring stuff on the table, hon.

530
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,042
What are you doing?

531
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:55,002
Um...

532
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,202
The producer's playlist.

533
00:42:59,282 --> 00:43:01,242
Sort of reading up on...

534
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:04,482
Sort of homework really.

535
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:09,362
Trying to think of funny things to
say.

536
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:20,242
CAMERON: Go on, Jack! Good lad.

537
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:23,362
If he does that shoulder again,
his mother will kill me.

538
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:25,322
Don't worry, I won't let her.

539
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:30,762
Go on, Jack!

540
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:52,522
Juice time do you think, Em?

541
00:44:12,762 --> 00:44:14,802
Em?

542
00:44:14,802 --> 00:44:16,842
Do you want some juice, hon?

543
00:44:16,842 --> 00:44:18,802
How's that baby?

544
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:25,842
Emily?

545
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:27,802
Emily, where are you?

546
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:48,242
Emily?

547
00:44:48,242 --> 00:44:50,242
Where's the baby?

548
00:44:50,242 --> 00:44:52,202
Where's Sally?

549
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:43,442
My baby! My baby, Paul!

550
00:45:43,442 --> 00:45:45,722
Where did you go
with the baby?

551
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:48,282
She's so tiny.

552
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:50,202
You're a walking liability.

553
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:52,362
You come into my house.
Oh, piss off.

554
00:45:53,202 --> 00:45:55,602
What's gonna be the next bloody
revelation?

555
00:45:56,602 --> 00:46:06,602
