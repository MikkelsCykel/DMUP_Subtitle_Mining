1
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,700
Where is she?

2
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,900
- What the fuck do you care?
- I do... I do care.

3
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,500
- Is she alive?
- You wanna know where she is, Cruz?

4
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
You wanna know how she is?

5
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,900
Then start talking. And I mean everything.
Every last fuckin' detail.

6
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
I can't see. I need a doctor.

7
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,400
You'll get one soon as you tell us
what the fuck and why for.

8
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
<i>I think he's faking.</i>

9
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,900
<i>- You dont just go blind.
- I think the motherfuckers faking!</i>

10
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,400
No. Heard of this. Head Trauma.
You'll see again.

11
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,700
Just in time to look the judge
in the eye when he sentences you.

12
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,700
Sentences me? For what?

13
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,100
Take your pick. You look quite the
'Train in the head'. Five dead.

14
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
- Five?
- Mm...

15
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,700
- Maybe I ought to see a...
- Ought to see a lawyer or a faggoty lawyer?

16
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're not under arrest, Ned?

17
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,500
So why the cuffs? Why won't you tell
me where she is, if she's alright?

18
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,100
Because of the law, Cruz.
I ask the questions, you answer them.

19
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,900
My client... is she alive?

20
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,300
You really dont know?

21
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,500
Bullshit! He's playing like
he's fucking here, I'm thinking.

22
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,500
If we let him get away with this,
we gonna be here all night.

23
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,600
We dont want you to think, Cruz.
Allright.

24
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,400
We dont want you to ask questions.
We just want you to respond.

25
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,400
Like a Reflex, with the truth, Compadre!

26
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I am a human lie detector.

27
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,700
If you dont tell me the truth, I'll beat it
outta you. And love every minute of it.

28
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,900
All right, all right..

29
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,200
Sorry, sorry.

30
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,300
Go ahead, entertain us.

31
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,500
- You were there the night it started.
- Tell us anyway.

32
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's doing it again.

33
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,500
You wily fucking Duke. Quit thinking.
Quit stalling. Can we do this my way?

34
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, Poley but tell Frizer to get down when
I start to shave skin..

35
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,700
- Skeres?
- Yeah?

36
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,800
- Do you like Adam Nova?
- The actor?

37
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
He's alright.
I guess he makes an honest buck.

38
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,900
Try 20 million per picture and
20 percent junk off the back-end.

39
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,800
One of the highest paid
moviestars in history

40
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>and I have to tell him...
That its all over.</i>

41
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,900
<i>Shortly after Nova's very public
feud with a certain studio mogul,</i>

42
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,200
<i>The mogul paid some low-rent
private eye to get the dirt on Nova.</i>

43
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,400
And leak it to a tabloid website.

44
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,800
<i>Nova hires me to find out what dirt
that tabloid website is going to expose.</i>

45
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:58,000
Whats the 411 on Adam Nova, Uh?
What flashbulb boys handle me this time?

46
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,300
I'm fucking terrified.

47
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,500
<i>We've all got kinks.</i>

48
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
<i>Contrary to what science tells us,</i>

49
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,700
<i>All DNA does not twist the same.</i>

50
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,700
Well Adam, you gonna open it or what?

51
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,600
<i>Adam Nova's side kink is an
albino little person named Russell.</i>

52
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,900
<i>And the two of them have made a habit
of mixing viagra with meth-amphetamines</i>

53
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,900
And doing the double dolphin with
Degaulle Groupie for 48 hours straight.

54
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,300
Fuck!

55
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,300
- What is it, buddy?
- This is your fucking fault!

56
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,500
- Let me fucking see!
- Away from me, you sick little pervert!

57
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,200
<i>Nova is finished.</i>

58
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,300
<i>When these sort of things
get near the internet</i>

59
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,800
<i>its moving at the speed of light.</i>

60
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,900
I suppose you wanna get paid.

61
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,100
Wait here. I'll be right back.

62
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,100
Adam, wait a minute!
Let me see the fucking pictures!

63
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,100
Get off my ass!

64
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,700
No matter what it is, I can fix this.

65
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,900
<i>We've all got kinks,
The built-in closets where they hide.</i>

66
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,300
<i>There is always the fear that some day,
someone walks into your closet,</i>

67
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,000
<i>And switches on the light and
there in the corner, is your kink.</i>

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,200
<i>And most terrible fear of all...</i>

69
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,400
<i>the fear of being exposed.</i>

70
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,600
You wanna explain this?

71
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,100
- Is that.. Aftershave or cologne?
- What? Aftershave.

72
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,100
- Whoa...
- Fuck you!

73
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,200
Why is it that when weird shit happens,
its always stuck to the bottom of your shoe?

74
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,500
So, who is the crispy midget?

75
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,700
He's Astrophysicst, Frizer.

76
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
- Astrophysicst.
- His name is Russell.

77
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,100
He's a white dwarf
gone supernova.

78
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,800
<i>It's 2:00 am. I'm sick of Los Angeles.</i>

79
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,600
<i>Sick of bearing witness to human tragedy.</i>

80
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
<i>And sick of Frizer's shitty aftershave.</i>

81
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,200
<i>I'm too jack-topped to go home. So...
I go back to the office to hate myself.</i>

82
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,600
<i>Maybe its my favorite jacket,
ruined forever.</i>

83
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,300
<i>But all of a sudden I dont like
what I do for a living.</i>

84
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
<i>I should go home.</i>

85
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
<i>I should climb into the tub...</i>

86
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,600
<i>and pull the water up over my head.</i>

87
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,900
<i>But all I can do is return
to the scene of my own crime.</i>

88
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,800
- You are private eye?
- Yeah... I used to be a private 'H'.

89
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,500
Maybe one day I'll be a 'G' man. I'm just
working my way around the alphabet.

90
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,200
Blah Blah Blah!
I want you should find somebody.

91
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,600
You've specific person in mind?
Or just anybody do?

92
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,600
My name is Anton. They call me "The Pro".

93
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Okay Anton, listen. Today treated
me like a dog treats a fire hydrant.

94
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,500
I... I'm closed for work really. Please...

95
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,400
Her name... is Lexie.
Lexie Persimmon. She is my girl.

96
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
I think, wherever she is,

97
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,300
I'm sure she's snug in bed, and dreaming
about bungee-jumping off your forehead.

98
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,400
It would be a shame
to wake her up.

99
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,700
- All right, what's the punchline?
- What is meaning of punchline?

100
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
- This is your girlfriend?
- Duh!

101
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,600
She wrote to me.

102
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,000
I wrote her back.
Every wednesday for 5 whole years.

103
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,800
Wow! You must've had a jumbo box of crayons.

104
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,700
But there's nothing,
no house at her return address.

105
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,000
Where did you do your time, Big Anton?
What were you in for?

106
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,700
No stamps, No post marks.

107
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,600
You know the Federal Bureau of Prisons...

108
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,900
require the letters to prisoners
are in sealed envelopes. You see?

109
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,900
I've been doing life at Lompoc.
But they let me go, let me out.

110
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,200
Now I've got to find her.

111
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,100
But she's aint dancing
at Minkowski's no more.

112
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,400
So come on, we go to Minkowski.
Maybe they will tell you something.

113
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,700
If I write you a letter and
sprinkle it with Chanel No 5,

114
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,600
Would you believe me when I tell
you that I'm done for the day?

115
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,600
This is it, where she worked.

116
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
Ask him.

117
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Don't bother, Bonto. I told him already.
I never seen her before.

118
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,700
I don't know who she was.

119
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,600
How many bouncers do
you figure it would take?

120
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,100
- Who the fuck are you?
- Where is Minkowski?

121
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,600
Where do you go when you die?

122
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,500
- Now how is it working for you?
- What the fuck, man!

123
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,100
Answerig questions with questions..

124
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Now who you been dallying with
in this place and slowly? Hm?

125
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,300
- You gonna let me go?
- There you go again.

126
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,900
- Hey!
- What the fuck!

127
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Do you know Lexie Persimmon?

128
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,900
Hey, Asshole!

129
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,700
<i>A right hook like a freight train
coming around a corner.</i>

130
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,600
<i>And it all comes back to me.</i>

131
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
<i>A decade ago. Everyone had hear
of Anton 'The Pro' Protopov.</i>

132
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,400
Let's get out of here! Come on.

133
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,000
<i>He was 18 all when he threw a fight.
Took a dive... for a prize.</i>

134
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
- Excuse me.
- Ow. Shit!

135
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,400
Skinny Faddeev, The boss of
the Russian mob, Los Angeles.

136
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,100
- Dont be an asshole.
- We know who Faddeev is. Was.

137
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,100
Ofcourse you do. So you know
he was grooming his own nephew...

138
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,000
to be next the heavyweight contender.

139
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,100
And you know he offered Anton 'The Pro'
Protopov 30 million upfront to take a..

140
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Fall in the third round of his
nephew's exhibition match.

141
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,800
But Anton 'The Pro' was so... well,
unclear on the concept.

142
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,900
<i>Because if you crush your opponent's skull,</i>

143
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,400
<i>and then go down for the count,
nobody bites it.</i>

144
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
<i>It's stupid.</i>

145
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>Anthon 'The Pro's boxing career is over.</i>

146
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Hey hey, the car's over there!

147
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,900
You got pictures,
you got letters. Find her.

148
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll do better
without your help anyway.

149
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,400
- Sometimes, I dont know... I just..
- React, right?

150
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,000
- How do I find you?
- No, I find you.

151
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,500
Skinny Faddeev's nephew dies
of a fractured skull...

152
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,500
and a bleeding brain
in less than a week.

153
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,800
I saw that fight.

154
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,000
I saw Anton 'The Pro' take
that phony fucking dive.

155
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,900
Outside for me, allright,
that is the damndest angel of heresy.

156
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,500
What the fuck you laughing at?

157
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,000
Dont answer that!
Faddeev? What about Faddeev?

158
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,400
Allright, Skinny Faddeev ruins the
career of an 18 year old heavyweight,

159
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,300
Gets his nephew killed
and loses a cool 30 million.

160
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And, uh... one other thing.

161
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,900
He does it all without letting
the Mob in Las Vegas in on the fix.

162
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,100
But instead of taking the blame
for such colossal clusterfuck...

163
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,600
and trying to make peace
with the Las Vegas boys,

164
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
<i>Skinny Faddeev decides...</i>

165
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,800
<i>that he has a score to settle
with Anton 'The Pro' Protopov.</i>

166
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,700
3 days later, they found Skinny Faddeev
in the kitchen at Prostranstva.

167
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,900
And its hard to tell the difference
between former Master and Borscht.

168
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,900
It's the same Borscht mixed
with Skinny Faddeev's blood,

169
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,900
That you boy scouts find on Anton Protopov's
dirty laundry at the Roseville Hotel.

170
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,900
<i>He's coming down the hall.</i>

171
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,600
Freeze, motherfucker!

172
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,300
<i>Put the bottle down. Hands up!</i>

173
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,100
You were there.
You were the arresting officers.

174
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Yeah, we were.

175
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,400
So what?
Dont get clever again.

176
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,300
What the fucks all this got to
do with finding the stripper?

177
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,500
What the fucks a bastard condom
got to with your birth certificate, Poley?

178
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
It's just cause and effect.

179
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,000
By the way, he'll hurt you.

180
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,800
And Skeres and me,
we'll just look the other way.

181
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Skeres and I.
Skeres and I, will look the other way.

182
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,600
You think you're better than me.
Dont you, Cruz?

183
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,400
You and I, we're just migrant
workers in the land of opportunity.

184
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,900
But I'm the one with a badge.
I'm gonna ask you one more time..

185
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,700
Tell us everything you did,
everything you know and tell us now.

186
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,600
Or else what? Poley is gonna hit me?
It may get my sight back.

187
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,200
Anything that helps, yeah.

188
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,800
The faster you draw us a map,
the faster you get outta here. See?

189
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,900
No, I dont care about that.

190
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
Just tell me she's alright...

191
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
- and tell me she's alive.
- No.

192
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,300
You first.

193
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,900
All right.

194
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,000
Anton 'The Pro' Protopov...

195
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is sentenced to life imprisonment
for murder of Skinny Faddeev.

196
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,400
Suddenly, after serving 5 years
of life sentence, without parole...

197
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
he's back on the streets.
Free man.

198
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,100
So... somebody else
confessed to the crime.

199
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,500
Yeah, a Vegas hitman
already serving 300 years...

200
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,300
for murder, rape, kidnapping and
arson, claims he killed Faddeev.

201
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,900
Because Faddeev had no business
trying to fix a Vegas fight game.

202
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,900
Now this convict claims that Anton 'The Pro'
was framed with blood and Borscht.

203
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
So what?

204
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,300
So what? Do you really believe that?

205
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Enough with the Mob shit. Get to the girl.

206
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,100
Now, if you dont understand the Mob angle.

207
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Then it wont make any sense when
you get to the part about diamonds.

208
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,900
What diamonds?

209
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Where was I?

210
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,100
The 7 foot, 300 pound lifer is sprung
from prison and all he's looking for...

211
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,300
is his girl. How romantic is that?

212
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,300
And cut! Recess. Who's next?

213
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,700
So you'd agree today you
brought tape to my club, Uh?

214
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,500
Oh, you heard about that?

215
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,500
Yeah, I fuckin heard about that.
How'd you find me?

216
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,500
- I looked under the rug.
- So, you asking to get fucked up?

217
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,300
The fuck that your entire legal
name is Puss was a surprise.

218
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,900
Then Maincoon Production popped up..

219
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,000
And here I am... Schrodinger's warehouse.
Watching an artist at work.

220
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,800
- I ain't ever saw this bitch.
- Hey, fair enough. So, listen..

221
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,900
Herman Minkowski died 4 years ago.
You bought the joint a year later.

222
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,300
- Who sold it to you?
- His widow. Stripper, actress, tweaker.

223
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Allright, cum for chrissakes!

224
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,800
What you saying?
What is the plot?

225
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,700
Well, the guy she's fucking,
he keeps changing into another guy.

226
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,300
Point being they really all the same.

227
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,600
You just dont know where they disappear to.

228
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,300
Its like they go in...

229
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,600
- They never come out.
- Beautiful.

230
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,100
And... Cut.

231
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:02,000
- Minkowski's widow, she got a name?
- Yeah, Zooey. Zooey Wigner.

232
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,200
- You making a cameo?
- Hitchcock dead. Slide in.

233
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,900
Lights. Camera. Action, Motherfuckers!

234
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,600
<i>It takes about 30 minutes
online to find Zooey Wigner.</i>

235
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,100
Slow down. You claim it was
the last time you saw Puss?

236
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah.

237
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Really? So,
it would surprise you to learn that..

238
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,800
When Schrodinger's warehouse was open
the next morning, Puss was still there.

239
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Well, why would that surprise me?

240
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
It would. If you knew your
client broke his fuckin' back.

241
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,600
That, is one well-hung negro!

242
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,800
It'd take a pretty big motherfucker to do
that kind of damage to hoist him up there.

243
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,100
- Might even take...
- What the fuck are you guys talking?

244
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,300
Zooey Wigner. Tell us about Zooey Wigner.

245
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,000
<i>I dont found her at any of Italian agencies.</i>

246
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,900
<i>She isn't listed as client of any manager.</i>

247
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,300
<i>I find her on a UCLA Medical Center website.</i>

248
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,000
<i>Zooey Wigner's meth-addiction has
burned through capital gains...</i>

249
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,100
<i>...from her dead husband's strip club.</i>

250
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,500
<i>The only acting gig she can get...
...is to act like a patient...</i>

251
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,300
<i>with a medical condition for interest
to test their diagnostic skills.</i>

252
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,300
<i>Fridays, she's got Autosarcophagy.</i>

253
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,000
<i>A disorder causing people
to eat themselves,</i>

254
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
<i>on account of severe sexual anxiety.</i>

255
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,200
Its a really fucked-up job.

256
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,100
But... it keeps me in a rehab and...

257
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,100
shithole base apartment in El Segundo.

258
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Here's the... Take a look at this.

259
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,900
She does kinda look like a girl who worked
at the club a while ago. I dont know...

260
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,600
Do you remember her name?

261
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,100
No, no... That's not it.

262
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,300
I just... I dont really remember much...
from back then.

263
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,700
You know what, take it.

264
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,800
You're an actress, a professional.
Your time is valuable, meaningful. Take it.

265
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,900
Meaningful?
I'm pretending to eat myself.

266
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,300
Where's the meaning in that?

267
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,600
Wait. Jules maybe...

268
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,200
- Or just Julie... I think.
- Hmm.

269
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
The 'Ouroboros'
is what Plato described...

270
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,900
as the first living creature
in the universe.

271
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,600
An immortal, perfect creature.
A serpent eatng itself...

272
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,600
swallowing its own tail.

273
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
Everything has meaning.

274
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,000
Thats sweet.
I bet you made her feel better.

275
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,200
So, I suppose you never went to
Zooey Wigner's apartment that night?

276
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,100
No. You're not going to surprise me
this time?

277
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,900
Yesterday, Zooey Wigner was found
with the left side of her head caved-in...

278
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,000
floating face-up in that
shithole basement apartment.

279
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
<i>Floating?</i>

280
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,400
<i>Somebody must've left the water running
in her tub.</i>

281
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,900
But you didn't go there,
and I suppose, neither did Anton.

282
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,600
<i>No. I wet to Kepler's.</i>

283
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,300
So, whats tickened you, Right Man?

284
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,600
- Who broke your doll?
- I'm fine.

285
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You killing me when you say 'The Band'.

286
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:01,800
I'm thinking of becoming a Tele-Evangelist.
This business blows.

287
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,100
Like a sand, wind went out of you.
So, what is it this time?

288
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,700
I'm looking for someone who is supposed
to exist when nobody has seen.

289
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,800
- Ah... That again?
- Yeah.

290
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,900
You're always looking for that,
the ultimate missing person...

291
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
- The theoretical other, the soul mate.
- This isn't about me. Nobody want.

292
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,900
- Sure it is...
- No, it's for a client.

293
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,600
- It's a job.
- OK.

294
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,100
I've picked up a tail. It could be my client
or it could be somebody else onto them.

295
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,400
So you think
its later for crashville?

296
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,600
Nothing much.
Skin marks and treader's fault.

297
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I dig it in you. Just remember...

298
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,800
Love looks not with the eyes,
but with the mind.

299
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,600
- Cupid is blind.
- Yeah.

300
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,300
<i>- What the fuck was that about?
- Love and... longing.</i>

301
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,700
He knew what was going to happen.
He always knows.

302
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,800
Holy Shit! He's doing it again.
Cruz, what the fuck you talking about?

303
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,200
- Jazz.
- Huh?

304
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,200
Sex, your heartbeat... your soul.

305
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,600
- Skeres, you're a married man, right?
- Divorced.

306
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,700
You still remember love, right?

307
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,500
I got kids in college and I've already paid.

308
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,900
- I dont have time for fucking love stories.
- I'm sorry.

309
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,100
<i>Close your eyes...</i>

310
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,300
<i>and I will show you my secrets.</i>

311
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:19,800
<i>You gonna love me...
without shame or fear.</i>

312
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,400
<i>Your search ends with me.</i>

313
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,300
<i>I am missing person... of your heart.</i>

314
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,300
<i>Your one true love.</i>

315
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,800
<i>Anton is right. There is nothing
at the La Riviera's return address.</i>

316
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,200
<i>Wherever she's writing from,
Lexie Persimmon prefers in hiding.</i>

317
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,700
- Excuse me. Lady... Lady... Excume me.
- What you say to me?

318
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,300
Just a second.

319
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,100
Until recently, a letter has come
this vacant lot every week.

320
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,300
It would be forwarded
by the mail carrier...

321
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,100
to whoever submitted
a change in Further's form.

322
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
Okay, so?

323
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
I'm a U.S. postal employee.
I dont take bribes.

324
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,500
No, no. Dont making money,
but please help me.

325
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,400
I need this address. Its very important.

326
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,500
General Deliveries, San Celeritas.

327
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,700
- What was that?
- San Celeritas, New Mexico. Okay?

328
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
Thank you. I appreciate it.

329
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:12,200
<i>I go back to the office to grab a couple
of shirts and some clean underwear.</i>

330
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,500
<i>Thats when I realized that it
isn't my client who's tailing me.</i>

331
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,900
<i>Anton 'The Pro' has no
reason to toss my office.</i>

332
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,100
<i>So, someone must've been following
him when he first came to see me.</i>

333
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,700
<i>He had a duffel bag
when he came in,</i>

334
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,600
<i>but not when he left.
So, they either know whats in the bag...</i>

335
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,100
<i>or they know about the letters
or together who'd sent them.</i>

336
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,800
<i>- Oh yeah? Why?
- I didn't know, Poley.</i>

337
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,300
<i>I hadn't quite read them all yet.</i>

338
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
<i>San Celeritas, New Mexico, is a
ghost town in the land of enchantment.</i>

339
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,000
Wait a minute. So, Anton and this stripper,
she's never even met him.

340
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,800
- But shes writing him letters?
- Yeah.

341
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,400
<i>This is fucking stupid.
I dont wanna listen to this shit.</i>

342
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,700
I dont know if Anton said that because
Space and time are relative, Poley.

343
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,000
Time slows down when you
approach the speed of light.

344
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,300
Things get shorter, more dense.

345
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,900
The faster you travel, the slower
and even dumber you appear.

346
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,800
Oh god... thats so funny.

347
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,200
Yeah. Well, its just the laws
of physics, Poley.

348
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,800
You know what you are?
You think you're a smart guy.

349
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I hate such a smart guys. I hate 'em
more when they think they're tough guys.

350
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,100
You're one of them too, aren't you?

351
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
Stay on trail.

352
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,100
I know your fucking ways.
Remember I can read your mind.

353
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,100
You couldn't read even a picture book.

354
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,000
What? What's you say?

355
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,700
What, huh?

356
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,700
You know, Poley, I know. I know
you're gonna hit me, but listen to this...

357
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,300
You hurt me, you hurt me too bad...

358
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,900
You will never find out
where the diamonds are!

359
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
- What diamonds?
- Okay, okay.

360
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,700
I'm on my way to New Mexico,
and I am moving very fast.

361
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,500
<i>Lexie Persimmon is as good as found.</i>

362
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,500
<i>She's in San Celeritas
where her mail is forwarded.</i>

363
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:01,300
<i>I chose to drive, to clear my head.
Think about quitting this shit business.</i>

364
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,300
<i>Settling down... Something real.</i>

365
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,600
<i>But is no good.</i>

366
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,200
<i>I keep wondering why Skinny Faddeev...</i>

367
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,900
<i>would pay Anoton 30 million upfront.</i>

368
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,300
<i>And where is the money now?</i>

369
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,100
<i>And why would a streeter, who is god's
own wet dream, chose to be pampered...</i>

370
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,100
<i>with a Darwin's worst nightmare?</i>

371
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,100
<i>I cant stop thinking about her.</i>

372
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,900
<i>The woman, the photograph...</i>

373
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,100
<i>I tell myself
that I'll find Lexie Persimmon,</i>

374
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,400
<i>if that is her real name,</i>

375
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,100
<i>I'll tell her that King Kong
is looking for her.</i>

376
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,200
<i>And... that will be the end of it.</i>

377
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,300
<i>But I dont believe it.</i>

378
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,000
<i>Not for a second.</i>

379
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,300
- Wow! You totally dont belong here.
- Where is here?

380
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Around people like this. Red Auras..

381
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,500
Material, physical. Blue: Reverence.

382
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,000
And... mostly Yellow: Intellectual.

383
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,900
You're Grey. You are so conflicted,

384
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,000
But you've also got this
purple-red spiritual vibe...

385
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,600
Its extremely rare on this earth,
but... there's something so dark about you.

386
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,600
- Is there anything else to see around here?
- No! I mean, not really. You know its just,

387
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,200
Its an old Airforce base shutdown in 1962.

388
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,100
We should test the V2 rockets that were
captured from the germans here.

389
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,900
- Then Kestral bought it...
- Simon Kestral?

390
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,900
Oh yeah. A Simon, 'the reclusive
gazillionaire fucking visionary' Kestral

391
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,900
And no, I've never actually seen him.

392
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,100
But he bought San Celeritas
and everything underneath it.

393
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,600
There's these tunnels, some people say
they run all the way to Dolche,

394
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,700
where there's supposed to be this like...

395
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,000
secret underground military base
filled with extra-terrestrials.

396
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,200
But you dont believe that?

397
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,000
No. And you can't go down there
anyway on account of the Colliders.

398
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
The Collider?

399
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,200
The Particle Accelerator
that Kelstral spilled.

400
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,800
So God, I'm sorry. Do you want breakfast?

401
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
Yeah, where can I find her?

402
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,000
I dont know, man.
But I knew you didn't belong here.

403
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,200
Do you recognize her?

404
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,400
- May I please? Ketchup?
- Sure.

405
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,900
Sorry.

406
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,300
Do you know this woman, sir?

407
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,200
He's a Sikh.
And it means God is true and timeless.

408
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,300
Okay, thats really cool that you know that.

409
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,100
- So you own this place?
- No no, I just work here.

410
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,900
- Who is the Post Master?
- Guy that owns this place.

411
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,800
Orders up. I gotta go.

412
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,400
When do you get off?

413
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,700
About 14 minutes after I start fucking.

414
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
What is all this?

415
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,600
These are the spiral trails left
by sub-atomic particles.

416
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,000
Moving through liquid hydrogen
in presence of a magnet field.

417
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,200
You know, it certainly look familiar.

418
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,500
You gotta understand, everything behaves

419
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,600
like a particle in a wave at the same time
until something is actually observed.

420
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,400
Because of the same multiple
states of reality simultaneously.

421
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,700
Then only you actually observe anything,
anywhere in the universe, to change it.

422
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:16,400
And if that thing is entangled in a
relationship with anything else,

423
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,200
it changes still, instantly.

424
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,400
And that's faster than a speed of light.

425
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:31,700
But you know what, nothing's
faster than speed of light.

426
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,900
Its real-life magic...

427
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,800
and Atom.

428
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,700
It's made of Electrons,
Protons and Neutrons.

429
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,400
And Protons and Neutrons
are made up of Quarks,

430
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,800
and Quarks are held together by Gluons.

431
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,900
And Gluons are Bosons,
and Bosons... are elementary particles,

432
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,400
which are the fundamental forces of nature.

433
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,100
So, you're here because...

434
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,000
Because... in 2 days,
just 300 feet underground,

435
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,300
Two Proton beams are going to collide with
each other, at nearly the speed of light.

436
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,800
Nothing is faster.

437
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,300
And you may find it right here
and in the middle of desert.

438
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,500
- Find what?
- 'It'. The God particle.

439
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
And you are here beacuse...?

440
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,500
Because I'm looking for someone who is
supposed to exist but nobody has seen.

441
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,600
In the middle of desert.

442
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,600
Someone is following me, but don't know who.

443
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,000
Honest?

444
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:27,800
Yeah. So, tell me how does
the mail service work here?

445
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,800
The Mail service? It doesnt.

446
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,900
People just use Priority Mail or Email.

447
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,600
Regular mail just goes into basket.

448
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,100
People come in and collect whats their's.

449
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,500
<i>Then I tell her everything I know.</i>

450
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,100
About the 260 letters,
about the lonely stripper,

451
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,500
and washed-up boxer who became pen-pounce.

452
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,700
About a beautiful woman who found a way,

453
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,900
to share her deepest passions,
her kinks without fear of consequences.

454
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,300
Because she chose to give her love
to a man who'll never get out of prison.

455
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,400
Until... all of a sudden...

456
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,900
he did.

457
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,400
And by that time...

458
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,200
the Boxer was...
Well, he was in...

459
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,900
Bullshit!

460
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,300
I'm sorry, Poley. Anton 'The Pro'
never expected to seeing the light of day.

461
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,400
Thats why he told her
where to find the diamonds.

462
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,700
- Yeah, the diamonds.
- Thats right.

463
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
And Lexie Persimmon never expected

464
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,800
Anton 'The Pro' Protopov
to come looking for her.

465
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,500
Okay, Ned.

466
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,200
This is where you need to be very,
very specific, we dont have a lotta time.

467
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,600
Why?

468
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
Because Smartass,
its gonna be morning soon.

469
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,600
And you went half-explaining
to the local authorities...

470
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,300
how everything went sideways...

471
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,300
- You're gonna need every detail.
- Every last fucking detail, yes.

472
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,300
Man, why'd you chose to share your
investigation with this waitress?

473
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:41,200
I needed the username and the password
for cafe's account with Arbitrum Inc.

474
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,400
<i>Every week Lexie Persimmon retrieved a
letter from the basket at Planck's Constant</i>

475
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,700
<i>And she sent a letter in an
unsealed envelope by Priority Mail.</i>

476
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,900
<i>Since Fay had never seen Lexie Persimmon,</i>

477
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,100
<i>she probably did it after hours.</i>

478
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,200
<i>The only witness to this weekly
event was the digital DVR camera,</i>

479
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
<i>in the Arbitrum ATM.</i>

480
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,500
Why was it so fucking important
to see her getting her mail?

481
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,700
Because I was starting to wonder if...

482
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,900
<i>Lexie Persimmon even existed...</i>

483
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,100
<i>outside of her letters.</i>

484
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,300
<i>Simon Kestral is surfing, stoned,
off Papara beach, Tahiti</i>

485
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,300
Well, he has an idea,

486
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,000
that revolutionizes microchip technology.

487
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,800
<i>At age 60,
he's the 12th richest man in the world,</i>

488
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,400
<i>and a total recluse.</i>

489
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,700
Fuck!

490
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,800
Shit, man.

491
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,100
You know these guys are sikhs.

492
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,100
They work for one of the largest
security firms in the country.

493
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,100
We're talking government and private sector.
Why?

494
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,200
Because they view self-defense
and protection...

495
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,300
of the defenseless
as duty of the highest honor.

496
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,400
But they're fucking literal, you know...

497
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,900
I ask them to bring you to see me,
so they bring you to see me.

498
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm Simon Kestral.

499
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,100
And this is what I do to offer my hand
beacuse according to the tabloid,

500
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,500
I'm such a freak,
I don't touch other people.

501
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,900
I'll touch a tissue of eyes.

502
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,200
Aw, go ahead.

503
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,700
Look, I'm sorry you're here
without your shirt.

504
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,800
And you got a little booboo...

505
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,600
What the fuck, Chuck?

506
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,900
I'll make it upto you.

507
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,400
You can start right now.

508
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,000
Oh.

509
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,200
You're in a 8-mile long circular tunnel,

510
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,300
300 feet below San Celeritas.

511
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
And 27 hours from now...

512
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,000
8 Magnet-Assembly storing
10 GigaJoules of energy,

513
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,600
will guide two Proton beams
fired simultaneously...

514
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,400
in a semi-circular path
towards each other,

515
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,800
at 99.999% of the speed of light

516
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,100
and they'll collide right in there.

517
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,700
To recreate conditions of 3/8th
of a second after The Big Bang.

518
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,100
Ther beginning of the universe...

519
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,200
13 billion years ago.

520
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,800
Questions?

521
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,800
Pretty good task.

522
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,200
'What the fuck for', comes to mind.

523
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,400
But I know you're gonna tell me.
Because you can't resist, rght?

524
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,900
27 hours, I'm gonna find something
that theoretically should exist,

525
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,600
But no one has ever seen.

526
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Funny.
This is exactly what I'm looking for.

527
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,600
You know why?

528
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,400
Yes, because I'm a private
detective and I've been hired to.

529
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,400
Because I already know why we're here.
I knew it the first time I dropped acid.

530
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,100
Really? When was the last time?

531
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,300
We are sentient means,
evolved in an infinite universe.

532
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,600
An infinite extrapolation of our evolution,

533
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,900
is to become Gods ourselves.
You dig?

534
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,800
Now, along the way,
we must learn the secret,

535
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,600
of his magic wand.

536
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,100
If everything there is,
from all the heavenly bodies,

537
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,900
in all the galaxy's
still expanding universe,

538
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,800
To you and me was one
smaller than this single atom,

539
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,200
where did all this mass
and matter come from?

540
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,400
Dont tell me, the God particle.

541
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,400
Fucking A!

542
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,900
At 7:00 am.
Tomorrow morning,

543
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,900
with 5 billion dollars worth
off-the-shelf technology,

544
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,600
I'm gonna answer the
greatest question of all time.

545
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,400
- Why do men have nipples?
- You're a philistine!

546
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,900
The reason we are here is to
find out how we are here.

547
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,300
What's the trick?

548
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,100
What is the divine mechanism
that gives form and substance to all things?

549
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,900
Any other questions
are waste of fucking time.

550
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,500
This is the only worthwhile
pursuit in the universe, Bro.

551
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:31,200
- I'm looking for a woman.
- You're living your life in vain, Hombré.

552
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,300
Coming to my town at the 11th hour,

553
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,800
asking me insignificant questions
of a personal nature.

554
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,200
- What's the point?
- Love.

555
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,200
That got to him.

556
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,900
<i>I'm bought with our security boss,</i>

557
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,600
<i>with an invitation to dinner
that night, at Kestral's house.</i>

558
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,100
<i>He told me there is somebody
that he wants me to meet.</i>

559
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,900
<i>I need sleep.</i>

560
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:17,300
<i>I need the username and password
to the ATM digital cam.</i>

561
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,000
<i>But I cant help it.</i>

562
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,700
<i>I've got a bag full of a beautiful
woman's private thoughts.</i>

563
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,900
<i>That her subconscious desires..</i>

564
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,800
<i>I was the one you dreamed of, when
you were a boy becaming a man.</i>

565
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,900
<i>I was made for you... and you alone.</i>

566
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,500
<i>We're entangled, you and I,
in our own universe.</i>

567
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,000
Forever, Lexie Persimmon.

568
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,100
<i>PS: I did as you asked.</i>

569
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,400
<i>They were exactly where you
told me that they would be.</i>

570
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,900
<i>In their safe, back in the earth,
where they belong.</i>

571
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,600
Because I've no use for material wealth.

572
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,100
- I have you...
- For the rest of my life.

573
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,500
- Where is she?
- How the fuck did you get in here?

574
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,900
You find her?
What're you doing here? Is she...

575
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,300
Shut the fuck up
for a second!

576
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,000
- You're being followed.
- I know that.

577
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,700
What is this place?

578
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,800
The land of fucking make-believe..

579
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,700
Stick around, they'll make you a mayor.

580
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,400
What the fuck is this...
what the fuck is this?

581
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,600
You know what it is.

582
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,300
No. What was exactly
where you told her it would be?

583
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,300
- Ice.
- What?

584
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,600
Wooden Bling. Skinny give me.

585
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,000
What Diamond, Frizer?

586
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,000
Those diamonds.

587
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,800
The ones Skinny Faddeev gave
Anton 'The Pro' to throw the prize fight.

588
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,100
- Wait, slow down...
- No, no. Dont play dumb, Poley.

589
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,400
You dont have to.

590
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,100
Anton thought
he was never getting out of prison,

591
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,500
and he was in love with his Penpal

592
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,600
So he told his girl where to find 'em.

593
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,100
- Right.
- Where?

594
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,300
- In the closet.
- What closet?

595
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,500
In Anton's room at Roosevelt Hotel.

596
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,100
$30 million worth of conflict diamonds...

597
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,800
hidden in the ceiling fixture.

598
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,700
Conflict diamonds?

599
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,400
You know... It always bothered me then,

600
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,400
Faddeev paid Anton upfront
to throw the fight,

601
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,100
But if Faddeev thought he was dumping
something hard to sell on the open market,

602
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,100
like a couple handsful of
non-certified blood diamonds,

603
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,100
Anton wouldn't know the difference, but...

604
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,000
Faddeev would've still want them back.

605
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,200
Especially after Anton killed his
nephew and fucked up the fight.

606
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,200
You think too much.

607
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,600
Compared to you, Poley,
its sold as asparagus.

608
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,400
Say, thats my favorite fucking vegetable.

609
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,400
- Fuck!
- Stops it!

610
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,400
What is it about, What the fuck we're
doing here that you dont understand?

611
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:40,100
- You dont get to touch me.
- I wont fucking touch you.

612
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,600
Oh violent, so violent!

613
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,600
Diamonds, Ned.
Where are the diamonds now?

614
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,200
Back in earth, where they belong?

615
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,500
- What does that mean?
- She bury them?

616
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,200
Yea, yea, yea. I'm coming to that.

617
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:09,200
First, I have to explain to Anton,

618
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,700
That I haven't found Lexie Persimmon.

619
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,900
Then I have to find out if he knows...

620
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,500
Who is in my town.

621
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,200
Maybe Baratva. Mafia.

622
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,700
He follow me, now follow you.

623
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,300
Why would Mob be following me?

624
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,800
I am thinking on that.
I am thinking on account of ice.

625
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,700
- Diamonds? Why?
- Because I did killed Skinny Faddeev.

626
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
- So he did.
- Yes.

627
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,900
He want his jewels back after I fuck up.

628
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,700
I did not mean to kill his nephew.

629
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,500
I feel bad. But Skinny...

630
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,700
He get in my face.

631
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,600
I did not mean to kill him neither.

632
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:19,600
But I did. Sometimes...
I don't know, I just..

633
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,100
- React.
- I know.

634
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,100
When other convict
confessed of killing Faddeev,

635
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,500
I am confused...

636
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,900
because I know I'm the one
who did it.

637
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,900
But now I'm thinking, Mob,
they want me out of prison.

638
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,000
So it can lead them to diamonds.

639
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,200
Anton, you're a genius.

640
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,400
But now I have to protect my Lexie.

641
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,100
Well, we've got to find her first.

642
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,100
She... she has diamonds.

643
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,600
And you... if you find her,

644
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
All you'll do is lead them to her.

645
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,400
<i>Its late when I get the call from Fay.</i>

646
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,600
<i>And I accessed the Arbitrum ATM website.</i>

647
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,900
<i>I start scanning through the ATM's DVR,</i>

648
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,200
<i>looking for a pattern.</i>

649
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,000
<i>Someone retrieving a letter
and sending one by Priority Mail.</i>

650
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,100
<i>Lexie Persimmon stopped writing 8 weeks ago.</i>

651
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,900
<i>So only the first 4 weeks of
the 12 available on the server,</i>

652
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,500
<i>were relevant.</i>

653
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:49,500
<i>Any minute Dharm's security van is
gonna pull up and drag me to dinner.</i>

654
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,600
<i>And then I see it.</i>

655
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:01,000
<i>All of a sudden my searh is over.
I'd found who I was looking for.</i>

656
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,500
<i>Detective, I'd like you to meet my wife.</i>

657
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,500
Julie, meet Ned Cruz.

658
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,300
A real-life private detective.

659
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,000
<i>Isnt she anything a righetous
man has dedicated his time on earth...</i>

660
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,400
<i>to inserting himself into other
people's unexamined lives.</i>

661
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

662
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,300
He's a Remorra. A sucker fish,

663
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,200
that attaches itself to the
younger belly of a big fat city,

664
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,400
and feeds off its leftovers. Parasites.

665
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:51,700
He's from LA, the home of
your distinguisged stage career.

666
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,300
He's brought an artifact from your past.

667
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,900
All the way to San Celeritas.

668
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,500
I'm glad you're ashamed of him.
It'll be a fun.

669
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,600
- Are you a sucker fish, Mr. Cruz?
- No.

670
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,400
Then why would you let my
husband say such ugly things?

671
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,300
Well... they are just words.

672
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,300
Are words important to you?

673
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,200
When you hurt.

674
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,800
Ouch! That's fucking profound.

675
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,000
Detach yourself, Detective.

676
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,300
Dr. Niels Geck.

677
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,600
PhD at MIT, age 13.

678
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,000
Rogue scholar, age 16.

679
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,500
Professor of Theoretical Physics,
University of Geneva, age 20.

680
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,200
Chief Physicist at the
San Celeritas particle Collider.

681
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,500
It's blesseded with a neurological disorder.

682
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,300
He sees numbers and words
as shapes and colors.

683
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,400
Its called Synesthesia.
Its like being born on acid.

684
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So he has very rich inner life.

685
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,500
I envy him above all others.

686
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,200
He's gonna teach you a lesson.

687
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,400
- Niels, let's eat.
- Okay.

688
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,100
Once upon a time we believed
we lived in a clockwork universe...

689
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,100
governed by Newtonian mechanics.

690
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,600
Cause and Effect.

691
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,900
Newton was elegant, yes,
but then certain principles came along...

692
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,500
and changed everything.

693
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,100
The electron can be two different
things and in two different places,

694
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,200
at the same time,
so Cause and Effect is ridiculous.

695
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,000
You cannot predict, with any certainty,

696
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,600
what will happen next.

697
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,700
Tell me about the God particle.

698
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,300
When the universe was created...

699
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,700
Thank you.

700
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,200
There was an equal amount of
matter and antimatter...

701
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,100
and they should've annihilated each
other leaving nothing but empty space.

702
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,800
Theres just no explaining for,
how this universe acquired mass.

703
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,300
There's no explanation at all for how,
we're here in a physical sense.

704
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,600
Unless, unless there is some...

705
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,100
special, mysterious particle...

706
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,600
which actually gives mass...
well, to everything.

707
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,900
In a sense, such a particle must exist,

708
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,200
but we've never seen it.

709
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,100
It's like love. We know it exists.

710
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,500
We can feel it, but we've never saw it.

711
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,500
So, what happens tomorrow?

712
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,000
Well, we recreate the conditions
that existed...

713
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:19,200
One-Trillionth of a second
after the Big Bang.

714
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:25,100
Protons will head toward collisions
at nearly the speed of light.

715
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,400
And Quarks and Gluons will release
enough energy to create...

716
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,800
the Higgs Boson particle,
The God particle.

717
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,100
Its unstable, its fragile.

718
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,100
And it will last for less than
a one-millionth, of a billionth,

719
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,700
of a billionth of a second...

720
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,700
before it decays.

721
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,200
But we've seen it
for the first time in history.

722
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,200
Questions?

723
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,100
Yes. The woman who's serving us,
she's Hindu...

724
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,500
she's dressed in white,
and she's mourning. Why?

725
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,300
Her name's Prabha and her
husband died down there.

726
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,900
There've been a lotta accidents.

727
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,000
Whoa! He was an engineer
and he made a mistake.

728
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,000
- There has been a lot of mistakes.
- A lot? Compared to what?

729
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,600
He was trapped.

730
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:27,300
Pinned under the weight of something
much larger than he was.

731
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,900
- He crushed his rib-cage.
- Yeah. Broke his heart.

732
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,500
It was his own damn fault.

733
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,000
- His fault?
- You bet.

734
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,800
Because the only error is our human errors.

735
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,600
He made the wrong choice.
Unfortunately, he didn't live to regret it.

736
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:49,900
Unlike my oh-so-lonley wife.

737
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,300
Who made some very bad choices a long ago.

738
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,000
Please...

739
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,600
And that's why you're here. Isn't it?

740
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,300
Let me guess. Somebody is looking for her.

741
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,900
Maybe its just me.

742
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,600
So... what's the worst
that can happen...

743
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,300
with a couple of billion worth
of off-the-shelf technology,

744
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,900
brought it together by imperfect
human beings HO here in Mexico?

745
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,200
- A black hole.
- What was that?

746
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,900
A black hole.

747
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,600
Theoretically,
collisions with this much energy,

748
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,600
could create a black hole
that could swallow the earth.

749
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:38,300
Or create strangements
that could initiate runaway fusion,

750
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,100
and turn the planet into a
shrunken lump of strange matter.

751
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,500
We've got nothing to worry about.

752
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,000
You havee arrived here at
the penultimate moment!

753
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,900
The ultimate spiritual pursuit.

754
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,400
As God is the Wizard of Oz.

755
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,200
He's the man behind the curtain.

756
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,900
And tomorrow...
I'm yanking back that curtain.

757
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:12,800
So, I should attend my
business and roll away like...

758
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,100
a little ball of shit
in prenatal position, because...

759
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,900
whatever concerns, its

760
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,000
Inconsequential...

761
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
compared to whatever you think is gonna
happen when you flip that switch tomorrow.

762
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,700
The point, you insignificant asshole,

763
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,100
is that showing up here,
seeking disturbed shit about me,

764
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,300
is cosmically fucked-up.

765
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,400
You are fucked up.
You're the guy that have the magic show.

766
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,300
The one who cant live, not
knowing how the trick is done.

767
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,400
And all you're gonna do is,
just ruin it for the rest of us.

768
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,900
I think you two need to go... away.

769
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,200
Do your business.

770
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,500
Talk, fuck... whatever.

771
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,400
By 7.00am tomorrow, I'm gonna be on stage

772
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,700
standing next to God...

773
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,700
and looking right up your sleeve.

774
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
So, what do you think,
is gonna at 7.00am tomorrow?

775
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,900
There are hidden variables,
so its difficult to predict the outcome.

776
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,900
But I think, one way or another,
at 7am tomorrow,

777
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,600
Simon Kestral will be close to God.

778
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:04,300
<i>So Geck goes home and
Kestral goes down to the Collider...</i>

779
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,300
<i>to do whatever the fuck he has to do,
with only 8 hours to go before showtime.</i>

780
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,700
<i>And Julie and I...</i>

781
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,800
<i>We go for a walk.</i>

782
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,200
So, did you really came here for me?

783
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,600
Yes... yes.

784
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,500
- I am what you're looking for?
- Yeah.

785
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,800
How do you know?

786
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,500
You're exactly what I'm looking for.

787
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,700
How do I know you're not
like every man I've ever met?

788
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,100
You know, you look at me
you see what you wanna see.

789
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,900
I'm gonna stop defining
myself by how men see me.

790
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:13,800
- You've got father issues, right?
- Yeah.

791
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,400
- I stripped for him too.
- And your husband.

792
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:29,400
You know, it's more the same.
I'm nothing but a metaphor to him.

793
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:34,000
Like a trophy, a symbol for what he's
looking for... what we're all looking for.

794
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,900
What?

795
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:41,300
You know... you just...
you dont know. The inner...

796
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,800
We're standing above it, right now.

797
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,400
Oh, the Collider.

798
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,600
Basically its 'Beams Collider'. He's insane.

799
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,300
I'ts all gonna blow up in his face.

800
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:01,200
You know... we got a bigger problem here.

801
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,900
Kiss me.

802
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,300
No, not yet. Listen, he's here.

803
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:18,900
- Who?
- Anton 'The Pro', he's here. Protopov.

804
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,000
- What?
- My god!... All right, listen.

805
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,300
I can help you.

806
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,800
But you've got to come clean.
So, tell me... was it random?

807
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,800
Did you do it
because you were lonely?

808
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,700
Did you write to him
beacuse you read in the paper,

809
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:36,000
about a boxer who was going
to spend the rest of life in prison?

810
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,100
Might be worth $30 million.

811
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,400
Wait, I dont know what you're talking about.

812
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,300
$30 million is a lot of lifestyle to
which you've become accustomed to.

813
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,200
Stop! You're confusing me.

814
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,800
Where did you get this?

815
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,100
I buried all of these.

816
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,300
Bury them?

817
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:07,100
My headshots,
everything from back then, right here.

818
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,400
Listen, you're not making any sense,
you know. Why the accomplice?

819
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,400
Why Geck?

820
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,400
No, no. Dont deny it.

821
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,600
I have seen him,
he was recorded at the cafe.

822
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:23,000
Why did you use Niel's Geck to pick
up your mail and send your letters?

823
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,700
What letters?

824
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:30,000
Let me see. Who is Lexie Persimmon?

825
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,400
Jesus!

826
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,600
- Lexie!
- Shit!

827
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,300
- What the hell is that?
- You really dont know?

828
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,100
- Come on, you gotta run.
- Wait.

829
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,000
Back, go there. Now now!

830
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,400
Anton, wait! Listen to me!
It's not her. She's not Lexie Persimmon!

831
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,900
You cannot stop me.
You wanna try, tough guy? Shoot me.

832
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,500
I can't. You're my client.

833
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,300
Lexie!

834
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,500
Such a cliche! Come on.

835
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,600
It's unlocked.

836
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,900
What the fuck is going on?

837
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,600
- Where are we?
- Its Niel's house.

838
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,300
Geck? Now, hold on.

839
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,400
Who would know you danced at Minkowski?
Who would have your photograph?

840
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,200
- He would.
- Geck went to a striptease club?

841
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,200
Yeah. He brought my husband one night.
Niels introduced us.

842
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,200
Oh shit!

843
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,200
Lexie!

844
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,300
Who is that?

845
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,300
A guy who thinks,
you're the woman of his dreams.

846
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,900
What?

847
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,100
- All right, let's go.
- Lexie!

848
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,900
Niels?

849
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,600
<i>Lex Parsimoniae.
What does it mean?</i>

850
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:14,100
Why, its the Latin expression
for a philosophical concept,

851
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,400
known as 'Occam's Razor'.

852
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,700
In language that Poley can understand,

853
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,700
It means... "All things being equal,

854
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,100
The simplest solution is the best".

855
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:36,400
Now in this case it just means
that a lonely physicist...

856
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:41,500
starts a 5-year long paper-sex relationship,

857
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,800
with a convicted killer,
doing life at Lompoc.

858
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
You know... it is safe, perfect.

859
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,400
The killer gets love and the
Physicist gets treated like a...

860
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,300
woman he pretends to be.

861
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,600
Late at night, in the privacy of his home,

862
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,300
his kink hidden and with
no fear of being exposed.

863
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:11,800
It means that Niels Geck,

864
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,400
is Lex Parsimoniae.

865
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,200
Lexie Persimmon.

866
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,400
<i>- So, you wrote the letters, right?
- What letters?</i>

867
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,500
- You... you read them?
- Yeah.

868
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,000
I dont understand.

869
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,800
Oh my god! So, you knew
he was coming for you.

870
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,200
You had to know.
His last letter!

871
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,500
He must've told you
he was getting out, right?

872
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,100
Yes of course,
I calculated the way he functioned,

873
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,700
The likelihood that I'd be
where he was looking for me.

874
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,800
Wait a minute! What?

875
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:04,600
Did I do something wrong?

876
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,000
Where are the diamonds?

877
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,500
Lexie!

878
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,700
- Oh my god! You, come here.
- What about the... - Dont make a sound.

879
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,800
All right Anton, stop! Enough!

880
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,500
Hello Anton.

881
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,800
<i>Niels Geck calculated the probability
that Anton Protopov would find him.</i>

882
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,100
Lexie?

883
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,900
<i>And based on his result,
he bought himself a gun.</i>

884
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,300
- You not look like self.
- I am.

885
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:08,900
You are not my Lexie.
You're a guy!

886
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,300
I'm both at the same time.

887
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Could you please...
please, put the gun down?

888
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:30,400
- You can love me.
- What? No! Where is she?

889
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,200
- I'm here.
- No!

890
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,300
- I'm here.
- Anton, wait!

891
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,100
- Anton, no! Stop!
- No, No. No!

892
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,400
I love you.

893
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,200
<i>Drop the gun, now!</i>

894
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,300
And that's it. That's all I remember.

895
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:07,700
Till I come to and I can't see a fucking
thing and you guys are here and...

896
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:12,300
I don't know who's alive or dead.

897
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,300
All I want... all I need to know, is...

898
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,600
is Julie all right? That's it.

899
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,900
Good. Good boy.

900
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,100
Just one more thing.

901
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,600
Who was it? Who crashed the party?

902
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,400
That... that's simple.

903
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:43,600
The guy who had been shadowing
Anton, then tailing me...

904
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:48,800
the guys in the Lincoln Town car.
I can describe them.

905
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,800
One is a fucking sociopath,

906
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,700
who never finished first grade
school and who nobody likes.

907
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,100
And the other is a broken down family man,

908
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,700
with nothing...
nothing to show for his life.

909
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,400
And the third type...

910
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,700
wears a brown shoes
and a black suit because...

911
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,800
he can't tell the difference
between right and wrong.

912
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,700
How could you tell who it was,
I thought you couldnt fucking see?

913
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,900
Right, Poley, but you know what...

914
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,500
I didn't need to see to recognize
Frizer's fucking aftershave.

915
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:43,800
No one... nobody knew story
of Anton 'The Pro' Protopov...

916
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,200
better than you guys.

917
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,200
Three stooges!

918
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,100
Working homicide and organized crime,

919
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,200
for so long that you're no
better than the bad guys.

920
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,500
- Whoah! The Bad guys.
- The bad guys.

921
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,800
You know, Anton was right.

922
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:06,000
He was sprung from prison
by the Mob...

923
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,300
with a phony confession,
from a three time loser...

924
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,300
so that he could lead them to $30 million
worth of Skinny Faddeev's stupidity!

925
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,400
And you guys... you guys,
are either working for the Mob,

926
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,700
or you stiff-armed them,
pull rank...

927
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:22,800
garbage worked for you all.

928
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,900
But it was you guys, you all along!

929
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,300
All along.

930
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,600
It is funny.

931
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,300
Anton didn't give a shit about the diamonds.

932
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,700
But you guys, sure as hell did.

933
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,100
Oh yeah.

934
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,000
Poley, go ahead.

935
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,900
<i>Get him up, Poley.</i>

936
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,700
- You get him up.
- We're out of fucking time here.

937
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,900
Hell, get him up.

938
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,900
<i>Its a dead fucking end. He doesn't
know where the diamonds are.</i>

939
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,200
Poley killed the only one who does.

940
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,300
- Shut the fuck up.
- No, fuck you, Poley!

941
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:53,800
What'd you say?

942
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,200
We got to use him,
you fucking messin' all it.

943
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,300
- What the fuck are we doing here?
- Wait wait wait...

944
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,800
Who Killed Puss?

945
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,700
- Your client did.
- Why?

946
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,800
Guess, he was following up on
your so-called investigation,

947
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,200
Didn't like
the African-American's personality.

948
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:17,500
What about Zooey Wigner? I mean,
Anton couldn't have known where she lived.

949
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,000
You... Assholes!

950
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,800
You follow me to the medical center.

951
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,400
I leave, you go in, and flash the badges,

952
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,800
Find out who I was there to see,

953
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:39,900
and then... And then,
Poley, Poley tails her home.

954
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:45,100
Tries to milk her
and loses his little temper.

955
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,000
Oye, you did not.

956
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,000
- Yeah.
- Oh Shit...

957
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,100
You cannot clean this up.

958
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,000
You know, there are too many loose ends.
It's messy, messy.

959
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,100
He's right.
We got it okay till we housed him here.

960
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,000
It was a stupid idea.
And you... you!

961
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,900
You're a fucking sociopath!

962
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,900
You be sickly sorry, you make a
move on me, you grisly piece of shit.

963
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,200
- Sorry?
- Well...

964
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,500
What?

965
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,400
Stop them, Frizer, before they kill again.

966
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,000
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Not yet.

967
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:39,500
All right, here's how its gonna be...

968
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,000
Anton gets out of prison
and partners with you,

969
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,900
to find this Persimmon bitch
who's got his diamonds.

970
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:49,900
Typically, you leave behind
the path of death and destruction.

971
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:55,400
It's morning now and any
minute somebody's gonna find...

972
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,700
a towel-head security guard,
with broken neck, over at Kestral's place.

973
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,000
Geck doesn't show up for work,
they gonna come looking for him.

974
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,400
They gonna find you at end of the trail,
everybody dead.

975
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,400
A real fucking bloodbath.

976
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,000
- What is... what is this?
- The gun that brought down Anton 'The Pro'.

977
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,800
The one they will find
with your fingerprints on 'em,

978
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,100
Next to the corpse.

979
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,400
- You can't... you can't use that thing.
- Unregistered.

980
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,500
See... I like my aftershave.

981
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,900
I like the color of my shoes
and I like that...

982
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,300
at the end of the day,
I beat you, Cruz.

983
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:48,100
I might not have the diamonds but
you gonna take the fall for my efforts.

984
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:54,800
And Poley is gonna use Geck's
little 22 to kill your girlfriend.

985
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,000
Wait a minute...
What? Wait...

986
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,400
Yeah, she's been here
all along, smart guy.

987
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:03,300
To imagine you'll be able to see
whats gonna happen to her.

988
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:07,500
- Poley, wait.
- No, no. No!

989
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:10,000
Well, Skeres, you've a better idea?

990
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,200
Wanna confess your partner's, go to prison?

991
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,000
Frankly, I don't think
your partners will let you.

992
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,400
Oh shit...

993
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,100
I know where the diamonds are.

994
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,500
Don't tell them.
They're gonna kill us anyway.

995
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,500
- Where are they?
- Make me a deal.

996
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,900
- No.
- Then go and fuck yourself.

997
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,500
All right...

998
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,100
All right... all right... all right.
I know... I know where they are.

999
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,900
I know where they are, but I can't see.

1000
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,200
Julie knows too,
but she doesn't know she knows.

1001
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,200
With my help she can lead you right to them.

1002
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
But if you kill her, nobody will be able
to show you where Geck buried them.

1003
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:32,500
It's your call, man, it's your call.
It's your call.

1004
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,900
Open the trunk! Poley!

1005
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:33,300
You keep the car running, maybe
we could get a little air back here.

1006
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,100
Dr. Geck is not answering his telephone.

1007
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,100
Geck the geek. Fuck him.

1008
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,900
- Detector hot?
- All systems are all go, sir.

1009
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,500
Tic Toc...

1010
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,100
Go ahead.

1011
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,600
What the fuck do I look like?

1012
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,000
You're an asshole, Frizer.

1013
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,200
Roll-it-down asshole.

1014
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,900
If we've a contest, World's biggest asshole,

1015
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,000
- you coming second.
- Yeah? Why not first?

1016
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,000
Because you're an asshole.

1017
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,500
<i>3 years to retirement.</i>

1018
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,700
How the fuck!

1019
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,900
- I end up here.
- How? Who gives a shit. Keep digging.

1020
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,200
I give a shit, simple motherfucker!

1021
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:06,000
Maybe I wanna take a minute and
consider that my decision's been really bad.

1022
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,100
Fucking decision!

1023
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,600
Yeah... Now's a great time for that.

1024
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,200
- I fucking knew it.
- Go!

1025
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,100
Maybe its not hell, you know?

1026
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:32,200
Why... why! Why the fuck,
did I let you talk me into this?

1027
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,300
How about $30 million worth of 'Why'?

1028
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,100
Oh fuck!

1029
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,900
Get the gun, get his gun!

1030
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,900
What the fuck is this?

1031
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,700
What the fuck is that?

1032
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,400
<i>What's he doing?</i>

1033
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,300
Shit!

1034
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,500
Get down!

1035
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,900
Shit!

1036
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,200
- You okay?
- No. I dropped the gun.

1037
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,100
Let's see what we're made of.

1038
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:36,900
Oh fuck!

1039
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,600
Oh god!

1040
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:24,800
Shit!

1041
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,200
- We have to turn!
- I can't, I can't!

1042
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,900
- Can't we go any faster?
- Fucking bitch!

1043
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,300
Dammit!

1044
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,500
Its coming directly at us.

1045
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,500
Christ!

1046
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,100
You all right?

1047
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,000
Fuck it!

1048
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,800
So, were you really blind that whole time?

1049
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,500
So you just kinda smash things
together and see what comes out?

1050
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,500
Most of the time, yes.
More or less.

1051
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,300
I mean, Newtonian mechanics
is so 17th century.

1052
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,500
Cause and Effect are totally bogus.

1053
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:21,200
And Reality,
I mean reality is just a wave function.

1054
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:24,200
It's all about likelihood,
nothing is certain.

1055
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,500
I mean, you solved everything.

1056
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,400
You got the girl and I got the Gecko.

1057
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,800
And $30 million worth of diamonds.

1058
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,000
That we should really give back, you know...

1059
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,700
to like Angola, or Liberia...

1060
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,200
or The Ivory Coast
or The Republic of the Congo.

1061
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,000
Or something...

1062
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,500
I don't know.

1063
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
But man, I really like this car.
