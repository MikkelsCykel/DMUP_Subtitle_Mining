1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,633
Ryanair final call for passenger Wilton...

2
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,933
...traveling to Brussels-Charleroi
on Flight FR-1014.

3
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:39,700
Please proceed immediately
to Departure Gate 6,

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,233
where this flight is now closing.

5
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,095
Do you want a car?
£10, Theatreland.

6
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,291
Car? London?

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,796
You want a taxi?

8
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,195
Buckingham Palace.

9
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,965
No one.

10
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:09,328
Would you like a car, sir?

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Are you from Sajit?

12
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,865
I'm not here to meet you in particular.

13
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:15,066
I am here to rescue those...

14
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,633
...that have been let down by the system.

15
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,333
Okay.
Let's go.

16
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,433
I'm over there.

17
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,591
Who's next?
- 2-9.

18
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:21,188
Here.
My turn.

19
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,899
Okay.

20
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:25,964
Hey.

21
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,899
Your name is now Mohammed.

22
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,931
Thank you, Okwe.

23
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:46,099
Hurry up, now, man.
Come quick, quick, quick, quick.

24
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,199
Quick, now.

25
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,131
Right.
You just come here.

26
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:08,829
That bitch.

27
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:11,989
This shit, dustbin city.

28
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:14,962
So, what do I need, Okwe?

29
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:16,698
Amoxicillin.

30
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:18,998
You get that in Boots drugstore or not?

31
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,131
From a doctor.
- You're a doctor.

32
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,231
I'm a driver.

33
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:25,230
Look.

34
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,732
They say you're a doctor, right?

35
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,230
You get me something now.

36
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,597
I can't piss fire another day, man.

37
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,332
I'm a driver.

38
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:37,257
It's for me wife's sake.
You know what I mean.

39
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,364
Okay.

40
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:43,289
So I'll get you all the jobs in South London.

41
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,924
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.

42
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,198
Let me kiss you, Okwe.

43
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:51,528
Maybe in return,
you can get some soap.

44
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:11,420
Early is as bad as late, Okwe.

45
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,256
Hello.
Front desk.

46
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,580
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

47
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,329
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,521
Good night, madam.

49
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,597
Good night, madam.

50
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:47,797
What?

51
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,863
Senay, perhaps today,
I can cook you lunch.

52
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:51,963
No, Okwe.

53
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:58,997
So that's true what they say.

54
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,296
What is true?

55
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:04,064
They say you and the Turkish
girl are nesting like birds.

56
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,164
I rent her couch.

57
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:08,797
In the morning,
when she's working here.

58
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,396
We're never there at the same time.

59
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,894
She has rules.

60
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:16,630
You know, she's a Muslim,
which means she's a virgin.

61
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,364
Like a little angel.

62
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:22,034
Ivan, I think there's someone at the door.

63
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:26,697
Can you believe it?

64
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:29,229
One of the fuckers wanted to
put me on his Visa card.

65
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,455
Oh, my bloomin' feet.

66
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:34,166
Lucky I don't work standing up.

67
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,029
What?

68
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,730
Don't they have hookers
where you come from?

69
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,830
Where are you from?

70
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,775
Somewhere with lions, I bet.

71
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:52,564
I like lions.

72
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,163
Right.

73
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:57,063
Oh, yeah.

74
00:06:57,163 --> 00:07:00,029
You might want to send
someone to check on the room.

75
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,697
There is a problem?
- How should I know?

76
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,956
I don't exist, do I?

77
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,029
See you tomorrow.

78
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,087
What's that?

79
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:10,346
You're stealing stuff already, huh?

80
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,187
Guy before you used to steal
whole pigs from the freezer.

81
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,287
But you better hide it.

82
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,953
If Sneaky sees that...

83
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:19,119
Oh.

84
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:21,187
Speak of the fucking devil.

85
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:24,047
Where's the greeter here?

86
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,951
This fucking place.

87
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,252
Hey.

88
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:53,007
Instead of smoking,
you clean this place up.

89
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:32,352
Okwe.
Everything is all right?

90
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,777
What's this?
Lunch?

91
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:42,649
It was blocking the lavatory in Room 510.

92
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
It is a heart.

93
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:46,986
A human heart.

94
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,453
What?

95
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:51,286
What the fuck do you
know about hearts, Okwe?

96
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:54,786
Perhaps you should telephone the police.

97
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:58,986
Police? You think I should call the police?

98
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:01,644
Señor Juan, someone is dead.

99
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,152
Okay.
You speak to them.

100
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:08,845
You found it.
You do the talking.

101
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll introduce you.

102
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,833
What's your full name, Okwe?

103
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,086
And you never told me where you're from.

104
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:24,485
Or even how come you're here
in this beautiful country.

105
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,847
Hello? Police?

106
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,660
Yeah, got somebody who
wants to talk to you.

107
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:32,952
Hello?

108
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,348
Hello?

109
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,419
Hello?

110
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,385
You will learn, Okwe.

111
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:44,009
The hotel business is about strangers.

112
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,986
And strangers will always
surprise you, you know?

113
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:53,144
They come to hotels in the night
to do dirty things.

114
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:54,285
And in the morning,

115
00:11:54,385 --> 00:11:57,452
it's our job to make things look pretty again.

116
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,552
For your trouble.

117
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,151
You think if you don't take
the money, you are innocent?

118
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:07,309
Take it.
Do something nice with it.

119
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,884
No.

120
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:43,211
It came to me last night
in a flash of inspiration.

121
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,809
I can see.

122
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:51,884
That's a good move.

123
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:55,582
Guo Yi,
there's something I need.

124
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,317
Amoxicillin.

125
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,151
You got the clap?

126
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:01,051
No.

127
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,184
My boss.

128
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:03,517
Which one?

129
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,217
They're all the same.

130
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:09,545
In this country,
the health service is free.

131
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:12,549
You still driving cabs in the day?

132
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,750
You're going to kill yourself.

133
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,009
I do not care to sleep.

134
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:24,739
When you go quiet,
it means you've won already.

135
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,650
Go on, Okwe.
Don't be nice.

136
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,750
Makes it worse.

137
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,184
Well, shit.

138
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,350
You want Chinese or English tea?

139
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,484
Chinese.

140
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:41,484
Don't know how you drink that stuff.

141
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:45,451
I found it on a body.
It's blown my head wide open.

142
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,150
You should read it.

143
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,045
Medicine for your soul, Okwe.

144
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:55,462
Guo Yi, today I also found something.

145
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:59,217
In a lavatory in one of the hotel rooms.

146
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:01,545
Someone's heart.

147
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,784
A heart.

148
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,110
A human heart.

149
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:10,816
I'm only telling you
because you are a rational man.

150
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,678
Maybe there's an explanation.

151
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,383
Maybe some guy with one
of the girls had a heart attack.

152
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:24,916
Rooms are down as empty.

153
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:27,650
So the Spanish guy had
to get rid of the body.

154
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,317
Hotels hate dead people.

155
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,883
It was a healthy heart.
- So?

156
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,750
So your boss was right first time.

157
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,517
Somebody brought it with them.

158
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,016
Who carries human organs?
- Lots of people.

159
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,514
Name someone.
- Me. Okay? Me.

160
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,140
I do it all the time.
I take my work home.

161
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:46,787
What I'm saying is,
I could if I was weird.

162
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,179
And this is a weird city.

163
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,516
Why would anyone do
that to a human heart?

164
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,883
These sound to me like questions.

165
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:58,783
I don't ask questions after 11 years here.

166
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:00,816
And I'm a certified refugee.

167
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,717
You're an illegal, Okwe.
You don't have a position here.

168
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:07,874
You have nothing.
You are nothing.

169
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,908
You wait outside.
I'll go get you those pills.

170
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:18,119
Stick to helping people who can be helped.

171
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:35,716
Fresh stuff.

172
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,283
Thank you.

173
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,383
Thank you.

174
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:08,082
Senay.

175
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:10,182
Senay.

176
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:13,682
Senay, having only one key
is making this impossible.

177
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,916
I do not want you coming
in when I am there.

178
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:17,415
At the hotel, we are friends.

179
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:19,895
Shh.
- I'm no different here.

180
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,144
How would it look, Okwe?

181
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:26,082
So it is better I always
chase you down the street?

182
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:29,876
Wait five minutes,
then knock the door.

183
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,506
Knock very, very quietly.

184
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:51,105
Senay.

185
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,182
Yes?

186
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:57,598
Did you clean on the fifth floor
yesterday morning?

187
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:06,509
Nothing works.

188
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,315
Senay, did you clean Room 510 yesterday?

189
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:13,049
What the hell are you talking
about the hotel for?

190
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:15,375
Water, water, water.

191
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:18,415
I was wondering if there was
a problem in 510 yesterday.

192
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,673
You can fix these things?

193
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,081
Okwe.

194
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,149
You can fix...

195
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,015
They were not clean.
Glasses need very hot water.

196
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:32,215
So do women.

197
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:36,310
Everything here is connected
to everything else.

198
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:42,305
Okwe, in Africa, it is the man
who will cook and clean?

199
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:46,140
Senay, this came for you.

200
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:50,178
Why did you not tell me?

201
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,247
I just told you.

202
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,279
You have friends in New York?

203
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:03,381
Your postcard.

204
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,147
I have a cousin.

205
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,981
Ever since I was small,
she has written to me.

206
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,415
I sometimes wish London
was more like New York.

207
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,448
It would be easier to drive a cab there.

208
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:15,105
You have been to New York?

209
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:17,615
And you came back?

210
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:19,840
I lived there for a time.

211
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:24,514
In the winter,
they put lights in the trees.

212
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:26,705
Is that true?

213
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,847
And you can skate in the parks.

214
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:32,347
And some of the policemen
ride white horses.

215
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:34,657
Not all of them, but some.

216
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:38,272
What did you do there?

217
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:40,081
I worked in a hospital.

218
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:43,214
You were a cleaner?
- I was there to study.

219
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,481
So, why are you working in a hotel?

220
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,774
It is an African story.

221
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:52,548
I've noticed you never answer 'yes' or 'no.'

222
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:54,977
You are very strange.

223
00:19:56,748 --> 00:19:58,414
You drink wine, Senay?

224
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:00,614
Do you want to know why I left Turkey?

225
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,647
Because you wanted to
live like your cousin.

226
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:03,314
No.

227
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:07,239
Because I do not want
to live like my mother.

228
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,471
Yes.
- Yes, what?

229
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:11,638
I do drink wine.

230
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,344
This is a recipe from Nigeria.

231
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:37,919
In Nigeria, they do many
interesting things with pork.

232
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:43,379
But, of course, I used lamb.

233
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,948
Mmm.

234
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,313
Take one three times a day.

235
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:01,814
Avoid alcohol.

236
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:03,971
In here. Come.

237
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,772
So she's a popular lady.

238
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:28,446
My warriors cannot work
with rotten balls, Okwe.

239
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:33,139
My friend is just a porter
in the hospital crematorium.

240
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:47,380
Hello.
Front desk.

241
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,113
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

242
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:52,213
Psst. Hey.

243
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Hello?

244
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,913
Yeah, room service.

245
00:22:07,846 --> 00:22:09,412
Sneaky doesn't know about this?

246
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:12,444
Sneaky knows about everything.

247
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:14,145
And you?

248
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:16,312
You know everything that
goes on in the hotel?

249
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:18,412
Not so much butter.
Hey.

250
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:22,003
You guard the door, lvan.

251
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:24,704
You see who comes and goes.

252
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,980
You would know if somebody
came into the hotel...

253
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,813
...but did not leave again.

254
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:32,572
Why would someone not leave, Okwe?

255
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,512
I don't know.

256
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:40,544
You should remove the crusts,
like in the Ritz.

257
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:44,375
Everyone leaves, Okwe.

258
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,145
Some leave quickly.

259
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:49,370
Some stay for long time.

260
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:51,311
If you want to stay,

261
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:56,277
don't concern yourself
with who comes and who goes.

262
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:02,813
It's the little touches
that make the difference.

263
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:05,174
That's capitalism.

264
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,346
Now go.

265
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:10,775
Don't forget.
You accept only cash.

266
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:14,678
Room service.

267
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,778
Thanks.

268
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,045
Okay, you just make
yourself comfortable, and, uh...

269
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:21,112
I'll go freshen up.

270
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:23,212
All right?

271
00:24:25,646 --> 00:24:29,236
Fucking asshole.

272
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,511
Oh, my God.

273
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:45,006
Come on, babe. Hurry up.

274
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,545
Okay, okay.

275
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:52,340
Calm yourself, sweetheart.

276
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:55,846
What are you doing?

277
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:57,645
Have a drink first.

278
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:00,643
You look fine.
Just get out here.

279
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,473
Hey.

280
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,577
Hey.

281
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:09,712
Fuck.

282
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:24,278
Enough. No more.

283
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:25,743
Where the fuck did you come from?

284
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:27,144
Leave now.

285
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:29,244
Oh. Oh, fuck.

286
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,244
You don't have concussion.

287
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:41,279
How the fuck do you know?

288
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,477
Christ, you must be bored.

289
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:45,310
Getting your kicks spying on me.

290
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,811
I was making sure the blockage
had not returned.

291
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,477
Perhaps...

292
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:52,044
It's Juliette.

293
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:53,677
You should go home and rest.

294
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,078
Rest?

295
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,477
Got three more before morning.

296
00:25:57,577 --> 00:26:01,270
So, have you ever seen a lion?

297
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,366
Oh, yes.

298
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,445
On TV.

299
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,500
I had it cut.

300
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:31,576
It is yours.

301
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:36,196
You were right.
This way is more sensible.

302
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,078
Okwe, you must not tell them at
the hotel that you have a key.

303
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,978
Senay, I tell them only the truth.

304
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:58,143
Even so.

305
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,143
And show them that your back hurts...

306
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,911
...so they know you sleep on the floor.

307
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,143
But that is not true.
I sleep on the couch.

308
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:08,073
The couch is not as real as the floor, Okwe.

309
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:09,610
Believe me.
I'm a woman.

310
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,611
And some of those bitches
won't know what is a couch.

311
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:15,941
But they know floor.
They clean floors.

312
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:18,676
For you?

313
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:21,110
Immigration-enforcement directive.

314
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,210
Open the door.

315
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:37,177
Forgive us.
Miss Gelik?

316
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:38,978
Senay Gelik?
Turkish national?

317
00:27:39,078 --> 00:27:41,142
Do you have your S.A.L. Handy?
- My what?

318
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,977
Your acknowledgement letter.
Your I.D.

319
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:45,839
Oh, yeah.
I carry it always.

320
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:48,209
Neighbors, Senay.
They see things.

321
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:51,376
In the last few days, they've
seen someone come and go.

322
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,476
A man.

323
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:56,676
Sometimes a woman in your
position can be exploited.

324
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,643
There are people in London
without any kind of papers.

325
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:01,910
They prey on people like you.
- Prey?

326
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,043
There is someone living here.
- There is no one living here.

327
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,210
You are aware that your E.L.R. Status...

328
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,977
...means you are unable to accept rent.

329
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:11,235
You're seeking asylum.

330
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,842
Or engage in employment of any
kind for at least six months.

331
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:18,977
You're not working, are you?
- Mind if I use your bathroom?

332
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:21,339
Your case is under review.

333
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,576
Thank you.

334
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,609
Thank you.

335
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,109
Is that all you want?

336
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:56,209
No, no, no, no.

337
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,242
You know this stuff will
not only keep you awake.

338
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:04,762
It'll blow your brains out.
You know that, don't you?

339
00:29:11,942 --> 00:29:14,635
Hey. Okwe.

340
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:18,001
Keys.
There you are.

341
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,275
Hey, Okwe.
What happened, man?

342
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,475
Hey, somebody's husband
came home early, right?

343
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:24,610
Here.
Take this.

344
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,539
We don't want the doctor
getting sick, right?

345
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,076
I played them one of these fellows' songs.

346
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,576
And, actually,
they were very helpful.

347
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:43,481
Had they already heard it or not?

348
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,057
They were already very into funk and...

349
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:51,009
It's bound to happen.

350
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:53,166
You stay here too long.

351
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:57,298
You start dressing like
an Englishman, huh?

352
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,908
Where is he, then?

353
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:19,941
Who?

354
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,666
I have a date.
Every payday, 4:45.

355
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:25,575
Hey.

356
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,241
Come on, lover boy.

357
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,638
Okwe, will you help me?

358
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,808
Hey, guy before you took £5.

359
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:32,842
No, no, no, no.

360
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:35,508
But you watch the door, huh?
- Yes.

361
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:36,842
Come, my little princess.

362
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:39,375
Come, come, come, come,
lille princesso.

363
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:43,805
Security room is out of bounds
for half an hour.

364
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,738
Five minutes, max.

365
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,707
Immigration-enforcement directive.

366
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,908
Can I help you?

367
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:06,795
What time do the maids clock in?

368
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,873
Wakey-wakey.
- 5:00.

369
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:15,505
You mind if we wait?

370
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,341
No.

371
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:38,507
Excuse me, sir.
This is a nonsmoking area.

372
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,274
If you wish,
perhaps you can wait...

373
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:44,029
...in the designated area across the lobby.

374
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:18,074
Hello?

375
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,441
Shh.

376
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:21,974
It's for you.

377
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:23,941
Hello?

378
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,268
Okwe. Okwe.

379
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,397
But I am almost there.

380
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:31,928
Senay will be here in two minutes.

381
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:34,007
You must stop her.

382
00:33:39,273 --> 00:33:42,535
I have a medical condition.

383
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:45,333
Lightning doesn't strike twice.

384
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Shh, shh, shh.

385
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:02,965
Is that the last of them?

386
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,039
Yes.

387
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:08,073
This is an interesting place.

388
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:11,063
Would you like to see a rate card?

389
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:32,806
I have a friend.

390
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,340
In her factory,
they always need people.

391
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,273
It's a sweatshop.

392
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:40,439
Is it any worse than
cleaning up after whores?

393
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,539
It's better money.

394
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:47,032
Oh, you are so sad for me.

395
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:49,306
I do not wish to cause harm to anyone.

396
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:50,706
That is all it is?

397
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:52,539
I will collect my things and go.

398
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,730
Go?
- How can I stay?

399
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,499
Okwe, who will cook for me?

400
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,773
If it's okay, I will call on you
if I have the time.

401
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:04,606
But I'm owed three days'
money by the hotel.

402
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:07,440
I will see Señor Juan tomorrow morning.

403
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,301
I have no money for food.

404
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:14,537
I will see him today.
Meet me at the café at 4:00.

405
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,741
You are here to see Señor Juan?

406
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:02,604
Looking for work?

407
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,900
Are you working?

408
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:10,539
French?

409
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,832
No, no.

410
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,895
Help me.

411
00:36:15,971 --> 00:36:19,335
Yoruba.
You speak Yoruba?

412
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:21,406
Bantu?

413
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:26,039
What the fuck are you doing here, Okwe?

414
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,572
Senay has decided to leave.

415
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:29,739
She asked me to collect what she's owed.

416
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,738
Oh, yeah?

417
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,748
What, are you marrying
her or something, Okwe?

418
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:38,572
I'll get her money.

419
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
No, no. It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

420
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:54,333
I'm a doctor.
It's okay.

421
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:58,894
No, no, no.
Please, please, please.

422
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,854
You must get this man to hospital now.

423
00:37:06,954 --> 00:37:08,221
He must go straightaway.

424
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:10,522
If you are a doctor,
you can do something.

425
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:13,121
This is the wound of an operation.

426
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:15,854
Where? Where did he have this operation?

427
00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:17,487
Which country?

428
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:19,587
You must get this man to hospital.

429
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:21,354
They won't go to hospital.

430
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,545
No, no.
- No hospital.

431
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Guo Yi is here?

432
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:49,953
Shit.

433
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:07,586
Sister. Hello.
It's my first day here.

434
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,388
I was told to collect my overall.

435
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,488
Which shift are you on?
- Shift?

436
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:15,753
Come on. Either you're late
or you're really late.

437
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,521
You couldn't do the bins in the kitchen...

438
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:18,851
...when you're done in here,
could you?

439
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,645
Okay, okay, okay.

440
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,820
You see these blue tablets?

441
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,725
He must take two every two hours.

442
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:34,219
Understand?

443
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,229
He must take two blue
tablets every two hours.

444
00:40:47,685 --> 00:40:50,083
You speak English?

445
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:51,419
And Somali?

446
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,519
A bit.

447
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:59,938
He says to say, 'Thank you.
God is great.'

448
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:05,161
Tell them he must take two
blue tablets every two hours.

449
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,865
And one white tablet every six hours.

450
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,739
It is very important
that you get this exactly right.

451
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:29,456
Ask him which hospital they went
to to have the kidney removed.

452
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:35,785
He says they didn't go to a hospital.

453
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:38,265
Ask him where they did this.

454
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:43,519
In a room.

455
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,359
He had his kidney removed
in the hotel, yes?

456
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:51,037
How much did he get for risking his life?

457
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:56,745
He is English now.

458
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:00,049
He swapped his insides for a passport?

459
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:07,051
The man at the hotel said...

460
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:10,466
...it would be like taking out a tooth.

461
00:42:47,085 --> 00:42:50,052
Can I get you something?
- I've been here one hour.

462
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,208
An hour and a half.

463
00:42:56,685 --> 00:42:57,919
There.

464
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:00,739
I will go and collect my things.

465
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:04,075
Why won't you sit down?

466
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:13,050
Okwe, where have you been?
- Africa.

467
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,252
I thought you weren't coming.
- I would have got you the money.

468
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:18,352
The money?

469
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:23,384
Do you feel that?

470
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:25,713
Do you feel anything?

471
00:43:27,086 --> 00:43:31,575
You know, I counted.
I've seen you laugh three times.

472
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,652
Four.

473
00:43:37,518 --> 00:43:40,540
You think I'm so innocent.

474
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:41,851
In my village,

475
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,050
they chew those leaves to forget
how hard their lives are.

476
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,684
I use it to keep awake.

477
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,307
You know it makes you look...

478
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:53,416
Senay.

479
00:43:53,484 --> 00:43:56,245
You should keep away from me.

480
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:58,408
You lost your job.

481
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:01,629
Because of me,
you are in a sweatshop.

482
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:06,215
And now you are going again.

483
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:08,050
Be sure you make it to New York.

484
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,805
I will make it to New York,
Okwe, thank you.

485
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:18,650
It's best if you don't show up
until after 5:00.

486
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,783
Most porters are gone by then.
Only ghosts left.

487
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:22,951
Showers are here.

488
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:25,317
Water's not too hot,
but it runs.

489
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:28,508
Couch in my office is pretty soft.

490
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,607
Oh, I forgot.

491
00:44:31,684 --> 00:44:34,275
You don't sleep, do you?

492
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:38,909
My friend, welcome to my hotel.

493
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:40,751
Beautiful, isn't it?

494
00:44:40,851 --> 00:44:44,805
And the other residents are, uh, very quiet.

495
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:46,451
It will only be until I...

496
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:49,016
Until the world improves.

497
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,250
Best truffles I've ever seen in England.

498
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:39,113
Dug up 15 hours ago in Provence.

499
00:45:39,184 --> 00:45:42,116
Came through on the night train.

500
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:44,184
Mmm.

501
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,350
Mmm.

502
00:45:48,817 --> 00:45:50,917
Shall we say one thousand?

503
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:54,312
I'm in the wrong fucking hotel.

504
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:56,682
One thousand, Señor Juan.
What do you say?

505
00:45:56,782 --> 00:46:00,146
Okay.
One thousand.

506
00:46:01,883 --> 00:46:05,482
But if I give you that price,
I need a favor.

507
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:08,050
There is a night porter.
African.

508
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,483
He came from you, so I guess
he came through Amsterdam.

509
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,242
Yes.
What about him?

510
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:17,749
He's some kind of doctor.
What kind of doctor?

511
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:20,994
I need to know what there is to know.

512
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:23,747
Police. Police.

513
00:46:44,717 --> 00:46:46,350
Can I help you gentlemen?

514
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,050
We're looking for someone
called Senay Gelik.

515
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,049
Thought she might be working here.

516
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:54,582
Do you see anybody working here?

517
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,548
If you see her, give us a call.

518
00:47:22,316 --> 00:47:24,316
You have been here for two days.

519
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:27,749
And already because of you,
I'm in trouble.

520
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:31,009
Maybe I should call lmmigration.

521
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:33,741
Should I call them?

522
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:35,415
You wouldn't do that.

523
00:47:35,515 --> 00:47:39,675
I need a good reason.
What can you give me?

524
00:47:40,582 --> 00:47:44,415
If they find out you've been
working, what will they do?

525
00:47:44,515 --> 00:47:47,141
They will put you in prison.

526
00:47:47,216 --> 00:47:51,045
And here,
they mix the men and women.

527
00:47:51,115 --> 00:47:55,047
So every night,
you will be raped.

528
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:02,082
If you want to be like a Western girl,

529
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:05,545
that's what happens to Western girls.

530
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:08,773
If you want to go to jail, fine.

531
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:11,315
If you can't give me a good reason,

532
00:48:11,415 --> 00:48:14,904
I will call the lmmigration.

533
00:48:14,983 --> 00:48:16,983
I'm a good man, Senay.

534
00:48:17,015 --> 00:48:19,674
I know where to draw the line.

535
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:23,215
I don't want to take your virginity, Senay.

536
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:27,441
I just want you to help me to relax.

537
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:41,213
You have such a beautiful mouth, Senay.

538
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:49,883
Achtung. Achtung.

539
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:52,349
My ladies and gentlemen,
your coach awaits.

540
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:54,846
Please. Please.

541
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:58,148
But you must take your own
luggage to the coach.

542
00:48:58,248 --> 00:49:01,043
Please. Thank you. Good evening.

543
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:05,581
I will help only those
who cannot carry their own bags.

544
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,113
Okwe, get up here.

545
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:16,548
This man is a doctor.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

546
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:18,948
She's okay.
She only needs to rest a minute.

547
00:49:19,048 --> 00:49:21,536
He qualified in Lagos.

548
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:24,348
He worked for the Nigerian government.

549
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:28,380
His name is Dr. Olusegun
Olatokumbo Fadipe.

550
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:31,678
We must hurry or we'll miss the coach.

551
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,215
In the end,

552
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:45,565
I find out everything
about everyone in this place.

553
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:50,148
Here.
Take a look at this.

554
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:53,203
French.
It's a work of art.

555
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,214
There are two Lebanese I use
who are the best in London.

556
00:49:56,314 --> 00:49:58,014
You give them a photograph...

557
00:49:58,114 --> 00:50:01,515
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Señor Juan.

558
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:05,915
If you were just some African,
the deal would be simple.

559
00:50:06,015 --> 00:50:09,348
You give me your kidney,
I give you a new identity.

560
00:50:09,448 --> 00:50:12,347
I sell the kidney for 10 grand,
so I'm happy.

561
00:50:12,447 --> 00:50:16,214
The person who needs the kidney
gets cured, so he's happy.

562
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,114
The person who sold his kidney...

563
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:21,581
...gets to stay in this beautiful
country, so he's happy.

564
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:25,545
My whole business is based on happiness.

565
00:50:25,615 --> 00:50:30,945
But for you,
Dr. Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe,

566
00:50:31,014 --> 00:50:34,037
I've a better idea.

567
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,081
I do not want to get involved,
Señor Juan.

568
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:41,943
Each time you operate,
you get £3,000.

569
00:50:42,014 --> 00:50:46,004
A passport for you and one for Senay.

570
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:47,347
Take her on honeymoon.

571
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:50,538
I do not want to get involved.

572
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,546
You could even go back to Africa.

573
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:57,269
And no one would know
who the fuck you are.

574
00:50:58,714 --> 00:51:00,114
Your choice.

575
00:51:00,214 --> 00:51:02,214
No rush.

576
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:08,474
Just wanted to put a
little wasp in your head.

577
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:20,880
Unusual.

578
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,674
Chinese guy with no family.

579
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,906
Maybe he's from the back of a truck.

580
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:33,775
I cut off his buttons so
his spirit can escape.

581
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:35,747
I'm sewing up his pockets...

582
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:40,780
...so he can't take his bad luck
with him to the spirit world.

583
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,247
If he's an atheist,

584
00:51:42,347 --> 00:51:45,780
I'm ruining a suit no one will ever see.

585
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:49,580
If he's a Buddhist,
I'm giving him eternal happiness...

586
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,514
...for the price of a piece of thread.

587
00:51:51,614 --> 00:51:54,580
I have found out why the
heart was at the room.

588
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,168
They are removing kidneys.

589
00:51:57,813 --> 00:52:00,347
One of their patients died at their hands.

590
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:03,013
Another, I treated for
a staphylococcal infection.

591
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:05,841
You're treating people?

592
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:07,380
I hope you charge.

593
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,638
Did you hear what I said?

594
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:14,408
There's nothing so
dangerous as a virtuous man.

595
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,446
Well, Okwe,
if you're so concerned,

596
00:52:16,546 --> 00:52:18,213
you should go to the police.

597
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:19,680
Get yourself deported.

598
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,080
Do you think if it were for
deportation I would not do it?

599
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,702
I'm a wanted man, Guo Yi.

600
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:29,369
Wanted for what?

601
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:37,644
Okwe, you didn't know
people sold their organs?

602
00:52:38,713 --> 00:52:41,179
Not here.
- What do you mean, 'here'?

603
00:52:41,279 --> 00:52:44,146
Here in London you think
it doesn't happen...

604
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:46,213
...because the queen doesn't approve?

605
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:49,213
I heard in London it's 10 grand for a kidney.

606
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:52,369
For that, people take risks.

607
00:52:52,446 --> 00:52:56,209
If I had the courage,
I'd sell my kidney.

608
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,041
Just to get out of here.

609
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:03,011
Just to save my brain.

610
00:53:55,312 --> 00:53:57,212
The problem with being on time...

611
00:53:57,312 --> 00:54:00,312
...is that you can always be tracked down.

612
00:54:00,412 --> 00:54:02,678
What do you think of the girl?

613
00:54:02,778 --> 00:54:05,972
She's my next customer.
8 years old.

614
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,712
She's called Rima.

615
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:12,079
Her family brought her over
from Saudi hoping for a miracle.

616
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:16,684
If she doesn't get the new
kidney, she's going to die.

617
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:19,645
The doctor we use is no good.

618
00:54:19,745 --> 00:54:21,045
If he fucks up again,

619
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:24,885
there'll be another heart down the lavatory.

620
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:31,011
Okwe?
You still there?

621
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:34,834
So I'm an evil man, right?

622
00:54:34,912 --> 00:54:37,810
But I'm trying to save her life.

623
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:39,878
That's weird, huh?

624
00:54:39,912 --> 00:54:43,652
Kind of thing that keeps
you awake at night.

625
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:57,568
Tonight, London is colder than Moscow.

626
00:54:57,645 --> 00:55:00,577
I heard it on the radio.

627
00:55:25,912 --> 00:55:27,912
Okwe?

628
00:55:28,278 --> 00:55:32,677
It is a crazy idea,
but we really can do it.

629
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:34,845
You said you liked New York.

630
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:40,172
But if not New York, then maybe
Boston or Los Angeles.

631
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:43,644
I'm going there, Okwe.
What do you think?

632
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:46,644
And, Okwe,
you could go there, too.

633
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:51,608
Senay, are you okay?

634
00:55:51,677 --> 00:55:53,677
Senay, where are you?

635
00:55:53,677 --> 00:55:55,837
What has happened?

636
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:41,666
I knocked,
but you did not hear me.

637
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:44,900
Senay, are you okay?

638
00:56:45,676 --> 00:56:48,303
Senay, what has happened?

639
00:56:48,378 --> 00:56:50,866
The factory does not suit me.

640
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,933
My hands are too soft.
I cut my fingers.

641
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:59,601
So I have decided to go to America.

642
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:04,466
For America,
you would need a visa.

643
00:57:06,776 --> 00:57:09,403
Or maybe a European passport.

644
00:57:10,977 --> 00:57:13,910
You keep away from Señor Juan.
- It is like taking out a tooth.

645
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,776
He's lying, Senay.

646
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:18,677
Because you are poor, you will
be gutted like an animal.

647
00:57:18,777 --> 00:57:21,210
They will cut you here,
or they will cut you here.

648
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,210
They will take what they want.

649
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,444
One of the laundry girls did it.
And now she's free.

650
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:28,177
Others are dead, Senay.

651
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:30,277
So they are free, too.

652
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,350
What would your God say?

653
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,078
My God does not speak to me anymore.

654
00:57:36,178 --> 00:57:38,178
Don't break, Senay.

655
00:57:38,242 --> 00:57:39,644
Save money.

656
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:43,229
Keep New York in your
head and work hard.

657
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:47,705
You know what kind of work I do?

658
00:57:58,744 --> 00:58:00,744
Lunch.

659
00:59:10,176 --> 00:59:13,910
Okwe, somebody's in
the back room looking for you.

660
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,941
She look like a film star, boy.

661
00:59:23,242 --> 00:59:24,343
Senay.

662
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:28,742
Look, Okwe, I know for sure
that this coat costs £300.

663
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:30,876
And this dress...
- Tell me what has happened.

664
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:33,526
We can sell the coat for £200.

665
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:36,178
Senay, where did you get these?

666
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:38,208
I bit, Okwe.

667
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,838
At the factory.

668
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,509
He said he would report me to lmmigration.

669
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:45,973
And he made me suck.

670
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:48,701
But today, I bit.

671
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:50,775
I bit.

672
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:53,898
I bit.

673
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:21,575
Señor Juan sometimes
has rooms in the hotel.

674
01:00:21,675 --> 01:00:22,675
No, Senay.

675
01:00:22,775 --> 01:00:25,764
Just for tonight.
- No.

676
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:28,076
Through there is hot water and a shower.

677
01:00:28,176 --> 01:00:30,176
Hurry, Senay.

678
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:36,107
What is this place, Okwe?

679
01:00:36,709 --> 01:00:39,841
It is a place where you can stay for tonight.

680
01:00:39,941 --> 01:00:41,609
So cold.

681
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:45,641
If anyone comes,
you are a friend of Guo Yi.

682
01:01:06,976 --> 01:01:10,716
Tomorrow we will find
you somewhere to live.

683
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:24,306
So... it is in there.

684
01:01:29,374 --> 01:01:31,933
I can hear it.

685
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:35,367
Your heart.

686
01:02:44,774 --> 01:02:46,774
Hello.
Room service.

687
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:03,134
Buenos dias, negro.

688
01:03:12,341 --> 01:03:14,830
Come on.
Come on.

689
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:24,040
She is nil by mouth the whole day.

690
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,140
Please.

691
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,106
Sister.

692
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:34,399
Help me, brother.

693
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:42,101
Stop acting like you've got a choice.

694
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Please.

695
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,373
Put on your clothes.

696
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:52,633
Son of a bitch.

697
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:55,440
You came in a truck,
but you're going home in chains.

698
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,515
They'll deliver you like meat.
- No.

699
01:04:00,907 --> 01:04:04,477
The whole world is
wrong except you, Okwe?

700
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:07,300
What?
What, Okwe?

701
01:04:07,341 --> 01:04:12,294
You are going to cut me
up and flush me away?

702
01:04:12,373 --> 01:04:14,373
Huh?

703
01:04:47,939 --> 01:04:50,340
I really don't know you at all,
do I, Okwe?

704
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,873
This is Senay. She is a friend.
- I'm not your friend.

705
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:55,773
She's been out here all night.
- I would rather freeze to death...

706
01:04:55,873 --> 01:04:57,306
...than go into that building again.

707
01:04:57,406 --> 01:04:59,406
You know, there are
mornings I feel the same.

708
01:04:59,506 --> 01:05:00,573
Come.
It's cold.

709
01:05:00,673 --> 01:05:02,773
This is the house of the dead, Okwe.

710
01:05:02,873 --> 01:05:04,873
They're all dead.

711
01:05:06,074 --> 01:05:08,074
Okwe.

712
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,573
Maybe this will help.

713
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,037
My cousin has a room in Chinatown.

714
01:05:15,106 --> 01:05:17,656
I guess there's space for two.

715
01:05:19,472 --> 01:05:24,040
You know, Okwe, good at chess
usually means bad at life.

716
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:27,373
You do realize that she's
in love with you, don't you?

717
01:05:27,473 --> 01:05:31,213
I've been with her 20 minutes,
and I know it.

718
01:05:31,272 --> 01:05:34,706
But then, I'm bad at chess.

719
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:45,472
Senay, there is something I must tell you.

720
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:48,240
This is your religion?
- I have no religion.

721
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,340
Senay.

722
01:05:51,472 --> 01:05:54,005
You have stopped chewing the leaf.

723
01:05:54,105 --> 01:05:56,105
I can see it in your eyes.

724
01:05:56,205 --> 01:05:59,272
You know, Okwe,
your eyes are quite pretty.

725
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,282
They're not bad-looking.
- Senay, listen to me.

726
01:06:05,139 --> 01:06:07,934
I come to this churchyard often.

727
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:12,256
I come here to be alone
and to think about my wife.

728
01:06:14,072 --> 01:06:16,631
So now you see.

729
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,899
What do I see?

730
01:06:18,973 --> 01:06:21,523
You should not see me anymore.

731
01:06:25,306 --> 01:06:27,306
Do you love her?

732
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:28,272
Do you love her?

733
01:06:28,372 --> 01:06:29,972
There is a room above a restaurant.

734
01:06:30,072 --> 01:06:32,005
Immigration police do
not go into Chinatown.

735
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:33,705
You will be safe.
- Do you love her?

736
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:35,472
Here's money for the rent I owe you.

737
01:06:35,572 --> 01:06:38,372
There is more for the trouble
I have caused you.

738
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:40,562
Do you love her?
- Love?

739
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:46,895
For you and I,
there is only survival.

740
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:51,949
It is time you woke up
from your stupid dream.

741
01:07:19,505 --> 01:07:21,505
Yes?

742
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,738
Senay.

743
01:07:26,305 --> 01:07:29,535
Are you going on holiday or something?

744
01:07:30,804 --> 01:07:32,929
Señor Juan.

745
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:43,538
Señor Juan.

746
01:07:43,638 --> 01:07:45,638
America, maybe?

747
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:04,104
Come on.

748
01:08:04,204 --> 01:08:06,371
You cleaned up their shit so long.

749
01:08:06,471 --> 01:08:08,960
Now you can be one of them.

750
01:09:08,236 --> 01:09:10,396
Who is it?

751
01:09:10,471 --> 01:09:14,494
It's me.
I got some paperwork.

752
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:18,195
Okay.
How old are you?

753
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,638
22.

754
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,670
How old do you want to be?

755
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,770
22.

756
01:09:24,737 --> 01:09:27,202
Hey, Come on.
Relax.

757
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:29,037
I can make you whatever you want.

758
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:31,537
You want to be Spanish?
Or Greek?

759
01:09:31,637 --> 01:09:33,637
Italian.

760
01:09:33,738 --> 01:09:35,438
You're going to need a new name.

761
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:38,060
Isabella Encarico.

762
01:09:38,137 --> 01:09:39,570
You're sure that's Italian?

763
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:42,363
She owns a café in New York.

764
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,570
Okay.
You are at New York lmmigration.

765
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,769
What's your name?

766
01:10:12,869 --> 01:10:14,803
Isabella Fontana Encarico.

767
01:10:14,903 --> 01:10:16,926
How old are you?
- 22.

768
01:10:17,003 --> 01:10:18,904
Where were you born?
- Napoli.

769
01:10:19,004 --> 01:10:21,104
Where in Napoli?
- Arenella.

770
01:10:21,204 --> 01:10:24,101
Right.

771
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,970
The trick, Senay, is to believe
you are the new person.

772
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:31,803
If you believe it inside, then
the lmmigration will believe it.

773
01:10:31,903 --> 01:10:33,960
Drink, Senay?

774
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:41,933
What are you afraid of?
Okwe's gone.

775
01:10:42,003 --> 01:10:44,468
Got scared and go away.

776
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,470
Go to hell.

777
01:10:50,436 --> 01:10:53,334
This is hell.

778
01:10:53,403 --> 01:10:56,096
I'm helping you to get away.

779
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,236
Take off your robe.

780
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,870
Come on.
Come on.

781
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,470
Hey, hey.
Stop. Stop that.

782
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:02,797
Stop that.

783
01:11:02,869 --> 01:11:05,165
I can't believe it.

784
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,703
I'm arguing like you are my fucking wife.

785
01:11:07,803 --> 01:11:09,903
Let me explain something, Senay.

786
01:11:10,003 --> 01:11:14,569
Your robe, now, is what the
Americans call a 'deal breaker.'

787
01:11:14,669 --> 01:11:16,303
So...

788
01:11:16,403 --> 01:11:18,403
No.

789
01:11:20,436 --> 01:11:24,431
You are this close to New York,
and you said no.

790
01:11:41,703 --> 01:11:43,703
Wait.

791
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:51,490
I want the whole thing.
That's the deal.

792
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:53,660
Take it or leave it.

793
01:11:55,336 --> 01:11:58,166
You do not see me.

794
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:00,792
You just do.

795
01:12:00,868 --> 01:12:02,868
Take it or leave it.

796
01:12:37,702 --> 01:12:40,327
So it wasn't so bad, huh?

797
01:12:40,401 --> 01:12:42,134
Nothing to cry about.

798
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:44,565
I'm not crying.

799
01:12:44,636 --> 01:12:49,651
If you told me it was the first
time, I'd have cut a ribbon.

800
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:55,595
I can't believe Okwe never fucked you.

801
01:12:55,668 --> 01:12:58,065
You kind of love him, huh?

802
01:12:58,134 --> 01:13:02,067
Women love men most who
don't love them back.

803
01:13:02,134 --> 01:13:05,863
Well, you had a lucky escape.

804
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:08,594
You know why he ran away?

805
01:13:12,202 --> 01:13:14,602
Because I found out that in Africa,

806
01:13:14,702 --> 01:13:16,895
he murdered his own wife.

807
01:13:24,702 --> 01:13:28,002
You don't eat or drink for 24 hours, okay?

808
01:13:28,102 --> 01:13:30,102
Doctor's orders.

809
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:59,128
Senay is here?

810
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,058
Senay is here?

811
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:21,934
Senay.

812
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:33,626
I will need a pill.

813
01:14:36,901 --> 01:14:40,896
There is a pill you can
take the morning after.

814
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:44,667
You're a doctor.

815
01:14:45,601 --> 01:14:48,624
At least you can get me a pill.

816
01:15:27,933 --> 01:15:30,738
I won't allow you to butcher her.

817
01:15:30,767 --> 01:15:32,666
You won't allow?

818
01:15:32,766 --> 01:15:35,528
I will operate on her myself.

819
01:15:35,601 --> 01:15:36,901
You'll do what?

820
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:38,701
I will do it.

821
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:42,966
It is the only way I can be sure
she will not die.

822
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:46,190
In return, I want a passport.

823
01:15:46,268 --> 01:15:48,324
A new identity.

824
01:15:49,334 --> 01:15:52,232
Well, holy shit.

825
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:54,299
So you are human, Okwe?

826
01:15:54,334 --> 01:15:58,499
I will bring you our photographs
tomorrow morning.

827
01:16:04,933 --> 01:16:08,888
Hi. I'm Juliette.
I'm a friend of Okwe's.

828
01:16:08,967 --> 01:16:11,762
He said that you needed these.

829
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:20,622
So, he did not care enough
to bring them himself.

830
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,632
Oh, Okwe's an angel.

831
01:16:33,933 --> 01:16:37,024
There.
Never happened.

832
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:45,998
So, what did happen?

833
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:56,026
Before, I was a virgin.

834
01:16:56,099 --> 01:16:58,099
Jesus.

835
01:16:58,099 --> 01:17:00,099
Mohammed.

836
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,958
What a pair.

837
01:17:13,032 --> 01:17:15,658
The virgin and the whore.

838
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,893
Boss?
- The doctor needs a good car.

839
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:32,189
Take it.
Last time, you were lucky.

840
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,899
Black is black.

841
01:17:56,932 --> 01:17:59,797
Wash these again.
Please.

842
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,027
Boil, boil, eh?
Hot, hot.

843
01:18:34,665 --> 01:18:36,723
Oh, dear.

844
01:18:38,965 --> 01:18:42,523
So this is how you do it right.

845
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:46,169
There can be no guarantee against E. Coli.

846
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:49,631
Wonderful.

847
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:50,899
Oh, yes.

848
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:53,055
No, no.

849
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:08,064
Passports.
It's something I do right.

850
01:19:20,732 --> 01:19:22,298
No parking.

851
01:19:22,398 --> 01:19:24,761
Okwe wants me to wait here.

852
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:29,855
I gave her a sedative an hour ago.

853
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:32,296
She's only in a deep sleep.

854
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:36,699
But now you are here, I can
administer the anesthetic.

855
01:19:36,799 --> 01:19:38,165
Now I'm here?

856
01:19:38,265 --> 01:19:41,065
You are going to be my
assistant, Señor Juan.

857
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:42,599
What the fuck is this?

858
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:45,499
I have noticed that if you
do not drink, your hands shake.

859
01:19:45,599 --> 01:19:46,966
When you pass me the scalpel,

860
01:19:47,066 --> 01:19:50,466
I do not want you to cut off my fingers.

861
01:19:54,066 --> 01:19:56,786
Where will they come to collect?

862
01:19:58,998 --> 01:20:01,631
If you faint,
I will have only half an hour...

863
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:03,831
...before the kidney begins to deteriorate.

864
01:20:03,931 --> 01:20:08,096
They come to the laundry bay.
Back of the kitchen.

865
01:20:09,165 --> 01:20:10,831
You better start.

866
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,797
Go and scrub your hands.

867
01:20:12,897 --> 01:20:17,556
Yes. Professional.

868
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:21,297
It's decided.

869
01:20:21,397 --> 01:20:23,761
It's fucking decided.

870
01:20:23,831 --> 01:20:27,763
You and me are going into business.

871
01:20:29,665 --> 01:20:32,256
You know washing dishes?

872
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:37,629
You know when you forget
on Friday and come in Monday,

873
01:20:37,698 --> 01:20:40,596
and there is a pan with sauce?

874
01:20:40,664 --> 01:20:42,030
White. Green.

875
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,097
Shit.

876
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:45,924
That is...

877
01:20:45,997 --> 01:20:49,055
How they do things in the city.

878
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,397
Jesus.

879
01:20:54,497 --> 01:20:57,224
Was I speaking English then?

880
01:20:57,297 --> 01:20:59,490
What you say?

881
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:03,394
Why do you say?

882
01:21:03,497 --> 01:21:05,497
Senay.

883
01:21:18,097 --> 01:21:20,364
I don't understand it,
how the ice will help.

884
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:21,897
Make you last longer, babe.

885
01:21:21,997 --> 01:21:24,997
I don't want to last longer.
It's not even payday.

886
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:27,655
All right.
Make you harder.

887
01:21:28,997 --> 01:21:33,077
Think what happens to water
when it freezes, huh?

888
01:21:33,997 --> 01:21:35,730
There.

889
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,564
Get a bucket.

890
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:39,664
Bucket?

891
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,187
Come on.

892
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:46,855
Okwe, you have removed kidneys before?

893
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:48,464
Many times.

894
01:21:48,564 --> 01:21:50,332
In pathology.

895
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:52,521
What is pathology?

896
01:21:52,597 --> 01:21:55,742
It means the patient is already dead.

897
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:59,878
Did he tell you things about me, Senay?

898
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:03,196
No.

899
01:22:10,296 --> 01:22:13,750
Let me wipe your brow, Doctor.

900
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:33,750
Juliette, put the ice
on the bed and put on the gown.

901
01:22:39,698 --> 01:22:41,430
Take the bag.

902
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:42,930
Squeeze.

903
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:45,030
Gently.

904
01:22:45,196 --> 01:22:47,236
We must go and scrub up.

905
01:22:54,163 --> 01:22:56,163
Cold tonight, huh?

906
01:22:58,897 --> 01:23:03,886
On the night like this,
who would want so much ice?

907
01:23:06,529 --> 01:23:09,360
You are Pylades.

908
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:11,263
Pylades was the boatman...

909
01:23:11,363 --> 01:23:15,096
...who ferried the souls
to the land of the dead.

910
01:23:15,196 --> 01:23:16,497
If you didn't put a coin...

911
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:18,762
...under the tongue of your dead relative,

912
01:23:18,862 --> 01:23:21,563
Pylades wouldn't take them to Hades...

913
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:25,743
...no matter how good you
had been in your life.

914
01:23:41,196 --> 01:23:43,196
Knife.

915
01:23:51,329 --> 01:23:52,796
Oh, Jesus.

916
01:23:52,896 --> 01:23:56,211
Juliette, you are not allowed to faint.

917
01:24:40,137 --> 01:24:41,137
Is that it, then?

918
01:24:41,237 --> 01:24:42,870
No, no.
I must sew him up.

919
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,970
Why?

920
01:24:46,703 --> 01:24:48,703
Fetch me stitches.

921
01:24:57,703 --> 01:25:00,870
Juliette, will you go and check
there is no one else waiting?

922
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,970
Yeah.

923
01:25:18,803 --> 01:25:21,167
Where's Señor Juan?

924
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:23,270
He's drunk.

925
01:25:48,136 --> 01:25:51,830
How come I've never
seen you people before?

926
01:25:51,903 --> 01:25:55,203
Because we are the people you do not see.

927
01:25:55,303 --> 01:25:57,970
We are the ones who drive your cabs.

928
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,093
We clean your rooms.

929
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:02,294
And suck your cocks.

930
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:21,103
In one hour, call an ambulance.

931
01:26:21,203 --> 01:26:23,328
Send them up to Room 510.

932
01:26:23,336 --> 01:26:25,336
Juliette.

933
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,236
Thank you.

934
01:26:27,336 --> 01:26:29,103
Shh.
It's okay.

935
01:26:29,203 --> 01:26:31,226
One hour.
- Okay.

936
01:26:42,403 --> 01:26:45,665
Handa?
Handa, it's me... Senay.

937
01:26:45,736 --> 01:26:47,670
You hear how good my English is?

938
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,236
I'm coming to New York.

939
01:26:49,336 --> 01:26:52,236
I'm coming to New York.
I'm coming to New York.

940
01:26:52,336 --> 01:26:54,703
My hands are shaking.
- So are mine.

941
01:26:54,803 --> 01:26:56,403
I don't have a driver's license.

942
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:58,402
Hey. It's dead.

943
01:26:58,502 --> 01:26:59,936
It's the tunnel.

944
01:27:00,036 --> 01:27:02,236
I must tell her what time we land.

945
01:27:02,336 --> 01:27:04,403
Senay, what Sneaky told you was true.

946
01:27:04,503 --> 01:27:06,002
He did not tell me anything.

947
01:27:06,102 --> 01:27:09,202
I did not kill my wife myself,
but still it was my fault.

948
01:27:09,302 --> 01:27:12,170
I was a pathologist in Lagos.
- Now we are someone new.

949
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:14,036
A government official was shot.

950
01:27:14,136 --> 01:27:16,235
I was told to destroy the evidence.

951
01:27:16,335 --> 01:27:19,103
When I refused,
my house was firebombed.

952
01:27:19,203 --> 01:27:21,328
My wife was still inside.

953
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:25,399
The police charged me with her murder.

954
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:30,066
I had to run.

955
01:27:30,135 --> 01:27:32,328
But my daughter stayed.

956
01:27:32,402 --> 01:27:36,767
Valerie.
She's with my sister in Lagos.

957
01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:39,565
How old is she?

958
01:27:40,136 --> 01:27:42,363
7.

959
01:27:43,169 --> 01:27:45,169
I must go to her.

960
01:28:31,502 --> 01:28:33,661
Tell me about Lagos.

961
01:28:33,735 --> 01:28:36,859
Do they have hotels that need maids?

962
01:28:38,536 --> 01:28:40,036
When you arrive at the airport,

963
01:28:40,136 --> 01:28:44,033
you will see a whole line of yellow cabs.

964
01:28:44,101 --> 01:28:47,331
The car will take you across a bridge.

965
01:28:47,336 --> 01:28:50,135
When you have crossed the river,
you will see...

966
01:28:50,235 --> 01:28:52,395
...lights in the trees.

967
01:28:53,235 --> 01:28:55,565
Policemen on white horses.

968
01:28:55,635 --> 01:28:57,635
No.

969
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:02,858
I know that it won't be like that.

970
01:29:06,734 --> 01:29:08,734
Goodbye, Okwe.

971
01:29:24,634 --> 01:29:26,862
Senay.

972
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:31,235
Hold me.

973
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:37,396
You must go.
Isabella.

974
01:29:37,467 --> 01:29:40,092
Always we must hide.

975
01:29:46,268 --> 01:29:49,583
This is the café where my cousin works.

976
01:30:57,301 --> 01:30:59,789
I love you.

977
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,300
Hello?

978
01:32:01,999 --> 01:32:03,999
Valerie.

979
01:32:07,067 --> 01:32:09,067
Yes, it's me.

980
01:32:11,867 --> 01:32:13,867
At last.

981
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,630
I'm coming home.
