1
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,893
Tell me when you're gonna come.

2
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:56,283
- Are you coming? You're coming?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,814
Hello.

4
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,193
Hey, bro, what's up?

5
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,948
I'm crashed out.

6
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,121
What are you doing?

7
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,335
What party?
What are you talking about?

8
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,839
Are you fucking kidding me?

9
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,842
Are you fucking kidding me?

10
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,386
Where?

11
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,305
Fuck!

12
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,310
Fuck!

13
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,814
The number you have reached has
been disconnected. If you feel you...

14
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,900
No fucking way!

15
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,839
Where's the phone? Payphone.

16
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:02,261
Straight to the back,
past the bathrooms, on the left.

17
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,811
Hey, Mallory.

18
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,439
Oh, hey, Syd, what's up?

19
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,825
You gonna go
to Becca's thing tonight?

20
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,829
Yeah, you know, I was gonna go
and say goodbye.

21
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:29,830
Why, you going?

22
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,834
Yeah, I think so.
Thinking about it. Yeah.

23
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,837
So you still talk to London?

24
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,841
Yeah, you know,
here and there. Why?

25
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:46,847
Oh, you know, I was just a little
surprised to hear she was moving.

26
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,850
Did she get a place out there?
Is she staying with somebody?

27
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,853
She didn't tell you where
she was staying? Come on, Mal.

28
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,814
I mean, she said something
about moving in with her boyfriend...

29
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,818
...or something, but, I mean,
that's pretty much all I know.

30
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,820
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah.

31
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,823
Can I have a vodka? A large one.

32
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,826
Naked, please.

33
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,627
Excuse me. One second here.

34
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,838
Here you go.

35
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,842
Thanks. Hey, look, I didn't...
I didn't mean to be rude.

36
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,595
It's okay.

37
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,848
- Hey, Syd, I gotta go cash out, so...
- Yeah.

38
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,850
- See you tonight.
- Yeah.

39
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,812
Listen, I'm gonna get a bit of sniff,
so if you want some, just let me know.

40
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,814
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

41
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,816
How much is it?

42
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,818
Oh, no, don't worry. Just find me.

43
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,821
Don't tell London.
You know she hates that shit.

44
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,823
Yeah, like I'm gonna say something.

45
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,162
- All right, well, see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

46
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:05,843
Your name wouldn't happen
to be Bateman, would it?

47
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,846
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Hey. Syd.

48
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,848
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming down.

49
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,851
I know you don't deliver this far down.
I just had a shitty day.

50
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,854
I have to clear my head out.

51
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,814
No worries, mate.

52
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,816
So where do you wanna do this?

53
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,819
We don't want to go in the bathroom.
It's horrendous in there.

54
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,781
I drove. You wanna use my car?

55
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,076
Your car? Why not?

56
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,836
So how is this shit? It's pretty good?

57
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,839
Can't say I've sampled
any of this batch...

58
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:48,844
...but considering the source,
I imagine it to be pretty clean, yeah.

59
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,849
So is this like a full-time gig for you?
A full-time job?

60
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,851
No, mate, I'm a banker.

61
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,853
Foreign exchange dealer.
Currency trader.

62
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,815
- Currency trader?
- Euros, pounds, arbitrage, yeah.

63
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,817
Okay, so you're not a dealer.

64
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,820
Mate, I ain't a fucking dealer.

65
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,822
Strictly a buyer.

66
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,825
I was uptown, you were on my way.
It's just a favor.

67
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:17,456
Gotcha. Well, whatever it is,
I really appreciate it, man.

68
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,669
Here we go.

69
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,838
So a currency trader, huh?

70
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,840
How's the money in that, good?

71
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,843
Not if you get stuck on this shit, no.

72
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,847
Yeah, I know.
God, what a stupid fucking drug.

73
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,850
I don't know what you're doing after
this, if you got plans or anything...

74
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,812
...but a friend is having a party two
blocks from here, if you're interested.

75
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,815
No, thanks, mate,
but I've had a shit day, believe me.

76
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,818
I just figured, you know,
you came down this whole way.

77
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,820
It'll probably be pretty good.

78
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,822
What kind of party is it, exactly?

79
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,824
Actually, it's a...

80
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,288
It's a going-away party for this girl,
for my ex-chick.

81
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,835
But it'll be good, you know,
free booze, free food, hot chicks.

82
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:08,465
I really shouldn't. Thanks anyway.
I appreciate the offer.

83
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,848
Fuck it, Syd. I'm gonna go.
Take it easy.

84
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,850
Why are you gonna go?
Don't go. You just got here.

85
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,852
You walked all the way down here.
Why leave?

86
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,854
Because I've had a horrendous day.

87
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,816
I've decided not to go because I don't
want to meet a loft full of strangers.

88
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,819
- You enjoy yourself.
- Come in for five minutes.

89
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,821
- Get a drink.
- No, man. You go, fuck it.

90
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,823
What do you got
that's better than this?

91
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,825
Girls, free booze, do a line.

92
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,828
I've just come out of the most
psychotic therapy session...

93
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,832
...l've had in fucking years.
Almost smacked some cunt for a taxi.

94
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,834
I really don't know
if I'm ready for this shit.

95
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,838
Just come in for five minutes.
You don't like it, you can leave.

96
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,840
One fucking drink, bro.

97
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,842
Mallory will be here.

98
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,844
One drink?

99
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,097
One fucking drink.

100
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,854
- How you doing, man?
- Evening.

101
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,814
- What is it, 5011?
- Yes.

102
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,692
Thanks, man.

103
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,821
- Hey, Maya.
- Hi, Syd.

104
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,823
- How you doing?
- Good.

105
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,826
- It's been a while.
- Yeah. How you doing?

106
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,828
I'm good.
Bateman, this is Maya. Sorry.

107
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,831
- Maya, Bateman.
- Nice to meet you.

108
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,834
How you been?
What you been up to?

109
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:31,548
In hell, man. I fucked up on the SATs,
I gotta retake them.

110
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,842
- That's it, you know?
- Right.

111
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,763
Just wanna kill myself. Yeah.

112
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,817
Well, you know, if you want to get out
of SAT mode, I picked up a lot of:

113
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,820
- You know, so...
- Are you dealing now?

114
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,825
Yes, I'm dealing. No, I'm not dealing.
I got more than I need, so if you're...

115
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,827
- All right, man, thanks.
- Just come find me.

116
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,707
- I might take you up on that.
- Did anybody...?

117
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,845
Coming.

118
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,848
- Hello.
- Hello.

119
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,849
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?

120
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,853
- I'm good. Hey, Syd, how are you?
- This, my darling, is for you.

121
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,813
Oh, you guys, shut up. Thank you.

122
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,817
- You know you are the best.
- Nobody's here yet.

123
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,819
Grab a drink.
Make yourself at home.

124
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,821
Hello? Syd and London.

125
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:39,825
- Don't disrespect them in public.
- In public.

126
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,827
Let's go upstairs.

127
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,205
Why? Who's upstairs?

128
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:49,126
Very bad. Catch me.

129
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,775
You're crazy.

130
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,822
What is this?

131
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,783
It's for you.

132
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,537
- For me? For me?
- For you.

133
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,838
Oh, my God, Syd, I love it.

134
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,591
Thank you.

135
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,682
I love you.

136
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,688
I love you.

137
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,821
Come on, "I love you too, London,"
you fucker.

138
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,823
You can say it.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

139
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,825
- London, don't.
- What? What am I doing?

140
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,827
- This.
- What am I doing wrong?

141
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,832
Whatever this is, this obsession
to put a verbal label on everything.

142
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,835
- It's not about words.
- No, it is about words.

143
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,838
Because if we didn't have words,
we'd be living in caves...

144
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,840
...and still talking with our hands.
- Stop.

145
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,842
We haven't even
come close to a fight.

146
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,845
If we can avoid that first fight,
by theory we'll never fight.

147
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,847
Okay? Please.

148
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,849
It's been so perfect till now.
Don't do this.

149
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,853
It's been perfect for you. For you.

150
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,438
London.

151
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,822
Coming.

152
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:46,201
Wait a minute,
someone's at the door.

153
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,829
- Hello.
- Hi.

154
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,831
Wow, you look beautiful.

155
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,833
You look hot.
Nice hat, nice boots.

156
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,835
Thanks.

157
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,088
- Hey.
- Hey, Becca.

158
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,843
- Rebecca.
- Bateman. Friend of Syd's.

159
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,845
- Nice to meet you.
- Nobody's here yet, guys.

160
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:09,725
So just come on in
and make yourself at home.

161
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,815
Okay, so you're not gonna believe
who's just fucking shown up.

162
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,817
Great party, mate.

163
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:22,821
Oh, it'll be better. It'll be better.
Trust me. I promise you.

164
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,200
Okay, I've gotta go.

165
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,829
Please tell me
you did not bring Syd here.

166
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,831
Oh, my God, I just rode up
in the elevator with him.

167
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:37,711
- Why? He's not invited?
- He's so not invited.

168
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,839
He's fucking touching
my Buddha's head.

169
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:41,840
Hey, London, it's me.

170
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:46,845
Give me a call as soon
as you get this, okay? Okay, bye.

171
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,847
Fuck it.

172
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:53,852
Hey, Syd. Do us a favor, yeah?
Don't touch the Buddha.

173
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,812
Okay?

174
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,815
He's a fucking cocksucker.

175
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,817
Where did you get your hat?

176
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,196
It's so cute on you.

177
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,704
He's fucked.

178
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:18,669
To show up at someone's party.
He isn't even fucking invited.

179
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,849
Did they just go upstairs?

180
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,978
Right. Nice. Nice of them to ask.

181
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,822
Wait, I'm confused, did you say
you do believe in God or you don't?

182
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:51,827
"God" might not be
the appropriate word for it, actually.

183
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:52,828
It's more of an epiphany.

184
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,830
Epiphany?
What was your epiphany?

185
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,833
Well, for me, an epiphany
is when you really see the universe...

186
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,835
...in all it's splendor and beauty...

187
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,838
...and you suddenly
understand everything.

188
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,840
- What does that mean?
- Fucking everything.

189
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,843
Everything you can imagine. You don't
know what "everything" means?

190
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,847
I know what it means. I don't know
what you mean by "everything."

191
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,850
It means everything, doesn't it?
You know, everything.

192
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,854
- So, what's your problem?
- For someone who's seen the infinite...

193
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,815
...you're vague. You'd think
with someone who's had a revelation...

194
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,818
...you'd be more specific.
- It's not about specifics.

195
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,822
It's an energy that hits you between
the eyes and you're enlightened.

196
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,824
- You see everything?
- You don't see everything.

197
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,827
You see nothing.
But you understand everything.

198
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,829
And you know what
got me the most?

199
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:41,585
- Is that I understood time horizons.
- What's a time horizon?

200
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,842
It's like this. I understood
where I stood in relation...

201
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,845
...to where the Romans and the Jews
were 2000 years ago...

202
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,847
...and why I was here now.

203
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,849
Then I felt this enormous
compassion...

204
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,853
...for the struggle of the human race
and what it had to go through for us.

205
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,814
You know, for life as we know it
to come to this point.

206
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,818
It's truly remarkable, but at the same
time, it's utterly fucking disturbing.

207
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,821
I mean, we're the same people
that were living in Roman times...

208
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,825
...throwing boiling oil on each other
and crucifying Christians.

209
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,829
Not that that's entirely a bad thing.

210
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,832
Hey, Syd, are you in there?
It's Maya.

211
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,834
Oh, fuck! Fuck me.

212
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,838
- Fuck, fuck. Give me one second.
- What the fuck have you done?

213
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,840
- Sorry. Fuck.
- You clumsy bastard.

214
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:32,094
- What have you fucking done?
- Shit.

215
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:33,846
Look at that.

216
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,848
It's covered in fucking beer.

217
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,850
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

218
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,852
What are you gonna do?

219
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,813
- Goddamn it, Syd.
- Instant karma.

220
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,814
- I got it.
- That's enough to give up blasphemy.

221
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,817
- Get up here.
- No, we can totally save this.

222
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,819
What are you gonna do,
eat food off the floor?

223
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,821
- Fucking gross.
- Do me a favor.

224
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,824
- God fucking damn it.
- God, is this it?

225
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,826
- Yes.
- Are you kidding?

226
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,829
- No, it's my fucking fault too.
- Just snort it off the floor.

227
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:05,127
You don't wanna do that. I shouldn't
have put it by the fucking sink.

228
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,135
What are you doing?

229
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,815
- What's that?
- As I said, all is not lost.

230
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:30,819
- Bateman, Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God, you fucking rock.

231
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,821
- Do you know this painting?
- No.

232
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,823
It's Van Gogh's
Wheatfield with Crows.

233
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,826
The most significant painting
the man's ever painted.

234
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,828
- Oh, well, then.
- Fuck, it's true.

235
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,830
That'll do for starters, won't it?

236
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,834
Look, this is the last painting
the man did before he killed himself.

237
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,838
It's his suicide note. He even put
his left ear in the fucking clouds.

238
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,841
There is his mutilated left ear.

239
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,845
Can you see it? Not everyone sees it,
of course, but there it is.

240
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,848
He mutilated his left ear
and put it in the fucking painting.

241
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,227
What does that mean?

242
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,816
Maya, I'm curious.
Do you believe in God?

243
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,819
You guys have been doing
too many drugs.

244
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,821
Answer the question. Yes or no?

245
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,824
God, that's a really long
conversation...

246
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,829
...but I will tell you something I read
the other day that freaked me out.

247
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,831
I don't remember where it was.

248
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,834
It was like Russia or Germany
or one of these places...

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,839
...but these scientists,
they took this pregnant rabbit...

250
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,842
...and they hooked up to,
like, a heart monitor and an EE G...

251
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,844
...which sensors your brain waves.

252
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,847
And, like, the second after she gives
birth, they take these babies...

253
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,851
...and they jump in a van
and they start shooting them...

254
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,854
...one by one in the back of the head
with, like, a.22 rifle.

255
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,814
From, like one mile away:

256
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,817
Five miles away:
Twenty miles away...

257
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,820
Don't tell me people are
killing little bunny rabbits.

258
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,823
What's so interesting
is that every time they'd shoot...

259
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,825
...one of these poor babies
in the back of the head...

260
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:03,829
...the mother's heartbeat
and brain waves would go crazy.

261
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:07,833
So I'm just saying there's,
you know, shit like that, and then...

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,836
The mother knew the babies
were getting shot...

263
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,839
Yes. Every fucking time. Exactly.

264
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,843
I mean, there's all that stuff, you know,
like those weird identical twins, right?

265
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,846
One of the brothers is
walking down the street...

266
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:25,309
...gets stabbed
by some serial killer.

267
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,854
Wait. So he gets stabbed, right?

268
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,816
And then 900 miles away,
at the exact same time...

269
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,819
...his twin brother falls down.

270
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,821
Weird, it's very weird, yes.

271
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,823
Do you want to let me finish
what I'm saying?

272
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,826
- Please, please, finish.
- Okay, he falls down.

273
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,828
Gets hospitalized
due to heart palpitations...

274
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,831
...at the same time
his brother was stabbed.

275
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,833
- Why are you shaking your head?
- You sound like London.

276
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,836
- It's coincidence.
- How is it a coincidence?

277
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,839
I've had this conversation before.
I'm not having it here.

278
00:20:56,006 --> 00:21:01,720
Well, then, let's not. Then don't
ask me about God, okay, Syd?

279
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,850
Hey, is London here yet?

280
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,852
No, I don't think so.

281
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,812
Did you meet her boyfriend?

282
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:15,067
Yeah, a couple of times. He's nice.

283
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,821
Is he, like, an attractive guy?
Is he good-looking?

284
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,826
Are you asking me
if he's an attractive guy?

285
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,828
I guess.

286
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,831
You guess?
What do you mean, you guess?

287
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,833
I mean, I guess.

288
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,837
All right, so I'm curious. Do you think
he's more or less attractive than me?

289
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,840
Syd, I don't know.

290
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:41,844
Well, you do know.
You just aren't telling me.

291
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,847
I don't know, Syd. You guys just...
You have totally different looks.

292
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,849
All right, yes.
We have very different looks.

293
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,853
But whose do you like more?
His or mine?

294
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,231
This is stupid, Syd.

295
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,817
Okay, fine.

296
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,820
I guess, on some level,
I find him attractive.

297
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,822
That doesn't mean that I find him...

298
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,827
...any more or less attractive
than I find you.

299
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,288
Okay?

300
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,832
I won't lie to you.
Just because we're going out...

301
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,834
...doesn't mean I'm gonna,
you know...

302
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:18,839
...suddenly not be attracted
to the opposite sex.

303
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:21,842
He's a friend
who happens to be attractive.

304
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,845
It was one lunch.
Why are you freaking out?

305
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,849
You don't see me going to lunch
with a bunch of attractive people.

306
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:33,854
Okay. First of all,
it was one guy, not a bunch.

307
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:38,817
And it's really not my problem that
you don't have female friends, is it?

308
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:44,406
Because no one's stopping you
from having female friends.

309
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,411
I love this, by the way.

310
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:56,835
- So for the sake of conversation...
- Syd.

311
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,838
- Let's just pretend you and I...
- Please, can we just drop it?

312
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,840
...don't know each other.
Just listen to me.

313
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,844
Let's pretend for five minutes
you don't know me, I don't know you.

314
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,846
Me and what's-his-name
are in the room.

315
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,849
- Who do you pick?
- I do know you, Syd.

316
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:11,850
Remove that from the equation.

317
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,853
- You can't.
- Gun to your head. Who do you pick?

318
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,815
I would pick you.
I would pick you in any equation.

319
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,817
Are you all right in there?

320
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:24,780
Everything is fine. Thank you.

321
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,826
Syd, literally, this has got to be one
of the most insane conversations...

322
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,829
...l've ever had with you.

323
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,831
I don't want to fuck him. I don't.

324
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,833
- Fuck him?
- It was one lunch.

325
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,835
Who said anything
about fucking him?

326
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,838
- I didn't say fucking, I said attracted.
- That's what you meant.

327
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,840
- It's not.
- Please keep your voice down.

328
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,842
I meant attracted, you said fuck.

329
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,846
Can you just fucking
shut the fuck up?

330
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:49,847
What do you want?

331
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:54,518
I want you to answer
the fucking question.

332
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,817
Syd, you're a cute guy. You are.
You really, really are, but I don't know.

333
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,820
He has this angular, sexy,
Diesel-ad thing going on.

334
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:06,822
But I don't even know him.

335
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,825
- So maybe he's an asshole.
- You know what?

336
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:12,828
Fuck you, Maya. If you were my friend,
you would've lied.

337
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,831
Syd. Syd, you are at
her going-away party.

338
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:17,833
If you don't calm down,
you'll drive me...

339
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,839
...and you, and everyone else,
and her at this fucking party crazy.

340
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,843
Just say goodbye and let her go,
because she's gone.

341
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,971
She's gone, man.

342
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,810
Line, anyone?

343
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,815
No. No, thank you.
But do you have a cigarette?

344
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,568
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:15,015
Light. I'm sorry.

346
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,815
All right, all right, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

347
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,818
- Are you leaving?
- Thank you. Thank you for everything.

348
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,820
- Really.
- Listen, do me a favor.

349
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,825
Don't tell London I'm doing blow
in here. That'll really screw me.

350
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,828
You know, Syd, yeah,
you know, I'll try to remember that.

351
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:39,540
Maya, I'm serious. Please?

352
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,843
Hey, please tell me you're not doing
coke in my parents' bathroom.

353
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,846
- What?
- I saw you go upstairs.

354
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,848
- Where did you go?
- To the bathroom.

355
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,851
Swear to God, you're not doing coke
in my parents' house.

356
00:25:59,017 --> 00:25:59,852
Oh, my God, I swear to God...

357
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,813
...l'm not doing coke
in your parents' house.

358
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,816
Okay, I'm sorry, darling.

359
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:10,320
All right.
Have a good time. I'm sorry.

360
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:17,828
How long were you two together?

361
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:22,457
Who? Me and London?
Two and a half years.

362
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,835
- You split when?
- Six months and a few days ago.

363
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,838
You're counting, Syd.
Not a good sign, mate.

364
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:31,508
Why? Why do you say that?

365
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,845
Joking.
I mean, what's the girl's name?

366
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,848
- Maya. Can I have one of those?
- Maya.

367
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,850
Maya.

368
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,852
I'd do some terrible things to her.

369
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:45,814
She's like an X-rated Barbie doll.

370
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,816
- How old is she?
- I don't know, like 16, 17.

371
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,569
Seventeen?

372
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:54,823
- Now I really wanna fuck her.
- You'd fuck a 17-year-old?

373
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,825
What, you wouldn't?

374
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,828
If it's not against the law,
what's the problem?

375
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,830
You can fuck a 15-year-old
in France.

376
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,832
Does that make them
all pedophiles?

377
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:07,836
Right situation, right country,
you'd fuck one too, believe you me.

378
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:11,840
Right, right. International waters,
deserted island, shit can happen.

379
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,843
But if any of my female friends
knew I fucked a 17-year-old...

380
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,846
...they'd lose it.
- What's the matter with you?

381
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,849
If we told women a tenth of
the things we think and do...

382
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:21,850
...do you think we'd ever get laid?

383
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:26,813
- Like when I asked a girl to piss on me.
- To piss on you?

384
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,816
Yes, mate, but I was on
a horrible amount of X at the time.

385
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,195
Did she piss on you?

386
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,824
Actually, no...

387
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,536
...she pissed in my mouth.

388
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,831
She pissed in your mouth?

389
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:47,835
It was not a pleasant experience,
believe me.

390
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,837
How the fuck does that happen?

391
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:53,841
What is the conversation that leads to
a girl having to piss in your mouth?

392
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,843
It was a fucking mistress.

393
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:00,305
- You paid an S & M chick?
- Many times.

394
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,850
"Many times."

395
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:06,854
Listen, it's an expensive hobby,
both mentally and financially.

396
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,316
So, what's the deal?
How does it work?

397
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,819
I don't know if I want
to go there, you know?

398
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:17,823
Come on, explain it. No one cares.
Did you get your shit wet? Me too.

399
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,827
It's my fucking Savile Row suit.
It's fucking 5 G's.

400
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:25,831
I've kept it out of the rain all day.
Look at the state of it.

401
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,833
Look, I don't wanna go there.
All right, Syd?

402
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,835
Come on. I'm not gonna tell.

403
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,838
- Why the fuck do you wanna know?
- How does it work?

404
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,841
- You just go over there?
- Look at you, you fucking dirtbag.

405
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,844
- You brought it up.
- You wanna go there...

406
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,847
...you fucking go there. Leave my
fucking demons to myself, mate.

407
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,849
- Where is it?
- Tribeca, you cunt.

408
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,853
Explain it. How does it work?
You just walk over?

409
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,813
Look, you phone from downstairs...

410
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,986
...and magically they let you in
through these enormous iron gates.

411
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:57,821
You get all excited.

412
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:03,285
You get all wrapped up.
You can't wait to get in there.

413
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,830
The whole thought of it just
gets amongst your fucking veins.

414
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,832
You're into it, you know?

415
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,834
All of a sudden,
they give you a form.

416
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,838
It's a five-page disclaimer
in fucking triplicate.

417
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,841
And you're like, "Hold on.
What is this? Paperwork?

418
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,843
I've come here
to get my dick sucked.

419
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,846
I didn't come here to sign forms."
It's hilarious.

420
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,849
You don't pay them,
you give them a fucking donation.

421
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:29,853
I mean, that is so American, isn't it?
Come on.

422
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,815
And then they give you a list and
a little pencil, like in the sushi bar.

423
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:38,820
You start checking off the
requirements. Whipping, spanking...

424
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:42,825
Come on, you fucking dirty
shit-cunt whore. Fucking whip me!

425
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,827
- Nipple clamps, coprophilia.

426
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,830
- What's coprophilia?
- When they shit on you.

427
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,832
Shit in your mouth.

428
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,835
You can have it in the mouth
or you can have it over a glass table.

429
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,839
Can you imagine? They fucking
wheel out a glass table and they just...

430
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,842
...shit all over it,
and you're just like:

431
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,844
"You dirty bitch!"

432
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,847
Who the fuck
asks for that fucking misery?

433
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,850
I hope not you.

434
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,228
Yeah, what about me?

435
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,815
Anyway, you know, there's a lot...
I mean, the list is long, mate.

436
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,818
- Infantilism, you've got...
- What's infantilism?

437
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,820
They make you a baby,
give you a bottle.

438
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:23,824
Put you in diapers, nurse you,
turn you into an infant.

439
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:27,828
I mean, it's the sickest,
most twisted place you'll ever go.

440
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:28,829
I mean, they claw your balls.

441
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,832
They'll tie your cock up
with a shoelace...

442
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:36,837
...stick truncheons up your ass.
It's twisted. It's fucking twisted.

443
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,840
But I'm telling you,
the moment you come...

444
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,843
The moment you come,
you are so sober.

445
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,513
I mean, so fucking sober.

446
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:50,851
You're like, "What have I just done?
What the fuck have I just done?

447
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,813
I've just paid $275
for some stranger...

448
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,816
...some chick I don't even know,
to, like, whip me...

449
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,819
...and piss on my head."

450
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,822
So where's the upside?
Why do you do it? I don't get it.

451
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:08,827
Well, on a physical level,
it can be rather pleasurable.

452
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:12,831
Psychologically... This is without
getting too deep here.

453
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:15,834
- I think it has a lot to do
with pain and self-flagellation...

454
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,837
...both literally and metaphorically.

455
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,840
I mean, I don't know whether
it's the culture or what...

456
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,843
...but the English, in general,
are very into pain and spanking.

457
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,845
The English? Really?

458
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,848
Yeah, you're always reading
some story in the papers...

459
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:34,853
...about some judge or vicar
bent over a hooker's knee.

460
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,814
I didn't know the English
were so fucked up.

461
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,816
Mate, the English are very...

462
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,529
...I mean, very fucked up.

463
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,826
Yeah, one sec.

464
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:54,873
Sweating like a fucking rapist.

465
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,836
Syd.

466
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,839
Come and have a look at the view.

467
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,843
Yeah. It's Mallory,
the girl from the bar. I'll hook you up.

468
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,845
- Come back in.
- Who?

469
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,847
Mallory. The girl from the bar.

470
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,849
- She's hot. I'll hook you up.
- No, no, mate, no.

471
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,852
I'm too... I'm wanked, mate.
I can't be fucking with girls.

472
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,854
So what? So am I.

473
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,815
I've been drinking this piss.
No, I can't, fuck it.

474
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,817
- I can't operate like this.
- Who cares?

475
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,819
- I'm fucking dizzy.
- She'll be in and out.

476
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,822
You help yourself to that,
I'm gonna leave.

477
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,824
- It's been a fucking pleasure.
- Don't leave.

478
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,827
Please don't fucking leave.
Go get a drink, come back.

479
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:33,829
- No, mate, no.
- Bateman, one fucking drink.

480
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:36,832
Come right back.
Work Mallory, she's hot.

481
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,834
Fuck you. A drink of what?
What do you want?

482
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,836
Anything. A bottle.
Jack, tequila, whiskey.

483
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:43,839
You're staying, though, right?

484
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,841
- One fucking drink.
- One fucking drink.

485
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:51,597
Fine, fine, just don't go anywhere.
You'll fucking thank me.

486
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,816
I haven't had a bump
in like three hours.

487
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,818
Bateman, this is my friend Mallory.

488
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,821
Mallory, this is Bateman.

489
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,823
Hey.

490
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,825
You're the guy from the bar, right?

491
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,827
Mallory, yeah?

492
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,829
Bateman.

493
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,831
Nice to meet you.

494
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,833
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

495
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,754
- What a clumsy idiot.
- Sorry.

496
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:26,840
Well, how do you guys
know each other?

497
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,842
A friend of a friend.

498
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,720
What friend?

499
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:35,849
I don't know, Mallory.
What's with the 20 Questions? Fuck.

500
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,852
Just asking. So, what,
are you leaving or something?

501
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,814
I'm just gonna grab us a drink
and then...

502
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:46,818
...l'm coming back.
Do you want one?

503
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,822
Sure, I'll have another one.

504
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,824
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Good.

505
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,786
I'll see you in a minute, Syd.

506
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,582
Damn, kid.

507
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:08,674
So how do you know that guy?

508
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,844
He got this blow. He's not
a dealer, he just knew the guy.

509
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,846
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Good guy, right?

510
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:16,849
- Yeah.
- Hey, you don't know if London's here.

511
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,851
Yeah, she got here like a minute ago.

512
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,854
What'd she say?
Does she know I'm here?

513
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,691
No. She didn't say anything.

514
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,827
I can't believe she's leaving tomorrow.
That's just so fucked up to me.

515
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:40,831
Well, instead of staying here all night,
why don't you go out and talk to her.

516
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:43,834
- I'm sure she'd love to talk to you.
- I doubt that.

517
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,837
Why wouldn't she wanna talk to you?
You guys in a fight?

518
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,840
A fight? Mallory, she hasn't
called me in two months.

519
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,843
I wasn't invited tonight.
Don't you think it's odd...

520
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,846
...she wouldn't tell me she's moving
across the fucking country?

521
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,848
- She didn't call you?
- No.

522
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:59,850
- That's fucked up.
- Didn't even leave a message.

523
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:03,854
- I know that girl better than anybody.
- When's the last time you talked?

524
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:07,816
- I don't know, two months.
- Really?

525
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:10,819
- I'm sure she was gonna call you.
- When? I just checked my messages.

526
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:15,824
- Is she gonna call me from LAX?
- Dude, I don't fucking know. Man.

527
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,577
Fucked up!

528
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,831
Hey, Syd, can I ask you
something personal?

529
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,833
What?

530
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,461
Well...

531
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:31,840
It's probably... I don't know if it's true,
that's obviously why I'm asking...

532
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:35,844
...and since we're cool and all,
I just figured... I'm kind of concerned.

533
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:39,848
But l... Anyway, I kind of heard that...

534
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,852
- What? Something about London?
- I heard... It's probably bullshit.

535
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,813
- But I heard you...
- What, Mallory? Spit it out. Fuck.

536
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,817
Dude, I kind of heard that
you tried to kill yourself.

537
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,822
- What? Who told you that? London?
- No, it wasn't London.

538
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,824
- Who told you that? Who?
- Dude, I don't know.

539
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,826
I don't even remember.

540
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,828
London's the only person
that knew about that.

541
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,831
So any way you heard it,
it's pretty fucked up.

542
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:08,836
- So, what? It's not true?
- No, it's not fucking true.

543
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,839
Dude, I don't get it.
What the fuck happened then?

544
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:16,844
You tell me what you heard happened,
then I'll tell you what really happened.

545
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,806
Just after this bump. Hold up.

546
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:22,850
All right. Okay.

547
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:26,854
I heard that, like, you guys had a fight
or something, and you broke out...

548
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,815
...she drove to your place,
found you unconscious...

549
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:33,819
...next to some sleeping pills, and you
had to get your stomach pumped.

550
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:37,823
Okay, now do you wanna know
what really happened?

551
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,825
Yeah. I mean, that's why I asked.

552
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:41,827
- You know my dog, Toker?
- Yeah.

553
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,829
- Yes, well, he's epileptic.
- Okay.

554
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:47,833
- So the vet prescribed phenobarbital.
- Pheno...? What the fuck is that?

555
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,836
They're barbiturates.
They're downers, for his fits.

556
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:55,841
Wait a minute. Your dog has epilepsy
and got prescribed...?

557
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:56,842
Let me finish. Anyway...

558
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:00,846
...it was our two-year anniversary
and she thought I'd forget.

559
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,849
- So...
- Syd, you always forget. Always.

560
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,560
Oh, fuck.

561
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:14,026
- I feel like such a bitch.
- Well, you are a bitch.

562
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:16,820
Open it.

563
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:19,948
- Open it.
- Okay.

564
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,670
Oh, my God.

565
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,840
This is so gorgeous. How did
you know I wanted this dress?

566
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:40,844
I saw you drooling all over it
last time we were at Valentino.

567
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,597
I love it!

568
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:47,351
Oh, it's so beautiful.

569
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:52,439
Thank you so much, baby.

570
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,822
There's more.

571
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,824
- What is that?
- It's a basketball.

572
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,869
What...? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

573
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,837
Hi, little guy. Hi, little guy.

574
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,548
Oh, baby.

575
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:22,845
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

576
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:27,766
Look at him.
I can't believe you did this. L...

577
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:31,353
Thank you. Okay. Okay.

578
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,815
Hello?

579
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:38,777
Hey. Can I just call you back?

580
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,821
No, I'm just
in the middle of something.

581
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,824
All right, bye.

582
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,827
- Who was that?
- It was Mallory.

583
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,997
Look at his paws.

584
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:59,840
- What? What is it? What's wrong?
- I heard a guy's voice on the phone.

585
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,843
What? Are you fucking crazy?
That was Mallory.

586
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,845
You swear to God?

587
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,223
Yes, I swear to God.

588
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,853
If you don't fucking believe me,
go ahead and call her.

589
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,608
Syd. Are you really gonna
fucking call her?

590
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,819
Yeah, is Mallory there?

591
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:23,822
This is London's boyfriend.
Who the fuck is this?

592
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:26,825
London, what the fuck is this?
Who was that? Why did you lie?

593
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:29,828
- Let me just explain.
- You better fucking explain.

594
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,831
What? Why did you lie?
Are you cheating on me?

595
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,833
No, no. Listen.

596
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,835
I was really fucked up.
I was out with the girls.

597
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,838
- Fucking perfect.
- Are you gonna let me explain?

598
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,840
Yes, yes, you better
fucking explain, London.

599
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:46,845
Okay, the clubs were closing, we went
back to Becca's boyfriend's loft.

600
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,848
I fucking passed out.
I wake up the next morning...

601
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,851
...and the guy... There was someone
lying in bed next to me.

602
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,853
Then he didn't try anything?

603
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,814
You're fucked up in his bed,
he didn't try anything.

604
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,816
I find that hard to believe.
And don't fucking lie to me.

605
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:03,821
If you fucking lie to me,
I'm walking out the fucking door.

606
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:06,824
He tried to kiss me. But there was
nothing because I pushed him away.

607
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,827
- It was not a big deal...
- Define "tried."

608
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:11,829
I wanna know
every single fucking detail.

609
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,832
Were you on or under the covers?
Was his hand on your tit?

610
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,835
No, Syd. He tries to kiss me
and I pushed him away.

611
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,838
- You pushed him away?
- Yes. I walked outside.

612
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,840
Mallory called me a cab,
and I went home.

613
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,842
If you went home,
why is he calling you?

614
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,845
- How does he have your number?
- I don't know.

615
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,848
Maybe Becca's boyfriend
gave him the number.

616
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,851
But I definitely didn't give it to him.

617
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:38,814
Nothing happened. I swear to God.
Don't you fucking believe me? Please.

618
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:39,815
I don't know what to believe.

619
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:42,818
You swore that was
Mallory on the phone...

620
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:44,820
...and it wasn't.
So, what the fuck?

621
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,823
We've dated for two years. I believed
everything you said until now.

622
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,825
Now I don't know
what the fuck to believe.

623
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,828
It's like your words are meaningless.

624
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,831
I just don't trust you anymore,
London.

625
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,833
I made a mistake.
I made a fucking huge mistake.

626
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,836
- I'm sorry.
- Lf it was one fucking mistake...

627
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:03,839
...why did you say
you were gonna call back?

628
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,841
Why would you tell a guy
who you don't know...

629
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,844
...whose number you don't have,
you're gonna call him back?

630
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,847
What the fuck is that?

631
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:15,851
So I took a couple
of Toker's phenobarbital.

632
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:18,854
Wait, you took
your dog's medication?

633
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:22,816
Phenobarbital is phenobarbital.
It doesn't matter if it was for my dog.

634
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:26,820
People have been taking it
recreationally for years.

635
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:27,821
Smoke that.

636
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,824
So wait a minute,
what does it do to you?

637
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:33,827
They make you feel good.
They're like downers.

638
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,829
- Okay.
- Anyway...

639
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,832
...I was pretty drunk
and I took like five or six of them.

640
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,835
- Five or six doggy downers?
- Toker's 50 pounds, he takes two.

641
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:45,839
- I'm 170, five or six seems pretty good.
- Shit.

642
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,842
The problem is that if you're drunk,
you can fall into a coma...

643
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,845
...if you're not careful.
- You went into a coma?

644
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,848
- What's wrong with you?
- No, I didn't go into a fucking coma.

645
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:57,851
London came back
to apologize or whatever.

646
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,562
Syd? Syd!

647
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:06,652
Syd! Somebody, please, help!

648
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:10,823
It's so fucked up. The fact she's telling
people that makes me so furious.

649
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,826
I would never do that to anyone.
It's just fucking rude.

650
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:16,829
- They never pumped your stomach?
- No, I went to the hospital.

651
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,832
I took a few coherency tests.
That's it. That's all.

652
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:23,836
Do you see how reality gets twisted
when little fucking girls gossip?

653
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:27,673
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess.

654
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,844
- What? Do you not believe me?
- No, of course I believe you, Syd.

655
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,848
That's why I asked. I was concerned.

656
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:37,850
Makes me so livid
that she's out there...

657
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:40,853
...telling people this warped version
of what happened.

658
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:44,815
You know what? Just please don't
go out there telling her I told you this.

659
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,817
That's the last thing you need.

660
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:49,820
The last thing I'm gonna do
is mention your name.

661
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,823
Well, honestly, if I were you, I wouldn't
even bring the shit up, okay?

662
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,826
It's her last night here.
Focus on something positive.

663
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:59,872
She don't wanna hear that shit.

664
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:03,292
Fuck.

665
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,836
What? What's wrong?

666
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:07,838
I don't know, I don't know.

667
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:11,842
Because I start sweating
and my heart starts pounding...

668
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,845
...and I feel like my head's spinning
and the world's crashing.

669
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:18,849
And I get pulled down,
further into, like, the darkest...

670
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:22,853
...meanest places of my brain,
and I start suffocating.

671
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,899
And you feel like you're dying.

672
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:32,529
What? What? Say something.

673
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:38,994
- What would you like me to say?
- Anything. Something. I don't care.

674
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:40,829
I can't be your crutch, Syd.

675
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:44,833
Oh, you are such a miserable
fucking human being.

676
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,835
Miserable in what way?

677
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,838
The way that you're sitting there,
taking my fucking money...

678
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:53,842
...and I'm dying. Nothing you do
helps me. The Prozac doesn't help.

679
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,846
The lithium doesn't help. The Zoloft
doesn't help. Nothing you do helps.

680
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:01,975
You're kind of a fucking asshole.

681
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,816
I just wanna fucking
turn the pain off, you know?

682
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:11,819
Just give me something that
the pain can go away with, you know?

683
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,239
Can you do that? Don?

684
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,828
I think you're doing great.

685
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,830
When that anxiety hits,
it's terrifying...

686
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:25,833
...because you're like,
"Maybe I'm really going crazy.

687
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:27,835
Maybe I've finally
fucked with my head enough...

688
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,837
...that I just detached from reality."
