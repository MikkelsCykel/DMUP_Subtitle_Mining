00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,984
<i>Did you ever meet Don Juan?</i>

2
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,211
<i>Never. Not once!</i>

3
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,289
<i>Then why are you in mourning?</i>
<i>Because I've never met him.</i>

4
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:56,021
It's amazing. I had no idea
my own funeral could be so delightful.

5
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,792
It certainly brought your career
to a happy end.
End?

6
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,459
<i>Leave off while they still</i>
<i>think of you as you were.</i>

7
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,900
<i>All these wrinkles,</i>
<i>these lines, these gray hairs.</i>

8
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,633
You'd spoil any party,
even a funeral.

9
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,142
No, no, no, my friend.
This is a great sight.

10
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,440
Women and women and women.

11
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,845
The eternal hunger
of women for love.

12
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,486
I pretty much
have all my stuff.

13
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,071
Looks like you got a love letter
from one of your other girlfriends.

14
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,573
I don't have
any other girlfriend, Sherry.
Come on!

15
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,544
All right. I get it.

16
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,780
No, you don't.
But it's okay.

17
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:55,342
That's the way you are.
You're never going to change.

18
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,424
I just don't think
I want to be with an-

19
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,322
an over-the-hill Don Juan
anymore.

20
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,755
What do you want, Sherry?

21
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,799
What do <i>you</i> want, Don?

22
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,597
I mean, I'm like your mistress,

23
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,763
except you're not even married.

24
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,803
L-Look at your friend Winston
next door.

25
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,038
It looks like
they're having a great time.

26
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,048
Don't you ever want
to have a family?

27
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,880
Well, is that what you want?

28
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,991
I don't know what I want,
but I just want to figure it out
by myself.

29
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,364
By yourself.

30
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,365
Yeah.

31
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,163
Maybe I'll call you sometime.

32
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,413
<i>Sherry?</i>

33
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,125
<i>What are you but a female?</i>
<i> Same as you!</i>

34
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,527
<i>Nobody asked you.</i>
<i>He never kissed you.</i>
<i>It was an impudent lie!</i>

35
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,099
<i> Yes, it was a lie.</i>
<i>Don Juan told me so himself.</i>
<i>It was only publicity.</i>

36
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,101
<i>He did not!</i>
<i>Don't you-</i>

37
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,330
<i>And who are you to give orders here?</i>
<i> Who am I?</i>

38
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,873
Don Juan said I was the girl
whose kiss he'd been seeking
on a thousand women's lips!

39
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,806
I was the only one. He'd never love
anybody else in his life!

40
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,277
<i>Ha! He loved you so much that he went</i>
<i>straight from you to another woman.</i>

41
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,814
<i>He loved me!</i>
<i>And loathed young women like you.</i>

42
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,577
<i>Cat!</i>
<i>Cow!</i>

43
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,016
Snake!
Pig!

44
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,484
Goat!
Weasel!

45
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,283
Worm!
No, no, no, no!

46
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,093
Yeah?

47
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,597
Hey, Winston.

48
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,666
You at work?

49
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,662
It's Saturday. Of course. Yeah.

50
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,911
No, I just got up.

51
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,543
What, you can't access the site?

52
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,624
Yeah. All right. I'll be right over.

53
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,730
Yes. Coffee would be good.

54
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,399
Will it be a cup
of Ethiopian coffee?

55
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,572
Okay.

56
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,934
Good morning.

57
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,976
<i>Morning, Don!</i>

58
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,783
Hey, you two.
Keep your eyes on the Cheerios.

59
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,525
How's the sweetest grape
on the vine?
I'm good.

60
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,997
Winston is in the back,
on his computer,

61
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,068
in his office.

62
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,534
<i>Irie.</i>

63
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,776
Thank you, Don.

64
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,878
What's up, Winston?
Hey, Don. Listen.
I can't seem to access this site.

65
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,047
l-I need your computer expertise.
Yeah? What is it?

66
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,888
It's like a whole system
for breaking down the plots
of detective fiction...

67
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,985
or the solution of crimes.

68
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,326
Y- Click.

69
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,162
Yes. You see?

70
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,634
And click. I tried before.

71
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,205
Stay calm.
Click. Uh-

72
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,535
Go get 'em, Sherlock.

73
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,576
Cool, cool, cool.

74
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,479
Oh, this is my kind
of information, man.

75
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,017
I love the Net.

76
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,817
The whole world of information-
through the wall, click.

77
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,223
You sure you don't want
a computer at your house?
No.

78
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,296
Seems awful strange to me.

79
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:43,061
A man who made all of his money
off of computers doesn't want
to have one in his house.

80
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,605
Oh!

81
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,366
Cool. Cool.
This is fascinating.

82
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,139
Supposedly, you can use this
to write a mystery novel...

83
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,442
or to solve
a complicated crime.

84
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,018
If-

85
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,246
Don.

86
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,254
You all right?

87
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,291
What?

88
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,396
Is something wrong?

89
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,167
Well, it's probably nothing.

90
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:20,227
Uh, a love letter
from one of your lovely ladies.

91
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,704
Something like that.

92
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,038
I'll read it to you.

93
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:32,516
"Dear Don, sometimes life
brings some strange surprises.

94
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,246
"It's been almost 20 years
since we've seen each other,

95
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,881
"but now there's something
I need to tell you.

96
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,654
"Years ago, after our story ended,

97
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,060
"I discovered I was pregnant.

98
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,931
"I decided to go through
with the pregnancy,
and I had a baby, a son.

99
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,003
"Your son.

100
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,130
"I decided to raise him by myself
because our time together...

101
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,072
"had come to a close.

102
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,611
"My son is now almost 19.

103
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,781
"He's somewhat shy and secretive,
unlike you,

104
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,251
"but a sensitive, wonderful person.

105
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,812
"A few days ago he left
on a mysterious road trip,

106
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:15,121
"but I'm almost certain
he's searching for his father.

107
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,923
"I've told him almost nothing about you,

108
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,625
"but he's resourceful and imaginative.

109
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,532
"Anyway, if this is, in fact,
your correct address,

110
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,571
well, I just felt
I should let you know."

111
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,976
There's no signature...

112
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,447
and no return address.

113
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,415
Hey, congratulations!
You're a father.

114
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,218
Uh, you're really upset by this.
C-Can I see it?

115
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,903
Your address is handwritten,

116
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,028
but printed.

117
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,470
Red ink on pink paper.

118
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,244
Typewriter.

119
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,045
<i>A red ribbon. Curious.</i>

120
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:17,782
"Dear Don, sometimes"-

121
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,790
Hmm.

122
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,892
Damn. This postmark
is too faint to read.
That's fucked up.

123
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,900
Tsk-tsk.

124
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:34,200
And you have no idea
who this is from?

125
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,604
Nope.

126
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,609
None.

127
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,838
But from all I know,

128
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,847
you are like, uh-
like Don Juan or something.

129
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,152
Don Juan.

130
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,224
I gotta go.

131
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,866
You want me to keep the letter
for forensic evidence or... clues?

132
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,096
Or- Don.

133
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,910
Hmm.

134
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,263
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

135
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,303
I see that.

136
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,011
It's kind of lonely in here, man.

137
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,285
Do you mind?

138
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,130
Is Sherry coming home?
No.

139
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,037
She left.

140
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,108
<i>What do you mean, "She left"?</i>
<i>She went on a trip?</i>

141
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,007
No. I mean, she left.

142
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,680
Sorry, man.

143
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,343
Yeah, me too. I think.

144
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,292
Well, but knowing Sherry,
she probably hasn't played
her last card yet. Right?

145
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,293
Probably not.

146
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,663
Anyway, you've never had trouble
finding interesting females.

147
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,326
I mean, uh, that's the way your life
has been though. Right?

148
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,801
You're like, uh- like Don Juan.

149
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,270
Winston, please stop saying that.

150
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,479
Hey.

151
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:02,111
About this letter-
I did examine the postmark
under my microscope.

152
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,748
<i>And it is too faint to read,</i>
<i>but the stamp-</i>

153
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,826
it's got on it a woodpecker.

154
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,192
<i>What does that mean to you?</i>
<i>Anything?</i>

155
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, what I think we should do...

156
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,432
is to narrow down the possibilities.

157
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,665
Winston, this is probably
someone playing a joke on me.

158
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,538
If not, then...

159
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,544
whatever.

160
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,112
It seems so unfair-
someone to write a letter like this...

161
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,344
and-and-and not sign it?

162
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,921
Don't you want to know
who is the mother of your son?

163
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,082
My hypothetical son?
No, Winston.

164
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,092
<i>I don't, okay?</i>

165
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,062
Okay.

166
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,031
Then we can just drop it.
<i>We can?</i>

167
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,125
We can, of course. Okay.

168
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,397
<i>Good.</i>
It's dropped.

169
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,225
But then how can you ignore
something like this?

170
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,786
- You need to treat this as a sign.
- What kind of sign?

171
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,866
<i>Of the direction of your life.</i>

172
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,435
Of this present moment.

173
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:28,438
<i>You need to solve this mystery...</i>

174
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,204
and find out which of your women it was
that you impregnated with your semen
20 years ago.

175
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,246
Winston.

176
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,919
<i>What happened to</i>
<i>that groovin' CD I burned for you?</i>

177
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,052
Here it is. Do you mind?

178
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,270
Ah, that's nice.
Ethiopian sounds.

179
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,433
It's good for the heart.

180
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,023
Look, come over tomorrow
for, uh, Sunday brunch,

181
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,289
and, uh, we'll talk a little further
about our investigative plan, huh?

182
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,364
So I'll leave that right there.

183
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,524
Go home
and leave me alone.

184
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,898
Okay, man. I love you too.

185
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,559
I think your father's real name
is Sam Spade.

186
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,066
My father isn't Sam Spade.

187
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,365
No? Think he's Sherlock Holmes?

188
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,905
No.

189
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,636
Well, I know he's one
of those famous detectives.
Mike Hammer!

190
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,871
No, not Mike Hammer.

191
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,977
Oh, I know.
He's that Dolemite guy. Right?

192
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,882
No, not Dolemite.
No?

193
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,152
He's down.

194
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,196
Keep your eyes open.
He may be Dolemite.
No!

195
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,236
Mona,

196
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,238
thank you.

197
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,242
That was so delicious.
You're welcome. Anytime.

198
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,277
Really?
Mm-hmm.

199
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,142
What time's dinner?

200
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,842
You are the most perfect woman
in the world.

201
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,078
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me tell you something.
That's mine.

202
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,280
Come, come, come.

203
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,653
No cigarettes.

204
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,929
That's where you get
your appetite.

205
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,003
Your woman cooks too good.

206
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,269
I'd like to look
at that pink letter again.
Let me see it.

207
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:21,312
I burned it last night-
microwave.
Yes, little Rita?

208
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,471
Papa, you're smoking again.

209
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,040
No, no, no. This is just herbs.
It's just a little Cheeba. Hmm?

210
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,120
Let me see that.

211
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,728
He's right.
It's just <i>cannabis sativa.</i>

212
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,796
You see?
Just a little indigo, baby.

213
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,333
'Cause Mama says,
"No more smoking tobacco anymore."

214
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,766
Yeah, I know.
I gave it up.
Never!

215
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,703
Never!
No more tobacco. I promise.
Okay.

216
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,847
Come, come, come, come.
Let me see this mysterious pink letter.

217
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,535
Okay. What you have to
do for me is make a list.

218
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,902
A list.

219
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,137
I need the possibilities
of who the mother might be.

220
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,374
You give me a list
of all your girlfriends
from back then,

221
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,780
and then I can plan everything.

222
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,981
Uh, I think I'm going home,
Sherlock.

223
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:42,219
Just destroy that letter
when you're through with it,
will you?

224
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,195
Work on that list.

225
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,108
Hello, Winston?

226
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,981
What list?

227
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,683
<i>No, haven't even thought about it.</i>

228
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,757
Are you on a cell phone?

229
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,489
Yeah. Is it okay if I run in
and grab that list?

230
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,226
Sure. Why not?
Great. Hold on a second.

231
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,473
Any other info
on where they might be?

232
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,840
Not really.
That's where they lived
or their families lived.

233
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,312
That's all I can remember.
Good. Cool.

234
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,781
Okay. Sorry about that.
It's okay.

235
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,855
Look, man. I'm all over this.

236
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,890
The day after tomorrow,
I'll have everything ready.

237
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,960
Knock yourself out.

238
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,320
Don, man,
my lunch break's almost over.
Sorry. What's up?

239
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,399
Look, I got all the info right here,
based on your list,

240
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,434
plus the whole plan.

241
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,172
You got addresses,
married names,

242
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,366
in some cases even their jobs.

243
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,443
I've got some sad news though.
What?

244
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,875
That girl named Michelle Pepe?

245
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,710
She died in a car accident...

246
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,716
<i>five years ago.</i>

247
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:24,551
I found the name of the cemetery
where she-well, where she is.

248
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,851
Little Michelle Pepe?

249
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,654
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

250
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,730
<i>But the other four-</i>
<i>I got all their info.</i>

251
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,734
Well, that's...
very impressive, Winston.

252
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,362
I really don't know
why you did all of this.
What am I supposed to do about it?

253
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,939
Look, your whole trip-
it's all planned.

254
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:46,441
Booked reservations, rental cars.
Everything you need.

255
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,447
- All you have to do
is give them the credit card.
- What are you talking about?

256
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,485
You go visit them.
You go to their houses.
You see them.

257
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,612
You bring flowers, pink flowers.
You're just checking in.

258
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,455
Just checking in.

259
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,326
<i>I even got maps.</i>
<i>Everything you need.</i>

260
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,867
And I burned you a new CD, see?

261
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,233
That's traveling music.
<i>That I'll take.</i>

262
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,200
Uh, just coffee, please, Avis.
Thank you.

263
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,835
A few tips though.
Dress conservative, a little classy.

264
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,847
Don't give anything away.

265
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,045
And always, always bring flowers.
Pink flowers.

266
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,122
<i>And look for clues about your son-</i>
<i>photographs, anything.</i>

267
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,885
<i>Or hints, like pink stationery</i>
<i>and red ink.</i>

268
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,461
<i>Handwriting, if possible.</i>
<i>And find that typewriter.</i>

269
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,757
Bring me that typewriter,

270
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,560
and then I can forensically
match the type...

271
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,567
to the letter.

272
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,399
You're insane, Winston.

273
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,339
Even if you could possibly
rope me into this nonsense,

274
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,377
which you can't,

275
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,606
I'm not a detective,
I'm not a private eye
in one of your crime novels.

276
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,447
Forget it. No fuckin' way.

277
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,785
What, after all the work I've done?
<i>Well, you do it.</i>

278
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,450
You take the trip.
I'll pay for it.

279
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,495
<i>Me? Impossible.</i>
<i>I've got three jobs and five kids.</i>

280
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,292
<i>And, besides, it's your life.</i>

281
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,835
I've merely prepared the strategy.

282
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,234
But only you can solve the mystery.

283
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,397
And why is that?

284
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,940
Because you understand women.

285
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,392
Let me ask you something.

286
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,020
Suppose I took
this ridiculous trip,

287
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,361
and say this kid really exists,

288
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,264
and he shows up...
while I'm gone.

289
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,837
Don, don't worry.
I'll monitor your house every day.

290
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,497
Yeah? Then what?
What do you do?
If he shows up?

291
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,973
He shows up.
Don't worry.
I apprehend him.

292
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:02,308
Oh, okay. Great.
You apprehend him.

293
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:06,976
Look, I've got seven minutes
before I'm due to punch in.

294
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:11,488
Tomorrow morning,
on my way to the plant,
I will drop you at the airport.

295
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,023
No problem.
I got you an early flight.

296
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,617
It's not gonna happen.
No way.

297
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,823
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning
at 7:00 a.m. sharp.

298
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,668
<i> My mom won't let me wear a bikini.</i>
<i> I can't believe your mom</i>
<i>let you come on this trip.</i>

299
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,738
<i>Oh, she doesn't know.</i>
<i>I mean, she knows, but she thinks</i>
<i>that I'm with your family.</i>

300
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,204
<i>No, she wouldn't have let me come,</i>
<i>and you would have been</i>
<i>totally mad at me.</i>

301
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,742
<i>What if she calls my mom?</i>
<i>She's not gonna call her.</i>
<i>She thinks that she's here.</i>

302
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,437
See, it's perfect.
No, it'll be fine. Don't worry.
Wait, wait, wait. What?

303
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:59,004
Don't even worry about it.
Do I need to call my mom? 'Cause
my mom will totally lie for you.

304
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,814
<i>I want to go to the party tonight,</i>
<i>and I really want to be able</i>
<i>to meet some cute guys.</i>

305
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:07,085
That guy is so cute
that's sitting behind me.
Can you see him?

306
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,955
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>He's really cute though.</i>
<i>Don't stare at him.</i>

307
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,029
<i>He is cute.</i>
<i>He looks like a supermodel.</i>

308
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,396
<i>No, he looks like the Calvin Klein model</i>
<i>that's on the side of the bus.</i>
<i>Oh, my gosh. He's so cool.</i>

309
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,959
<i>He's totally staring at us right now.</i>
<i>Think Ally will take us to get something</i>
<i>to eat before we go? I'm starving!</i>

310
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,834
<i>That's why you need</i>
<i>the mix-and-match</i>
<i>for when you get fat.</i>

311
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,568
<i>Oh, my God. I know!</i>
<i>We're such heifers.</i>
<i>You get the bigger sizes.</i>

312
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,008
<i>I look so fat.</i>
<i>Doughnut girl.</i>

313
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,055
<i>Look for clues,</i>

314
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,128
<i>like a typewriter,</i>
<i>like something pink.</i>

315
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,825
<i>This will be very easy.</i>

316
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,209
Hi, Laura. It's me, Don.
Remember me?

317
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,743
Hi. Who are you?

318
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:51,281
Don Johnston.
Really?

319
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,215
You're Don Johnson?
Yeah- No.

320
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,286
Johnston with a "T."
Oh.

321
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,481
Uh, does Laura Daniels,
who was formerly Laura Miller,
live here?

322
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,455
Yeah. That's my mom.

323
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,584
Well, I'm a very old friend of hers,

324
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,424
and I haven't seen her
in, um, in over-

325
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,499
Well, come on in.

326
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:19,543
So, my how’ll be home from work soon,
so just sit down. Here.

327
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,611
Make yourself comfortable.

328
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,812
So, my name's Lola.

329
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:32,515
Well, sometimes people call me Lo,
but my really real name is Lolita.

330
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,523
Lolita?

331
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,959
Yeah.

332
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:46,163
Well, l-I don't-
Do you want something?
'Cause we've got Popsicles.

333
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,202
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

334
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,436
<i>Lolita.</i>
Yeah?

335
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:58,210
Do you have
any brothers or sisters?
<i>Why?</i>

336
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,716
Do you think I need some?

337
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,482
Oh, wait, that's my phone.

338
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,889
Just-Just stay there.
I'll be right back, okay?

339
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,359
<i>Okay.</i>

340
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,953
That's so crazy.

341
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,428
Really?

342
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,294
<i>That's so sick.</i>

343
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,063
He didn't. Wait. Hold on.
My cell phone's ringing. Hello?

344
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:29,764
<i>Yeah. I know. I just talked to her.</i>

345
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,932
That's crazy, right?

346
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,976
<i>I know.</i>

347
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,231
Can I help you with something?

348
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,252
Donny, is that you?

349
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,588
Hey, Laura.

350
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,695
What are you doing here?

351
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,386
We're having chicken for dinner.

352
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,153
That was quite an outfit
you weren't wearing earlier.

353
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,659
Well, here we are.

354
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:24,218
<i>Then Larry exploded</i>
<i>in a ball of flames at the track.</i>

355
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,814
That happened,
and now it's just me and Lo.

356
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,466
It was even on TV.

357
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,138
I'm sorry.

358
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,135
Lo, your head looks
just like a pineapple.

359
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,044
- Mom!
- Doesn't it?

360
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,913
Yeah, it does look like a pineapple.

361
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,655
So, what, uh-

362
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,553
Where do you work?
Oh, Mom has her own business.
Right?

363
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,563
Yeah.
Really?

364
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,099
I'm a professional
closet organizer.

365
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,500
Come on.
No, I organize people's closets.

366
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,797
I even do their drawers.

367
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:21,241
I label everything.
I get them all organized.

368
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,609
I even color coordinate them.

369
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,172
Yeah.
And they pay her for that.
It's amazing.

370
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,117
- Hmm.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

371
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,187
Lolita, I said you- Lolita!

372
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,193
I said you could have a taste.

373
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:42,163
Now, come on.
That's enough of that.
That's not cool.

374
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,864
Lolita. Interesting choice
of name, Laura.

375
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,741
What?

376
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:59,078
<i>So, Donny, I heard you made it big</i>
<i>in business a few years ago?</i>

377
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,185
What are you into?

378
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,016
It was computers.
Oh, high-tech stuff.

379
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,191
More high tech
than pencils, I guess.

380
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,760
Mr. Fancy Pants!

381
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,399
<i>Yeah, my pants are fancy.</i>
<i>So what?</i>

382
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,796
So I see you're having
a yard sale?

383
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,240
Uh, you got me.
It's something we do
on Saturdays.

384
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,472
Yeah, Larry had all this crap
in the garage, and-

385
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,948
And then I got this neighbor
to paint a sign for us.

386
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,951
It's fun.

387
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,511
Are you gonna be selling
any old, uh, typewriters?

388
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,853
No.

389
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,427
Wh-
That's so 20th century.

390
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,461
Did you come all the way down here
to get a typewriter, Don?

391
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,065
What do you want a typewriter for?

392
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,474
An old friend asked me
if I would look around
for a typewriter.

393
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,170
So... I just remembered it.

394
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,085
Well-

395
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,950
You know,
I forgot to make dessert.

396
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,026
Oh, Don doesn't like Popsicles.

397
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,256
Donny.

398
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,333
What are you doing here?

399
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,969
I was just looking
for a typewriter.

400
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,165
Oh.

401
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,798
I remember.

402
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,087
Bye.

403
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,329
Hey.

404
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,872
Bye, Don.

405
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,474
Good-bye, Laura.

406
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,181
<i>Come back sometime.</i>

407
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,182
<i>See you, Laura.</i>

408
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,298
Lo! Go.
Put some clothes on.

409
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,872
Can I help you?
Dora?

410
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,504
Yes.

411
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,776
It's me, Don.

412
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,512
Remember me?

413
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,520
Oh, Don!

414
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,692
What-What are you doing here?

415
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,296
I brought these flowers.

416
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,737
So beautiful.

417
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,340
Wanna come in?

418
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,031
So,

419
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,162
what brings you out here?

420
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:39,441
Well, I was kind of in the area,
so I thought I'd drop in.

421
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,908
I see.

422
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:45,311
How- How did you
track me down, exactly?

423
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,713
Uh, on the computer.

424
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,786
They can do anything.

425
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,902
Nice place you've got here.

426
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,029
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>
<i>It's a nice example.</i>

427
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,163
My husband and I
are in real estate.

428
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,674
<i>We sell landscape lots...</i>

429
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:17,144
and preconstructed designer homes.

430
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,910
Or do you already have this information
from your computer?

431
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,145
<i>No.</i>

432
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,087
Your card is pink.

433
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,591
Yes.

434
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,390
Ron, my husband, thought it would be cute
if mine were pink and his blue.

435
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,539
I like those pearls.

436
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,812
<i>Did I give you those?</i>

437
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,686
I don't think so.

438
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,690
<i>I should have.</i>

439
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,566
It's very strange,
your showing up like this.

440
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,175
Yeah, it <i>is</i> strange.

441
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,112
It's my husband.

442
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,917
<i>Hey! Where's my perfect little wi-</i>

443
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,993
<i>Well, what have we here?</i>

444
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,931
Hi. Don Johnston.

445
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,997
I'm a really old
friend of Dora's.
Oh.

446
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,937
You don't look <i>really</i> old.
Just kinda old.

447
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,338
<i>I'm Ron.</i>

448
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,969
<i>Don Johnston.</i>
Mm-hmm.

449
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,014
That's an old flame of yours,
right, honey?

450
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,381
Don just dropped in
completely unexpectedly.

451
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:06,718
<i>Wow! Nice to meet you, Don.</i>

452
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,950
Ron and Don.

453
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,529
Hey, uh, is Don gonna stay
for dinner? I hope.

454
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,260
No. I really couldn't.

455
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,563
Well, sure you could.

456
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,434
Right? Honey?

457
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:38,148
<i>Computers, huh? Wow.</i>

458
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,746
<i>That's gotta be a lucrative field.</i>

459
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,018
Yeah, I've done pretty well.

460
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:47,495
Hmm. Well, the real estate biz
has been very good to us.

461
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,497
<i>Right, hon?</i>

462
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,397
At first I had the idea
of going into bottled water.

463
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:56,871
I think in the near future,
water will be worth more
than oil or gold.

464
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:01,967
<i>Yeah. You're dying of thirst,</i>
<i>you can't take a swig of oil.</i>

465
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,978
Right?

466
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,981
Or gold, for that matter.

467
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,814
Boy, you are certainly
right about that.

468
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,185
But for right now,

469
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,817
we decided that real estate
and quality prefab homes...

470
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,191
was the right way to go.

471
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,459
And it has been
quite lucrative.

472
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,837
Hon, those are
beautiful flowers.

473
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,876
Mmm.

474
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,143
Hey!

475
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,219
Don, I want to
show you something.
Excuse me.

476
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,763
Isn't this
the coolest photo?

477
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,663
Wow. Yeah.

478
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,703
Yeah?
This is crazy, right?

479
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,829
My straight little Dora.

480
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,742
My adorable little Dora.
Mmm.

481
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,246
Young hippie chick.

482
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:14,579
That is great, Ron.
Now, could you please
put it back?

483
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,652
Sorry, baby.

484
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,156
Probably brings back
one or two memories, huh, Don?

485
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,662
I took that photo,
didn't I?

486
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,666
Mm-hmm.

487
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,798
Well, you know, it's strange...

488
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,069
how people's lives change,
isn't it?

489
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,389
So, any kids?

490
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,525
Well, that's-
that's kind of a touchy subject.

491
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,624
See, I always wanted
to have kids with Dora.

492
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,135
You know,
I mean, kids of our own.

493
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:12,674
<i>But she didn't, really,</i>
<i>so I respect that.</i>

494
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:17,406
Oh, I don't know if I would have
had the time and patience
to be a good mother...

495
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,982
to- to Ron's children.

496
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,380
I'm just happy to have my Dora.

497
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,499
What about you, Don?

498
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,569
You married?

499
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,439
No, I'm still a bachelor.

500
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,275
A bachelor?

501
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,278
Wow.

502
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,577
But any kids?
He said he was still
a bachelor.

503
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,880
Well, honey, you know-

504
00:55:56,986 --> 00:56:00,387
You never know.
One or two could have gotten away.

505
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,259
No. No kids I know of.

506
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,820
Hello, Winston.

507
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,891
Just a crazy guess.

508
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,161
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing up here.

509
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,231
I'm gettin' nowhere.

510
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,935
Yeah, I saw her.

511
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,971
Yeah, I saw her too.

512
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,539
Yesterday.

513
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,370
No. No clues.

514
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,412
No typewriters.

515
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:11,085
Couldn't you have rented me,
like, a Porsche or some car
that I might really drive?

516
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:14,088
I'm a stalker in a Taurus.

517
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:21,095
I have done everything
that you wanted me to do, you know.

518
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,256
l-l-I've really had enough of this.

519
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,834
I think I oughta go back today.

520
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:31,006
Yeah, but l- I don't-
I don't think I wanna see her.

521
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,878
No, Winston-

522
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,445
Winston, let me-
let me talk to you later, okay?

523
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,782
Can I just-Yeah.

524
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,322
Let me talk to you later.
Please?

525
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,891
Okay? Thanks.

526
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,010
I'll talk to you in a while.
Okay?

527
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,162
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we're now on our final descent.</i>

528
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,631
<i>Please return to your seats</i>
<i>and make sure your seat belts</i>
<i>are securely fastened. Thank you.</i>

529
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,264
I heard what you said.

530
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,459
And I heard
what Dr. Markowski said.

531
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,504
<i>You have to believe</i>
<i>in yourself.</i>

532
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:24,630
<i>I have a lot of respect for you.</i>

533
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,072
<i>I understand how you feel.</i>

534
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:30,077
<i>I understand, and I'll try</i>
<i>to do better next time.</i>

535
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,079
Hi.

536
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:36,379
It takes a lot of courage
to say what you said.
I'm very proud of you.

537
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:40,388
<i>And I want you to know that</i>
<i>I think you're doing very, very well...</i>

538
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,515
<i>and I believe in you.</i>

539
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,185
Yeah, she definitely
speaks to iguanas.

540
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,629
<i>Okay. That's right.</i>

541
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:52,098
<i>Call back on Monday</i>
<i>and we'll happily schedule you and Iggy.</i>

542
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:55,170
Sure.
Mm-kay. Thank you.

543
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:59,807
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnston,
but Dr. Markowski
only takes appointments,

544
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,469
and she's in a session
right now.

545
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:04,808
Is your animal friend
with you?

546
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,815
Uh, no, l-l-I don't have
an animal friend.

547
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:11,683
I'm an old friend of Carm-
uh, Dr. Markowski's.

548
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,188
Um, Carmen has
a really tight schedule.

549
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,191
She may have a minute,
if you want to sit down.

550
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,420
Yeah, okay.

551
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:26,061
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Of course I won't forget you, Cleo.</i>

552
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,363
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

553
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,865
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>Dr. Markowski.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

554
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,459
- Bye now.
- Bye, Cleo.

555
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,538
See you next week,
Mrs. Dorston.

556
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,283
So, what do we have next?

557
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:58,555
Don?

558
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:09,137
So, you're an animal psychic?

559
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,207
No.
I'm a communicator.

560
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,708
And you're a doctor now?
Mmm.

561
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,841
When we were together,
you were so passionate
about becoming a lawyer.

562
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,918
I mean, you were...

563
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,320
very passionate.

564
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:30,153
Yeah, well,
passion's a funny thing.

565
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,661
<i>I have a doctorate</i>
<i>in animal behavior.</i>

566
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:38,427
But that was
sort of after the fact.

567
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,937
It's an odd story.

568
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,740
I'm getting into odd stories.

569
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:49,333
Well, I was a very successful lawyer.

570
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,347
I had no life, though,
outside my work,

571
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,111
except for my dog,
Winston.

572
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,889
Your dog's named Winston?

573
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,991
<i>Yes.</i>

574
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,993
<i>But then he died...</i>

575
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,063
suddenly.

576
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:12,499
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
It was, uh-

577
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,501
It was years ago.

578
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,902
But my new ability was this gift.

579
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,409
This gift from Winston.

580
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:42,056
All right,
you can come in again.

581
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,404
Anyway,

582
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,338
<i>after Winston died</i>
<i>I got this gift.</i>

583
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,841
<i>To-</i>

584
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,208
To read animals' minds?
<i>No. I told you-</i>

585
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,612
- No.
- I'm a communicator.

586
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,483
You see,
soon after Winston died...

587
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:10,317
I realized that I could
hear animals speak to me.

588
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:14,954
I mean, I certainly hadn't
been aware of that before.

589
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,191
And I don't
read animals' minds.

590
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,995
<i>But when they want</i>
<i>to communicate,</i>

591
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,662
<i>I can hear them.</i>

592
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,239
You know,
like you and I are talking.

593
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:28,538
<i>But we don't</i>
<i>read each other's minds.</i>

594
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:35,715
Is he saying something?

595
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,794
He says
you have a hidden agenda.

596
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:51,458
He- He said that?

597
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:56,104
I think you'd better
go back outside now, Ramon.

598
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,547
<i>Animals can tell us</i>
<i>what they want,</i>

599
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:10,608
but that doesn't mean
that that's what's best for them.

600
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,014
<i>Yes?</i>

601
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,695
Excuse me, Carmen,
but Mr. Renaldo and Skippy
are here for your next session.

602
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,697
Oh. Okay.

603
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,859
Um, give me
one more minute.

604
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:41,481
<i>Sorry, Don, but I really</i>
<i>can't keep Skippy waiting.</i>

605
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:46,988
Do you think you could tell Skippy
that you're just gonna walk me to my car?

606
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:53,327
How about later?
Wanna get a drink?

607
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,329
No. I don't drink.

608
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:57,331
Maybe get something to eat?

609
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:00,266
I don't, uh, eat.

610
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,104
You don't?

611
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,107
Uh, take a walk?

612
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:10,144
I know you walk.
I don't feel like it.

613
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,749
Do you have a typewriter?

614
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,819
A typewriter?

615
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,084
Are you married?

616
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:27,253
You know, I think you
should probably go now.

617
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,331
Oh, come on, Carmen.

618
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,027
Can't you answer me?
No.

619
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,303
"No," you won't answer me?

620
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:39,841
No, I'm not married.

621
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,878
I was though.

622
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:48,009
Any kids?

623
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,554
Yes.

624
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:57,249
<i>I have a daughter, Lianna.</i>
<i>She's 16.</i>

625
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,261
She's in Sweden.

626
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,422
Sweden.

627
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,864
Am I supposed to ask
about you?

628
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,903
<i>It seems like I've told you</i>
<i>my whole life story.</i>

629
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,904
<i>So-</i>
Me? No.

630
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,906
I'm not married.

631
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,942
<i>Of course you aren't.</i>

632
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:19,710
And I don't have any kids.

633
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,783
Do I?

634
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,955
How would I know that?

635
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:31,885
Sorry, Carmen, but Mr. Renaldo
and Skippy have been waiting
in the session room.

636
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,326
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.

637
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,398
Okay.

638
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,470
Well, my time is really up.

639
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,806
So, good-bye.

640
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,880
<i>Bye, Carmen.</i>

641
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:16,896
<i>Mr. Johnston?</i>
<i>You forgot your flowers.</i>

642
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,455
Hey. Excuse me!
Excuse me.

643
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:36,435
Excuse me. Uh, do you know
where Atwood Road is?

644
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,132
I'm lost.

645
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,744
Oh!

646
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,756
<i>Hey.</i>

647
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,053
Hey, it's okay.

648
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:08,796
It's okay.

649
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:11,731
Can I help you?

650
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,926
Does Penny live here?

651
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,004
Who's askin'?

652
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:21,933
I'm an old friend of Penny's.
Don. Don Johnston.

653
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,738
She's in the house.
Go around there. A screen door.

654
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,817
Thanks.

655
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:10,825
Penny?

656
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,637
Hello?

657
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:27,632
- Penny?
- Yeah?

658
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,019
Donny.

659
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:48,156
So, what the fuck
do <i>you</i> want, Donny?

660
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:52,461
Oh, I just thought I'd drop by.

661
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,535
Just checking in.

662
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,767
Well, I don't remember
any happy ending
between us, Don.

663
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:04,811
No... reconciliation,
nothing.

664
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,540
You left <i>me,</i> Penny.
Remember?

665
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,083
Yeah.

666
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,153
Very clearly.

667
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,958
So, what is it you wanted?

668
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,119
Everything okay over there, Pen?

669
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,897
Not sure yet!

670
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:26,901
Goddamn it.

671
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,300
What is it you wanted?

672
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,909
Penny, do you-

673
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,347
Do you have a son?

674
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:48,389
Fuck you, Donny!

675
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,959
Danny, grab that fucker.

676
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:04,938
<i>Penny!</i>

677
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,308
Shut up.

678
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,345
I didn't say anything.

679
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,268
What the hell's
your fuckin' problem?
I was just leaving.

680
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:38,770
No, what are you doing
upsetting Penny like that, huh?
I just needed to ask her a question.

681
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:41,775
Yeah, I know
you asked her a question.
Now, listen.

682
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:45,779
I just don't think
it's very sensitive of you...

683
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:48,815
comin' out here
to try to hurt Penny's feelings,

684
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:52,580
you know,
to get back at her or whatever.

685
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,290
That just seems so rude.

686
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,232
You said all pink, right?

687
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:28,809
<i>It's best that they're all pink, yeah.</i>

688
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:36,549
Oh, you're very good
at this.

689
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:39,711
That's beautiful.
Thanks.

690
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:41,721
Are you okay?

691
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:45,725
Uh, it was just
a minor misunderstanding.

692
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:48,694
Mind if I take a look?

693
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:55,166
<i>Oh. That's nasty.</i>

694
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,703
Did you even wash it?

695
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,331
Sort of.

696
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,343
Let me take care of it.

697
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:18,491
What's your name?

698
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:21,391
Sun. Sun Green.

699
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,726
Sun Green?

700
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,732
Perfect.

701
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,734
What's yours?

702
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,736
Don.
Don Johnston.

703
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:31,839
Really?

704
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,737
Don Johnson?
<i>Johnston.</i>

705
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,777
With a "T."

706
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:41,015
So...

707
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,221
if I continue down this road,

708
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,951
I will find
the Riverview Cemetery?

709
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:55,257
Yeah. You just go down the hill.
You'll see the entrance on your right.

710
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:03,863
Thank you, Sun Green.

711
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:05,939
You're welcome.

712
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,870
Hello, beautiful.

713
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,938
Red ink on pink paper.

714
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,931
I don't know what I want.

715
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:21,166
<i>He says you have a hidden agenda.</i>

716
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,243
Fuck you, Donny.

717
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,805
Circle Drive, please.
No rush.

718
01:28:10,985 --> 01:28:14,443
The wheel of fortune turns.
Round and round it goes.

719
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:16,648
Where it stops, no one knows.

720
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:23,530
Boy.

721
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:20,218
That's my report,
Sherlock.

722
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:23,290
The general outline
of what you put me through.

723
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,759
That's it?

724
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:31,230
And after all that,
you're still no closer to knowing
who's the mother of your son?

725
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:33,300
That's right.

726
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:36,993
But there was
that one typewriter.

727
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:39,572
And the pink motorcycle.

728
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,608
And it was Dora's pink,
uh, business card.

729
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,871
And-And-And Laura's
pink bathrobe.

730
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:48,415
I think this whole thing
is a farce, a fiasco.

731
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:51,543
As far as I know,

732
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:54,052
you may have written
that letter to me.

733
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:00,826
Look, I'm really sorry
that you got beat up and everything.

734
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:05,160
l-l-l-I feel that
it was somehow my fault.

735
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,234
It was.

736
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:12,068
Kind of strange, too, how, uh,

737
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:15,141
Carmen's magic dog
was named Winston.

738
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:20,245
Yeah-

739
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:23,442
Look, man, I really put
a lot of work into this thing.

740
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:27,453
I thought that it was
really important that you know
whether or not you had a son.

741
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:30,820
I mean, it's your life.
You got to live your life, right?

742
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,689
I <i>was</i> living my life,
Winston.

743
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:38,297
I still am.

744
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:41,493
What's this?
It's pink.

745
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,537
It's a note
I found in my foyer
when I got back.

746
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,699
Red ink on pink paper.

747
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:49,673
It's from Sherry.

748
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,677
What? From Sherry?

749
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:55,112
Why didn't you tell me?
May I see it?

750
01:30:55,216 --> 01:31:00,347
Envelope and paper
not exactly the same size.

751
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:04,753
You know, the handwriting...

752
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:08,818
seems pretty close
to the address on the envelope,
but I can't be sure.

753
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:13,133
Sherry still likes you.

754
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,864
You think that Sherry
could have sent the first letter...

755
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:22,203
and made the whole thing up
just to fuck with you?

756
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,244
Who knows?

757
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,680
You know, I've got to go.

758
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:31,809
I think I have just enough time
to stop home
and compare the handwriting...

759
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:34,945
and then hopefully
punch in at work on time.

760
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:37,889
You coming?
No.

761
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:42,152
I just need a little break
from all of this.

762
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:45,097
Look, don't worry.

763
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,066
We're still going to
solve this mystery.

764
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:42,488
Didn't I see you
at the airport last night?

765
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,649
I don't know.
Did you?

766
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:46,659
Yeah.

767
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:48,956
You on a road trip?

768
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,031
Yeah.
Something like that.

769
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:57,670
You look hungry.
Can I buy you a sandwich
or something?

770
01:32:57,772 --> 01:32:59,672
Uh, no, that's okay.

771
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:03,039
You can relax.
I'm not gay. I'm not a cop.

772
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:06,204
Just a guy who sees a guy
who might need a sandwich.

773
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,551
Okay. Thanks.

774
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:14,553
But could you get something to go?
I'd sorta rather stay outside.

775
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:16,555
Sure.

776
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:18,750
How about a nice
club sandwich?

777
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:20,827
I'm vegetarian.

778
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:23,988
You eat cheese?

779
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:26,896
Yeah, sometimes.
l-I like cheese.

780
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,703
Okay, I got it.
I'll be right back.

781
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:48,954
Thanks.
You're welcome.

782
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,688
Hey.

783
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:25,519
You found us a place.

784
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:27,719
All right.

785
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:33,328
Let's see here.

786
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,232
Big cheese and veggie sandwich...

787
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,304
with mushrooms.

788
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:42,107
Fries-
Mmm.

789
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,143
extra large.

790
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,750
Two waters.

791
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:54,621
Two coffees.

792
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:05,893
My mom put that there...

793
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,968
<i>for good luck.</i>

794
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:15,006
Thanks for the food.

795
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:17,407
Ahh.
No problem, chief.

796
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:23,717
You called me chief?

797
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,088
Yeah. Why?

798
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:35,862
What happened to your eye?

799
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:39,666
I, uh-

800
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:43,869
I ran into somebody.

801
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:46,472
Somebody's fist.

802
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,244
You a gangster?

803
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,245
No. I wish.

804
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:56,976
No, I was, uh-
I was in computers.

805
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,620
Computers and girls.

806
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:04,556
What about you, chief?

807
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:07,684
I'm interested
in, uh, philosophy.

808
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,932
Philosophy and girls.

809
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,004
Sounds pretty good.

810
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,707
Think so?

811
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:30,383
So, uh,

812
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:36,011
as just a guy
who gave another guy a sandwich,

813
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:43,219
you have any, like,
philosophical tips or anything...

814
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:48,093
for a guy on a kind of road trip?

815
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,661
You asking me?

816
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,208
Yeah.

817
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:58,277
Well-

818
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:04,479
The past is gone.

819
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:06,553
I know that.

820
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:10,584
The future...

821
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:12,750
isn't here yet,

822
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,828
whatever it's going to be.

823
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:18,263
So,

824
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:22,426
all there is is-
is this.

825
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,772
The present.

826
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:33,780
That's it.

827
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,118
Are you a Buddhist?

828
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:42,155
No. Are you?

829
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,659
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

830
01:37:47,094 --> 01:37:51,497
I'm sorry that's the best
I have to offer at the moment.

831
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,567
No, I appreciate it.

832
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:57,203
I like what you said.

833
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:01,806
It's better than some, like,

834
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:04,069
fatherly-sounding bullshit.

835
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:09,348
Is that...

836
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,577
what your father's like?

837
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:21,726
Ah, that's not a good subject.

838
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:24,730
Hey, I gotta go, man.
I'm sorry.

839
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:27,392
Thanks again
for the sandwich and stuff.

840
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:29,492
Hold on a second.
Wait.

841
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:35,533
I know you think
that I'm your father, don't you?

842
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:41,112
What?
Just tell me.
You can talk to me, chief.

843
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:43,479
Man, you're fucked up.

844
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,212
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Wait!

845
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:57,212
