1
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Hiya.

2
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,400
Arthur, it's Harry.

3
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I've been trying to get ahold
of you for three days.

4
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,000
- What's the matter?
- I gotta see you.

5
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Now. Please.

6
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
- One hour.
- Arthur, I've got big trouble.

7
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
It just doesn't
make any sense, Arthur.

8
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,000
They said I broke the agreement.

9
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Day before yesterday,
they stopped answering my calls.

10
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,800
What can I do?

11
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,800
Give 'em a call.
Say a few words on my behalf.

12
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,200
I wouldn't know who.

13
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,500
Why should they listen to me?
I'm no part of that.

14
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,000
No, but your father was.
A very important part.

15
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,500
His brains helped put the whole
thing together for 'em.

16
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,600
They still talk about him
like he was a patron saint.

17
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,100
You've got his name.

18
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,200
Please, Arthur?

19
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,500
It's all I've got.

20
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,600
Thanks.

21
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,300
Save it.

22
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
Come on outside.
Let's have a drink.

23
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,100
You know,
I've given a good many years.

24
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,400
Me and your father both.

25
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,200
How many friends you think
I got right now, huh?

26
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,500
What?

27
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,000
I was just thinkin'.
Remember that fishin' trip...

28
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,400
that you and me and your father
took up to Canada?

29
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
You was about eight, right?

30
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,100
Seven or eight.

31
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,400
You fell overboard.

32
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
You couldn't swim.

33
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,900
Your old man says,
"He'll learn pretty fast."

34
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,400
You were floppin' around.
You looked like a drowned rat.

35
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
But you didn't say a word.

36
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,300
You didn't yell for help
or nothin'.

37
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,900
You just kept lookin'
at your old man...

38
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,100
and he didn't make a move.

39
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Well, pretty soon
I had to reach out...

40
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,600
and grab you by the hair
and pull you in the boat.

41
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,600
You looked like a drowned rat.

42
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,300
Your old man,
he laughed like hell.

43
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,600
That was a long time ago.

44
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,900
Hey, what are you drinkin'?

45
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,800
We've got vodka...

46
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,900
we got scotch, bourbon.

47
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,900
Arthur, this is my son Steve.

48
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Steve, this is Mr. Bishop.

49
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,700
Hi. How are you?

50
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,200
I need some bread, Dad.

51
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,400
What are you talkin' about?
Why, just this morning I was...

52
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,100
I only need a thousand.

53
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Besides,
my asking you for money...

54
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,700
makes you feel
I'm dependent on you.

55
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,800
Kinda ties us together.

56
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Fast, huh?

57
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,300
Chromosomes will tell.

58
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,000
He's got a point.

59
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,200
My father gets uptight
when I ask him for money...

60
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,400
he steals from other people.

61
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,200
Steve, that's enough.

62
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,700
Don't get excited.
It's bad for you.

63
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,200
Nice to meet you.
Drop by any time, huh?

64
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,400
Any friend of Big Harry's...

65
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,400
I know you gotta go.

66
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm sorry about that.

67
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,300
Forget it.

68
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,900
I just don't understand him
anymore.

69
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
It's just so...

70
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,900
Well, call me
when you know something, OK?

71
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,500
OK.

72
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,800
Take care of yourself.

73
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
Arthur Bishop?

74
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
I have a special delivery.

75
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,300
Certified. Please sign here.

76
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,500
Mr. Bishop?

77
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,200
We would like you
to go ahead... anytime.

78
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
- Nothin' else, huh?
- Nothin' else.

79
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,300
You're to wait down there...

80
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,000
and I wait for you
at the top of the hill.

81
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Well, could you tell anything
by his voice?

82
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,100
I mean the tone?

83
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,500
Harry, stay loose.

84
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,300
Yeah, sure.

85
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,300
It's like you say, if they're
willin' to talk, well...

86
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,400
Harry, I'll be parked
right up there.

87
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,700
Say, don't you think that...

88
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
Hello?!

89
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,300
Well, I'm here!

90
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,000
Come on, let's talk.

91
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,300
You said we were gonna talk!

92
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,800
Harry, run to the car.

93
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,600
- It's a set-up.
- I can't!

94
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,700
I'll try to get behind him.

95
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,600
Run!

96
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,700
Oh, God.

97
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,500
I can't...

98
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Keep going!

99
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,000
I can't.

100
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,900
You?

101
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,400
This is it, huh?

102
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Finish it, Arthur.

103
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,000
You or me.

104
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,600
Finish it.

105
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,800
I had a feeling.

106
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,100
Can I come in?

107
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,100
Oh, my darling,
it's been so long.

108
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,500
I said I wasn't gonna do this.

109
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,600
I had it all worked out.

110
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,400
I go to the door,
there you are.

111
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,600
I smile, very poised,
as if I just saw you yesterday.

112
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,900
I'm sorry.

113
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
Nothing's changed.

114
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,800
It never does.

115
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,200
OK, I think
I've got it together.

116
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,600
You know...

117
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,200
I think you've lost some weight.

118
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
I wrote you a letter.

119
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,500
I couldn't mail it.

120
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,700
I didn't know where.

121
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,600
I keep movin' around.

122
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,200
It's true, you know.

123
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,500
I do always know
when you're near.

124
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,100
ESP.

125
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,800
Maybe.

126
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,800
What's the matter, baby?

127
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,400
Well, I've been here
about three minutes...

128
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
and you've managed about
one recrimination a minute.

129
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,500
I can't seem to feel anything
but hurt when you're not here.

130
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,800
I guess when I see you again,
I just have to hurt back.

131
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,600
Did you really
write me a letter?

132
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,400
"My dearest love...

133
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,900
"I'm once again alone."

134
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,200
I can't hear you.

135
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,600
"And the silence in this room...

136
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,000
"presses against my ears
until I'm deafened.

137
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
"This is the way I live
until I see you again...

138
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,100
"and then you're here
and there's no past.

139
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,400
"Only the two of us.

140
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,200
"I know these words hurt you...

141
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,100
"because you can't give
anything but the moment...

142
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,500
"but I have to write them now...

143
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,100
"because somehow my need
for you must find its voice.

144
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,700
"And you... what of your pain?

145
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,100
"If you could only
let me have...

146
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,300
"one small part
of the weight of it."

147
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,500
Don't read anymore.

148
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,300
Don't you see?

149
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,100
Even that would be a comfort
to me when you're not here.

150
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,900
Oh, my darling,
I love you so much. I can't...

151
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,600
Don't.
It's gonna be all right.

152
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh, baby, I love you.

153
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,600
Oh, my darling.

154
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,700
Darling, take us to bed.

155
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,100
Baby, I missed you.
I'm so glad you're here.

156
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,200
I love you.

157
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,400
It'll be a hundred more
this time.

158
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,000
The letter took me
a while to make up.

159
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,200
All right?

160
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,600
Yes. The letter was good.

161
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,700
Try to think of something
like it for next time.

162
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,000
OK, I will.

163
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,100
To his community and church...

164
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,200
he gave his resources,
his faith, and his spirit.

165
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,800
His good works comfort us
in the going.

166
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,800
We commit his remains
to your earth, O, Father...

167
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,700
and we pray you
vouchsafe him eternal life.

168
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,200
I've always been interested
in primitive rituals...

169
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,400
like tucking the dead away.

170
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,300
Glory be to the Father
and to the Son...

171
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,400
and to the Holy Spirit.

172
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,100
Glory be to the father,
Harry McKenna...

173
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
fixer extraordinaire...

174
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,700
pusher, pimp, thief, arsonist.

175
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
You liked him a lot?

176
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,200
Oh, yeah.
He was my kind of man.

177
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,500
What was your connection
with him?

178
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,400
He worked for my father
a long time back.

179
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,000
He thought I could
do him a favor.

180
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,200
So, your old man was in, huh?

181
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,400
And you?

182
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,000
Don't you think you should be...

183
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah, you got somethin' goin'.

184
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,400
You're pretty sure of yourself.

185
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,800
I live in my mind, Mr. Bishop.

186
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Sounds like something
I read someplace.

187
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
And so do you.

188
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,300
Could I have a ride home?

189
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Sure.

190
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,600
Amen.

191
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,500
Come on. Steve's got
the whole place outside.

192
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Good old Steve!

193
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,800
What are they celebrating?

194
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,300
Well, this is all mine now.

195
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,300
My father never really
liked my friends...

196
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,100
and I'm not so sure I do,
either.

197
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,700
Hey, we've got a call here
from Katmandu.

198
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,300
Hey, Katmandu's calling, Sam.

199
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Yes, I placed a call
to Sydney, Australia.

200
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,300
We got the White House.

201
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,200
Yes, I want to speak...

202
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,700
Yeah. No, listen, I live there.

203
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,000
I know he's there.

204
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's all in the bubbles.

205
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,200
Yeah, emergency.
I must speak to him. John Lenn...

206
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,300
Hey, Steve,
Louise is on the phone.

207
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,700
Sounds important, man.

208
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,300
- Afghanistan here.
- No, I didn't call Afghanistan.

209
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
- Hello, Louise?
- Are you with her?

210
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,600
- You don't love me.
- That kinda talk is foolish.

211
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,200
I'm gonna kill myself.
I wanna die.

212
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,300
- Louise, please.
- I do.

213
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,800
- Well, go ahead then.
- I will. You don't care.

214
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,200
Yeah, that's right.
I don't care.

215
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,700
Right...

216
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,300
My friends are so happy,
they're killing themselves.

217
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,000
Would you come along?

218
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
Who's he?

219
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,700
He's a friend of the family's.

220
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,200
I thought
you'd already started.

221
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,800
Oh, no.
I wanted you to watch.

222
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Now, let me see
if I've got everything.

223
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,600
Ice cubes, wine, razor blades.

224
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,000
How long does it take?

225
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
I don't know.

226
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,500
Sure you do.
You know everything.

227
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,400
Louise,
you called me because...

228
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,900
either you don't want to do it,
and you want me to stop you...

229
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,200
or you want to lay
the guilt of it on me...

230
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,800
and I'm not buying either one.

231
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,100
So go ahead on.

232
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,600
Hold on.

233
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,400
Mind if I have
a little wine first?

234
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
You son of a bitch.

235
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,400
Mr. Bishop?

236
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,100
Not for me, thanks.

237
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,700
You really don't believe.

238
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,500
Baby.

239
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,100
I call you baby because
your innocence touches me so.

240
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,200
Those really are sharp,
aren't they?

241
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,200
I always said
that you had guts, Louise.

242
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,600
About how long will it take?

243
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,800
Mr. Bishop?

244
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,700
How much do you weigh?

245
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,000
110.

246
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,500
Two and a half to three hours.

247
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,100
At first you'll get cold,
and then sleepy.

248
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,400
You're a son of a bitch, too.

249
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,300
Louise, I haven't had
anything to eat yet today.

250
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800
What you got in the fridge?

251
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,100
Thanks.

252
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,800
I know he'll stop me.

253
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
I know he will.

254
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,700
I know he feels something.

255
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I know you.

256
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,400
What?

257
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,800
I didn't hear you, baby.
What'd you say?

258
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,500
I said you'll stop it.

259
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,100
Listen.
If you don't care anything...

260
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,000
about your own life,
then why should I?

261
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,200
You do care. You do.

262
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,700
And you do, too.

263
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm cold.

264
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
I'm getting colder.

265
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,900
I'm cold.

266
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,400
Psychosomatic.

267
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,000
You've got an hour
and a half left.

268
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,400
Please, Steve.

269
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,100
I don't want to do it.

270
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,200
If you kick it...

271
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,000
you can probably make
the sheriff's station...

272
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,200
in Malibu
in about fifteen minutes.

273
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,400
Would you have let it happen?

274
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Would you?
Look, I was just an observer.

275
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
You haven't answered
my question.

276
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,000
Well, what do you think?

277
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,800
We'll never know, will we?

278
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,700
Well, say
that I just sat there...

279
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,700
or we just sat there
and watched her check out.

280
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,200
Think that
would have been crazy?

281
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,100
Irrational, maybe.

282
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,700
Is there anything wrong
with that?

283
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,600
It just means that you
have your own rule book.

284
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,400
I can dig that.

285
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,400
Is that so?

286
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,300
It takes a very special
kind of person...

287
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,900
to pick up the tab
for that kind of living.

288
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,000
You say you dig it,
but you're talkin' about...

289
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
something you really
know nothing about.

290
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,700
And you do?

291
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,100
Do I?

292
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,000
Very slippery.

293
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,800
When he's cornered, he answers
questions with questions.

294
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,200
What's your action, Mr. Bishop?

295
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,500
You've been watching
too many late movies.

296
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,300
Well, it's been interesting.

297
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,500
Thanks. Maybe another time.

298
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,100
The underwater feeding show...

299
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,500
by Marineland's staff diver
in the giant fish tank.

300
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,800
The giant fish tank
is to your left...

301
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,800
Next of kin?

302
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,600
None.

303
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Anybody we can notify?

304
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,500
How about an acquaintance?

305
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,700
Are you finished, doctor?

306
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,100
No, there's a charge.

307
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,400
You can take care of it at the
cashier's window one floor up.

308
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,900
I suggest that you make
an appointment with your doctor.

309
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,500
That is, if you have a doctor.

310
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,200
What do you think?

311
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,600
What'd you feel
before you passed out?

312
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,900
Couldn't get my breath.

313
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Palms sweating?

314
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,600
Nausea? Heart beating fast?

315
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Sounds like an A.R.

316
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Acute anxiety reaction.

317
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,100
Classic neurasthenic pattern.

318
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,500
See a doctor, Mr. Bishop.
Have some tests.

319
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,800
If they come back negative...

320
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,000
maybe you should think
about seeing a psychiatrist.

321
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,600
In the meantime, take these.

322
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,000
They'll help a little.

323
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,100
I need a signature, Doc.

324
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,100
Hey, you were really
out there for a while.

325
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,000
The cashier, you say,
is on the first floor?

326
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,800
Dr. Richmond
wanted in Emergency.

327
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,100
Watch your backs, please.

328
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,500
Thank you.

329
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,500
You waitin' for me?

330
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,800
How long you been here?

331
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,700
Since last night, about 12:00.

332
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,400
Must be important.

333
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,900
You said another time.

334
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I said maybe another time.

335
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,200
That's right.
That's what you said.

336
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,300
Come on in.

337
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,700
So this is what it looks like
inside your head, huh?

338
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,500
This place must've cost
some bread.

339
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,300
Are you still trying
to figure my action?

340
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,500
I inherited enough.

341
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,200
It is nice to be comfortable,
isn't it?

342
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,100
Is there something specific
you want to talk about?

343
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,600
No, I just...

344
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,700
Well, yeah, there is.

345
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,700
What happened the other night,
that was pretty far out...

346
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,200
and you were saying
some things about it.

347
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,600
So?

348
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,700
So, how 'bout some answers?

349
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,500
To what?

350
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,800
For openers,
suppose I say I think...

351
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,400
I'm the kind of person...

352
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,800
that can pick up the tab
for what happened?

353
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,700
What's the rest of it?

354
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,900
What makes you think
I can answer that?

355
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,400
You said that...

356
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,900
I said that you didn't know
anything about it.

357
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It doesn't mean I do.

358
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,500
Now you see him, now you don't.

359
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,300
Is my time up?

360
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,500
There is something
I have to do.

361
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,000
Can I come?

362
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,500
What do you want from me?

363
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's incredible.

364
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,700
Yeah. It keeps me sharp.

365
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,000
Balance,
problems of orientation...

366
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,900
sometimes you have
to think in reverse.

367
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,000
Here, you take it.

368
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
That's not bad.

369
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,900
How long you been flying?

370
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,500
About twenty seconds.

371
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,500
My father
was what they called a judge.

372
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,800
He would settle arguments
on the council...

373
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
and his word was final.

374
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,700
It was never questioned...

375
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,100
until one day
some hothead from Chicago...

376
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,800
took exception
to one of his decisions...

377
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,800
and put a contract on him.

378
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:35,300
The guy that got him
was a shooter from Topeka.

379
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,800
That was all.

380
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,300
How old were you then?

381
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,800
Your age.

382
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,600
Maybe younger.
I was still in school.

383
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,400
You find this interesting,
don't you?

384
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,900
Are you kidding?

385
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,900
My father used to do
front numbers even for me.

386
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,300
Like if he did that,
maybe it wouldn't rub off.

387
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,200
Never talk about that stuff.

388
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,600
He was beautiful.

389
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,300
Only trouble was,
I really wanted to dig it.

390
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,800
He wanted me to be
a part of his front, too.

391
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,800
So, what happened
after they burned your old man?

392
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,000
I finished school.

393
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,700
And?

394
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,900
That's all. Then I grew up.

395
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,800
Did your father ever tell you
anything about the operation...

396
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,000
like how it worked?

397
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,900
What's with those guys, anyway?

398
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,900
They all act
like they're ashamed.

399
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,700
My father wasn't ashamed.
He was the best.

400
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,500
Game.

401
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,700
You're pretty good.

402
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,100
- Play to win, do you?
- You know any other way?

403
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,100
Let's make it two out of three.

404
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,400
OK, but I'm telling you,
I'm genius at this game.

405
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,600
Yeah?
You go get the ball, genius.

406
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,900
What's going on?

407
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,200
That old man is Yamoto.

408
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,900
He's here from Japan,
where he's a master.

409
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,600
The other guy is Kori.

410
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,600
Very dangerous and very fast...

411
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,100
but he's got some new tricks...

412
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,600
that are sort of an insult
to the old style.

413
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,500
Yamoto thinks these tricks...

414
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,900
are useless
against a classic fighter...

415
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,500
and he's here
to prove his point.

416
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,900
The object of these fights is
total concentration and control.

417
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,100
They don't actually
hit each other...

418
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,300
otherwise one or the other
would be dead...

419
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,300
and that's against the law.

420
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,600
I thought he wasn't
supposed to hit him.

421
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,200
Probably
one of Kori's new tricks.

422
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,800
You haven't said three words
since the match.

423
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,200
He practically
murdered that guy.

424
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,200
Murder is only killing
without a license...

425
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
and everybody kills.

426
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Governments,
the military, the police.

427
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,900
Do you think
that Yamoto's a killer?

428
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,500
He's a killer who doesn't kill.

429
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,200
It's funny.

430
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,200
For him,
the rules are important.

431
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,900
That's your expert opinion?

432
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,200
That's my opinion.

433
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,100
OK. Don't get uptight.

434
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,200
- Not me.
- Bullshit.

435
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,900
Look, every time we're on this
subject, the same thing happens.

436
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
As long as we're rapping it out
on your terms...

437
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,700
everything's OK, but the minute
I have a question...

438
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
or I want to know
something specific from you...

439
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,700
you either shine me on
or go out for coffee.

440
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,600
What the hell is going on?

441
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
You're pressing pretty hard.

442
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,600
You'd better be damn sure
you want to know.

443
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,100
This is not
freshman philosophy time.

444
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,400
I'm sure.

445
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,300
You ever hear
the term "mechanic"...

446
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,300
used outside
of its normal meaning?

447
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,600
Where?

448
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,900
My father used it.
It's a dealer.

449
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,300
A guy who works game tables.

450
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,100
Anything else?

451
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,900
Sure. It's a shooter.

452
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,700
A hit man.

453
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,400
So?

454
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,000
So there we are.

455
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,400
And that's your action?

456
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,800
Yeah, that figures.

457
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
I'm telling you this...

458
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,300
because there are times
when I could use a backup.

459
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,200
Wouldn't have
to spread myself so thin.

460
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,700
And you seem
to have the aptitude.

461
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,400
You do this for money?

462
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,700
Money is paid,
but that's not the motive.

463
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:08,900
It has to do with standing
outside of it all on your own.

464
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,500
I'm gonna teach you all I can.

465
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,600
After that, you can choose
how you want it to go.

466
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,400
- You in?
- Do I have an alternative?

467
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,500
There are alternatives
to everything.

468
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,400
You've got a partner,
Mr. Bishop.

469
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,000
Associate.

470
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,700
Point the gun as though it were
an extension of your arm...

471
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,500
and keep both eyes open.

472
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,600
All right, you ready? Pull.

473
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,500
That's better. Much better.

474
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,800
Pull.

475
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,400
Winchester.

476
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,000
300 Magnum, 180 grains.

477
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,000
Muzzle velocity.

478
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,200
Pull!

479
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,900
3,070.

480
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,800
Drop at 200 yards.

481
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,100
Two minutes low. Pull!

482
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,500
300 yards.

483
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,700
Pull.

484
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,300
5.3 inches.

485
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,000
300 yards, 150 grains.

486
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
4.8 inches.

487
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,400
Pull.

488
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,800
Doubles.

489
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,600
Pull.

490
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,800
There are killers,
and there are killers.

491
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,100
To tell you the truth...

492
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,200
they all have
a different book of rules.

493
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,500
To get away with it
depends on the book of rules...

494
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,400
you have in your pocket
at the time.

495
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,700
Your own country,
somebody else's country...

496
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,200
or your own personal
book of rules.

497
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,700
All this... heroes.

498
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Half of them were killers.

499
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,100
Napoléon was one, you know?
Pancho Villa, Genghis Khan.

500
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,400
And then we have
our own domestic brand...

501
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,900
like Billy the Kid, Jesse James,
and John Dillinger.

502
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,200
Yeah, they're about as famous...

503
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,100
as our own
honest-to-goodness heroes.

504
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,300
Don't tell me
that's gonna make us heroes.

505
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,100
I wouldn't tell you
anything like that.

506
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,500
All I'm saying is that people
who stand outside the law...

507
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,000
oftentimes end up as heroes.

508
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,400
What's with that ball of wax
I see you squeezing?

509
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,900
Sometimes you have
to hold the mark.

510
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,500
It develops the strength.

511
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
"In the ages
between 45 and 64...

512
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,800
"of the total deaths
by accident...

513
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,600
"10,431 were from falls."

514
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,500
You know, falls from
high places are very clean.

515
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,300
What's that?

516
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,600
That is your first involvement.

517
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,600
Taking the Zoo Drive turnoff.

518
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,600
Now they're going west.

519
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,400
There's one camera.

520
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,600
Another.

521
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,200
Two cameras
covering the main gate.

522
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,500
You couldn't
get within 100 yards...

523
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,400
without tripping
that alarm system.

524
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,900
The guards sleep in shifts.

525
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,200
One of them awake all the time.

526
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,600
What about number one?

527
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,700
Midnight till 4:00
in the morning.

528
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,700
We need more.

529
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:06,000
We'll have to stay in closer
until we find something.

530
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,300
I want you to rent two cars,
a Ford and a Volkswagen.

531
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,700
This looks like
it might be something.

532
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,700
Turn this on.

533
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,700
Comes across the border
at 1 a.m.

534
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,800
I can have it to you
at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

535
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,000
How?

536
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,700
In a Chicken Lickin' truck
right to your place.

537
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,400
OK. You check the goods
when it comes, then wake me.

538
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,300
I'll make the test.

539
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,800
Better not be crap.

540
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,100
You know where to find me.

541
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,200
Well, they'll have
to turn off the alarm system...

542
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,600
to make that delivery.

543
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,200
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

544
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,900
One of the tools of the trade,
my friend.

545
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,500
Allied Plating. This is Frank.

546
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Listen, I've got a bumper
that needs re-chroming.

547
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,000
If I brought it in tomorrow,
can I pick it up by Saturday?

548
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,900
We don't work
on Saturday down here.

549
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,500
Monday afternoon the soonest.

550
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,200
Monday's all right.
I'll bring it in tonight.

551
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,300
Since there's no guard
on the weekends...

552
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,800
at the Allied Plating plant...

553
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,200
we could put the bodies
in these nitric acid tanks.

554
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,600
Mr. Bishop?

555
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,500
We would like you
to go ahead with this one.

556
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,900
We go.

557
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,300
I'm gonna check you for iron
before you go past here.

558
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,800
- Come on, get out.
- What's the matter?

559
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,100
Come on. Get out of there.

560
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,500
What the hell is this?

561
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,700
Chicken Lickin'.

562
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,100
Chicken Lickin'
is lickin' chicken.

563
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,600
Wise guy.

564
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,500
Get the bodies in the truck!

565
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,400
Do you know my dog
got a birthday card today?

566
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,900
I didn't. Just my dog.

567
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,600
Archibald, those kids
on the hill there...

568
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,500
how can you live here
with all that noise?

569
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,600
I called the police,
but there's nothing they can do.

570
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,700
Daddy, it's getting worse here
every weekend.

571
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,400
In forty-eight hours...

572
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,700
everything will be in solution.

573
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,200
It was...

574
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,600
What?

575
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,400
Well, it could've been
so simple...

576
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,100
but that guy
came out of nowhere.

577
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,100
Those things happen...

578
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,700
but remember it the next time.

579
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,300
Could you spare a few minutes,
Mr. Bishop?

580
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,600
Yes. When?

581
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,200
Now. I'm at home.

582
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,400
All right.

583
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
I have to do something
for a while.

584
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,000
I'll see you later.

585
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,500
Mr. Bishop is here, sir.

586
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,000
Show him through.

587
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,200
This way, sir.

588
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,500
That was very untidy,
Mr. Bishop.

589
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:06,200
We'd like to know how
Harry McKenna's son figures.

590
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,500
He'll be working with me
from now on.

591
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,800
You think this is wise?

592
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,500
You telling me
I need your permission?

593
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,200
Information is all I want,
Mr. Bishop.

594
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,400
We like to know things.

595
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,100
An organization survives
only because its members...

596
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,000
are willing to sacrifice
certain personal choices...

597
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,300
for the good of all.

598
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,100
A very democratic principle,
Mr. Bishop.

599
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,400
We survive
because we have this rule.

600
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,000
What you or I want
is unimportant.

601
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,000
Only the rule.

602
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,800
Someone trained by me
could be of value to you.

603
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,300
Nobody lives forever.

604
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,400
You take
full responsibility then?

605
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,900
This one has to be done fast.
Very fast.

606
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
I'll handle it
the way I always do.

607
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,500
There may not be
time enough for that.

608
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:43,100
The word is, he's getting ready
to talk to some people.

609
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:46,600
The problem is considerable.

610
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,600
I'm not some wild
Cleveland shooter.

611
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,600
I don't cowboy.

612
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,500
If he talks, things
could get complicated... sloppy.

613
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,900
That would disturb a lot of us.

614
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,200
It's not really open
to discussion, Mr. Bishop.

615
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,100
This business
of McKenna's son...

616
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,600
has upset
a few of our associates.

617
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,300
I understand it...

618
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,200
but these people
see it only from the outside.

619
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,200
A quick, clean job
would go a long way...

620
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,100
in putting everything
back into proper balance.

621
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,700
Yes, I understand.

622
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,600
I knew you would.

623
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,000
Your man's in Naples.

624
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,000
We've given you
a name in Rome...

625
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,300
for any equipment
you might need.

626
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,500
Good. You're still up.

627
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,900
I called you about 9:00.

628
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,900
Yeah, well,
Louise picked me up and we...

629
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,500
It's good for the nerves.
She has this thing she does...

630
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,900
Spare me the details.

631
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,500
Look, if I'd known
you wanted to work...

632
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,100
You are a free agent, my friend.
The only thing you have to do...

633
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:47,000
is fulfill the requirements
of the Association.

634
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,800
And that means
your occasional presence...

635
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,800
some intelligent responses,
some skill at your work...

636
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,100
and nothing more.

637
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,000
You've got that,
so what's buggin' you?

638
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,700
We got one, huh?

639
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,400
They want him to be cowboyed.

640
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,700
Explain.

641
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,200
They want me to get him now...

642
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,600
any way I can.

643
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,000
That doesn't sound very cool.

644
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,900
What are you gonna do
about that?

645
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,600
I'm too far along
to change my habits.

646
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,900
I'll do what I've always done...
in Italy.

647
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,100
Italy? Am I gonna go?

648
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,100
Why not?

649
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,800
Steve McKenna.

650
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,700
Mountain View Drive.

651
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,900
Age twenty-four.

652
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,600
Height...
five foot, eleven inches.

653
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,800
Weight... 165.

654
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,100
Right-handed.

655
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,200
Hair... blond.

656
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,500
Distinguishing marks...

657
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,400
small scar on right arm.

658
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,600
Interests... girls, freaks...

659
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,900
physical fitness...

660
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,000
fast cars...

661
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,500
and killing.

662
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,700
Just like the postcards.

663
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,400
Let's go to work.

664
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,500
What time?

665
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,400
It's 11:47.

666
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,900
Good?

667
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,200
Last time I had this
was ten years ago.

668
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,000
They make it right here,
you know...

669
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,300
But not enough to export.

670
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,800
Casa de fiori doesn't travel.

671
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,100
It's not bad.

672
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,100
Slowly.

673
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,900
The time you take
is very important.

674
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,500
Savor it.

675
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,200
Even what we're doing now.

676
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,700
See, you must
figure it carefully.

677
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,000
Don't rush.

678
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,500
Know every move, turn it
over and over in your mind...

679
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,600
until you're sure
there are no holes.

680
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,300
But you have to be
dead sure... or dead.

681
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,200
No second chances.

682
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,800
I'll try and remember that.

683
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Remember, don't try.

684
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,300
Dead sure... or dead.

685
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,800
The room's not going
to get any bigger.

686
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,500
I think I'll take a walk.
Is that all right with you?

687
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,600
What now?

688
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,900
It looks like
they're going south.

689
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,900
We could follow
on the Coast Road.

690
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,200
Excuse me, sir. Would you take
a picture of my wife and me?

691
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,500
Thank you.

692
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:28,500
It seems he doesn't do the same
thing the same way twice.

693
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:34,100
Except spend Friday
and Saturday night on that boat.

694
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,500
A diesel leak explosion
might be nice.

695
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,800
Yeah, but how do we
get close enough?

696
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,300
You scuba?

697
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,800
Yeah. Sure.

698
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,500
Good.

699
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,400
I'll go down to Rome,
pick up some equipment...

700
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,700
and be back tomorrow night.

701
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:03,400
Meanwhile, you study this chart,
especially this area right here.

702
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:07,700
Memorize the beach area,
offshore formations...

703
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,800
the depth, that sort of thing.

704
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,200
You got it.

705
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,100
You really expect
this kind of action?

706
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,200
You begin to lose odds
out in the open like this.

707
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,700
You straight on everything?

708
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,300
Where does our man sleep?

709
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,900
Forward bunk, starboard.

710
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,400
His friend?

711
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,800
- Aft, starboard.
- Engine hatch?

712
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,500
About four feet aft
of the bridge.

713
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,500
Let's go.
It'll be light soon.

714
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:05,200
It's a setup.

715
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,200
Duck!

716
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,600
Speed boats.

717
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,300
- How can they know?
- Give me that.

718
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,800
Those friends of yours?

719
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,800
Come on, man,
what the hell is going on?

720
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,600
They were sent
by the people I work for.

721
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,900
Explain.

722
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:17,200
When I brought you in,
I didn't check with 'em.

723
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,300
I broke a rule.

724
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,000
That was fast of you
back there. Thanks.

725
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,800
How long till she goes?

726
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,800
Just about... now.

727
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,400
Marcello, Cergei.

728
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,600
They're very thorough.
You drive.

729
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,900
Hey, man, this is getting
just a little bit hairy.

730
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,300
Yeah. I'm gonna try something.

731
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,800
That ought to take care of 'em.

732
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,400
One of 'em had a walkie-talkie.
He was in contact with somebody.

733
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,200
There they are.
It's a road block.

734
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,500
Slow down.

735
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,000
When you're about
200 feet from them...

736
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,200
put it in first
like you're going to stop...

737
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,500
but keep it rolling.

738
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,700
Wedge this
against the gas pedal.

739
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,600
Jump when I say so.

740
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,500
All right,
jam it on the gas pedal now.

741
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,500
All right. Ready, jump!

742
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,900
I'm empty.

743
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,600
Same here.
What do we do now?

744
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:38,100
Our friend back there
has picked up a machine gun.

745
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,800
Hey, pick it up and let's go.

746
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
You might not get back
for another ten years.

747
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,800
This really is a beautiful city.

748
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
What the hell. Let's go.

749
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,100
Brucine.

750
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,600
You'll be dead in a few minutes.

751
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:21,200
Listen,
you'll really appreciate this.

752
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:25,400
This stuff is absolutely clear
when it's in solution.

753
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,500
I just coated the inside
of the glass with it...

754
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,300
and let it dry.

755
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,300
And when the wine hit it...

756
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:35,100
it went right back
into solution... no trace.

757
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,700
Looks just like a heart attack.

758
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,400
You said every man
has his jelly spot.

759
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:49,600
Yours was you just
couldn't cut it alone.

760
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,000
Was it because of your father?

761
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,900
You killed him?
I thought he just died.

762
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,600
You see? There you are.

763
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,200
They told you who to hit.

764
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:14,000
It kept the whole idea from
being what we talked about.

765
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,300
You needed a license.
Their license.

766
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,400
I'm gonna pick my own mark.

767
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,400
Hit when I want.
Just like you said.

768
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:35,300
Standing outside.

769
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,000
See Naples and die.

770
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,100
"Steve, if you read this,
it means I didn't make it back.

771
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,800
"It also means
you've broken a filament...

772
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:32,000
"controlling a thirteen-second
delay trigger.

773
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,300
"End of game.

774
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,600
"Bang. You're dead."
