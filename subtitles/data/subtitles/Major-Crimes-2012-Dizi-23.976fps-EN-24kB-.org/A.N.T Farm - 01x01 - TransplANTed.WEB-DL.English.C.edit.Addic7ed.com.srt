00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,530
Oh my gosh.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,220
Dad! Look at this place!

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,490
Lockers instead of cubbies.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,690
Drivers Ed instead of Kiddie Vice.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,700
Him instead of...

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,910
What was I talking about?

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,790
Dad! Did she has to go to my high school?

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,950
I mean seriously she's only eleven.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,180
It's not Chyna's fault that she's gifted.

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,690
Any more than it's your fault that you're not.

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,990
Ah... great. Another ant.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,620
Hey what's with the name calling?

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,440
No. It's OK, dad.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,020
I'm an ant because I'm in the advanced
natural talents or A.N.T programs.

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,410
Yeah. I wasn't
talking about you.

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,720
Someone knocked over the little
ant farm again this morning.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,260
These little creepers are everywhere!

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,290
Ugh!

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,330
Ahhh! Get it off!

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,230
I mean, get it off.
Get it off.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,330
Anyway, you must be Chyna.

23
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,300
Welcome to the Ant Farm!

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,240
I love doing that.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,340
Um, are you my teacher?

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,250
No, teachers need a degree.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,610
I'm Gibson.

28
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,220
Your tutor, guidance
counselor and therapist,

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,420
all rolled up in one.

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,560
I also give out licorice.

31
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,560
Uh, no, thanks.

32
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,700
I had hair-covered
licorice for breakfast.

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,270
Not so fast,
bumblebee. A-ha!

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,270
Sorry I'm late.

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,570
Security hassled me about my battle ax.

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,710
Mom!

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,250
Whoa! Your mom's a warrior princess?
Awesome!

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,720
No, no, she's a children's
birthday party entertainer.

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,420
More awesome!

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,350
Hey, keep January 27th open.

41
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,650
Oh, you have kids?

42
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,750
Nope!

44
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,440
Just like you with music,

45
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,240
each student in the ANT
Program has a unique gift.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,150
Benny is a robotics expert.

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,410
<i>Greetings.</i>

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,290
Angus here is a computer genius.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,350
Ooh, that looks cool!
Can I play?

50
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,320
<i>Missile launch initiated.</i>

51
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
Am I winning the game?

52
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,830
Sure, 'cause it's a game.
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,600
Just a game.

54
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,800
<i>Missile launch aborted.</i>

55
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,670
And then there's Svetlana, our gymnast.

56
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,410
Hey, where is Svetlana?

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,650
Hello!

58
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,450
You need to stop doing that!

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,750
<i>Nyet! Nyet!</i>

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,590
Don't say "no" to me.

61
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,750
Oh!

62
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,490
You know, she might have
been saying, "Net, net."

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
Oh.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
Uh, sir?

65
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,500
I don't mean to alarm you or anything,

66
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,470
but this kid has a dead body.

67
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,740
It's wax.

68
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,440
Some people make friends.

69
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,510
Fletcher here has to
literally make friends.

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,480
I'm an artist.

71
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,710
As a project, I'm sculpting
the entire class in beeswax.

72
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,650
Well, they're beautiful.

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,650
You're beautiful.

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,750
I mean, your music is beautiful.

75
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,520
But you've never heard me play.

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,660
Yeah, I know, but, you see, I...

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,700
Hmm, wherever could he be?

78
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,530
Hi. I'm Chyna.

79
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,670
Chyna. Named for one of Earth's
oldest continuous civilizations,

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,770
whose dynasties include the Shang,
Tang, Xin, Ming and San Huang Di Wu.

81
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,780
So, your gift is

82
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,480
talking?

83
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,650
I'm Olive.
I have an eidetic memory,

84
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,450
so everything I've ever heard, seen or read

85
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,390
is permanently etched into my brain.

86
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,590
Wow! That's cool.

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,730
It's a blessing and a curse.

88
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,700
So, Chyna, did they give
you your new AntPad yet?

89
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,440
Oh! Yup.
This thing is so cool!

90
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,510
Check out all these apps.

91
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,580
Calendar app, GPS app.

92
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,480
Nap app?

93
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,680
Oh, no, no, don't...

94
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,820
Oh, no!
Homeroom's almost over!

95
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,760
Wait. Hey, guys,
what's going on?

96
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,560
Run! Run!

97
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,460
Whoa!

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait!
What's the rush?

99
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,800
Second period
doesn't start till 10:00.

100
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,370
It's not about when next period starts.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,600
It's about when this one ends!

102
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,470
Run!
Run!

103
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,770
Help! Help!

104
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,540
Angus!
We've got to save Angus!

105
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,380
Forget it, man!
Angus is gone!

106
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,850
But...
He's gone!

107
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,420
Tell my mother I loved her!

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,330
Looks like somebody's sitting in my chair.

109
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,740
Ooh, I love this story!

110
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,600
Get to the part where
they eat the porridge.

111
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,710
Hi, I'm Chyna.

112
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,780
Well, let's see if this china's breakable.

113
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,510
Good morning, class!

114
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,710
I... Ooh.

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,620
Lexi's chair?
Yeah.

116
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,680
Rookie mistake.

117
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,660
So, you must be my new prodigy.

118
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,820
Play something!

119
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
Okay.

120
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,670
I meant on the violin.

121
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,770
Oh. Right.
See, I knew that.

122
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,530
That was incredible!
Thanks.

123
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,770
Now, class, this semester, I will
be putting on <i>Hairspray.</i>

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,370
Um, don't you need hair for that, sir?

125
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,610
Not the styling product.
The Broadway musical!

126
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,550
You can sign up for cast,
crew or orchestra.

127
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,350
I'm going out for cast

128
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,750
because, obviously,
I'm the leading-man type.

129
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,420
I was in that play,
<i>Les Miserables.</i>

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,360
I played Les.

131
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,760
And I'm sure everyone else was miserable.

132
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,670
Now, of course, my audition
is merely a formality,

133
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,670
since I've starred in every
musical we've ever done.

134
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,510
<i>Grease.</i>

135
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
<i>Annie.</i>

136
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,750
<i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,790
Wow. You grew whiskers.

138
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,460
They're fake.

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,560
Oh! I'm not talking about
the ones in the picture.

140
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,560
What are you doing?

141
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,430
Do not anger the big kids!

142
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,370
They'll kill us, make
jewelry out of our bones

143
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,670
and then sell them at craft fairs!

144
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,600
I do not want to end up around the neck

145
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,540
of a middle-aged woman
in a jean skirt!

146
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,680
Just relax. We're in class.
Nobody can hurt us in here.

147
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,380
Hey!
Get me out of here!

148
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,610
Okay, Fletcher, just relax
your cheek muscles.

149
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,380
Oh, not those cheek muscles!

150
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,490
Oh, wait a minute.
I got an idea!

151
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,490
See? We made it to lunch.

152
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,460
Now, where's the cafeteria?

153
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,630
What?
No, no, no, no.

154
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,570
We eat in the safety of the Ant Farm.

155
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,370
Wait. I left my lunch
in my locker.

156
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,840
Emma left her lunch in her locker.

157
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,710
Who's Emma?
Exactly.

158
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,780
Look, there is a cupcake in that lunch.

159
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,510
I'm going for it!

160
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,510
Okay, but hurry, before the bell...

161
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,310
We're doomed!

162
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,620
No, we're not!
Get in, get in! Hurry!

163
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,650
Okay. Okay.

164
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,320
See? There are advantages to being
the smallest kids in school.

165
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,630
And you were right.

166
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,490
This cupcake was so worth it.

167
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,700
This is not my locker
and that's not a cupcake.

168
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,370
That would explain the tail.

169
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Ooh!

170
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,680
Can you believe that showoff Chyna?

171
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,750
I thought she was really good
on that tiny chin guitar.

172
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,520
So, are your rents still on vaycay?

173
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,620
Yep. Party tonight. My place.
It's gonna be ridic.

174
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,560
Ooh! Text me the deets.
Kay.

175
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,720
Aws.
Late.

176
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,190
Are you crazy?

177
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,190
The big kids do not want us at their party.

178
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,350
They hate us.

179
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,090
She's not wrong.

180
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,460
Look, guys, this is Lexi's party.

181
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,460
This is our chance to show her
that we belong in this school.

182
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,230
All we need to do is make
ourselves look a little older.

183
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,180
What? You said
to look older.

184
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,280
That is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever seen.

185
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,480
Hey, party people!

186
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,360
And suddenly you're in second place.

187
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,160
So, do we look like high schoolers or what?

188
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,300
Why do I smell fruit?

189
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,230
It's blueberry yogurt.

190
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,300
I wanted them to look natural

191
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,240
and the label said
"all natural."

192
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,370
Hey, Chyna.

193
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,510
Dad!

194
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,310
Hey! You didn't tell me
your dad was a mall cop.

195
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm a highly decorated member of the
San Francisco Police Department.

196
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,490
You see this medal?
Cleanest cop car.

197
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,230
Dad, I thought you said
you had a meeting tonight.

198
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Oh, yeah, the chief had to cancel.

199
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,460
His car was stolen.

200
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,270
So, who are your friends?

201
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,370
Oh, uh, Dad, this is Olive and Fletcher.

202
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,070
Friends are here to do homework.

203
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,480
Then why do they look like the
Monopoly Man and the community chest?

204
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,250
Yeah, because

205
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,120
we're studying <i>Pygmalion</i>
<i>in English class,</i>

206
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,390
and it's easier if we act it out.

207
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,120
See, he's Professor Higgins
and she's Eliza Doolittle.

208
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,590
Eliza, do a little.

209
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,230
'Ow do ya do, guvnah?
I'm just a simple flower girl, I am.

210
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,170
We need to find a way to get to that party.

211
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,510
Well, why can't we just
climb out the window?

212
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,210
Because if my dad checks on us
and I'm not here, he'll freak.

213
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,280
Man, I wish he'd just mind his own beeswax.

214
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,190
Beeswax! That's it!

215
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,560
Fletcher, these are so realistic.

216
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,130
But the eyes creep me out.

217
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,100
Well, I hate your nose.

218
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Will these really fool your parents?

219
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,540
Oh, well, my mom's out to dinner.

220
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,170
And my dad, he's out to lunch.

221
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,380
He'll never know, especially
if we dim the lights.

222
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,180
Now let's go get our party on!

223
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,120
Hey, beautiful.

224
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,290
Let's go!
Nothing!

225
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,470
Okay, we did it.
We made it to a high school party.

226
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,080
Good times. Great memories.
Let's go.

227
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

228
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,050
We'll be fine

229
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,150
as long as we don't draw
attention to ourselves.

230
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,320
Come on, let's go.

231
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,420
My yogurt's on the move.

232
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,400
Wow. Add a church hat
and some dentures

233
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,230
and you could be
my great-aunt Delores.

234
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Okay, Olive. Hold on.
Hold on. Goodness gracious.

235
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,270
Okay, that's not right.

236
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,540
Chyna?

237
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,480
What are you doing at this party?

238
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,550
Look, please don't tell
Dad you saw me here.

239
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,290
Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
I thought you were grounded.

240
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,390
I gave Angus five bucks to hack the
tracking device Dad put in my cell phone.

241
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,230
Right now I'm at church.

242
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,130
Oh, look, you just got a text from Satan.

243
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,270
"See you soon."

244
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,040
Isn't it a little late for you Ants?

245
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,250
Shouldn't you be in your
widdle footy pajamas by now?

246
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,550
I'll have you know that our
bedtime is not until 8:30!

247
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,120
9:00 on weekends.

248
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,460
Would you guys please stop saying stuff
that makes us look like little kids?

249
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,130
Ooh, cookies!

250
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,330
You must be the entertainment.

251
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,470
Are you a magician?

252
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,100
No, actually...

253
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,270
'Cause I think magicians are so hot.

254
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,270
Pick a card.

255
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,350
Oh, Chyna.

256
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,320
Why don't you tell us
about your first kiss?

257
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,420
Oh, first kiss?
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,220
You know, that takes me back.

259
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,290
It was at summer camp.

260
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,430
And his name was.

261
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Dorian.

262
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,060
Banister.

263
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,170
What?
You have never kissed anyone.

264
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,340
I would have remembered that
when I read your diary.

265
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,440
Pages and pages of nothing!

266
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,510
Okay, concentrate on your card.

267
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,160
I want you to empty your head of all...

268
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,260
Done!

269
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,330
What does a lady have to do to
get a juicy box around here?

270
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,470
I'm sorry, we ran out.

271
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,300
Like nine years ago.

272
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,170
Oh! Why don't
you try this?

273
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,240
Red Viper Soda.

274
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Okay.

275
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,050
Wow, good stuff!

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,220
Chyna? Gibson's here to see
how your first day went.

277
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,370
Melted kid! Melted kid!

278
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,440
It's wax.

279
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,240
Yeah, it's totally wacks that
someone would do that to a kid.

280
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,540
Totally wacks, yo.

281
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,310
Oh!

282
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm getting nothing.

283
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,320
I think we need to establish
a physical connection.

284
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,290
Okay.

285
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,390
Is it working?

286
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,100
Oh, it's definitely working.

287
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,140
Party!

288
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,070
Whoa!
What happened to you?

289
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,240
I tried this really awesome
drink called Red Viper,

290
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,510
and I feel great!

291
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,410
Except for my feet, which
I can't feel at all.

292
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,180
I mean, they're still there, right?

293
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,380
'Cause I really can't
see them with this dress.

294
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,120
You drank Red Viper?
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,180
Do you know what's in that junk?

296
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Sure. Carbonated water, sucrose,
glucose, sodium citrate, taurine,

297
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,490
glucuronolactone, caffeine,

298
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,290
calcium pantothenate, pyridoxine,
yellow dye number 7,

299
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,460
red dye number 36...
Oh, and vitamin C,

300
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,330
so it's good for you!

301
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,200
Oh, no! The magician!

302
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,370
I hope the rabbit's okay!

303
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,510
Stay strong, little guy!

304
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,210
Hey, magician,

305
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,150
any chance you can make us disappear?

306
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,610
I can't believe they snuck out.

307
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,710
Do you have any idea where they went?

308
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,480
I heard Lexi Reed
was throwing a party tonight.

309
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,350
Where does she live?

310
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,820
I don't know.
No one would text me the deets.

311
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,360
This is highly decorated Officer Parks.

312
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,600
I need a 10-20
on a Lexi Reed.

313
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,770
We'll also need SWAT and that
monkey that can defuse a bomb.

314
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,640
Actually, Officer Chimperson is dead.

315
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,440
Turns out he really couldn't defuse a bomb.

316
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,480
Oh.

317
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,380
You stupid Ants ruined my party!

318
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,710
You thought your lives were
miserable at school before?

319
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,680
Just wait until tomorrow.

320
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,450
"Let's go to a high school
party, it'll be fun."

321
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,460
Another one?

322
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,360
Don't you think this one was bad enough?

323
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,730
We trusted you, Chyna.
And you let us down.

324
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,340
Thanks a lot.

325
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,570
Well, the stereo's dead,
and so is this party.

326
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,780
Wait! If you guys
want music,

327
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,750
I can play something.

328
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,420
Yeah, 'cause nothing rocks the
house like a violin concerto.

329
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,590
Actually, I was thinking I would
sing something more like this.

That girl is my sister.

340
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,430
And I'm trying to listen to her sing.

341
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,560
Your older sister?

342

354

I thought you played violin.

355
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,550
Oh, I do.

356
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,420
And guitar.

357
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,650
And piano, trumpet, saxophone,
flute, cello, harp, the bagpipes,

358
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,620
French horn, drums,
harmonica and the spoons.

359
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,560
Oh, and I also sing a little.

360
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,430
Yeah, a little.

361
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,530
You know, maybe I will try
out for the school play.

362
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,570
You should!
You're really talented!

363
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,570
Shut up, Paisley!

364
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,770
Sorry we, kind of, turned on you, Chyna.

365
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,710
Although, looking back,

366
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,650
it was mostly Olive.

367
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,680
That was the Red Viper talking.

368
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
That stuff is bad news.

369
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,590
I still love you guys.

370
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,360
Oh, no.

371
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,690
It's the mall cops!

372
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,460
I'm a highly decorated police officer.

373
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,470
If I were a mall cop, would I have a...

374
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Where's my badge?

375
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,500
Freeze, dirtbags!

376
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,410
Give me that!

377
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,680
Officer, I can explain.

378
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,750
Don't bother.
I'm not here for you.

379
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,780
I'm here for her.

380
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,750
There you are, Chyna!

381
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,490
You had me worried sick.
I left church to find you!

382
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,460
Home. Now.

383
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,730
And anybody else whose parents
don't know you're here, out!

384
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,770
Not you, Gibson!

385
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,710
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

386
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
I knew you weren't ready for high school.

387
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,710
But, Dad, I am ready.

388
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,680
I finally found a place where I belong.

389
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,320
Right now, the only place where you belong

390
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,380
is in the back of my squad car.

391
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,750
Let's go.

392
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
putting me in the perp cage?

393
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,590
Do I at least get a phone call?

394
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,760
Sure.

395
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,460
I think your mom is gonna
want to talk to you.

396
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,830
Yeah, I think I'll skip the phone call.

397
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,410
Sir, madam, you have a lovely home.

398
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,680
Why are you freaks still here?
Get out of my house!

399
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,820
Hey! Don't you talk
to us that way!

400
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,420
Yeah!

401
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,620
My mom is going to kill me!

402
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,430
Don't worry, I know how to get that out.

403
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,760
I'll text you the deets.

404
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,900
We looked everywhere.

405
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,470
I guess Chyna's dad decided to
pull her out of the ANT Program.

406
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,610
Hey, what's all that music stuff?

407
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,480
I set it up.

408
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,640
Chyna!

409
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
We thought your dad
pulled you out of school!

410
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,650
Oh, well, he wanted to,

411
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,450
but I plea-bargained him down
to a three-month grounding.

412
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,490
So, if we plan on having any more fun,

413
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,660
Fletcher, I'm going to need a
lot more of those sculptures.

414
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,590
They're done!

415
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,830
I mean, they will be done.

416
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,700
It's not like I stayed up all last night

417
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,770
making wax sculptures of you.

418
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
No, that would be weird.

419
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,840
You see, I...

420
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,770
He knows we can see him, right?

421
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,480
I really don't know what
he knows at this point.

422
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,450
Come on, let's go eat in the cafeteria.

423
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,420
You're not scared of the big kids?

424
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,650
Ooh! Or that lunch lady
with the hairnet

425
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,750
on her beard?

426
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,460
No. That whole thing
with the cops

427
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,660
gave us Ants some serious street cred.

428
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,700
Hey, guys,

429
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,330
I just got back from the hospital!

430
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,640
They gave me a pig spleen!

431
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,570
Run!

432
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,540
Oh, come on!

433
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,510
Not again! Not the spleen!
Not the spleen!

434
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,910
