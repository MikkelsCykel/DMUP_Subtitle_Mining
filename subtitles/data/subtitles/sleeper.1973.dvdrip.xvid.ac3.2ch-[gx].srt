1
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,248
- Everything's on for tonight?
- Yes.

2
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:40,877
- I still think it's too soon to bring him up.
- We have no choice. They're onto us.

3
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:45,297
I've programmed the CLC for two hours.
There's no telling when it'll be free again.

4
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:52,388
We'll have to move him if he comes up,
or be ready to dispose of him the usual way.

5
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:59,435
Please state registration code.

6
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,858
Check.

7
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,693
Where was the subject found?

8
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:08,655
We came across it the last day of
our field trip into the woods a week ago.

9
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,866
The capsule was perfectly intact.

10
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:15,536
- Is there any date on the capsule?
- Yes. The subject was frozen in 1973.

11
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:19,373
He's been under for 200 years.

12
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:07,170
- Blood pressure?
- 140/50.

13
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:13,051
- Encephalo-activity?
- Just under normal.

14
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,929
General life functions: Acceptable.

15
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:19,848
- He should come out of it any moment.
- Do we have any information on him?

16
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:25,979
Just the usual data card inside
the capsule and the personal artefacts kit.

17
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,817
Subject was 35 years old
at time of initial cryogenic immersion.

18
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,652
His name: Miles Monroe.

19
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:36,572
He was part-owner of the
Happy Carrot Health-Food Restaurant

20
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:39,200
on Bleecker Street, wherever that was.

21
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,998
Also a clarinet player with
something called the Ragtime Rascals.

22
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:48,460
Was his immersion voluntary?

23
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:53,340
"Subject entered hospital for routine
exploration of minor peptic ulcer,

24
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,137
and complications set in.
Patient never regained consciousness. "

25
00:04:58,387 --> 00:05:02,850
"He was admitted for immersion
by his cousin, a Mrs Joan Needlebaum. "

26
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,519
- The physical damage was repaired?
- Totally. Routine.

27
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:10,481
- We're getting an initial motor response.
- This is the critical stage.

28
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:15,236
If his regaining consciousness isn't
handled carefully, there could be damage.

29
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:19,489
We're dealing with an involuntary subject
who expects to be waking up in

30
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,328
St Vincent's Hospital
in Greenwich Village in 1973.

31
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:05,618
Swallow reflex is almost there.

32
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,545
- We've got to get him out of here.
- He's not ready.

33
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:19,173
We've got to get him ambulatory,
ready or not.

34
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:23,011
Careful.

35
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,973
Now, just keep him on his feet.

36
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:30,644
We've gotta dispose of this capsule.
Get him to the farm.

37
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:33,230
- We'll meet there tonight.
- Yes.

38
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,775
Now, let's try to take a step.
Like this. One...

39
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:39,652
- Bend the knee. Up, down.
- Take a step. That's it.

40
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,363
There you are. Good.
Very good, Mr Monroe.

41
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,073
Up, down...

42
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,575
Oh, no. He's got it in reverse.

43
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:50,413
- You're going wrong.
- Mr Monroe.

44
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,832
Security's coming.

45
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,668
Mr Monroe? Please, Mr Monroe. Wake up.

46
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,880
We've gotta get him dressed - quickly.
Stand, right there. Stand.

47
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,843
That's it.

48
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:35,749
Mr Monroe, there we are.

49
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,341
Sorry to bother you, Doctor.
Is everything OK?

50
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:51,680
Yes, we...
We ought to be through here shortly.

51
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:57,518
It's funny. We're getting
a misread on the power function.

52
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,025
Really? Well, I'll order a check
first thing in the morning.

53
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:05,403
Any reason why anyone else
would be consuming power?

54
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:09,616
No, it's just Dr Orva,
Dr Monroe and myself.

55
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:14,620
We definitely did register
a power increase here.

56
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,585
Don't mind Dr Monroe.

57
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,297
He's not over the effects of a new ray
we've been experimenting with.

58
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:30,426
- What's this?
- That?

59
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:35,181
- I think you two'd better come with us.
- Why? We haven't done anything.

60
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,686
I think I can explain. You've heard
of the Venus Project, haven't you?

61
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,646
Yes.

62
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:46,525
We had to come in this evening
to finish up some very important work.

63
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,904
When we asked for clearance, we were
given no reason to believe we couldn't...

64
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:53,826
- You have authorisation?
- We had clearance given.

65
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:59,747
- Fully, a week ago. Don't you believe...?
- Dr Monroe, I... Gentlemen...

66
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,126
- This really is getting difficult.
- He could be dangerous.

67
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:08,423
Please leave us alone
so that we can complete our work.

68
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,510
He's going to get dizzy.
This is going to be worse than ever.

69
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,388
- Don't you see what a difficult...
- This is getting a little out of hand.

70
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:20,017
If we hadn't had this interruption,
we'd have had it under control.

71
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:25,605
- Now, please, gentlemen.
- Are you sure you have authorisation?

72
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,490
He's fully recovered...
except for a few minor kinks.

73
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,619
- Has he asked for anything special?
- Yes. This morning for breakfast.

74
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:28,792
He requested something called wheat
germ, organic honey and tiger's milk.

75
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:34,048
Those are the charmed substances once
felt to contain life-preserving properties.

76
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:36,634
You mean there was no deep fat?

77
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:40,137
No steak or cream pies or hot fudge?

78
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:45,101
Those were thought to be unhealthy... the
opposite of what we now know to be true.

79
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:47,560
Incredible.

80
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:52,607
Well, he wants to know where he is
and what's going on.

81
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:56,528
I think it's time to tell him.

82
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:33,856
I can't believe this.

83
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:37,109
My doctor said I'd be up
and on my feet in five days.

84
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,945
He was off by 199 years.

85
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:43,991
I know it's hard, Miles, but try
to think of this as a miracle of science.

86
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:47,161
To me, a miracle is I go in
for a minor operation,

87
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:50,747
I come out the next day,
my rent isn't 2,000 months overdue.

88
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:55,501
That's a miracle of science.
This is what I call a cosmic screwing.

89
00:11:55,752 --> 00:12:00,131
And where am I, anyhow? What happened
to everybody? Where are all my friends?

90
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:04,719
Understand that everyone you knew in
the past has been dead nearly 200 years.

91
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,054
But they all ate organic rice.

92
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:10,223
You are now in the year 2173.

93
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:13,604
This is the central parallel
of the American Federation.

94
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:18,442
This district is what you'd probably call
the southwestern United States.

95
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,902
That was before
it was destroyed by the war.

96
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:24,322
- War?
- Yes. Over a hundred years ago,

97
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:27,617
a man named Albert Shanker
got a hold of a nuclear warhead.

98
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:31,663
You will remain in hiding here
for two weeks while we run tests on you.

99
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:35,625
Then, when you've recovered
your strength, we'll discuss the plan.

100
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,710
I still can't believe this.

101
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:43,131
What do you mean "hiding"? Who am I
hiding from? What does she mean?

102
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:47,594
You might as well know, Miles,
that reviving you as we did

103
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:50,389
was in strict opposition
to government policy.

104
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,431
What we've done is illegal.

105
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:55,393
If we get caught,
we'll be destroyed... along with you.

106
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:57,895
What do you mean "destroyed"?

107
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,940
Your brain will be
electronically simplified.

108
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,736
My brain?
It's my second-favourite organ.

109
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:08,240
Resisters to mind-reprogramming will be
exterminated for the good of the state.

110
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,494
What kind of government you guys got?!
This is worse than California.

111
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:15,247
There is a growing underground, Miles.

112
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:19,334
Someday the revolution will come
and we can overthrow our leader.

113
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:21,962
You gotta be kidding.
I wanna go back to sleep.

114
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:25,256
If I don't get at least 600 years,
I'm grouchy all day.

115
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:29,051
We're taking him along too fast.
He's still emotionally unstable.

116
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:34,390
I go in for a lousy ulcer operation,
I lay in a Birds Eye wrapper for 200 years,

117
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,518
I wake up,
suddenly I'm on the ten-most-wanted list!

118
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:39,561
We'd better tranquillise him.

119
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:43,106
It was too good to be true.
I parked right near the hospital.

120
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,818
Here. Smoke this. Be sure you get
the smoke deep into your lungs.

121
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:48,778
- I don't smoke.
- It's tobacco.

122
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,115
It's one of the healthiest things for you.
Now, go ahead.

123
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,995
You need all the strength you can get.

124
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:01,918
I bought Polaroid at seven.
It's probably up millions by now.

125
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:30,945
Now, we have certain artefacts here
which we date from 1950 to 2000.

126
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:36,492
We'd like any information you can give us
on them. Very little exists.

127
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,118
For instance...

128
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:41,704
Joseph Stalin. He was a communist.
I was not too crazy about him.

129
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,292
He had a bad moustache,
a lot of bad habits.

130
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:47,963
This is Bela Lugosi. He was the mayor
of New York for a while.

131
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:50,215
You can see what it did to him there.

132
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:53,301
This is... This is...

133
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:56,346
Charles de Gaulle.
He was a very famous French chef.

134
00:14:56,596 --> 00:15:01,016
Had his own television show. Showed
you how to make soufflés and omelettes.

135
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,895
This is Scott Fitzgerald over here.
A very romantic writer.

136
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:10,693
Big with English majors, college girls,
nymphomaniacs. Very, well...

137
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,112
This is Chiang Kai-shek,
who I was not too crazy about either.

138
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:17,240
This is Billy Graham.

139
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,870
Very big in the religion business.
He knew God personally.

140
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,832
Got him his complete wardrobe.
Used to go out on double dates together.

141
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:28,667
It was a big thing.
They were romantically linked.

142
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:34,717
This is some girls burning a brassiere.
You notice it's a very small fire.

143
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,886
This, I don't know what that is.

144
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,389
That's a photograph of Norman Mailer,
who was a great writer.

145
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,809
He donated his ego
to the Harvard Medical School for study.

146
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,478
And this... this I can tell you already,

147
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:52,066
this is a centrefold from a magazine
we used to call "Playboy", which...

148
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:54,485
These girls didn't exist in actual life.

149
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,280
They were rubberised.
You had to blow 'em up.

150
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,408
And you could spread ointment on them,
or anything else that you...

151
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:05,704
I'll just take this and study it later
and give you a full report on it.

152
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:10,667
And would you tell me exactly...

153
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:14,171
what this is?

154
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,715
Yes. This is...
You see, this is the chattering teeth.

155
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:22,094
This, you would buy at a store and take it
to a party if you wanted to get big laughs.

156
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,514
You'd put it down on the coffee table

157
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:28,520
and you'd set it off and then...

158
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,857
See how funny it is?
The teeth chatter. They're plastic.

159
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:42,115
<i>I am going, at this time, to give
to this television and radio audience...</i>

160
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,827
Some of us have a theory
that he might have been

161
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:47,036
a president of the United States,

162
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,206
but that he did something horrendous,

163
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:54,168
so that all records,
everything, was wiped out about him.

164
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:58,464
There is nothing in history books,
there are no pictures on stamps...

165
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:00,550
Yes, he was president.

166
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,303
But whenever he left the White House, the
Secret Service counted the silverware.

167
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,347
<i>Thank you very much, Jimmy.</i>

168
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:12,686
<i>From the beginning, Muhammad Ali's
career was marred by controversy</i>

169
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:17,317
<i>and, who knows, it may have ended
last Saturday in the very same way.</i>

170
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,484
<i>From the...</i>

171
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:22,405
At first we didn't know what this was,
but we've developed a theory.

172
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:26,951
We feel that when citizens in your society
were guilty of a crime against the state,

173
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:29,036
they were forced to watch this.

174
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:33,373
<i>...the way it began - March of 1964.
That's where...</i>

175
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:38,086
Yes, that's exactly what that was.

176
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,091
- Would you like some more?
- This tastes awful.

177
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:45,677
I could have made a fortune selling it.

178
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:50,389
Janis, some more for Mr Monroe.

179
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,815
Certainly, sir.

180
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:03,319
- Are you thirsty, Mr Monroe?
- Me? No. No, thank you.

181
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:04,777
Of course.

182
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:08,575
- These robots are uncanny.
- They're one of our biggest industries.

183
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:13,872
Far more sophisticated than previously
manufactured labour-saving devices.

184
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:19,127
They're alert, they respond. I've gone out
with girls with less movement than that.

185
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:22,171
Watch this. Janis, come here.

186
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:27,092
Yes, Dr Orva. May I be of service to you?

187
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:29,929
Tell us about yourself.

188
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,390
My name is Janis 414.

189
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:36,726
I'm a domestic service menial
of the 400 Series.

190
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:41,856
I can cook, clean,
I am a butler, a gardener and chauffeur.

191
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:47,654
I have been programmed to respond to
a complex series of domestic commands.

192
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,365
Janis, clear the table
and then leave the room.

193
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:53,242
Come on, Miles.

194
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,205
Are there females?
The possibilities are limitless.

195
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:58,833
It's late. We've got to get you out of here.

196
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,211
- What do you mean? Where am I going?
- To the Western District.

197
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:05,005
The underground has
its headquarters there.

198
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:09,175
Miles, have you ever taken
a serious political stand on anything?

199
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:13,555
Yeah, sure. For 24 hours once
I refused to eat grapes.

200
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:17,976
There's something called the Aires
Project. We want to know what it is.

201
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:19,185
Why?

202
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:23,397
We believe it's a plot the leader has
to destroy the revolutionary movement.

203
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:26,275
- How do I fit in?
- We defrosted your capsule

204
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:28,902
because we needed someone
with no identity.

205
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:31,196
Everyone here has a citizen's record.

206
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:36,034
We've all been computerised,
catalogued, fingerprinted, voice-printed.

207
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:39,078
But you have no number.
You can be used to penetrate.

208
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,539
If you're captured,
you don't know anything.

209
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,750
They could torture you for months.
What could you tell them?

210
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,213
My name, rank, serial number
and your name.

211
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:50,216
- You've got to help us.
- You've got the wrong guy.

212
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,927
I'm not heroic.
I was beaten up by Quakers.

213
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:55,429
- Miles, you're our chance.
- No, I'm sorry.

214
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,266
I never get involved in anything
where I could be tortured.

215
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:04,146
I'm a screamer. It's embarrassing. I wake
up shrieking at the top of my lungs.

216
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:09,650
Excuse me, sir. The security police are
here and they're surrounding the house.

217
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:13,321
- When will you want lunch?
- Go to the Western District.

218
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,615
- Find the Aires Project.
- You can do it.

219
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:19,452
Out that way, Miles.

220
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:06,931
Fly, goddamn it. Fly.

221
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:12,437
Goddamn cheap Japanese flying packs.

222
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:50,282
We still haven't located the alien.
We'd like to check the back of your van.

223
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,284
All right, come on. Let's go. Move it.

224
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:39,038
Let's go. I don't have all day.
Come on. Come on.

225
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:42,958
Here's your new home.

226
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:53,679
Oh, no. Is this the best they could offer?

227
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,141
Jeez. I'd hoped for something
with at least decent features.

228
00:24:58,392 --> 00:25:04,648
I guess I'll bring you in next week and
have your head removed. OK, come on.

229
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:09,652
- What's your name?
- M-Milo.

230
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:12,530
<i>The alien authorities are seeking
is still at large.</i>

231
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,658
<i>Persons observing
any unusual activity or behaviour</i>

232
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:21,831
<i>should do themselves and our leader
a favour by reporting it to the police.</i>

233
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,291
All right, Milo.
I'm expecting company any minute.

234
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:28,712
Help with the drinks and serve.
Some of them'll be hungry.

235
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:31,589
The kitchen is on a single-circuit system.

236
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,843
I think I'm going to put
some rose oil on my fingertips.

237
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:37,553
Check the music channel
and the aromatrom,

238
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:42,685
and make sure there's plenty of food
for all the people.

239
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:39,658
I think the way
it was first explained to me...

240
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:45,663
Remember that very funny story...

241
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:54,838
Hi, everyone. Long time, no see.

242
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:59,217
Long time, no see. Come right on in.

243
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,850
Where did you get that? It's gorgeous.

244
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:12,479
- Hi!
- How are you, darling?

245
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:39,048
- It's wonderful. You shouldn't have.
- I just thought you'd like it.

246
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,843
Oh, it's Keane. It's pure Keane.

247
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,053
No. No, it's greater than Keane.

248
00:27:45,304 --> 00:27:48,473
It's Cugat.

249
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,357
It was white on white.
And you know where she got it?

250
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:02,987
- No. You're kidding.
- Right. Right. You know who paid for it?

251
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:11,122
- Magnificent.
- Let's go and tell her about...

252
00:28:25,177 --> 00:28:28,764
Here it is.

253
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:37,063
The orb.

254
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:48,490
Could I have a hit off that hot orb, Milo?

255
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:58,375
Milo, Milo.

256
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:35,452
No, no, no.

257
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:09,028
Let's all go for a swim.

258
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:12,781
Where's the pool?

259
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:18,245
Run, run, run!

260
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:45,606
That was wonderful. I feel so refreshed.

261
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:48,984
We should have had sex,
but there weren't enough people.

262
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:52,070
- We'll use the orgasmatron.
- That's a good idea.

263
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,950
I think Beverley's nose
looked larger tonight.

264
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:07,668
- I had such a good time.
- All in all, I thought the party went well.

265
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:10,504
As good as last night's
or the night before's.

266
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:13,924
Maybe not quite as good
as last Saturday's but, you know,

267
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:16,468
I love a party with a theme.

268
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:21,889
- Say, there's something on your mind.
- They arrested Dalton Porter today.

269
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:24,058
- Why?
- He was with the underground.

270
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:25,977
- No.
- It was horrible.

271
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:28,688
They tried to reprogramme him
and it went wrong.

272
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:31,317
- He's a vegetable.
- I don't wanna hear this.

273
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:34,404
L- I saw it happen. He was babbling.

274
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:37,656
He claimed he saw secret experiments
at the hospital.

275
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:40,117
Something called... Aires.

276
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:44,955
I absolutely do not wanna hear about it.
This world is so full of wonderful things.

277
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,833
What makes people go berserk
and hate everything?

278
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,168
Why does there have to be
an underground?

279
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:55,548
There's the orb, the telescreen, the
orgasmatron. What more do they want?

280
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:00,928
It's hard for us to understand criminals.
We're artists. We respond only to beauty.

281
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:06,058
Yes, I know.
Herald... I wrote a new poem today.

282
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,686
- You didn't?
- Yes, I did.

283
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,612
A little boy caught a butterfly

284
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,697
And said to himself:

285
00:32:20,949 --> 00:32:25,703
I must try to understand my life
and help others,

286
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:28,664
Not just mothers and fathers

287
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:32,210
But friends. Strangers, too.

288
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,631
With eyes of blue
and lips full red and round,

289
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,342
But the butterfly didn't make a sound

290
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:42,302
For he had turned into a caterpillar...

291
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:46,431
By and by.

292
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:48,099
That's deep.

293
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,311
You're so obviously
influenced by McKuen.

294
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:55,397
- Do you really like it?
- Only one thing...

295
00:32:55,648 --> 00:33:00,277
They change from caterpillars
into butterflies. Not the other way.

296
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,739
They do? They do?

297
00:33:03,989 --> 00:33:05,699
Damn it. Damn it.

298
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,828
Damn it. I always get that wrong.

299
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:11,289
- Relax. Relax.
- Oh, shoot. Shoot.

300
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, no. Now the whole evening's spoiled.

301
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:17,921
And now I'm getting a headache.
Shoot. I hate to be wrong!

302
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:22,175
Luna, sit down, sit down.
Luna, sit down. Come on. Sit down.

303
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:28,806
- It'll be all right, I promise. Now just relax.
- I was having so much fun.

304
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:32,852
Come on... That's better.

305
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:37,022
<i>And now Channel 1200
leaves the air until tomorrow morning.</i>

306
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:41,902
<i>Our leader wishes you all
a pleasant good night.</i>

307
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:06,093
- Can I help you?
- Would you change his head for me?

308
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:09,138
- Something a little more aesthetic.
- Right.

309
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:13,100
And check his works. He acts peculiar.

310
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:15,602
Got room in there
for another head change?

311
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:19,439
Yeah, sure.

312
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,739
- All right, I'll be back in a little while.
- Let's go.

313
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:44,122
You have to help me. I'll tell the truth.
I'm not a puppet. I'm Miles Monroe.

314
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:46,541
I was frozen in 1973.
Doctors thawed me out.

315
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:50,628
Everybody's after me, but I didn't
do anything. I'm a nice person.

316
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,964
I would never force myself sexually
on a blind person.

317
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:55,174
You're the alien?

318
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,345
You live in a police state. We have to
find out what the Aires Project is.

319
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:04,600
- God, you are. You're the alien!
- You won't give me away, will you?

320
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:12,399
I knew I could count on you.

321
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,703
Are you hungry?

322
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:29,625
Do you want a cracker, maybe?
Take a cracker.

323
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,795
How can you not be hungry?
We've been sitting here for hours.

324
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:37,132
All you had in the car were these...
interstellar space cookies.

325
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:43,138
Eat something. You'll feel better.
Just take a cracker.

326
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:48,476
Will you shut up? For God's sakes,
put yourself in my position.

327
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:52,646
I'm a clarinet player in 1973.
I go into the hospital for a lousy operation.

328
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:57,651
I wake up 200 years later
and I'm Flash Gordon. Plus I'm a criminal.

329
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:02,322
I never did anything wrong. I ran
a health-food store in Greenwich Village.

330
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:05,117
Occasionally
a customer would get botulism.

331
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,702
But that was very rare.

332
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,164
Now, look, you have to help me.
You're the only person I know.

333
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,836
I'm gonna take that gag off.
If you're gonna scream, scream.

334
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:17,213
Nobody's gonna hear you.

335
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,424
Go ahead, scream.

336
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:23,761
I love it, I love it. Scream.

337
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:28,098
Help! Help me!

338
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,771
Shut up or I'll bring this rock down
on your head so hard

339
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,608
that a substance resembling guacamole
will come out of your ears.

340
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:41,069
- What do you want with me?
- Help me reach the underground.

341
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,238
I'm not helping any alien.
We don't want your crazy ideas.

342
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,407
Go back to Greenberg's Village.

343
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,077
Greenwich Village.
Not Greenberg's Village.

344
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,746
And that was 200 years ago.
I can't go back.

345
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,498
You're sick. You have to give yourself up.

346
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:57,751
They won't hurt you.
They'll restructure your brain.

347
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,504
Oh, no. Nobody touches my brain.
They may drop it.

348
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:03,048
Then I'd talk like I'd been hit by lightning.

349
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:06,470
Please! I wanna go home.
I'm getting a headache. I'm hungry.

350
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,390
I haven't had a stress pill
or a bath in seven hours.

351
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,393
I'm not accustomed to this. I need my orb.

352
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:17,355
I wanna relax. Look at me.
Look at me. I'm shaking.

353
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,025
- You'd be great on a camping trip.
- I order you to take me home.

354
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,946
They'll be out looking for me.
You've abducted a very important person.

355
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:30,867
I am a renowned poet. I sell 20 to 30
poems a week, plus greeting cards.

356
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:35,956
- How far is the Western District?
- It'd take days, and that's with a vehicle.

357
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,959
Take me there and you'll never
see me again, I promise.

358
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:45,131
I'm hungry. I can't think straight.
Obviously, I'll promise you anything.

359
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:48,926
If I get you some food,
will you take me to the Western District?

360
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:51,095
You sit here. I'll find us something.

361
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:54,767
And don't try anything funny,
cos you know what you'll get.

362
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,352
What?

363
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:59,521
What?

364
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:03,191
What will you get?

365
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:08,947
A large and painful hickey.

366
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:15,928
Oh, my God. I beat a man insensible
with a strawberry.

367
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:40,870
That's a big chicken.

368
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,084
What a way to go, to be pecked to death.

369
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,766
Pass the celery.

370
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:08,855
- There you go.
- Couldn't you get anything else?

371
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:12,984
Do you think it's easy to run when you're
holding a banana the size of a canoe?

372
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:18,530
You didn't get any dessert.
There's no seasoning, no wine.

373
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,827
I still can't believe the size of these.
I'd hate to see the fertiliser.

374
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:24,997
What was that?

375
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:27,708
- What?
- That noise. Didn't you hear anything?

376
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:31,045
Are there any strange animals
that I should know about here?

377
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,047
Anything futuristic,

378
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:36,716
like with the body of a crab
and the head of a social worker?

379
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:41,471
How do you know I won't trick you and
turn you in to the hands of the police?

380
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:44,265
How do I know?
Cos I think, maybe, what the hell.

381
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:46,517
I think maybe you trust me a bit now.

382
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:52,731
Maybe you think I got you food and, what
the hell, I'm not really such a bad guy.

383
00:42:57,235 --> 00:42:59,321
OK. Now, we're gonna get a vehicle.

384
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:05,159
And don't try anything funny
or you'll be sorry. Come on.

385
00:43:07,745 --> 00:43:11,040
Our car broke down.
Is it possible we could borrow one?

386
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,251
Sure. Come on in. Are you OK?

387
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:15,922
Fine.

388
00:43:16,172 --> 00:43:20,676
My goodness gracious. Just look
at yourself. You're so dishevelled.

389
00:43:20,926 --> 00:43:25,055
I might have some clothes
you could just jump right into.

390
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:28,392
Why don't you just come this way?

391
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:32,187
- Her car ran out of...
- What, honey?

392
00:43:32,437 --> 00:43:33,730
We have to borrow a car.

393
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,941
- What are you mumbling about?
- Could I use your bathroom?

394
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:38,317
Yes, of course.

395
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,111
Come on in and sit down.

396
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:46,492
Come on in here and you just sit
right down here, you little cutie.

397
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,756
Hello, police? I can't speak.
I'm with the alien.

398
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:04,009
We're heading west on the 1600 channel.

399
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:06,972
We should be at the eastern parallel
in a half an hour.

400
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:10,391
<i>- Detain him somehow. We'll be right out.
- OK, I'll try.</i>

401
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:13,019
But I'm not gonna promise anything.

402
00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:17,440
<i>Don't let him out of your sight.
We're on our way.</i>

403
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:23,028
- Would you like a stroke?
- Me? No, thanks, man. I'm cool.

404
00:44:23,278 --> 00:44:27,365
Excuse me.
Do you have a space hydrovac suit?

405
00:44:27,616 --> 00:44:32,454
Of course. Why?
Are you going on the space shuttle?

406
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:33,622
Yes.

407
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:37,417
Yes, I am. And he forgot his.

408
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:42,588
Reagan. Bring out my hydrovac suit.
Right this minute.

409
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:45,674
Here's your silly old hydrovac suit.

410
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:50,179
Jesus, I could hardly find it.
It's such a mess in that bedroom.

411
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:52,681
What am I gonna do with a hydrovac suit?

412
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:56,686
If you don't want the police to recognise
you, take off that robot uniform.

413
00:44:56,937 --> 00:45:01,900
- What is a hydrovac suit?
- It's for space travel. Use it as a disguise.

414
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,404
<i>I see you're starting to think
a little bit now.</i>

415
00:45:07,364 --> 00:45:12,701
- Why are we stopping by the river?
- I don't know. I think that we're lost.

416
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:16,080
Hey, look.

417
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:29,509
Over there.

418
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:33,054
- No. Over there.
- Shall we take her in or get rid of her?

419
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:38,184
- I'm not the one that you want.
- Take her in for reprogramming.

420
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:54,118
- What are you talking about?
- You've been contaminated by the alien.

421
00:45:54,368 --> 00:45:57,036
- What?
- You spent too much time with him.

422
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:01,332
- But I'm the one who turned him in.
- Let's get rid of her now.

423
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:05,712
- One less reprogramming job.
- She'll be fine after the brain treatment.

424
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:06,963
Help!

425
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:11,718
Our orders were to use our discretion.
I say destroy her.

426
00:46:35,907 --> 00:46:38,328
- We're gonna have to swim for it.
- I can't swim.

427
00:46:38,578 --> 00:46:41,539
- What do you mean, you can't swim?
- I mean I can't swim.

428
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:45,459
I can't swim either. Get on top of me.

429
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:49,338
- Come on, get on top of me.
- I don't wanna get wet.

430
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:52,799
- Hurry up. Paddle.
- I'm paddling.

431
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:57,554
Don't worry.
I was a lifeguard at Bloomingdale.

432
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:07,813
How could you? I hate you. I hate you.

433
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:09,941
Try not to get upset.

434
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:13,861
They wanna destroy me. Me!

435
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:19,991
The inflater.

436
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:22,202
Lean left. Left.

437
00:47:22,452 --> 00:47:24,621
No. Lean left.

438
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:28,293
Use the inflater.

439
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:39,637
- What is it?
- It's a 200-year-old Volkswagen.

440
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,643
They really built these things.

441
00:47:46,893 --> 00:47:51,314
Reg... "Register commies, not guns. "
What's that mean?

442
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:55,193
- What?
- "Register commies, not guns. "

443
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:58,488
He was probably in
the National Rifle Association.

444
00:47:58,738 --> 00:48:03,075
There was a group that helped criminals
get guns so they could shoot citizens.

445
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:05,870
- It was a public service.
- Let me see that.

446
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,956
It's a "New York Times" - be careful -
from 1990.

447
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:14,295
"Pope's wife gives birth to twins. " Wow.

448
00:48:14,545 --> 00:48:18,175
- We don't have cities like New York now.
- No cities at all?

449
00:48:18,425 --> 00:48:21,845
No. But I went to the university
at a population centre.

450
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:25,515
You went to a university?
It's hard to believe. For what?

451
00:48:25,765 --> 00:48:28,351
Cosmetic sexual technique and poetry.

452
00:48:28,602 --> 00:48:30,562
They teach you sex in school?

453
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:33,564
Yes, in case something
goes wrong with the machine.

454
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:36,442
What do you do? Switch to manual?

455
00:48:36,692 --> 00:48:38,611
Where did you learn about sex?

456
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:42,948
From my mother. When I was little, I
asked her "Where do babies come from?"

457
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,035
She thought I said rabies.
She said "From a dog bite. "

458
00:48:46,285 --> 00:48:52,874
A lady on the block gave birth to triplets.
I thought she was bitten by a Great Dane.

459
00:48:57,879 --> 00:49:03,384
That's perfect. We'll dump it in the water.
They'll never find it.

460
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:07,848
What's it feel like
to be dead for 200 years?

461
00:49:08,098 --> 00:49:10,768
It's like spending a weekend
in Beverly Hills.

462
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:14,313
Hey, don't bother to help. It's a light car.

463
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:18,776
Were you scared? Do you believe in God?

464
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:21,194
Do I believe in God?

465
00:49:21,444 --> 00:49:25,615
I'm what you would call
a teleological existential atheist.

466
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:30,662
I believe there's an intelligence to the
universe, except for parts of New Jersey.

467
00:49:30,912 --> 00:49:34,707
Why is it I never understand
what you're saying?

468
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,917
Why? Do you believe in God?

469
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:42,297
Well, I believe that there's somebody
out there who watches over us.

470
00:49:42,548 --> 00:49:45,342
- Unfortunately, it's the government.
- Miles.

471
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:52,473
Miles, did you ever realise
that "god" spelt backwards is "dog"?

472
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:58,398
- Yeah. So?
- It makes you think.

473
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:00,024
Yeah.

474
00:50:00,275 --> 00:50:02,193
Do you wanna push the car, please?

475
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:06,030
Push the car, will you?

476
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:08,365
- Ready?
- Yeah.

477
00:50:08,615 --> 00:50:12,202
All right, let's go!

478
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:25,506
- Nice work.
- Just my luck. It landed on a turtle.

479
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:30,178
Hey, I know this place.
This is where they first brought me.

480
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:35,516
- It looks deserted.
- Boy, we really have gone wrong.

481
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,018
Hey... Hey, look at this.

482
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,812
I wonder who their decorator is.

483
00:50:41,062 --> 00:50:43,023
- What's the matter?
- I heard something.

484
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,901
- It's probably futuristic mice.
- I'm scared.

485
00:50:46,151 --> 00:50:48,489
There's nothing to be scared of.
You're with me.

486
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:52,451
I did that. What...

487
00:50:56,037 --> 00:51:00,833
For God's sakes, get a grip on yourself.
You need a drink.

488
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:04,545
Come on. Try.

489
00:51:58,597 --> 00:52:00,307
<i>- Who are you?
- Me?</i>

490
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:04,311
<i>Get off my channel.</i>

491
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:09,984
<i>What are you doing?</i>

492
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:13,319
<i>Who is that guy?</i>

493
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,989
I couldn't make enough money
playing jazz,

494
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,533
so I had to open up
the health-food place.

495
00:52:18,783 --> 00:52:21,411
- Weren't you any good?
- Yeah, I was all right but

496
00:52:21,661 --> 00:52:24,956
I always felt that to really play jazz,
you had to be black.

497
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:27,708
- I'm just a mulatto.
- You?

498
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,254
Yeah. You knew that about me,
didn't you?

499
00:52:30,504 --> 00:52:32,214
- No.
- Yeah, I am.

500
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:34,925
- You're joking.
- I wouldn't kid about that.

501
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:38,721
My father was black
and my mother was white and vice versa.

502
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:41,390
Come on, Miles. You "are" joking.

503
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,560
I'm always joking. You know that.
It's a defence mechanism.

504
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:48,438
Do you wanna perform sex with me?

505
00:52:48,688 --> 00:52:50,440
Perform sex?

506
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:54,152
I'm not up to a performance,
but I'll rehearse with you if you like.

507
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:57,864
OK. I just thought you might want to.
There have a machine here.

508
00:52:58,114 --> 00:53:02,076
Machine? I'm not getting into that thing.
I'm strictly a hand operator.

509
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:05,996
I don't like anything with
moving parts that are not my own.

510
00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:09,875
It's hard to believe
that you haven't had sex for 200 years.

511
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,836
204, if you count my marriage.

512
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:17,840
- What did your wife do?
- She was a hit man for the Mafia.

513
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:20,929
- Was... Was she beautiful?
- Yeah, she was great.

514
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:24,933
Blonde hair, great upturned nose.

515
00:53:25,183 --> 00:53:29,895
It was really dynamite. Two blue eyes...
one on either side, of course.

516
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:32,689
I liked the arrangement.
That's why I married her.

517
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,609
- See, you are. You're teasing me again.
- No.

518
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:38,821
Yes. You think I'm stupid.

519
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:41,490
No. How can you say that?

520
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,159
I think that you're bright and...
and sensitive and...

521
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:49,247
Beautiful. Yeah. Well, then,
how come you're not attracted to me?

522
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:51,999
You know, I mean, men go crazy over me.

523
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,753
I'm great physically.
I got a PhD in oral sex.

524
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:58,715
- They make you take Spanish with that?
- What?

525
00:53:58,965 --> 00:54:02,634
I don't know. I was an English major.
Chaucer. Pope.

526
00:54:02,884 --> 00:54:05,971
I minored in foreplay.
It's a two-credit course at NYU...

527
00:54:06,221 --> 00:54:09,015
Miles. You're not taking me seriously.

528
00:54:09,268 --> 00:54:12,938
What do you want me to say if you say
"Do you wanna perform sex with me?"

529
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:17,525
It's so cold. I need to be warmed up
and sent flowers, romanced.

530
00:54:17,775 --> 00:54:19,944
Sex is different today. You see?

531
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:23,364
We don't have any problems.
Everybody's frigid.

532
00:54:23,614 --> 00:54:27,660
That's incredible. Are the men impotent?

533
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:32,622
Yeah. Most of 'em, except for
the ones whose ancestors are Italian.

534
00:54:32,873 --> 00:54:37,544
Right.
I knew there was something in that pasta.

535
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:49,597
You wanna get in the machine now?

536
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:52,933
No. We don't need that. Really, I...

537
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:56,020
I think it would be great if we did.
I wouldn't be frigid...

538
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:58,856
You wouldn't be frigid with me.
Nobody ever is.

539
00:54:59,106 --> 00:55:01,652
I got the magic fingers.
You know, I swear.

540
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:05,781
I've cured more women of frigidity.
It's my specialty.

541
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:09,451
Two minutes in bed with me
and you'll sell that thing for scrap iron.

542
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:11,828
I got a lot of fast moves. Really.

543
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,458
The only thing is, I have asthma,
so if you hear some wheezing, it's me.

544
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,960
But give me a decent burial and...

545
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:23,422
<i>This is the police.
We have the premises surrounded.</i>

546
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:26,467
<i>Come out with your hands up...</i>

547
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:30,429
Hide in this room. I'll lead them away.
Contact the underground.

548
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:33,224
Find out what the Aires Project is.
Remember that?

549
00:55:33,474 --> 00:55:35,642
- Yes. The Jupiter Project.
- Aires.

550
00:55:35,892 --> 00:55:37,811
The Aires Project. What about you?

551
00:55:38,061 --> 00:55:43,650
Don't worry about me, honey. I'm like
a cat. I'll always wind up on my feet.

552
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:26,942
Mr Monroe? I'm Dr Nero,
your orientation advisor.

553
00:56:27,192 --> 00:56:31,196
I'm here to supervise the initial phase
of your assimilation into society,

554
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:36,410
a society that will take care of your
needs and desires with great efficiency.

555
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:41,916
Now, you get a good rest
and next week you'll begin a new life.

556
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:54,762
- Subject prepared for a total brainwash.
- Programmed for 1970s reference data.

557
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:57,598
Proceed to 200, level D,
programming code omega.

558
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:00,017
All systems proceeding. Activate subject.

559
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:03,479
Our Miss America contest
is down to the five finalists.

560
00:57:03,729 --> 00:57:06,732
Miss Alabama, Miss Florida,

561
00:57:06,982 --> 00:57:11,861
Miss California,
Miss Hawaii and Miss Montana.

562
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:16,115
Now, in order to test
the contestants' personalities,

563
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,409
we're going to ask each a question.

564
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:25,749
Miss Montana, if you could do anything
for mankind, what would it be?

565
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:31,256
- He's not responding.
- Go up half a cycle.

566
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:36,720
I would use my title to bring peace
to all nations of the world,

567
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:42,141
be it black, be they white,
be it coloured, be it whatever.

568
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,228
And now for that moment
you've been waiting for.

569
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:50,024
First, we're going to give you
Miss Personality and Miss Congenial.

570
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:54,696
Miss Florida and Miss Hawaii.

571
00:57:54,946 --> 00:58:00,242
And the second runner-up is...
Miss California.

572
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:05,205
Finally, the first runner-up,
who will take over first place

573
00:58:05,455 --> 00:58:07,666
if the winner is unable to fulfil

574
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:10,627
the duties and obligations
that go with winning.

575
00:58:10,876 --> 00:58:13,337
The first runner-up... Miss Alabama.

576
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:17,133
Which means that the winner is...

577
00:58:17,383 --> 00:58:20,888
Miss Montana.

578
00:58:49,832 --> 00:58:54,962
Anybody here?
I have a new citizen to be outfitted.

579
00:58:56,255 --> 00:59:00,800
You want jackets, we got jackets.
You want trousers, we got trousers.

580
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:05,263
This is a good time, believe me.
We're having a big sale. Tremendous.

581
00:59:05,513 --> 00:59:09,351
Positively the lowest prices.
Maybe you need a nice double-knit?

582
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:13,273
- I'm stuck with three-pieces corduroy.
- Something simple.

583
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:17,109
We got simple, we got complicated.
Why do you worry?

584
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,364
- Who put that shipment downstairs?
- Why d'you bother me? I got a customer.

585
00:59:21,614 --> 00:59:23,991
You know what you're doin'?
That was all velvet.

586
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:27,244
So it's velvet.
Leave me alone. I got a customer.

587
00:59:27,495 --> 00:59:29,412
- Why do we need so much velvet?
- What?

588
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,916
- Where do we come to velvet?
- I'll talk to you later.

589
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:35,418
I'm in a bit of a rush here, if it's OK.

590
00:59:35,669 --> 00:59:37,963
You know
what your mistakes are costing us?

591
00:59:38,213 --> 00:59:40,632
Drop dead. You wanna drop dead?

592
00:59:40,882 --> 00:59:44,469
OK, step against the screen.

593
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:10,954
- This is terrible.
- OK, OK. We'll take it in.

594
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:15,166
<i>You'll work at the function complex.</i>

595
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:19,837
<i>It's a required service of all citizens.</i>

596
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:29,305
This is where you'll be living.
It's a gift from our leader.

597
01:00:29,555 --> 01:00:34,225
Isn't this pretty?
I think you're really gonna like it here.

598
01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:38,896
That's your orientation pamphlet.
It has the names of all your new friends.

599
01:00:39,147 --> 01:00:43,359
There will be conversation
and discussion assemblies twice a week.

600
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:47,988
After you've moved into your permanent
home, you'll enjoy mechanised servants.

601
01:00:48,238 --> 01:00:53,245
Until then, you can have
a computerised dog. Rags!

602
01:00:53,495 --> 01:00:56,957
Woof, woof, woof.

603
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:59,627
Hello, I'm Rags. Woof...

604
01:00:59,877 --> 01:01:04,881
Is he house-broken or will he leave
batteries all over the floor?

605
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:15,116
Don't yell. We're with the underground.

606
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:23,164
Once this week
I questioned my supervisor

607
01:02:23,415 --> 01:02:27,419
and I missed a couple of minutes
of our leader's speech on television.

608
01:02:27,669 --> 01:02:32,551
And you know that blonde girl,
Rainer, who works in my office with me?

609
01:02:32,801 --> 01:02:37,555
She's got... With the long blonde hair
and the... great tomatoes.

610
01:02:37,805 --> 01:02:42,310
We've been sneaking into the projection
room on our lunch hour and making love.

611
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,856
I know if they catch us, it's against
the rules, but I can't help it.

612
01:02:47,106 --> 01:02:51,611
I'm... And I hope that you forgive me.

613
01:03:23,017 --> 01:03:26,603
Hello, Miles.

614
01:03:26,728 --> 01:03:30,941
- Who are you?
- Who am I? I'm Luna.

615
01:03:31,191 --> 01:03:33,818
- Who?
- Luna.

616
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:38,073
Don't you remember?
We were outlaws, aliens.

617
01:03:38,323 --> 01:03:41,242
The police captured you. I escaped.

618
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:44,328
I'm with the underground.

619
01:03:44,578 --> 01:03:46,497
Remember? The Western District?

620
01:03:46,747 --> 01:03:49,416
Miles, I'm Luna.

621
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:52,545
Luna! Remember? Luna.

622
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:56,506
- Your name is not Luna, is it?
- Think back, Miles.

623
01:03:56,756 --> 01:04:01,761
1973. The Happy Carrot Health-Food
Store? The Ragtime Rascals?

624
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:05,557
- You're the alien.
- That's right, Miles. I've come for you.

625
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:08,518
How did you get in here?
Don't come near me. Rags!

626
01:04:08,768 --> 01:04:13,023
- Miles.
- Rags, get in here. Come on, boy.

627
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:15,818
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- Come on, Rags!

628
01:04:16,068 --> 01:04:19,196
- Get her! Go for her throat, Rags.
- Woof, woof, woof, woof.

629
01:04:19,446 --> 01:04:22,825
We're going to reprogramme your mind.
We're going to free it.

630
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:25,910
- Rags, get her. Come on, Rags. Kill.
- Woof, woof, woof.

631
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:30,039
Go ahead. Goddamn dog.

632
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:35,628
Hello, I'm Rags. Woof, woof, woof.

633
01:04:44,178 --> 01:04:46,013
We have a good file on him.

634
01:04:46,263 --> 01:04:48,140
We'll induce a hypnotic state

635
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:52,477
and force him to re-experience
some of the major traumas of his life.

636
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:55,522
Hopefully,
this'll shatter his recent personality

637
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:58,816
and allow the old one to emerge again.

638
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:00,818
My orb, my...

639
01:05:01,068 --> 01:05:03,698
You won't need that any more, Miles.

640
01:05:03,948 --> 01:05:08,536
Now, listen to me, Miles.
It's the year 1962.

641
01:05:08,786 --> 01:05:12,540
It's time for that Sunday dinner
at your parents' house.

642
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:16,919
Your parents' house
in Brooklyn on K Avenue.

643
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:20,380
No.

644
01:05:23,008 --> 01:05:28,763
What are you standing there?
Come in. Your food is getting cold.

645
01:05:29,013 --> 01:05:32,558
- Let's eat.
- Miles, take some peas.

646
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:37,396
The Passover holidays are coming and
you'll be wanting to wear your matzos.

647
01:05:37,647 --> 01:05:41,692
I've got something to tell you.
Arlene and I have to get a divorce.

648
01:05:41,943 --> 01:05:45,278
She thinks I'm a pervert
because I drank our waterbed.

649
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:49,366
<i>Oi vai iz mirl</i>

650
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:55,582
<i>Oi, gevaldl. What will them "goyims" say?</i>

651
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,417
No.

652
01:05:57,668 --> 01:06:02,088
Stop whining and eat your "shikseh".

653
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,048
Oh, no.

654
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:08,302
No, please. Don't let in the light.
Cover those lights, please.

655
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:13,641
Please, don't get up.
I was just passing through.

656
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:17,018
Erno. Erno, what's happening?

657
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,479
Something's gone wrong
with the treatment.

658
01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:22,607
His brain is elsewhere.
He believes he's another person.

659
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:28,155
- No, no. I need magic.
- Miles. Miles. Who are you, Miles?

660
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:31,157
I'm Blanche... Blanche Dubois.

661
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:34,285
It means white wood.

662
01:06:34,535 --> 01:06:38,873
- We can't upset him or it could be fatal.
- What are we gonna do?

663
01:06:39,123 --> 01:06:42,918
You read "A Streetcar Named Desire".
Just play along. He needs an injection.

664
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:47,257
Physical beauty is passing,
a transitory possession.

665
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:52,304
But beauty of the mind and richness
of the spirit and tenderness of the heart -

666
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:55,056
- and I have all those things -

667
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:59,853
- aren't taken away, but grow,
increase, with the years.

668
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:03,522
Strange that I should be called
a destitute woman

669
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:09,153
when I have all these riches
locked in my heart.

670
01:07:14,158 --> 01:07:17,411
I been onto you from the start.

671
01:07:17,661 --> 01:07:20,914
I seen how you tried to sprinkle
this place up with them

672
01:07:21,164 --> 01:07:25,960
powders and those
fancy French colognes.

673
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:29,297
Well, I say ha!

674
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:34,303
You hear me? Ha! Ha!

675
01:07:34,553 --> 01:07:38,724
I think... I... Yeah.

676
01:07:38,974 --> 01:07:45,397
Why, you're not the gentleman that
I was expecting. What's going on?

677
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:52,821
Whoever you are, I've always
depended on the kindness of strangers.

678
01:07:53,988 --> 01:07:58,660
- How you feelin', Miles?
- You look beautiful.

679
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:01,496
You were screaming out names
in your sleep.

680
01:08:01,746 --> 01:08:06,125
Oh. I was having sexual nightmares.

681
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:09,503
Who are the A&P Gypsies?

682
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:13,173
- You look so different.
- I feel different, Miles.

683
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:16,552
I've spent the past six months
living like a wild animal.

684
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:18,720
- Really?
- That's right. All of us.

685
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:22,849
All of us in the underground. We all live
on our cunning and our instinct.

686
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:27,981
- We're all a pack of wild animals.
- Lunch, Luna.

687
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:35,321
While you were being a pawn
in capitalistic society,

688
01:08:35,572 --> 01:08:38,282
Erno's been teaching me
the beauty of Karl Marx.

689
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:40,743
- Who's been teaching you?
- Erno.

690
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:43,370
You absolutely must meet him.
He's wonderful.

691
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,791
In a few months he's going to lead
the revolution and start a Marxist regime.

692
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,003
Government by the workers
and the downtrodden masses.

693
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:54,297
- You remind me of Lisa Sorenson.
- Who?

694
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,466
An old girlfriend of mine.

695
01:08:56,716 --> 01:09:01,679
A Trotskyite Jesus freak, arrested for
selling pornographic dot-to-dot books.

696
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,223
Miles, I wrote a song about the revolution.

697
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:08,685
There's not gonna be any revolution
unless we stop the Aires Project.

698
01:09:08,935 --> 01:09:12,981
Don't you worry about that.
Just relax. Listen.

699
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:15,778
Rebels are we

700
01:09:16,028 --> 01:09:18,697
Born to be free

701
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:24,327
Just like the fish in the sea!

702
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,674
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that you were... kissing.

703
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:45,305
Miles. I was just telling Erno
about Aires Day. He has a plan, Miles.

704
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:47,641
You tell him, Erno.

705
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:50,602
Right, darling.

706
01:09:50,852 --> 01:09:54,522
- This is a one-channel radio.
- W-What, darling?

707
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:57,608
<i>This... This is a phoney thumbprint.</i>

708
01:09:57,858 --> 01:10:01,153
<i>It'll allow her to pass through
the security scanning device.</i>

709
01:10:01,404 --> 01:10:07,912
<i>We're gonna steal operating gowns
and pose as doctors to get inside.</i>

710
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:21,758
OK, try not to appear nervous. Smile.

711
01:10:22,008 --> 01:10:25,178
- Peasants.
- Relax. You're shaking like a leaf.

712
01:10:25,428 --> 01:10:28,055
- How do you want me to shake?
- Everything'll be fine.

713
01:10:28,305 --> 01:10:31,684
- So how come you're shaking?
- You're making me nervous.

714
01:10:31,934 --> 01:10:33,894
Don't blame me.

715
01:10:34,145 --> 01:10:37,440
- Hello.
- Will you get a grip on yourself?

716
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:40,609
You'd probably feel safer
with Mr White Teeth back there.

717
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:44,821
- Who?
- The rebel with the wall-to-wall muscles.

718
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:46,531
- You mean Erno?
- Yeah.

719
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:49,743
It's a great name if you're the star
of a vampire movie.

720
01:10:49,993 --> 01:10:53,121
- He's brilliant.
- I know. He couldn't be with us today.

721
01:10:53,371 --> 01:10:56,293
- He's gotta take his handsome lesson.
- You're jealous.

722
01:10:56,542 --> 01:11:00,004
Are you kiddin'? With a body like mine,
you don't get jealous.

723
01:11:00,254 --> 01:11:02,423
Don't expect me to tie myself to one man.

724
01:11:02,673 --> 01:11:05,134
My love is a free gift
to all the Bolshevik brothers.

725
01:11:05,384 --> 01:11:07,678
Do what you want. You're over 21.

726
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:11,182
- Little tramp.
- We're here on business.

727
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:13,600
Free love. I created a Bohemian monster.

728
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:16,102
Next she'll want group sex
with the robots.

729
01:11:16,353 --> 01:11:18,229
Shut up. You're attracting attention.

730
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,067
Give her a book and she's
Miss pseudo-intellectual, neofascist,

731
01:11:22,317 --> 01:11:25,195
- Hegelian Freudian monster.
- Don't get hysterical.

732
01:11:25,445 --> 01:11:27,614
Get your part right. Don't worry about me.

733
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:31,658
- If we get screwed up, it's cos of you.
- "If we get screwed up, it's cos of you. "

734
01:11:31,909 --> 01:11:34,328
I'm on a mission with a retarded man.

735
01:11:34,578 --> 01:11:37,581
- Just get your part right.
- You get your part right.

736
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:44,253
What am I doing here? I'm 237 years old.
I should be collecting social security.

737
01:11:51,888 --> 01:11:56,518
Do you remember the diagram? There's
fast forward, dual control, overheat...

738
01:11:56,768 --> 01:12:00,312
- OK. We've been over all this.
- I know. But I wanna be sure you got it.

739
01:12:00,562 --> 01:12:04,983
I'm the guy goin' out the window. It's a
long drop. I'm liable to bruise my smock.

740
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:07,945
All right, Miles. Don't worry. I got it.

741
01:12:08,195 --> 01:12:11,281
- This is the manual.
- No, that's the rewind.

742
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:14,659
- Then this is the manual.
- No, that's the dual control.

743
01:12:14,909 --> 01:12:19,372
- I thought you said you had it.
- I do. I have it, I have it.

744
01:12:19,622 --> 01:12:21,791
You love Erno?

745
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:26,504
Oh, Miles. I don't know.

746
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:40,144
All right, the coast is clear.
Start lowering me.

747
01:12:40,394 --> 01:12:42,438
This is... manual.

748
01:12:42,688 --> 01:12:46,024
No, that's fast forward.

749
01:13:27,815 --> 01:13:29,609
Miles.

750
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:32,528
Look, I... I got some tape around.

751
01:13:32,778 --> 01:13:36,531
For a minute I thought
you couldn't work the machine.

752
01:13:36,782 --> 01:13:41,119
- Erno said to take the north escalator.
- I'm running this. We're going "my" way.

753
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:44,122
It's Erno's plan.
He knows what he's talking about.

754
01:13:44,373 --> 01:13:46,958
Why does he know? Cos he's handsome?

755
01:13:47,209 --> 01:13:51,629
He's got capped teeth. Did you know? He
has capped teeth. He's got capped gums.

756
01:13:51,879 --> 01:13:57,468
- He is an architect and a mathematician.
- Yeah. But can he do this?

757
01:13:58,302 --> 01:14:00,680
- You're an idiot.
- We're going my way.

758
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,557
Fine.

759
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:11,022
Dr Temkin, there you are.
Come with us. The meeting's this way.

760
01:14:11,272 --> 01:14:14,859
Doctor.

761
01:14:20,324 --> 01:14:23,703
- We're doctors. We're not impostors.
- Dr Temkin, could we please?

762
01:14:23,953 --> 01:14:26,706
Big doctor. Very big.
Eyes, ears, nose and throat.

763
01:14:26,956 --> 01:14:31,085
Please. May we? May we, Doctor, please?

764
01:14:32,545 --> 01:14:35,505
- Nice work.
- They think we're someone else.

765
01:14:35,755 --> 01:14:39,551
I know. If we'd followed
Erno's instructions, everything'd be OK.

766
01:14:39,801 --> 01:14:41,761
I don't wanna hear about Erno.

767
01:14:42,012 --> 01:14:45,223
That's the only thing
that makes me st-stutter.

768
01:14:45,473 --> 01:14:48,560
It's always Erno.
I'm tired of Erno. No more Erno.

769
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:52,855
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- All right.

770
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:03,032
<i>Gentlemen, none of you have ever met
before for obvious reasons of security.</i>

771
01:15:03,282 --> 01:15:06,368
<i>But now Aires Day is here.</i>

772
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:10,707
<i>I realise what I'm about to say
will come as a great shock.</i>

773
01:15:10,957 --> 01:15:14,794
<i>However, I'm counting on you
to respond appropriately.</i>

774
01:15:15,045 --> 01:15:18,465
<i>Ten months ago our leader
suffered a horrible accident</i>

775
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:22,885
<i>when a bomb, planted in his home
by the underground, exploded.</i>

776
01:15:23,135 --> 01:15:25,137
<i>Naturally it was kept quiet,</i>

777
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:28,682
<i>but since then we have virtually
been a leaderless society.</i>

778
01:15:28,933 --> 01:15:34,480
<i>Unfortunately, preparations
for a successor have never been clear.</i>

779
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:39,275
<i>In short, we have been in the throes
of a major crisis.</i>

780
01:15:39,525 --> 01:15:41,277
<i>As for our leader,</i>

781
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:46,074
<i>the emergency department rushed to
the scene of the accident immediately,</i>

782
01:15:46,324 --> 01:15:49,994
<i>but all that remained of him was this.</i>

783
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:53,164
<i>This is our leader's nose.</i>

784
01:15:53,413 --> 01:15:55,791
<i>Using great presence of mind,</i>

785
01:15:56,041 --> 01:16:00,714
<i>we rushed the nose to our closest
delta laboratory, which is here,</i>

786
01:16:00,965 --> 01:16:03,926
<i>where, through
massive biochemical effort,</i>

787
01:16:04,176 --> 01:16:07,846
<i>it has been kept alive for nearly a year.</i>

788
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:11,391
<i>Our dream has been that by cloning</i>

789
01:16:11,641 --> 01:16:15,979
<i>we would reduplicate
the entire leader again.</i>

790
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:19,816
<i>Cloning, for those of you
unfamiliar with biology,</i>

791
01:16:20,066 --> 01:16:24,153
<i>is a process by which,
using one single cell,</i>

792
01:16:24,404 --> 01:16:27,864
<i>a duplicate of the person it came from
could be formed.</i>

793
01:16:28,115 --> 01:16:32,995
<i>Till now, we've only had
limited experimental success,</i>

794
01:16:33,245 --> 01:16:37,082
<i>but all efforts have been directed
to cloning over the past ten months.</i>

795
01:16:37,332 --> 01:16:44,046
<i>And now we feel confident we can
reproduce our leader from his nose.</i>

796
01:16:44,297 --> 01:16:50,805
<i>Gentlemen, with God's help, in a couple
of hours, we will have our leader back.</i>

797
01:16:51,055 --> 01:16:53,391
<i>And we will then coordinate
Aires Phase Two,</i>

798
01:16:53,641 --> 01:17:01,398
<i>which will exterminate all dissident
factions on signal from our reborn leader.</i>

799
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,405
- Miles, it's a nose.
- I know. I was here.

800
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:12,074
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll radio Erno. It's time to strike.

801
01:17:12,325 --> 01:17:15,286
The leader has a terrific handicap.
He has no head or body.

802
01:17:15,536 --> 01:17:19,373
- We're not fully prepared.
- It doesn't matter. They're in chaos.

803
01:17:19,624 --> 01:17:22,001
- OK. Gimme the radio.
- I dropped it.

804
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:24,420
- You dropped it?
- It fell out of my pocket...

805
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,464
- Fell out of your pocket...
- Stop repeating what I say.

806
01:17:27,714 --> 01:17:29,799
- Stop repeating...
- Get a grip on yourself.

807
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:33,220
- We gotta stop 'em.
- The only way is to steal the nose.

808
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:37,098
- How?
- I don't know. I never stole an organ.

809
01:17:37,349 --> 01:17:39,353
- Wait a minute. I got an idea.
- Yeah.

810
01:17:39,603 --> 01:17:43,439
The nose is in the operating chamber.
We go to the floor below.

811
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:46,901
Cut a hole in the ceiling,
big enough to slide through.

812
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:49,904
Come up under the nose
and hide it under my coat.

813
01:17:50,154 --> 01:17:52,114
- It's a stupid plan.
- What's wrong?

814
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:56,577
It's too subtle. We have no time for that.
We go into the operating room.

815
01:17:56,827 --> 01:18:00,580
You create a diversion. I steal the nose.

816
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:05,627
- Miles, I'm scared.
- Easy. You took some skin there.

817
01:18:05,877 --> 01:18:08,630
- Here.
- What is that? A table lighter?

818
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,800
You gave it to me from Melik's
before they captured you.

819
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:16,095
Where you been hiding it? Don't tell me.

820
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:19,181
The trick in these situations
is to remain cool.

821
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:21,809
- You're biting my nails.
- Cos you're tense.

822
01:18:22,059 --> 01:18:26,438
We're here to see the nose.
I heard it was running.

823
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,821
Dr Temkin, we're ready on this end.

824
01:18:33,071 --> 01:18:35,073
You don't mind if some younger people

825
01:18:35,323 --> 01:18:38,034
not involved
in genetic programming observe?

826
01:18:38,285 --> 01:18:41,329
No, not at all.
I like to be watched while I clone.

827
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:45,958
The more the merrier.
I never... I never clone alone.

828
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:49,420
<i>Hello, Dr Temkin. So nice to see you.</i>

829
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:53,090
<i>I'm Bio Central Computer 2100, Series G.</i>

830
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:56,427
<i>I'll be assisting you
through the entire process.</i>

831
01:18:56,677 --> 01:18:59,722
<i>May I say, we're all aware
of your reputation</i>

832
01:18:59,972 --> 01:19:04,434
<i>and we look forward
to a successful cloning procedure.</i>

833
01:19:04,684 --> 01:19:07,437
- This is my assistant, D-D-Dr Spock.
- Janice.

834
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:12,734
- Dr Janice. Dr Spock. Spanis.
- Dr Spanice. Dr Smanice. Slock. Smock.

835
01:19:12,984 --> 01:19:14,736
- Dr Slanice.
- Doctor.

836
01:19:14,986 --> 01:19:18,741
I better have a look at the patient.

837
01:19:21,994 --> 01:19:24,538
He's in a lot worse shape than I thought.

838
01:19:24,788 --> 01:19:27,124
Better lay off Armenian women.

839
01:19:27,374 --> 01:19:32,420
<i>You can see the coded
medical history on read-out four.</i>

840
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:37,509
I believe that this is going to be
a very difficult croning job.

841
01:19:37,759 --> 01:19:41,221
- Yes. Cloning, you idiot, not croning.
- Cloning.

842
01:19:41,471 --> 01:19:45,558
<i>We are ready to proceed.</i>

843
01:19:45,767 --> 01:19:47,268
After looking at the nose,

844
01:19:47,519 --> 01:19:51,396
I get the feeling what we oughta do
perhaps is postpone the cloning.

845
01:19:51,647 --> 01:19:55,234
<i>Excuse me, Doctor, but
that would be a tragic mistake.</i>

846
01:19:55,484 --> 01:20:00,822
I think the computer is failing to take into
account what I call the Pinocchio factor.

847
01:20:01,073 --> 01:20:05,201
It states that the square root of the
proboscis equals the sum of the sinuses

848
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:06,410
over seven.

849
01:20:06,661 --> 01:20:12,418
What is "your" opinion, Doctor?
Should we proceed or postpone?

850
01:20:12,669 --> 01:20:15,338
Indeed.

851
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:19,174
One moment. A moment.
A medical moment.

852
01:20:19,424 --> 01:20:23,178
Yes. Well...

853
01:20:23,428 --> 01:20:26,056
I believe that we should
go ahead with the cloning.

854
01:20:26,306 --> 01:20:28,058
Go ahead with...

855
01:20:28,308 --> 01:20:31,687
I have to have a conference
with the doctor for a second...

856
01:20:31,937 --> 01:20:33,647
I just wanna speak to you...

857
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:36,941
- What do you mean?
- What are we supposed to do?

858
01:20:37,191 --> 01:20:43,406
- I don't know how to clone a nose.
- You're crazy. I'm sick of this.

859
01:20:43,531 --> 01:20:46,117
I'm sick of this. You make me crazy.

860
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:49,078
- Doctor, would you please proceed?
- You stop it!

861
01:20:49,328 --> 01:20:52,622
Get a grip on yourself.

862
01:20:52,873 --> 01:20:55,500
Of course. I'm glad you put it
to me in that fashion.

863
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:59,590
Now, if you'll let me have the lobster fork.
Thank you very much.

864
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,801
What you have here...
I've diagnosed the situation.

865
01:21:03,051 --> 01:21:05,679
I think what we're dealing with is a nose.

866
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:09,724
I think we're all in agreeance on that.
I have the little beggar right here.

867
01:21:09,974 --> 01:21:15,480
And what you want is a whole, entire
person connected to that nose, right?

868
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:17,607
Otherwise you get your money back.

869
01:21:17,857 --> 01:21:20,526
Now, did you want me
to leave room for a moustache?

870
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:24,863
There's a nice area there. It'll... It's...

871
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:27,449
What?

872
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:30,952
She's clever. The doctor's
placing down the garments

873
01:21:31,203 --> 01:21:36,416
cos we're gonna make an attempt
to clone the patient directly into his suit.

874
01:21:36,666 --> 01:21:39,710
That way, he'll be dressed
at the end of the operation.

875
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,005
It's a first in cloning,
and we can all get the hell outta here.

876
01:21:43,255 --> 01:21:45,633
No need to hang around while he suits up.

877
01:21:45,883 --> 01:21:48,177
<i>I think it's time to check the cell structure.</i>

878
01:21:48,427 --> 01:21:51,974
Yes. Checking the cell structure.
Checking the cell structure.

879
01:21:52,225 --> 01:21:55,602
- Ah, checking the cell structure.
- Checking the cell structure.

880
01:21:55,852 --> 01:21:57,604
Structure of cells to be checked.

881
01:21:57,854 --> 01:22:01,191
- Checking the cell structure.
- Checking the cells.

882
01:22:01,441 --> 01:22:04,820
Checking cell structure.
Checking the cell structure.

883
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:09,156
And now the cell structure
has been checked. Thank you so much.

884
01:22:09,406 --> 01:22:15,037
Now I'll just take my mask, if you don't
mind, and I'll strap it on to my face.

885
01:22:15,287 --> 01:22:16,163
And...

886
01:22:16,413 --> 01:22:21,043
If you'll excuse me for one second while
I give the patient a quick... nostrilectomy.

887
01:22:21,293 --> 01:22:23,212
This is it. Keep your fingers crossed.

888
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:28,133
<i>Something's going wrong. There's been
a current break in the life-support system.</i>

889
01:22:28,383 --> 01:22:31,845
- What I think we should do...
- What's that under your mask?

890
01:22:32,095 --> 01:22:35,098
Pardon me? Under my mask?
Nothing. Why?

891
01:22:35,348 --> 01:22:38,476
Is... Does it look excessively bulbous?

892
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:44,275
- He's got the nose.
- He's got the nose under his mask.

893
01:22:47,403 --> 01:22:50,197
Right. Nobody move
or I shoot your president.

894
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:53,951
Come on. We're getting outta here.

895
01:22:58,746 --> 01:23:02,000
Don't come near me,
or he gets it right between the eyes.

896
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:05,503
He'll do it. He'll do it.
I've seen him shoot a nose.

897
01:23:05,753 --> 01:23:08,089
Please. Please, be careful.

898
01:23:08,339 --> 01:23:12,342
You don't realise you're dealing with
one of the greatest minds you've seen.

899
01:23:12,593 --> 01:23:16,555
- Yeah. And his isn't so bad either.
- Yeah.

900
01:23:16,805 --> 01:23:18,682
Don't come near us.

901
01:23:18,932 --> 01:23:20,225
Get outta here now.

902
01:23:20,476 --> 01:23:23,437
He's bluffing. He wouldn't shoot the nose.

903
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:29,275
Bluffing, am I?
OK, clowns. You asked for it.

904
01:24:29,919 --> 01:24:31,087
I can't believe it.

905
01:24:31,337 --> 01:24:32,713
We actually did it.

906
01:24:32,964 --> 01:24:36,134
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
and a nose for a nose.

907
01:24:36,384 --> 01:24:38,594
Whatever it means, it sounds brilliant.

908
01:24:38,845 --> 01:24:40,972
You were absolutely wonderful.

909
01:24:41,222 --> 01:24:43,433
Just think. Erno's plan worked.

910
01:24:43,683 --> 01:24:46,810
What do you mean, Erno's plan?
What was I through all of that?

911
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:51,940
- What do you mean? It was Erno's plan.
- Look, I cannot discuss Erno with you.

912
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:55,569
I'm getting a hostility ache,
and a migraine headache now.

913
01:24:55,819 --> 01:24:58,280
I haven't seen my analyst in 200 years.

914
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:01,782
He was a strict Freudian
and if I'd been going all this time,

915
01:25:02,032 --> 01:25:03,826
I'd almost be cured by now.

916
01:25:04,076 --> 01:25:07,997
Miles. Erno's going to lead the revolution
and head the new government.

917
01:25:08,247 --> 01:25:12,336
Don't you understand? In six months,
we'll be stealing Erno's nose.

918
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:14,922
Political solutions don't work.

919
01:25:15,173 --> 01:25:18,675
It doesn't matter who's up there.
They're all terrible...

920
01:25:18,925 --> 01:25:25,015
- What are you looking at me like that for?
- I think you really love me.

921
01:25:25,474 --> 01:25:29,436
Of course I love you.
This is what this is all about.

922
01:25:29,686 --> 01:25:33,856
And you love me. I know that.
And I don't blame you, honey.

923
01:25:34,106 --> 01:25:35,983
And I'm not knocking Erno.

924
01:25:36,233 --> 01:25:43,657
He's great if you happen to like a tall,
blond, Prussian, Nordic, Aryan, Nazi type.

925
01:25:43,908 --> 01:25:47,911
But, Miles, meaningful relationships
between men and women don't last.

926
01:25:48,161 --> 01:25:52,999
That was proven by science. You see,
there's a chemical in our bodies

927
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:56,544
that makes us get
on each other's nerves sooner or later.

928
01:25:56,795 --> 01:25:59,506
That's science. I don't believe in science.

929
01:25:59,756 --> 01:26:02,636
Science is an intellectual dead end.

930
01:26:02,885 --> 01:26:07,473
It's a lot of guys in tweed suits, cutting
up frogs on foundation grants and...

931
01:26:07,723 --> 01:26:09,975
I see. You don't believe in science.

932
01:26:10,226 --> 01:26:13,604
And you also don't believe
that political systems work

933
01:26:13,854 --> 01:26:15,773
and you don't believe in God, huh?

934
01:26:16,023 --> 01:26:20,527
- Right.
- So, then... what do you believe in?

935
01:26:20,777 --> 01:26:22,695
Sex and death.

936
01:26:22,946 --> 01:26:25,949
Two things that come once in a lifetime.

937
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:31,121
But at least after death
you're not nauseous.

938
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:42,121
