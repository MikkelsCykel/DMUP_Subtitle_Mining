1
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,710
"Amazing Grace."

2
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,370
Excuse me?

3
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,710
My grandmother used to sing
that song to me.

4
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,420
That's real nice.

5
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,800
I especially like the part that goes:

6
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,720
"l once was lost, but now l'm found."

7
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,140
Take you, for instance. You have got to be
a fool to roll up in here, man.

8
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,720
But l figure you must be lost.

9
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,940
So I tell you what. See this here?
This is for your bill.

10
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,440
And...

11
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,440
...since you look like
such a jovial individual...

12
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,490
...here's for the tip.

13
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,850
So why don't you find your ass out of here?

14
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,480
We haven't finished our drinks.

15
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,060
You finished now?

16
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,940
Let it go, Po.

17
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,230
This is a hassle we don't need.

18
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,580
And don't come back, zipperhead.

19
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,460
Po, get them out of here!

20
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,880
Now.

21
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,140
Let's go.

22
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,350
Guess you want to gamble
with your life.

23
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,180
Casino's as good a place as any.

24
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,780
Guess l could use a little exercise.

25
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,840
Guns don't kill people.

26
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,600
People kill people.

27
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,980
For example,
these two guys with the machine guns.

28
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,060
If they start blasting off...

29
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,560
...ain't none of y'all going home!

30
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,780
You guys are disturbing my business.
So if your ass ain't black...

31
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,320
...you'd better get up out of here
before it really get hot!

32
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,750
Get on out of here.

33
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,350
Let's go.

34
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,180
Ladies, excuse us.

35
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,350
- What are you doing, Kai?
Get them out.

36
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,390
- You too.
- No. Stay.

37
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,980
You too, please.

38
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,270
What were you doing?
We're in a damn war.

39
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,110
I'm a big boy now.

40
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
These black guys'll bury you.

41
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,900
You work for me, Kai.

42
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,240
I work for your father.

43
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,530
Get your head out of your ass, Po.

44
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,120
As long as there's a war going on,
you are my responsibility.

45
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,540
I can take care of myself.

46
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Oh, my God.

47
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,420
Tiger, you killing me, man.
I hate this game.

48
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,170
Isaak!

49
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,920
You have a phone call.

50
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,720
Let me take it in the house.

51
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,050
I need a break anyway.

52
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,800
l don't even know why
you stressing it, man. Come on.

53
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,810
You know why l'm stressing.
All future business deals...

54
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,560
...will take place not in the pool
hall, but in somebody's country club.

55
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,190
You know that.

56
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,690
lf you're serious
about going straight...

57
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,570
...I want to know if you got a plan
for old Mac.

58
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,320
Or should I start looking at the
classifieds?

59
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,200
As long as I'm breathing...

60
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,620
...you ain't ever got to worry about
no classifieds.

61
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,420
All right.

62
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,380
Come on, boy.

63
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,210
You know it's me and you.

64
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,050
Hello.

65
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Hey, what you got for me?

66
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,220
You sure about that?

67
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,560
What's wrong?

68
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,560
All right.

69
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,940
What's wrong, man?

70
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,400
Somebody canceled Ch'u's boy.

71
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,110
What?

72
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,400
You set up a meeting with Ch'u ASAP,
then find out who killed his boy.

73
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,620
Don't even sweat it, okay?
I got it.

74
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,970
Mr. O'Day.

75
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,060
Mr. Sing's at gate B-12.

76
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,520
Thank you.

77
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,370
Nice touch on the metal detectors, my man.

78
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,250
Keeps everybody honest, my man.

79
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,510
You have my deepest, deepest condolences.

80
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,130
Thank you.

81
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,760
What happened to your son
was tragic.

82
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,140
Very unnecessary.

83
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,350
I want you to know I'll be
looking into this personally.

84
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,110
You will forgive me
if l'm not easily moved.

85
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,900
Mr. Sing...

86
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,070
...with all due respect,
there is no way...

87
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,070
...that anybody in my camp would touch
your family...

88
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,830
...any more than anybody in your camp
would touch mine.

89
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,450
It just wouldn't happen.

90
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,540
Our business venture will continue.

91
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,010
I'm pleased to hear that.

92
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,530
Mac.

93
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,030
Make sure we got round the clock security
for my son and my daughter.

94
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,120
It's all been arranged, chief.

95
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,370
Make those lemon tarts for the kids.

96
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,960
Trish.
- Yes?

97
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,550
- Ý need to get a signature from you.
- Okay.

98
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,170
Thanks.

99
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,170
- You're welcome.
Excuse me.

100
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,140
- Do you have this in a small?
- One minute. Amy.

101
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,550
Help her out for me.
She'll help you.

102
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,980
- What are y'all doing?
- You got a little something-something?

103
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,770
Girl, tell him to turn up the music.

104
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,520
Turn up the music!

105
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,440
Show them how we used to do it.

106
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,250
Watch the store for me, okay?

107
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,250
Okay, I got you.

108
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,920
Oh, shit.

109
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,550
Hey!

110
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,340
What a name for a store:
Serpentine Fire.

111
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,680
That's tight. Lt's real tight.

112
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,930
Kool and the Gang jam
from back in the day.

113
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,930
- Earth, Wind and Fire.
- Right, right, right.

114
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,100
That serious shit.

115
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,650
Do l know you?

116
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,900
- How you gonna play me like that?
- What?

117
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,360
I work for your pops.

118
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,450
- Right. Your name starts with an M.
- That's it.

119
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,910
Moron.

120
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,370
Funny. Lt's Maurice, all right?

121
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,830
Maurice, I'd love to reminisce
with you, but l'm busy right now...

122
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,960
...so let's do this later, okay?
- No.

123
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,580
- Lt don't work like that.
- Excuse me?

124
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,130
Your father could be
catching some static...

125
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,380
...and Mac wants me
to watch your back.

126
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,840
Let me tell you something.

127
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,300
Whatever my father and Mac are into
has nothing to do with me.

128
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,470
You can hate them all you want.
That's your business.

129
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,390
If they tell me not to let you out of my sight,
I don't care if you going to confession...

130
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,020
...it's going to be you,
me and the priest.

131
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,230
That's ridiculous.

132
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,610
Hey, look. My ride's right over there.

133
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,490
Back seat or the trunk.
Make it easy on yourself.

134
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,410
Your choice, baby girl.

135
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,410
Waiting for the magic word.

136
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,790
Please?

137
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,420
Stuck-up.

138
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,710
I got some coloring books
in the back.

139
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
- You think you're funny.
- Ý'm babysitting.

140
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,010
I gotta bring something
for the kids.

141
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,430
- Can l get my leg in the car? Damn!
- Ý mean.

142
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,760
Damn!

143
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,660
The NFL announced Friday that Oakland...

144
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,450
...will become home
to its newest expansion team.

145
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,000
The question of who the new owners
will be is still unresolved.

146
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,330
For more we go to Jody Vance.

147
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,790
That's right, Perry.

148
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,670
Several groups of investors will be
presenting proposals this week.

149
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,590
I thought we were done with football
when the Raiders left town.

150
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,310
- Yeah, well, jobs.
- What?

151
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,350
Jobs. See, if they have to build
another stadium...

152
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,600
...some of us that have been less
fortunate can attain jobs.

153
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,190
Harold, your unfortunate ass been
sitting in that chair for 15 years.

154
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,490
You couldn't attain a job if one
bit you in the butt.

155
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,990
You think you're funny.

156
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,120
Got a package for you, Calvin.

157
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,410
I'm laughing because
you think you're funny.

158
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,200
Thanks.

159
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,750
You want a job, Harold?
Open this damn box.

160
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,500
Well, lookie, lookie.

161
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,880
Who sent you a present?

162
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,750
I don't know.
Probably your wife.

163
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,260
There you go again.

164
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,030
Thank you.

165
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,670
- Excuse me.
- Off duty.

166
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,050
Can you take me here?

167
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,390
Can't you understand English?

168
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,100
Two words: off duty.

169
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,540
How you doing?

170
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,670
This shit tight, huh?

171
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,090
This shit's tight.
Hey, girl, what's your name?

172
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,840
- Ý said, what's your name?
- Hey.

173
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,180
What? You don't like a big man?
You not knowing. You not knowing.

174
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,930
There's a lot of playground here.

175
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,940
- What's up, Alonso?
- Trish, what's up?

176
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,110
- Just chilling. Getting some albums.
- This it today?

177
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,570
Yeah.

178
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,320
- You want this on your tab?
- Yeah, please.

179
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,650
Thank you.

180
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,490
Ever had a man with a gap in his mouth?

181
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,830
This is my shit!

182
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,170
Shit!

183
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,750
This is my shit right here!
I got something for you right now.

184
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,220
My bad.

185
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,090
Shit!

186
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,180
Trish!

187
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,230
Thank goodness. Just drive.

188
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,020
Two words: off duty.

189
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,980
You know what?

190
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,320
Jesus.

191
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,910
Two words for you, buddy:
on duty, 50 bucks.

192
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,490
Trish!

193
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,790
I'm gonna find you!
I know where you work at!

194
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,920
Please, just do me a favor
and get me out of here.

195
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,790
Who's that?

196
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,760
Nobody.

197
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,850
Where did you learn to drive?

198
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,690
Ahkbar?

199
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,530
Hong Kong.

200
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,120
You gonna start the meter?

201
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,590
Steal a lot of cabs
in Hong Kong?

202
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,260
Want me to pull over?

203
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,840
No, no. Just turn here.

204
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,640
So, Ahkbar, tell me. Ls it true what
they say about Hong Kong?

205
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,600
What's that?

206
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,140
All you guys do kung fu.

207
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,520
Of course.

208
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,810
State law.

209
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,860
Can you break
one of those boards with your head?

210
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,360
Sure.

211
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,990
That I'd have to see.
You must be a very dangerous man.

212
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,660
Are you scared?

213
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,370
No.

214
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,490
Don't take this personal...

215
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,000
...but l've been around more
dangerous guys than you.

216
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,830
Right here's fine.

217
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,800
No charge.

218
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,800
Keep it. L won't call the cops.

219
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,510
I don't want your money.

220
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,180
You seem like a nice guy.

221
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,720
I am.

222
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,390
You should find a new profession.
Stealing cars doesn't fit you.

223
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,020
What's your name?

224
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,570
You think I want you calling me?

225
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,940
I don't have a phone.

226
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,110
Yeah? Well, dead giveaway.

227
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,570
Besides, you drive like shit.

228
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,100
How are those acquisitions
coming along?

229
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,310
Progressing real nice, man.

230
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,900
I just have three more deeds
to get signed over, that's all.

231
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,190
Let me be clear.
You don't play around with the NFL.

232
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,200
It's their America, and their deadline
is progressing in less than a week.

233
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,530
I know.

234
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,120
Remember something, Mr. Roth.

235
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,790
A lot of people owned them stores
for 30 years or more.

236
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,920
So what if they need a couple more
days to mull over their decision?

237
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,640
These are tense times right now.
You know what l mean?

238
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,940
Shit.

239
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,600
Isaak.

240
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,310
You're murdering yourself.

241
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,320
Golf is a game of finesse, not power.

242
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,450
In that way, it's much like the rest of life.

243
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,450
The key is letting the body work together.

244
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,700
Get a good shoulder turn
so the wrist breaks naturally.

245
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,120
Make sure you keep your eyes on the ball.

246
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,390
This shaft, l don't like it.
It ain't working for me.

247
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,600
Save the excuses.

248
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,850
With all respect to your shop owners,
without the deeds, there's no land deal.

249
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,190
Without the land deal, there's no presentation.
Without the presentation, there's no...

250
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,570
- What's the popular term these days?
- Cheddar.

251
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,030
That's right. No cheddar.

252
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,410
Do l make myself clear?

253
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,870
If I say l'll deliver, l'll deliver.

254
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,080
Hey, hey, hey, now.
Sorry I'm late.

255
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,620
Girl, knowing the way you shop,
I'd say you're early.

256
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,830
- Oh, really? Ý got some hot stuff.
- Yes.

257
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,250
Good. Work it out!
Your brother's in the back.

258
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,130
It looks good.

259
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,840
That guy that got whacked?

260
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,300
- You mean Ch'u's boy?
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,220
He called me. Ain't that some shit?
Same night he got killed, Pop.

262
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,140
Jesus Christ.

263
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,730
What'd he want, Colin?

264
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,020
I don't know. Oh, look, man.

265
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,820
Let me holler back at you later.

266
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,190
Colin, you be in my office in one hour.

267
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,780
Okay.

268
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,330
I asked you not to do business here.

269
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,460
- Hi, sis. Nice to see you too.
- Ý mean it, Colin. Come on.

270
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,670
This is my place, okay?
I got kids hanging here all the time.

271
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,670
- Lf this is what you're about-
- Don't start the speech, all right?

272
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,510
For once, let's not go there.

273
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,850
I was on the phone, talking to Pop.

274
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,940
Hey, look, come on. He's a businessman.
I work for this businessman.

275
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,520
- Fine.
- Stop tripping over this shit.

276
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,780
Colin. Colin, wait. Wait.

277
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,530
Look. L'm sorry.

278
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,410
I just worry about you.

279
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,080
That's all.

280
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,330
Yeah, l know.

281
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,830
And I love you too, Trish.

282
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,710
But you ain't gotta worry about me.

283
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm fine.

284
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,560
Serpentine Fire.

285
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,140
Hello?

286
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm talking way back. Way back.

287
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,530
Right there, player.

288
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,000
What's good?

289
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,420
Try the parking lot.

290
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,380
I'm just trying to do my job, Trish.
Just like Mo.

291
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,470
He told me the shit you pulled.

292
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,590
Plain stupid is what it was.

293
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,560
Things are gonna get tense now that
that Chinese dude got popped.

294
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,720
Was that one of your jobs too?

295
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,190
No, that shoddy work's not my style.

296
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,980
I'm sorry. Poor baby!
Have l got you all wrong?

297
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,820
You don't have a clue to what l'm about.

298
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,530
Why don't you tell me?

299
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,150
For starters, get past the facade.

300
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,660
You got some serious facade going on.

301
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,120
Well, so do you. So does everybody.

302
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,660
And this Miss l-Don't-Need-Nobody
isn't you. Not the real you.

303
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,880
- You saving yourself for Kobe Bryant?
- Ls that what you think l'm doing?

304
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,760
I think you need to consider
the possibility that you've met him.

305
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,590
You're an errand boy for my father.
You're nothing.

306
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,850
Fair enough.

307
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,850
But there comes a time when a man
has to strike out on his own.

308
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,850
Stake his own claim.

309
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,610
How could I have missed it?

310
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,190
I think I'm hopelessly in love
with you.

311
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,070
Make fun all you like. Sooner or later,
this man's gonna be way too much for you.

312
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,570
Those big brown eyes are gonna get all
misty wishing there were two of me.

313
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,450
You know, fill yourself all you want.
I just lost my appetite.

314
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,870
Sit down.

315
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,000
You don't have to respect me, but you will
respect your father and let us protect you.

316
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,630
Do you understand?

317
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,270
Hey, Mac, you're so smooth
with the ladies, baby.

318
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,780
If I want Eddie Murphy,
I'll go to the goddamn movies.

319
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,030
Yeah, dog.

320
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,990
Good. Give him some fat-free water
or something.

321
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,410
Where my drink, man?

322
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,830
The fuck you looking at?

323
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,710
Hey!

324
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,750
All the way down the end there!

325
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,340
All the way down. Keep it moving. Move it out.

326
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,640
Colin.

327
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,970
Finish telling me about this call you got.

328
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,850
Guy calls, says he wants to meet me.

329
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,560
For what?

330
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,400
I don't know. We didn't talk that long.

331
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,190
Said he had a little something
that might put a stop to this war.

332
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,570
A little something?

333
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,150
A little something.

334
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,410
I didn't trust his ass,
so I tell him meet me at Silk's.

335
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,830
As soon as you got that call,
you should've told me.

336
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,420
Huh?

337
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,510
Next time l cross the street,
you should hold my hand.

338
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,140
Hey, who the hell you talking to?
I will knock the black off you, boy.

339
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,640
I mean no disrespect.

340
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,680
But l'm just trying to be a man here.
I'm looking out for you.

341
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,650
I don't need you
to look out for me, Colin.

342
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,900
Have a seat, Colin.

343
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,150
Go on. Sit down.

344
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,540
Come on.

345
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,800
I've been working on a big deal.
A real big deal.

346
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,430
When it goes through, we're out
of this gangster nonsense for good.

347
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,940
Everything we do will be
strictly legit from here on out.

348
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,900
What do you mean?

349
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,360
I got something else lined up for my boy.

350
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,780
And you will get to run with this ball.
I guarantee that.

351
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,950
But, Colin, you gotta use your head.

352
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,450
And you gotta listen.

353
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,580
You understand what l'm saying to you?

354
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,370
Yeah, Pop.

355
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,130
Finish your drink.

356
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,260
Collard Green.

357
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,880
Black Mac.

358
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,140
Something wrong?

359
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,640
You tell me.

360
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,450
Hey, chief.

361
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,580
Hey.

362
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,450
Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but you need to see this.

363
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,920
Calvin's place?

364
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,630
Mm-hm.

365
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,970
He was the sweetest guy in the world.

366
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,430
I think I'd better wrap up
these acquisitions quickly for you.

367
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,810
Things are getting pretty crazy
around here.

368
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,980
You gonna be okay?

369
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,940
Just give me a minute.

370
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,030
Okay, boss.

371
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,970
That's it right over there.

372
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,600
Okay. Lock up the store.

373
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,310
- We're going out tonight?
- Definitely.

374
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,780
Follow her.

375
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,980
Ahkbar. What the hell
are you doing here?

376
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,360
I need to ask you...

377
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,780
You get out of my apartment
before I call the cops.

378
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,570
Please.

379
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,910
You're the only guy I know working
down the criminal ladder. What's up?

380
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,960
This is the last number my brother
called before he was murdered.

381
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,120
It's the number of your shop.

382
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,420
It is.

383
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,010
But l don't know your brother.

384
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,510
- Why would he want to talk to me?
- He called your store.

385
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,260
But not to talk to me.

386
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,180
A girl who works the register.
It could've been her.

387
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,350
My brother...

388
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,680
Brother?

389
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,400
Colin.

390
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,610
Sometimes he makes calls from the shop.
Mostly when l'm not around.

391
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,860
Could you talk to him?

392
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,210
That's Maurice and his gang.
Look, Ahkbar.

393
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,250
- Ý think it's-
- By the way, my name is Han.

394
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,920
Well, Han, look.

395
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,720
These guys find you, you're gonna have
serious problems. Go out the window.

396
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,760
No. I like this way.

397
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,180
It's your funeral.

398
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,770
Dim sum good. You call again.
Dim sum all time. Thanks.

399
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,600
Hey, hey.

400
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,770
What you doing bothering
Miss O'Day?

401
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,520
He's the delivery boy, moron.

402
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,110
Okay, stay here.

403
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,490
I done told you,
my name is Maurice, all right?

404
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,200
I'm sorry. L keep forgetting, boo.

405
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,410
Hey, dog.

406
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,830
- You smell something?
- Ý don't smell nothing.

407
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,370
- Where's the take-out?
- You hungry, baby?

408
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,290
Cover the front.

409
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,210
Hey, Dim Sum!

410
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,920
You's a real funny man!

411
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,430
Mr. O'Day don't let things
slide lightly.

412
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,600
He also don't like the wrong element
around his daughter.

413
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,930
It's up to me not to let it happen.

414
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,440
Kick his ass.

415
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,320
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

416
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,670
Get up! Get him!

417
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,680
He's headed around the front!

418
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,690
Who that motherfucker?

419
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,610
Great country.

420
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,280
Free cars.

421
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,050
Sun Tzu was lost to us by
assassination less than a month ago.

422
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,220
A grocery store was firebombed
and his wife killed.

423
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,110
With all respect, Ch'u, any of us
could be killed at any time...

424
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,400
...overlord or not.

425
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,610
- Yes.
- Yeah.

426
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,490
We are not the blacks, Victor.

427
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,740
Our loyalty to each other
is unquestioned.

428
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:11,160
At least let us strike harder.
Show our true strength.

429
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:17,080
We will only do that
when it serves us best.

430
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,610
Han.

431
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,070
Let Kai worry about this.

432
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,920
Han. Han, I don't want to lose another son.

433
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,440
The old man didn't think you'd make it.

434
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,150
And you?

435
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,730
I knew you would.

436
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,990
It's been a long time, Han.
Good to see you.

437
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,400
Tell me...

438
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,660
...what happened that night?

439
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,620
He got in a fight in a black club.

440
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,910
Threats had been made. They got Po
the same evening, before l could find him.

441
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,040
Why there?

442
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,670
He wouldn't tell me.

443
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,010
Your brother could be a loose cannon,
but he didn't deserve this.

444
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,760
Why fight with blacks?

445
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:43,220
Well, the waterfront's only
four square miles.

446
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,980
Half of the businesses belong to us...

447
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,060
...the other half to them.

448
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,070
It was just a matter of time.

449
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,760
I was afraid prison would
make you soft.

450
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,140
People don't get soft in prison.

451
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,740
Pretty good.

452
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,960
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

453
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,380
You must be hungry.

454
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,630
Think you could find something
better to do than creep up on me?

455
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,720
And besides, aren't you
in the wrong part of town?

456
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,890
I went to your store,
they tell me you were here.

457
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,680
Hold on a minute.
Come on, kids.

458
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,430
All right, all right. Who wants what?

459
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,680
Hey.

460
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,100
I wanted the yellow one.

461
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,860
Give him the yellow one. He's the baby.

462
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,150
Stop! You want one?

463
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,320
Sure. L want the yellow one.

464
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,650
Well, you get a green one.

465
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,290
Did you talk to your brother?

466
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,630
What made you think l'd talk to my brother?

467
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,040
Hey, time-out.

468
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,010
Ti- What? Calling a time-out...

469
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,420
See that guy?
He works for my dad.

470
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,090
He's got a really bad attitude.

471
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,140
Who's your friend?

472
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,190
We met in line. L didn't catch your name.

473
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,440
- What's your name?
- My friends call me Ahkbar.

474
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,530
Ahkbar. Well, Ahkbar, this is Mac.
Mac, Ahkbar.

475
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,950
Well, As-Salaam-Alaikum, Ahkbar.

476
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,160
Yo, ain't that the guy?

477
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,120
Hell, yeah.

478
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,500
Same chump took Mo's ride
after he beat us down.

479
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,540
Nobody ever kicked my ass.
What are you talking about?

480
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,000
That the dude.

481
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,880
We can't start because we're
a man short. Would you help us out?

482
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,380
- Me?
- Yeah.

483
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,260
No. I don't know this game.

484
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,550
Man, it's easier than breathing.

485
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,680
- Besides, Trish loves football players.
- Oh, yeah.

486
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,890
Oh, yeah.

487
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,390
Right on.

488
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:41,400
Fellas, got myself a fresh recruit.

489
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,110
He's a rookie...

490
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,620
...so take it easy on him.

491
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,420
Give me that!

492
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,130
The brothers and I
always give rookies warm welcomes.

493
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,210
So don't worry about a thing.

494
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,460
I just need you to stand behind me.

495
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,640
I'm gonna give you the ball, and you run
to the far end of the field.

496
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,510
That's all?

497
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,180
That's all.

498
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,430
Set!

499
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,140
Mo.

500
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,190
Let's see your special.

501
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,570
Mo's special!

502
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,280
We're coming, boys.

503
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,320
Hut! Hut! Hut!

504
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,410
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run?

505
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,380
Come on!

506
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:47,970
Damn.

507
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,140
Like l told your ass the other day.

508
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,430
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

509
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:01,820
Good job, my man.

510
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,490
- Are they allowed to do that?
- Sure.

511
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,280
It's a contact sport.

512
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:09,280
This time, run a little bit
and turn up the middle.

513
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,490
And I'll throw the ball to you.

514
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,950
It's called the "buttonhook."

515
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,540
- On two.
- Buttonhook.

516
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:16,830
Right there.

517
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,460
Set!

518
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,170
All right.

519
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,590
Hut, hut!

520
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,600
Ooh!

521
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:40,310
Damn! Shakalack-shakalack.
Mo, you my Negro, Mo.

522
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,400
Break his ass.

523
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,150
Break his ass.

524
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,280
How come nobody else gets hit?

525
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,450
Because you're the one with the ball.

526
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,160
Okay. I'd like hut three.

527
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,040
Hut! Hut, hut!

528
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:56,100
You all right?

529
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,190
Hey, brother!

530
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,820
American football!

531
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,070
That was great!
- Brother!

532
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,160
- You were great.
- Damn, that was hot.

533
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,620
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

534
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,460
Here's my address.

535
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,170
- Tell me when you talk to your brother.
- Ý will.

536
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,460
Here.

537
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,420
Bye.

538
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,260
Did you see that?
Awesome!

539
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,510
I know. I know.

540
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,680
Pop ain't feeling me.

541
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,770
He still wants me to ride around
with training wheels and shit.

542
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,570
I was like,
Pops gotta understand that...

543
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,070
...me and him is cut from,
like, the same cloth.

544
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:55,820
He needs to start respecting me
as a man.

545
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:59,580
I mean, he needs to start respecting
my manhood.

546
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,500
Shit, l went to college.

547
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,540
That's right, baby. You did.

548
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,670
That's right, baby. L did.

549
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,630
Like that phone call I got
the other day.

550
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,130
Pop's too afraid about me handling
the business and stuff.

551
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,050
But, baby, I got ideas.
I mean, you know l got ideas.

552
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,470
It's like... Shit, I am an idea.

553
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,770
- Ý'll get it.
Come on.

554
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,730
I'm about to have
an Einstein moment.

555
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,320
Magic about to happen. Lt's gonna be scary.

556
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,280
Hey, look, all l want to know is...

557
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,320
...when does Colin O'Day
get to run with the show?

558
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:40,580
Don't worry, baby. Your turn's coming.

559
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,210
Sorry, Mr. O'Day.
These things are never easy.

560
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,930
Wait. Wait.

561
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,050
- Don't look at this. Come on.
- No!

562
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,930
Look at me. Please!

563
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,430
Get away from me!

564
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,140
No!

565
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,790
You had something to do with this.

566
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,370
- What you want me to say?
- Go to hell.

567
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,460
- Go to hell.
- What do you want?

568
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,790
Trisha...

569
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,210
You're as responsible as those people
who did this to my brother.

570
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,260
Don't come near me. L hate you.

571
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,930
You might as well have thrown him
out that window yourself.

572
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,440
That was my boy, Mac.

573
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:41,660
I know.

574
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,160
They killed my boy.

575
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,130
We're at the crossroads now, lsaak.

576
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,760
I'm not gonna pretend l know
what you're feeling.

577
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:08,270
But l know you gotta keep it
stitched up until business is done.

578
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,390
The people who did this...

579
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,020
...I promise you on my life...

580
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,360
...they will be knocked out of the box
in due time.

581
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,030
I'll make sure of it.

582
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,520
What happened?

583
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,160
You know, once, Colin and I did something
we thought would really be funny.

584
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,950
He hid out front...

585
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,410
...while I ran to tell my mom he'd been hurt.

586
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,460
Hit by a car
or something really bad like that.

587
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,710
And when she came,
he was supposed to jump out.

588
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,760
You know, surprise her...

589
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:13,390
...and we'd all fall out
and have this great laugh.

590
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,260
Me and my mom always loved
a good laugh.

591
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,140
I was about 8 or 9.

592
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,020
Colin was, like, 11.

593
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,440
I don't remember
how we came up with it...

594
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,740
...but, sure enough, l start
screaming and yelling...

595
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:40,500
...and my mom comes running out of
the house. She's, like, "Trish, what's wrong?"

596
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,540
And when l told her, l mean...

597
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,210
...the look on her face.

598
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:50,010
Even when Colin popped up to show it
was a joke, she couldn't stop crying.

599
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,880
She just held him close.

600
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:55,300
Clutched him, you know?

601
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:02,980
I was just a baby. L didn't get it
then, but I get it now.

602
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,270
Tell me.

603
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:08,690
- What happened?
- Colin's dead.

604
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,610
And no matter how hard l cry...

605
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:17,280
...he's not gonna pop up
and show me it was just a joke.

606
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,830
I'm sorry.

607
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,960
I need your help.

608
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:31,340
I gotta put this thing together
just as much as you do now.

609
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:37,760
Gentlemen, we are ready
to approach the NFL.

610
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:42,270
I don't think any of the other bids
are even in contention.

611
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,640
Our package is staggering.

612
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,230
We've got the money,
the organization...

613
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,820
...waterfront real estate
seconds from the bridge.

614
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,280
God Himself couldn't have designed
a better spot for a stadium.

615
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,030
Yeah. That's right. You know me well.

616
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,200
If I say there's caviar on
the mountain, you bring the crackers.

617
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,700
I don't get it.

618
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,750
These are waterfront properties.

619
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,250
They must mean something.

620
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,500
My brother didn't want them found.

621
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,970
Yeah, but why?

622
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,850
Is this the place?

623
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,600
Yeah. Lt says 44 Driggs Road.

624
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,270
Is anybody here?

625
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,900
Get down! Get down!

626
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,760
You're Chinese.

627
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,340
No shit!

628
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,060
I can't hit a girl.

629
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,950
In America, if a girl's kicking your ass,
you do not have to be a gentleman.

630
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,160
Damn. Look at that!

631
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,750
- They a trip, ain't they?
- Yep.

632
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,340
Them little things pay the rent,
you know what l mean?

633
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:08,670
Yeah, no doubt.

634
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:13,720
Crabs in a barrel can't climb out,
and they don't want to stay in.

635
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,930
- Ý guess they strange like that, huh?
Yeah.

636
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,720
Some brothers strange like that too.

637
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:21,310
As soon as one of us move up...

638
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,980
...a crab motherfucker like yourself
pulls us right back down.

639
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,270
But let me tell you something.

640
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:30,610
This place must seem like
a piece of shit to you...

641
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:34,740
...but that's still my piece of shit.
And I ain't selling it.

642
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,620
I got work to do.

643
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,910
Let's look at it another way.

644
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,790
You got two choices.
You either sign us over the deed...

645
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,800
...or l blow your head off
and leave it with these crabs.

646
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,880
Now, which is it?

647
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,010
- Yo, yo! Okay!
- Ý can't hear you!

648
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,470
All right! Ý'll do it!

649
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,220
- What?
- Ý said, I'll do it, man!

650
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:09,810
Go in, get me that deed.

651
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,490
Don't look at me.
I'll put your ass on the news.

652
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,740
What's the matter with you, man?
You crazy?

653
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:23,910
I can live with that.

654
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,120
- Hung!
- Kai.

655
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,040
How are you? Good to see you.

656
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,290
Good to see you.

657
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,250
Guess they don't care there's a war.

658
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,960
They don't care if the damn barge
is on fire.

659
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,380
This is a treat.

660
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:16,840
- What brings you downtown?
- You heard about Victor Ho?

661
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,550
Yeah.

662
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,300
We're looking forward to
some blowback.

663
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:24,890
That's why we're here.
We got a tip this place is gonna get hit.

664
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,850
You gotta be kidding me.

665
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,100
- When?
- Right now.

666
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,020
Get the money.

667
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,060
Thank you for attending this meeting...

668
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:53,770
...on such a short notice.

669
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,480
My dear brothers, when you expire...

670
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,030
...your territory will remain
within the collective.

671
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:02,650
Of course, since I alone survive...

672
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:07,200
...the collective is,
in actuality, only me.

673
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,880
You don't want to be in my path
when my feet are put to the coals, Ch'u.

674
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:25,720
Misery loves company.

675
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,720
Oh, young Mr. Roth,
you sound nervous.

676
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:32,310
May I suggest acupuncture?

677
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,480
I hope you have some good news for me.

678
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:39,150
There's no need for threats
or theatrics.

679
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:43,530
None of us want to drag this out
any longer than it already has.

680
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:47,240
Then close out your business
and get me those deeds.

681
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,580
Damn. Susie!

682
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,080
Could you get me Keyshawn Johnson,
please?

683
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,330
- Right away.
- Thank you.

684
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,540
Trish.

685
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:59,340
It's Papa, baby. Lt's me. Don't be scared.

686
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:03,210
Listen, Trish, l need you to come with me.

687
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,340
Why?

688
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:10,100
I'll tell you.
Just come on out front, okay?

689
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,620
I can't have you hanging with
Ch'u's boy.

690
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,700
- His name is Han, Daddy.
- Okay, then.

691
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,410
Stay away from Han.

692
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,540
Afraid I'll catch one of your
bullets?

693
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,540
It is too dangerous right now.

694
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,540
I'll take my chances.

695
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,300
Did you do it?

696
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:51,890
Did l do what?

697
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,720
Did you have his brother murdered?

698
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,350
Where did that come from?

699
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,730
I need to know.

700
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:00,440
- No, I didn't. L'm telling you, no.
- Be straightforward with me for once.

701
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:01,770
I did not.

702
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,440
Trisha, look at me.

703
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,990
I had nothing to do with it.

704
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:13,700
But one of them's gonna pay
for what happened to Colin.

705
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,620
Is that what you call being a businessman?

706
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,000
That's what I call protecting my family.

707
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,830
Look at me. Lookit.

708
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,090
You can't touch me!

709
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,960
Interception, baby!

710
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:28,090
Come on, man.
Running it back!

711
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,090
Look at that!
Go back to slow mo!

712
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,430
I'm coming for you.

713
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,220
I ain't gonna even look.

714
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:35,720
I'm just gonna play.
I can't see!

715
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:38,890
- Come on, now. Come on, now.
- Okay, okay, okay, look.

716
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:50,860
He could go...

717
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:53,240
...all the way!

718
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,450
Touchdown Jets.

719
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:58,080
How your mama doing?

720
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,080
Touchdown, baby!

721
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,710
Take it, take it, take it!

722
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,460
These nuts in your mouth.

723
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,840
I said, put the nuts in your mou...

724
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,970
Why y'all not working? Get to work!

725
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,600
Shiftless Negroes.

726
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,850
Toby! Go on!

727
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,480
Where's Mac, Maurice?

728
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:22,980
He's out back.

729
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,360
I want to talk to him.

730
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,650
Yes, sir.

731
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,910
You sure you don't want nothing?

732
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,160
No, I'm okay.

733
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,710
I'll be downstairs.

734
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,130
All right.

735
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,450
Hey.

736
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:19,700
I remember sitting in that chair...

737
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:23,000
...watching you fix your hair
for your first date.

738
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,880
You hooked me up with Dexter Benson.

739
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,550
My man Dex.

740
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,380
- Ý really liked that boy.
- Please, Daddy.

741
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:36,590
He was so scared, he bit my lip
when he kissed me good night.

742
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,050
Wait a second.

743
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:41,270
You didn't kiss that boy
on your first date.

744
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,230
That's right, l did.

745
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,940
I guess l was trying
to get back at you.

746
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:49,940
You know, I hate to admit it...

747
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,230
...but l miss those times.

748
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,040
I can tell you
when l missed your ma the most.

749
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,670
At your graduations and your dates.

750
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:10,500
Trisha, l know l ain't never been able
to talk to you.

751
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,670
There's been a lot of things l wanted to say.

752
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,930
It don't ever come out right.
I know that.

753
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:25,390
Trisha.

754
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:28,350
I want you in my life.

755
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,520
There are...

756
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,400
...certain things...

757
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,400
Until l can prove these things...

758
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:36,280
...I want you to stay here with me.

759
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:38,110
- Dad, see-
- Listen to me.

760
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,740
People out there, they gonna try
to hurt me by hurting you.

761
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,450
Like they did your brother.

762
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,370
I'll be damned if l let them do that.

763
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,790
Who is it?

764
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,170
Mac. You got a phone call.

765
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,540
Not now, Mac.

766
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,000
It's Roth.

767
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,340
Isaak.

768
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:56,380
Today's a good day.

769
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,300
It's deed day.

770
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,470
- Ý trust everything's in order.
Absolutely.

771
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,640
Tonight all my dreams come true.

772
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:05,810
I will see you at the club as planned.

773
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,230
I'll have your check.

774
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,110
Where do we stand with Silk?

775
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:14,650
We're hooking up at 8:00.

776
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,360
You watch out for him.

777
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,780
The boy's tricky.

778
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:21,160
Don't you let him get the upper hand.

779
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,330
I can handle Silk.

780
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,880
Are you out of your mind?

781
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,010
What are you doing here?

782
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,140
I missed you.

783
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:48,810
You miss me. L'm gonna miss you when
my father finds out you're here.

784
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,150
He's standing right outside the door.

785
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:52,560
What am I gonna do with you?

786
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:55,150
Jesus!

787
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,900
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

788
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:01,070
I gotta go take care of business.

789
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,990
You need anything, you just say the word.

790
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,530
I am fine, Dad.

791
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,700
I'm chilling.
You do what you gotta do, okay?

792
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,340
Jesus! Come on, you gotta go!

793
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,130
No, what do you?...

794
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,890
- You all right, Trish?
- Ý'm fine, Dad.

795
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,930
Listen, baby, you hungry?

796
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,810
They getting pizza.
Say the word, they'll bring it up.

797
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:34,350
I'm not hungry.
If I get hungry, l'll let them know.

798
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,110
I'll be back after a while.

799
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,360
- Okay.
- All right.

800
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,820
Trish!

801
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,080
Damn, this pizza good.

802
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,280
Trish!

803
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:51,330
Hey, baby girl, open up! Ý got some
sausage and pepperoni pizza!

804
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:54,170
Open up the door.
Ain't no swine on it.

805
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:56,790
Mmm-mm.

806
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:00,670
Pizza make you want to slap your mama.
What's this, Domino's?

807
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,010
Trish.

808
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,640
Damn, never been up in here before.

809
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:12,850
Trish!

810
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,690
They got Prince up on the wall.

811
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,820
You a freak too, ain't you, Trish?
Where you at?

812
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,900
I'm about to come around the corner.

813
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:29,120
Damn! Hey, get the car!

814
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:31,540
So where are we going?

815
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,000
Look.

816
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:38,170
All the places on this list
have been moved out or burned out.

817
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:39,500
Except this one.

818
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,260
This one.

819
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,800
I know this one.

820
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:46,800
My father and Mac talked about that.
It's Silk's casino.

821
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,470
Casino?

822
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,970
Let's gamble.

823
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,310
All right.

824
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,240
Han.

825
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:24,260
Now you're giving me some
B- Boy flavor.

826
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,180
- Hip-hop.
- Hip-hop?

827
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:27,720
Yeah.

828
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:30,640
All right.

829
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:34,470
I know hip-hop.

830
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,110
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, what's up?

831
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:54,870
Come on, he's with me. Okay?
Can you give me a break?

832
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:56,790
You Isaak's girl?

833
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,170
That's right, cutie.

834
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,500
You gonna let me in?

835
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,800
All right.

836
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:06,510
Thank you. Come on.

837
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,230
I'm not feeling this.
Let's go to the dance floor.

838
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:26,530
- Lt's not my scene.
- Not your scene? Cute. Let's go.

839
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:04,060
Boy, are you feelin' me

840
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,360
'Cause I'm feelin' you

841
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:09,110
Somethin' in my heart

842
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,280
Told me you're the one

843
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,700
Are you feelin' me

844
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:17,450
'Cause I'm feelin' you

845
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:21,670
Somethin' in my heart

846
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:25,840
Look here!

847
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:28,590
Man, can you believe this?

848
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:36,720
What the hell is she doing?

849
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:47,230
Boy, are you feelin' me

850
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,150
'Cause I'm feelin' you

851
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,530
What's up, Trish?

852
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,950
What's up, Silk?

853
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,320
Let's talk.

854
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:56,620
All right.

855
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:58,540
Come on.

856
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,460
Your pop's running around
like Donald Trump...

857
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:08,170
...grabbing up every piece of
waterfront he can get his hands on.

858
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,420
Now he wants to be a club owner.

859
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:12,550
Told me he was working on something big.

860
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,510
Something big?
I don't care how big it is.

861
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,760
Your pops can sweat me,
and Mac can sweat me all they want.

862
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,890
But Silk is staying right here.

863
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:23,310
My sentiments exactly, Silkie.

864
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:27,480
I think we all should stay right here
for one more negotiation.

865
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:31,820
It's like that, partner? You're gonna
try to roll up in here on me?

866
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:34,110
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up.

867
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,370
Does my daddy know about this?

868
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,450
Sit down.

869
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:39,790
What?

870
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:43,080
What?

871
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,080
You might as well lose the gat.

872
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:48,040
It's like l told your
punk ass before...

873
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:50,340
...I ain't signing shit.

874
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,170
All right, I'll sign it myself.

875
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:04,890
Well, well, well.

876
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:07,850
If it ain't my man Dim Sum.

877
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,690
Busy night?

878
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,570
Ran off with the boss's daughter,
threw a wrench in Mac's program.

879
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:17,490
And now...

880
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,080
...you about to get your ass kicked.

881
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:22,330
Where is she?

882
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,040
You didn't think you was gonna get
them panties, did you?

883
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,710
What?

884
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,960
Trish. You didn't really think she was
gonna give it up to you, did you?

885
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,760
Here's the deal, meatball.

886
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:39,340
You let me go, I let you live.

887
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,470
He say he gonna let me live!

888
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,940
You know, I'm really gonna miss you.

889
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:53,900
The way you make me laugh.
But look on the bright side.

890
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,190
Some you win...

891
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:59,240
...and, Dim Sum, you lose.

892
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,120
Come on, get me.

893
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,670
The hell what Mac say!
Somebody kill that son of a bitch!

894
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:34,190
Get up!

895
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,940
Get your bitch asses up!
Come on!

896
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:38,450
Yeah, come on.

897
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:48,500
Dim Sum!

898
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,080
Come out and play!

899
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,550
Hey, rice noodle!

900
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:58,290
What the hell you doing?

901
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:02,090
I hope you land on your feet,
grasshopper.

902
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:05,010
You're not the only one
knows some shit.

903
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:07,800
- Where is she?
- The Oakridge Men's Club.

904
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:13,810
Sorry, moron.

905
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:31,950
Name's Maurice...

906
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,040
...bitch.

907
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,540
Cristal, Ch'u.

908
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,510
You only live once.

909
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,340
Everything's kosher,
down to the last pagoda.

910
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,890
You're a good man.

911
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,450
Spend it well.

912
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,330
Mr. O'Day.

913
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:22,790
Mr. Ch'u.

914
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,630
You once gave me your condolences.

915
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:29,130
I now offer mine
in regards to your son.

916
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:33,350
There'll be ample time for you to
express your regrets, Mr. Ch'u.

917
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:53,490
Amazing.

918
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,000
How much?

919
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:04,040
So this has been
what it's all about, huh?

920
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:07,710
I wish my boy could see me do this.

921
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,840
And could be here.

922
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,260
Go ahead and keep that.

923
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,850
I don't understand.

924
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:21,310
You just acquired another partner.

925
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,570
I really think it's time the NFL
had a black owner. Don't you?

926
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,570
You're joking, right?

927
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,080
You're not joking.

928
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:43,290
I'm afraid l already have a partner.
Several, in fact.

929
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,540
Well, you just got another one...

930
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,590
...in fact.

931
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,510
Don't forget, Mr. Roth,
without these deeds...

932
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,090
...you have no...

933
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:56,300
What is that popular term, Dave?

934
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:57,600
Cheddar?

935
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:03,020
Do you mind if l have a moment?
- No, go ahead.

936
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:11,530
So this is the plan, huh, Isaak?

937
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:14,990
You want to be partners with Roth.

938
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,790
I've been waiting for the right time
to tell you.

939
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:22,580
Hey, Mac.

940
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:25,710
I'm going to the owner's box.

941
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,250
We are going to the owner's box.

942
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,420
I ain't playing with these people.

943
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,630
The owner's box.

944
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,680
I've had enough of this legit shit.

945
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,600
What's that?

946
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:50,070
I believe they call it
corporate restructuring. Right?

947
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:55,410
Isaak O'Day Development's getting
straight jacked...

948
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:56,950
...by Machiavellian Incorporated.

949
01:37:57,950 --> 01:37:59,950
I almost forgot.

950
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:03,120
I'm taking your most valued asset.

951
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:04,910
Nigel!

952
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:09,790
You blaze, we blaze.

953
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:12,300
Are you out of your damn mind, boy?

954
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:16,930
Is she worth $38 million to you?

955
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,600
Now l know you're crazy.

956
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:25,060
You lost your mind thinking this white boy
was gonna let you own a piece of their game.

957
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:28,270
Me and Ch'u, we had an understanding.

958
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:32,400
Anybody who didn't sign those deeds,
we took care of.

959
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,440
What you mean?

960
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,240
He shot them.
I was there when he killed Silk.

961
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:41,910
So now after everything,
you really gonna try to do this?

962
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:45,540
I have been covering your ass
for years, Isaak.

963
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:49,080
Quite frankly,
I am just tired of being your boy.

964
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,250
Just because you put your kids
through college...

965
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:56,010
...that it's supposed to make
all of your crooked straight?

966
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:59,550
Man, you want to own a damn box.

967
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:02,850
Mac just wanna own the streets.

968
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,730
That's always been your problem, Mac.

969
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,690
What about Colin?

970
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:10,900
What about him?

971
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:13,860
You killed Colin?

972
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:19,950
Even fake wars have casualties, lsaak.

973
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:22,700
I guess old Collard Green couldn't fly.

974
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,130
Vince! Vince!

975
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,300
Damn it, Roth!

976
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:25,100
Watch her.

977
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:14,690
Come get it!

978
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:30,450
Take it down!

979
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,580
Take it down now!

980
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:36,920
No way!

981
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:38,540
Take it down!

982
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,640
Why did you kill my brother?

983
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,360
All that Chinese shit
happened in-house.

984
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,650
You have your own people
to thank for that.

985
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,660
Not that you'll get the chance.

986
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:12,120
Sorry, Romeo, but you gotta die.

987
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,000
Damn...

988
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,500
...that's some cold shit.

989
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,100
We've called the police.

990
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:34,980
- There's an ambulance on its way.
- Thank you.

991
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,100
I'm all right, baby. How you feeling?

992
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:39,940
You doing all right? L'm doing all right.

993
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:43,730
Is that Han?

994
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,990
Yes.

995
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:48,570
You're the one who's been
making all this trouble, huh?

996
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,330
Let me shake your hand.

997
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:58,420
You got a firm grip. I like that.

998
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:01,790
Stay with your father.

999
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,380
I will.

1000
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,930
He a lot shorter than l thought.

1001
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:12,010
- Ý know.
- He just a little guy.

1002
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:13,810
I don't know what to do with you.

1003
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:43,880
Your brother wasn't suited to lead.

1004
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,590
He didn't have the discipline.

1005
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,090
That's why you killed him.

1006
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:53,140
That's why l had to.

1007
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:54,930
Had to?

1008
01:43:57,310 --> 01:43:58,350
My brother.

1009
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:01,230
That's right.

1010
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,610
That...

1011
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:05,570
...was a mistake.

1012
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:06,980
Come on.

1013
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:36,740
Come on!

1014
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:43,040
Give me some skin!

1015
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,000
Whoo-hoo!

1016
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,140
Are you okay?

1017
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,510
I'm okay.

1018
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,990
Come on, let's go.
