42
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,829
That's my sister
Skylar and her boyfriend Holden.

43
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:36,287
And that's me.
Well, I'm Djuna. D-J-U-N-A.

44
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,455
Oh, and everyone calls me D.J.

45
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:40,538
Now, I'm gonna level with ya.

46
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:44,580
We are not the typical kind of family
you'd find in a musical comedy.

47
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,580
For one thing, we got dough.

48
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:50,872
And we live right here on Park Avenue
in a big apartment; a penthouse.

49
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:55,581
Dad's a lawyer. I mean, I call him
"Dad," but actually he's stepdad.

50
00:03:55,664 --> 00:04:00,289
There's original Dad
who married Mom and they had me.

51
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,123
And there's stepdad. Well, he had
two kids with his first wife when...

52
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:07,207
Look, maybe this is all
getting a little confusing.

53
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,374
You see, there's Lane and Laura.

54
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,915
Those are my half-sisters,
and they're really great.

55
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:14,915
A little twitty at times,
but we love each other...

56
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,457
and we have
a million laughs together.

57
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,458
And, of course, my stepbrother
Scott, who's very smart...

58
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,625
but currently on the outs
with the family...

59
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,708
because he's become
a conservative Republican...

60
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,208
which has caused my stepfather
to have a stroke...

61
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,208
since we're all liberal Democrats.

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,708
How can you expect
people on welfare...

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,501
to develop any sort of incentives
if they're getting handouts?

64
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:38,459
What are you saying? Somebody who can't work
for one reason or another has to be discarded?

65
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,667
Welfare does not work. It's the same
outmoded liberal fantasy world...

66
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:45,834
as affirmative action, not allowing
school prayer and coddling of criminals.

67
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:49,668
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my own flesh and blood.

68
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:54,085
Unless some large Republican pea pods are in
the basement and have taken over your body.

69
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,043
Not pods, Dad. Ideas.

70
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,043
Virile, modern ideas.

71
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,627
A strong America.
The right to bear arms.

72
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,628
- Arms? What are you... Guns?
- Yes!

73
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,836
Are you crazy? What the hell is the matter
with you? I don't understand you anymore.

74
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,628
- Why... Wait a minute. Excuse me.
- Relax, Bob.

75
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:13,294
Steffi, bring down a copy
of my will and an eraser, okay?

76
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:15,544
If Dad's a liberal Democrat,

77
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:18,587
then you'd have to say Mom
is the one thing more extreme.

78
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,670
She's a guilty liberal Democrat.

79
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,587
Well, he grew up poor and he knows
what it is to work like a dog.

80
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,920
But Mom came from money and luxury...

81
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:31,088
and, you know, spends all her time
doing volunteer work for everybody.

82
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:35,755
She's with the American Civil Liberties
Union and Save the Whales...

83
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:39,671
and she raises dough for the
Whitney Museum and Lenox Hill Hospital.

84
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,713
She's always got something going,

85
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:46,131
like throwing some chic soiree
to help the New York Philharmonic.

86
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:53,343
Lane and Laura go to Nightingale,

87
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,302
which is this ritzy school
on East 92nd Street.

88
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,636
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, there he is.

89
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,844
- He is so gorgeous.
- Who is he?

90
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:09,803
We don't know, but we always
see him around this neighborhood.

91
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,803
- She's in love from afar. - I'm sure we can
think of a way to get her to meet him.

92
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:16,720
Please, no humiliating schemes.

93
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,428
You guys, my mom is
in there with a patient.

94
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:25,263
Claire's their best friend.
Her mom's a shrink on Central Park West.

95
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:28,263
Years ago, Claire drilled
a secret hole in the wall,

96
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:33,304
and we get our kicks after school
sometimes kinda tuning in on her clientele.

97
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:38,930
I've been having these fantasies
about... other men,

98
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,305
and, uh... you know,

99
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,264
it makes me feel bad and, um,

100
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,555
you know, guilty.

101
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:51,305
Oh, I ha... Um, I had
that elevator dream... again.

102
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,431
And, um, I'm in the elevator...

103
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,348
and... it just keeps going up...

104
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:01,140
and up and up.

105
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,806
Now you have to meet Grandpa.

106
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,891
Eighty-eight years old.

107
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:09,057
Found him at Grand Central Station.

108
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,432
- He thought he was
at the Botanical Gardens. - Thanks.

109
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:13,974
You have to keep your eye on him.

110
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:16,349
Last year he wandered out
of the bathroom in a towel...

111
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,349
and got on line in Times Square.

112
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:22,475
We had to send Frieda to get him back.
Oh, she's our maid.

113
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:25,558
Personally, I think she was
Hitler's maid at Berchtesgaden,

114
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:27,892
but she's the only one
who can handle Grandpa.

115
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,558
I found your arch supports in the stew!
Whatever were they doing in the stew?

116
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:37,059
Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Frieda.

117
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:41,518
Finally, there's my
dad, who lives in Paris but visits a lot.

118
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,309
You see, he and my stepdad
are great friends.

119
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:48,852
And if you ask me, he still has a crush on
Mom, although they've been divorced for years.

120
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:52,560
They're all friends, though, and they
come to each other with problems.

121
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:55,685
I can't believe it.
Giselle left me.

122
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,894
Look at this face. She left me with my
best friend, suddenly, out of left field.

123
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:02,852
- She didn't give any warning?
- Nothing at all. Look at that.

124
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:06,895
Did you ever see anything... I'm so
distraught over this, I can't tell you.

125
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,936
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Ohhh.

126
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:12,228
I should go to Paris and jump off
the Eiffel Tower. I'll be dead.

127
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,020
In fact, if I get the Concorde,
I could be dead three hours earlier,

128
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:17,020
which would be perfect.

129
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,646
Or... Wait a minute.
With the time change,

130
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:23,604
I could be alive for six hours in
New York, but dead three hours in Paris.

131
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:26,437
- Sit down. Relax. - I could get things
done and I could also be dead.

132
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:30,729
You didn't hear the signs.
She must've given you some signs, Joe.

133
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,188
What do you think I am, an idiot? What
kind of signs you think she gave me?

134
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:38,688
I found this photo in her underwear drawer?
She muttered his name when making love?

135
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:41,772
- I'm not talking about that.
- No, that's what happened.

136
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:44,563
- What? Joe! - I didn't see it.
I couldn't put it together.

137
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:48,231
I'm really glad you didn't marry her.
I told you, don't do it.

138
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:51,231
- I would've been happy to marry her.
- I'm really glad.

139
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,481
You want a glass of something?
Some wine?

140
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:57,231
I'll take anything. I gotta have
a drink. Know what the sad part is?

141
00:09:57,273 --> 00:10:02,774
- I thought everything was going well.
- You always pick the wrong women.

142
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:05,607
- Hey, I picked you.
- Yeah, we got divorced.

143
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,607
- 'Cause you were impossible to live with.
- I was impossible to live with?

144
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,524
I love this. You couldn't figure out
whether you wanted to be...

145
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,691
a psychoanalyst or a writer.

146
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:17,733
So, I compromised.
I became a writer and a patient.

147
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:20,775
We're gonna find you somebody.
We... We know a lot of people.

148
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:23,566
- Can't we find somebody?
- I've been trying since we got divorced...

149
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,733
to find the right woman for him,
somebody to match up with his personality.

150
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:30,234
But I'm beginning...
Honey, bring another glass.

151
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:34,151
I'm beginning to wonder if the world
population of women isn't too limited.

152
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,151
- Thank you.
- Well, I mean...

153
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:40,276
- You've had really bad luck. - No, he hasn't.
He's had an unerring sense of poor choice.

154
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:44,777
And the question is, does he want to spend
his golden years with somebody or not?

155
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,902
- What, are you into
my golden years suddenly? - Yes.

156
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:50,944
- You have to think about those things.
- Men age differently than women.

157
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:55,027
- Two more years, I'm gonna look
like your son. - Oh, that was so mean.

158
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,945
Don't you laugh.

159
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:00,445
Don't talk about my golden years.
She's got me in a home already.

160
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:03,611
What about Madeline?
After me.

161
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:07,403
Madeline was won... Madeline was
an archaeologist. She was fabulous.

162
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:09,403
Madeline was a nymphomaniac.

163
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:12,071
Yeah, okay, she had
a little problem with fidelity.

164
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:15,362
- I didn't happen to see it. But she was
a brilliant woman. - What about Carol?

165
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:17,696
Remember Carol what's-her-name?

166
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,821
- Carol was a poet, and a member of MENSA.
- She was a heroin addict.

167
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:24,822
She was also a heroin addict,
but I thought it was insulin.

168
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:28,363
- You know what the problem is? Listen.
- This is the problem.

169
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:31,863
- He's still in love with you.
I've always said this. - Oh, honey.

170
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:34,447
Who can blame him?
Of course he is.

171
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,447
- Ah, come here. Come here, my two men.
- That's the problem.

172
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,906
Two men.
I'm pining after Giselle.

173
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:42,156
We're gonna get somebody
who's nearly normal.

174
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:46,364
I don't know if we're gonna get
somebody. This is the problem.

175
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,406
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:54,740
Hey. What's all the secrecy about?
Why Harry Winstons?

177
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:58,615
Listen... I want you to help me pick out
an engagement ring for Skylar.

178
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,490
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

179
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:03,824
So, you're looking
for an engagement ring?

180
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:05,824
We're getting married.

181
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:08,200
Uh, I'm getting married.
Not to her.

182
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:11,325
Now, what size did you have in mind?

183
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,741
- What size?
- Uh-huh.

184
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:17,783
Oh, um... Well, she's not huge.

185
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:20,283
I mean, she's not bony either.
She's got flesh.

186
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,284
Something simple, but elegant?

187
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,826
- That's it.
- Simple, but elegant. Exactly.

188
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:30,117
- Like this one. - Oh, my God,
that's beautiful. That is beautiful.

189
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:34,367
- Look at that. - That's the mos
beautiful thing I ever saw. Hello.

190
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,910
So, what is that gonna cost me?
I like it.

191
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:40,535
- Fifty-five thousand.
- Fifty-five thousand dollars, you say?

192
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:44,993
Uh, well, let me take
this off then because...

193
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:48,577
I don't think that...
Actually, as I look at it, it's really...

194
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,744
To Skylar's taste, it's kind of...
tacky. She's not a mafia bride.

195
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:55,203
- Will you help me out?
- Here's a lovely one.

196
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:57,744
- That is... That is pretty.
- Pretty simple.

197
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,744
Well, I don't...

198
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:02,328
What is that gonna cost me?
About fifteen-hundred, 2,000?

199
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:04,954
- Eight thousand.
- Eight thousand dollars.

200
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:07,079
- Um...
- It's more in the ball park.

201
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,412
- It's in the range.
- It's the right neighborhood.

202
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,620
- Not my neighborhood, but...
- But it's a better neighborhood.

203
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:16,162
What the hell. Right? 'Cause
we're getting married. Let's do it.

204
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:20,538
- It's pretty.
- I think it's an absolutely exquisite ring.

Mrs. Holden Spence.

239
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:25,509
Skylar Spence!
I love the sound of that.

240
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:29,051
- He's taking her to Le Cirque for
dinner tonight. - Le Cirque? No kidding.

241
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:32,259
- He's gonna propose.
- I don't wanna blow my own horn here,

242
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:34,801
- but I'm the one who introduced them.
- We've heard it.

243
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:37,594
I did!
He came to work at our law firm...

244
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:40,427
The first day he was there,
I said, " This kid is great!

245
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:43,135
His feet are on the ground.
He's perfect for her."

246
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:45,135
Frieda, the pasta has no sauce.

247
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:49,260
It's Bavarian pasta! It doesn't need
any sauce! Italian pasta needs sauce.

248
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:52,928
- The Italians were weak!
- Okay, fine. Just gimme some pepper.

249
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,845
I cannot understand you!

250
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:58,053
Your solution to rampant crime
is let criminals go free?

251
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:01,095
- No, Charles Ferry deserves
a parole. - What? What is this?

252
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:04,971
Are you kidding me? You want
somebody like this out on the streets?

253
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:09,012
"Armed robbery, assault, assault with
a deadly weapon, attempted escape."

254
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,679
- Scott, he was an abused child.
- Have a little compassion.

255
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,929
He went to prison his whole entire life
because he had a horrible childhood,

256
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,387
which is something
you know nothing about.

257
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,597
- Then one mistake after the other.
- One mistake?

258
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,805
Yes. It leads to bad crime, corrupt...
I don't wanna discuss this with you.

259
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,805
- I can't listen to any of this!
- I can't stand this.

260
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,930
- I need my wallet.
- Where are you going?

261
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,972
- Up to the Polo Grounds.
- No, no, no.

262
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:34,390
- Giants and Cardinals are having
a doubleheader. - Pop, you can't go out.

263
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,765
- If you wanna take a walk, you gotta
go with Frieda. - Good idea.

264
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,390
- But they're playing today. This is
Labor Day. - It's June, Grandpa.

265
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:43,098
- It's June.
- The Polo Grounds closed years ago.

266
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,140
- Frieda, just take him for a short walk.
- Rained out?

267
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:50,141
- I'm not going with Frieda.
- All right, okay.

268
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:53,474
- I'm not going with her. I don't need
a German shepherd. - Take a nice walk.

269
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:56,182
- You know what the kids tell me?
- German shepherd. I feel so...

270
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:59,849
They think that Holden is gonna give
a little surprise to Skylar tonight.

271
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:03,058
If you keep gossiping about it,
there's gonna be no surprise.

272
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:06,392
- Honey, please...
- I'm going out.

273
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:09,100
- Have a nice time. - If Minnie calls,
tell her I went to the Polo Grounds.

274
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:11,767
Minnie's been
dead for 20 years, Grandpa.

275
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,601
I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying
if she calls, I'll be home later.

276
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:18,143
You know,
21 is too young to get married,

277
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:21,268
but if this was anybody but Holden,
I'd be against it.

278
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,643
Well, there's no way I'm getting married
'til I'm 35 and I've lived,

279
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:28,268
...and then I'll probably move in with
a woman. - Why do you make these jokes?

280
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:30,435
- You like Holden, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

281
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,185
The problem isn't Holden, it's Skylar.
She's a romantic twit.

282
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,602
- Yeah. Her problem with Holden is
he's not romantic. - So what?

283
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:41,060
- She's gonna marry him, right? -
I hope so. I want her room when she does.

284
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:44,561
I'm serious. I don't see any reason
why he should not leap at this guy.

285
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,770
Skylar suffers from
"white knight" syndrome.

286
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,103
Ever since her hormones kicked in,

287
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,770
she's been waiting for
some charismatic figure...

288
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:53,811
to come and sweep her
off her feet.

289
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:56,520
So Holden is that young Lochinvar.

290
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,479
- He's that young schnook. - He's a
schnook, but he's a loveable schnook.

291
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:04,146
- He's wonderful, and you... - What an
embarrassment. I'm never bringing a guy home.

292
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:07,646
- You have to listen.

- I've been thinking. Can I tell
you how I see us? - How?

310
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,403
Okay, well, we get married...

311
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,486
and we live near
my parents in Sharon.

312
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,778
Oh, I could never leave New York.

313
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:53,362
We leave my parents in Sharon.
We'd live in New York, of course.

314
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:57,112
It's just, at some point, we may want a
little more space if we have four kids.

315
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:59,987
I want two children.

316
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,945
Two kids is... Two is perfect!
Two is... Two is perfect for me.

317
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:06,113
Because four is really a lot.

318
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:09,155
And you'll be able
to stay at home with them and...

319
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:11,196
No, I'll be working.

320
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,571
I mean, when not working full-time.

321
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,946
Of course, you're gonna have
a career: journalism.

322
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,613
Architecture.

323
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:20,864
Architecture? Since when?

324
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,739
I don't know.
It's just some thoughts I've had.

325
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:26,406
Thoughts you...
You majored in journalism, but...

326
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,072
The point is...
The important thing is...

327
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:32,031
I think we agree with each other
on just about everything.

328
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:35,615
Shall I bring the dessert, sir?

329
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:39,032
Oh, is... It's time for dessert.
Yes, it is.

330
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:42,948
Will you excuse me for one second?
I'll just attend to a small matter.

331
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,573
- It's ready just as you wished, Mr. Spence.
- You think it's gonna work?

332
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:49,741
- Here we are, sir.
- Oh, look at... That's... That's perfect.

333
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:53,033
- I'm glad you liked it.
- Now, let me show you my end of the deal.

334
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:55,283
- Whoo! That's a honey, huh?
- Oh-ho. Oh, yes.

335
00:21:55,324 --> 00:21:58,158
Look at that.
It set me back just a little bit.

336
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:02,117
It's a brilliant idea, sir.
Very romantic.

337
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,575
- Yes, well, that's the kind of guy I am.
- Oh, I can see that.

338
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,659
I'm just gonna lay that right down there.

339
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:12,242
- Is that gonna knock her socks off?
I think so. - Yes, sir. Shall we?

340
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:15,742
- I'm relying on you, Umberto.
- Good luck, sir.

341
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,160
Is everything okay?

342
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,160
- All taken care of.
- Shall we order dessert?

343
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:23,160
- I took the liberty.
- You did?

344
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:26,660
I know you like a take-charge kind
of guy and I'm comin' through for you.

345
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:28,660
- It's not like you.
- Anything for you.

346
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:31,452
- Umberto, will you please do the honors?
- Parfait!

347
00:22:31,494 --> 00:22:33,452
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, mmm!

348
00:22:33,494 --> 00:22:37,452
Oh, my God, it's delicious!
And peach, my favorite flavor.

349
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:40,994
- It's delicious.
- What are you doing? Stop it!

350
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:43,286
- What are you doing?
- Where's the rest of the dessert?

351
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,870
- What do you mean? - Where the whipped
cream and the cherry are.

352
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:48,037
- I ate it.
- You ate the ring?

353
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,578
- What ring?
- Honey, I bought you a diamond ring!

354
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,578
- You did?
- I went to Harry Winston's.

355
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,120
- Where is it?
- I put it in the parfait.

356
00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:57,245
- Why?
- I thought it would be romantic!

357
00:22:57,328 --> 00:23:00,246
You thought it would be romantic
to put a ring on ice cream?

358
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:03,329
- This was not my idea.
This was D.J.'s idea! - D.J.?

359
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:06,413
She said it would give it
dramatic flair. I don't believe this.

360
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,204
I ate a diamond ring?

361
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,746
I turn around for two seconds and
there's $8,000 going down your throat.

362
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,914
- I swallowed a... Oh, my God!
- Take it easy. Stay calm.

363
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:17,955
- How big was it?
- It was tasteful, believe me.

364
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,497
- It was a big rock.
- I swallowed a what? A karat?

365
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,122
- It was a karat and a half, easily.
- You'd like two carrots?

366
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:25,164
- I'm dying!
- You're not dying!

367
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:29,248
- Something wrong, sir? - She just swallowed
a little jewelry. It's all right.

368
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:31,248
- How could you?
- How could I?

369
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,831
- Most people look at their food before
they lunge into it. -

370
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,790
Let me check your mouth.

371
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:40,415
I don't think this is going
to present much of a problem.

372
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:42,957
It's lodged in an accessible place.

373
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,624
It's an absolutely beautiful ring!
A solitaire.

374
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:48,082
A classic. A brilliant choice.
Congratulations.

375
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,291
Oh, congratulations, girl.
It is beautiful.

376
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:54,624
Katie! Katie, look.
She got engaged.

377
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,750
- So, uh, what is it, about two karats?
- No, a karat and a half.

378
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,000
- White gold?
- No, it's solid platinum.

379
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,000
- Solid?
- Harry Winston's.

380
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,000
- What'd you pay?
- Eight thousand.

381
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,833
I can get this same ring for you
for six from my brother-in-law.

382
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,668
I am so happy for you!
He is a wonderful man.

383
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,959

Summer came and Lane and
Laura got jobs at the Metropolitan Museum...

413
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:11,097
and spent weekends
at the beach.

414
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,473
Mom put together a group
of artists and writers...

415
00:27:13,514 --> 00:27:16,139
to petition for the parole
of Charles Ferry,

416
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,139
her new pet cause.

417
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:21,806
She even visited the prison and
was just appalled by the conditions.

418
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,931
What we need are open prisons.

419
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:29,932
Space. Space where the damaged
human spirit can heal.

420
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,807
I say give them an opportunity
to participate...

421
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,349
in decorating their own cells
with their own personal decorators.

422
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:41,641
And better cuisine.
European menus.

423
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:45,975
As for me, well, over the
years I was used to splitting summers up;

424
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:49,475
July with Mom in New York
and August with Dad in Europe.

425
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,225
Usually it was Paris,
but this time he took me to Venice.

426
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:57,101
Well, I think he still wanted to get
over memories of Giselle dumping him.

427
00:27:57,184 --> 00:28:01,101
Well, all I can say is, if we're
gonna talk about romantic cities...

428
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:03,767
I mean, they've got
the most gorgeous guys there...

429
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,059
and they can't keep
their hands off you.

430
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,309
It's great. The whole first week
was just heaven for me.

431
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:12,935
I was just having a ball,
sailing around on gondolas.

432
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:16,102
But Dad, well, he just seemed
to hang around the hotel.

433
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:19,143

449
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:19,814
I just feel so guilty.
I mean, I'm having all the luck.

450
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,815
- You should have fun.
- I am.

451
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:24,357
I still can't figure out
what went wrong with Giselle.

452
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,482
You know, I always thought
she was a little flighty.

453
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:31,315
- You want a drink? I'm gonna have a beer.
- Yeah. A Bellini.

454
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,858
- Let me give you this advice.
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:38,524
In life, when a relationship breaks up
that you're in... I hope they don't...

456
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:41,983
- Thank you. - It's better
to be the leaver than the "leavee."

457
00:29:42,024 --> 00:29:46,441
'Cause the leaver leaves, but
the "leavee" is left, and it's terrible.

458
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:51,109
The worst that happens to the leaver
is a little survivor guilt,

459
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:54,484
and survivor guilt is the worst thing
that should ever happen to you.

460
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:57,442
Yeah? Well, tomorrow
I'll spend with you.

461
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:00,109
- It's not necessary, really.
- No, it's okay.

462
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,776
Don't turn around. That's the couple.
Don't turn around.

463
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,943
- Who? - I told you about her.
I watched her check in the other day.

464
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:11,235
She's really lovely,
but I think married.

465
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:13,860
- Isn't she...
- Oh, my God!

466
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:16,776
- She's beautiful, right?
- I know who she is.

467
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,777
You're kidding?

468
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:21,611
Why didn't I think of it?
She's perfect for you.

469
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,236
How could she be perfect for me?
She's married.

470
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,027
No, she's not happily married.
You'd love her.

471
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:30,027
Tell me, who is she?
How do you know her?

472
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:33,528
My friend's mother is her shrink.
I know everything about her.

473
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:36,028
- You're kidding. What's her name?
- I don't know.

474
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:40,237
- What do you mean, you don't know?
Stop teasing me. - I'm serious.

475
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,070
- Who is she? - She's an art historian
and she's here to see the Tintorettos.

476
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:46,821
- Yeah?
- You know what I'm thinking?

477
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:49,404
- You got that look on your face.
- This is perfect.

478
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:52,154
- She jogs every morning alone.
- Yeah?

479
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:54,779
You could go and bump into her
and meet her.

480
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:56,904
No, thank you.
She's a married woman.

481
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,571
I'm telling you,
she's not happily married.

482
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:03,489
- Mm-hmm? - Complete
mismatch. The guy's some actor.

483
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:06,447
Anyway, it won't interfere
tomorrow because he sleeps late,

484
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,447
so you'll have no problem.

485
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,864
You can meet her. She'll definitely
be alone. I know this for a fact.

486
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:13,864
It's perfect.

487
00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:16,448
I'm out of shape.
I can't jog. I can't do it.

488
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:21,823
I haven't touched my treadmill
in weeks... 572 weeks. That's 11 years.

489
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:25,282
- I wheeze. Stop looking at me like that.
- No.

490
00:31:25,365 --> 00:31:27,990
- I'm not gonna do this.
- We're gonna get you some jogging clothes.

491
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:31,491
- She is really something.
- Tomorrow morning... you're gonna jog.

492
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:22,327
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

493
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:24,411
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you all right?

494
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:27,578
- Yeah. - You don't happen
to know which way the Gritti is?

495
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:30,703
Uh... I think it's back that way.

496
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:32,703
- Over there?
- Yeah.

497
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:36,787
- 'Cause jogging in Venice,
everything is so serpen... - Labyrinthine.

498
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,787
- Labyrinthine!
- Yes. You okay?

499
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,788
Yes, I'm fine.

500
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:43,663
You gotta keep in shape.
I jog every day. You?

501
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:45,829
- Yes, I do.
- You an American?

502
00:32:45,871 --> 00:32:49,329
- I... Yeah.
- It's a great country, isn't it?

503
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:52,079
- It's beautiful.
- The mountains and the prairies.

504
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:55,705
- Oh, Amer... Yeah, America. - The oceans,
you know, white with foam and everything.

505
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:58,039
So...

506
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:00,997
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yes.

507
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,289
- Sit down.
- No, I'm okay.

508
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,164
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

509
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:08,623
I have a pain in my chest
that's radiating down my arm.

510
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:12,748
- That's your heart. - No. In my case,
it's stress. I get it every other day.

511
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,456
- Okay. Breathe.
- What is your name?

512
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,831
- Von! Oh, here you are.
- Hi.

513
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,873
I was just giving him
directions. Are you okay?

514
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:24,666
- Okay. You said you wanted to do
three miles. Come on. - You okay?

515
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:26,874
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Breathe, breathe.

516
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:28,832
Nice shoes.

517
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:32,541
First I nearly
drop dead. I couldn't breathe.

518
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,541
Then her husband showed up.

519
00:33:34,624 --> 00:33:37,208
Her husband did come, huh? That's rare.

520
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:40,167
Rare? So is a coronary
thrombosis in our family.

521
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,208
Oh, did you get her name?

522
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,792
Von. Vonnie.

523
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:48,792
Listen, she's passionate about Tintoretto.
She's working on a book about him.

524
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:52,668
Obviously she's here to visit
the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.

525
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:55,793
I don't know what all this means.
What are all these art books?

526
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:59,834
She'll be at the Scuola. He
won't. They have nothing in common.

527
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:02,793
You bump into her again. Now
the groundwork's been laid.

528
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,377
You say, " Hello.
Didn't we meet jogging?"

529
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,794
I was the guy who had the sudden stroke.

530
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:11,585
Then you impress her with your
knowledge of her favorite painter.

531
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:14,794
Hey, you gotta be kidding. My
knowledge of art is limited...

532
00:34:14,877 --> 00:34:17,710
to Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh.

533
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:20,503
- What the hell do I know about this?
- Trust me, Dad.

534
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:24,586
Before we leave Venice, your
lips will be pressed to hers.

535
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,295
Yes. Unfortunately, I left
my Chapstick in New York.

536
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:35,921
What is this? "The rapidity
of his brush strokes..."

537
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:39,421
"Chiaroscuro outbursts of color..."

538
00:34:39,504 --> 00:34:42,129
I told Dad
everything I knew about Von...

539
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:44,462
and he studied his Tintoretto book.

540
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:48,255
I told him her likes, her
dislikes, her deepest feelings,

541
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,797
everything from her passion for Bora
Bora and "Mahler's Fourth Symphony"...

542
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,797
to her favorite flower:
the African daisy.

543
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,797
I mean, it was everything.

544
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,088
When he showed up at the
Tintoretto Museum that afternoon,

545
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:03,006
he could've given a
course on the subject.

546
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:07,089
- Hello again.
- Hi. Goodness.

547
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:09,631
You lived. How are you? I was concerned.

548
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:13,006
Oh, no, I was fine. I just
went back to the hotel before...

549
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:16,257
and had the concierge...
oil my pacemaker.

550
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,757
- - You know, I...
Incidentally, my name is Joe Berlin.

551
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,965
Vonnie Sydell.

552
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:24,465
It's a funny coincidence I see you here.

553
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:28,925
You know, two New Yorkers jogging in
Venice and we bump into each other.

554
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:31,800
- How did you know I was a New Yorker?
- No, I didn't.

555
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:35,091
But, you know, I, like,
assumed that, you know...

556
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,091
You're completely correct
to ask that question.

557
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:41,175
It's a good question. You
should not be ashamed of it.

558
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:44,467
Well, I live on 84th and Riverside.
Where in New York do you live?

559
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:48,717
In Paris. Well, I-I was a New
Yorker, but now I settled in Paris.

560
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:53,092
But I come back to New York all
the time 'cause I love it there.

561
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:55,009
What brings you here?

562
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:59,635
Oh, I wouldn't think of being in Venice
without checking out the Tintorettos,

563
00:35:59,718 --> 00:36:03,343
because he was... he's my
favorite... master in the world.

564
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:06,010
I just adore his work.
I'm crazy about it.

565
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:08,010
He was a very deep genius.

566
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:12,844
The deepest. Th-The
rapidity of his brush work.

567
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,178
Th-The chiaroscuro...
outbursts of color.

568
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:19,594
His capacity for controlled gesture.

569
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:24,136
Born in 1519,
only to die again in 1594,

570
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:28,429
but that's... the way
it happens to most of us.

571
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:31,679
So you have a real
appreciation of his work.

572
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:35,679
How could I not have an appreciation
of a man who was short in stature...

573
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,762
but with a proud and obstinate nature,

574
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:43,013
who painted outside the,
the academic convention...

575
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:46,846
of 16th century Venice?

576
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,888
What do you do, Mr. Berlin?

577
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,305
You can call me Joe. I'm-I'm-I'm
a writer. Novelist, mostly.

578
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:56,431
Joe Berlin. I saw one of your books.

579
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,847
I did. I remember it.
It had a very sexy cover.

580
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:03,681
It was at the stalls on
Fifth Avenue, the 99-cent bin.

581
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,931
Well, you know, probably... the get-acquainted price.

582
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:09,098
- Oh.
- They'll do that sometimes.

583
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:11,765
In the United States, I'm
considered controversial,

584
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:15,348
but in Paris, where they have
an ear for literature, I...

585
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:18,348
You know, they were quick
to recognize the genius...

586
00:37:18,432 --> 00:37:21,015
of Poe and Faulkner and myself.

587
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,599
Well, basically, you
see, I'm a simple guy.

588
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:29,766
My idea is just to live in
Paris and maybe, you know,

589
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,141
fall in love and...

590
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:35,349
and take walks, uh, in the rain...

591
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:38,142
and-and, uh, listen to music,

592
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:41,850
like, uh, particularly,
maybe "Mahler's Fourth."

593
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:47,017
- This could be me talking. "Mahler's
Fourth" destroys me. - Could it?

594
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,142
Ah, yes, "Mahler's Fourth," no question.

595
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,893
I... I... See, I'm not... I'm not a, uh...

596
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:54,643
what you'd call a, uh,
uh, a technology guy.

597
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:57,351
- I hate technology.
- I know. I could tell by looking at you.

598
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:59,893
I-I-I, uh... I'm...
I still work on...

599
00:37:59,935 --> 00:38:04,060
one of those old-fashioned antique
portable typewriters that-that...

600
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:07,519
Are you telling me you haven't
succumbed to the cerebral computer age?

601
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:10,852
You know, I'm telling
you, I like the simple life.

602
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:13,394
I like to sit in my
room in Paris and write,

603
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:16,977
maybe visit New York a certain
amount in the summertime.

604
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:22,354
Maybe spend some time some place
romantic, like, um, Bora Bora.

605
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:26,229
I... I love Bora Bora.

606
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:28,937
Since the first time I went there,
I can't get it out of my mind.

607
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,437
Well, naturally. You
know, it's beautiful.

608
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,646
At night, the stars are so
luminous you can practically...

609
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,646
- Read by them.
- read by them.

610
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,688
Yes. Are you okay?

611
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:44,271
A little mist appeared in your eye then.

612
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,814
I thought you were gonna cry. I
swear, I thought you were gonna cry.

613
00:38:47,897 --> 00:38:49,939
No, I'm, uh... I'm okay.

614
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:53,606
- Are you sure? Is something wrong?
- No, um...

615
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:57,022
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
Something's so exactly right.

616
00:38:57,064 --> 00:38:59,022
- Yes?
- Yeah.

617
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:02,315
Wait here one second.
I'll be right back.

00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:11,861
I got you a present.

629
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:15,112
An African daisy. This is my favorite.

630
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,362
You know, what are you doing tonight?

631
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:21,945
I think Greg and I have plans.

632
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:24,528
Hey, how'd it go?

633
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:28,488
She was absolutely great. Whatever
you told me was right on the money.

634
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,821
- I feel guilty.
- Why?

635
00:40:30,904 --> 00:40:35,571
Because, you know, I made her cry.
She said that she felt close to me.

636
00:40:35,654 --> 00:40:39,488
So? You've established a beachhead.
Now you go on and win the battle.

637
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:43,697
Don't forget to blow on her back between
her shoulder blades. It makes her crazy.

638
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,905
Hey, I'm not gonna do that.

639
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:48,905
What goes on between her
and her shrink is private.

640
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:52,489
What are you gonna do, give me
a map of her erogenous zones?

641
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:55,990
- Dad, are you seeing her tonight?
- No, she's married!

642
00:40:56,073 --> 00:41:00,490
Listen, I'm not that guy. I don't
know Bora Bora from Walla Walla.

643
00:41:00,573 --> 00:41:02,990
What the hell do I
know about Tintoretto?

644
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:06,740
I can't tell the difference between
his chiaroscuro and his segretto sauce.

645
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:09,491
Don't forget to blow
between her shoulder blades.

646
00:41:09,574 --> 00:41:11,991
I'm not gonna blow between
her shoulder blades.

647
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:14,824
Plus, I use a word
processor, not a typewriter.

648
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:19,032
I hope you have something great to wear
tonight, 'cause we're going to a party.

649
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:21,074
A party? I...

650
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:23,533
I wanna introduce you to someone.

651
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,992
Dad.

652
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:30,950
This is Alberto.

653
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,200
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

654
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,533
Who are all these people? This is, uh...

655
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:39,159
- Venetians. Friends, guests in town.
- Yes?

656
00:41:39,243 --> 00:41:41,701
Did your enjoy your staying in Venice?

657
00:41:41,743 --> 00:41:44,409
Fabulous. It's the best. Absolutely
the best. She'll tell you.

658
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:48,409
Dad, I wanted you to meet Alberto because
I think you should be the first to know:

659
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:50,409
We're getting married.

660
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:53,160
Wonderful. Let me know what
century, I'll rent a tux.

661
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,077
This January.

662
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
- Pardon me?
- This January.

663
00:41:57,244 --> 00:42:00,077
This January.
You're joking, of course.

664
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,369
I am in love with Djuna.

665
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:05,202
We all love this little
girl because she's adorable.

666
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:07,953
But... But you are... This is a jest.

667
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:12,870
It is January 15, to be exact.
It's his mother's birthday.

668
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:17,286
- A joke. A jest, right? Am I right?
- Not at all.

669
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,411
Excuse... Excuse me one second. Come on.

670
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:23,996
I just wanna talk to you for a minute. Come
over here. Just for a second. Right here.

671
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,412
What are you talking about?
Tell me this is a joke.

672
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:29,412
Otherwise, there's gonna be carnage.

673
00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:31,746
We're crazy about each other.

674
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:36,038
How can you be crazy... You
met this guy... five days ago.

675
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,705
- So? - What do you mean, so?
Are you having a breakdown?

676
00:42:38,747 --> 00:42:40,705
Why, because I'm in love?

677
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:43,538
What do you mean, you're in
love? With what? What does he do?

678
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,247
- He's a gondolier.
- A... No, thank you.

679
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,498
- He's one of those guys with the
striped shirt and the hat? - No hat.

680
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:52,373
- What do you mean, no hat?
- He doesn't wear a hat.

681
00:42:52,414 --> 00:42:55,873
This is crazy. What are
you, you know... Talk to me.

682
00:42:55,914 --> 00:42:59,248
- Are you gonna... Are you talking
about getting married? - Yes.

683
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:01,248
- That's insanity.
- Why is it insanity?

684
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:04,790
Because you have to go to school.
You're gonna go back to Columbia.

685
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,124
You're gonna major in journalism
or law, not... not rowing.

686
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:11,624
People have dropped out of
Columbia before. It's been done.

687
00:43:11,707 --> 00:43:14,707
You are not going to
run off with a guy...

688
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,333
who you just met and who's a gondolier.

689
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:19,541
- He's a poet.
- He's a poet?

690
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:22,916
Let me tell you what rhymes
with gondolier: no lira.

691
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,166
- Okay? So, forget it.
- Oh, God, Dad.

692
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:35,542
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello, again.

693
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:39,126
- My God, what a coincidence.
- This is, uh... Joe, Greg.

694
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:41,042
- Hi. How do you do?
- Hi.

695
00:43:41,126 --> 00:43:44,960
- Were you... You were running this
morning... with the heart? - That was me.

696
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:47,293
Have you seen Bernardo
Bertolucci? Is he here?

697
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:50,377
I wouldn't recognize him
'cause it's a madhouse in there.

698
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,960
- Do you mind if I go ahead? If you want
to talk. Okay. - It's an absolute madhouse.

699
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:55,960
I'll get you a drink.

700
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:58,127
- Incredible. I mean...
- Is it?

701
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,211
Have you seen this place? I was
just going home. It's unbelievable.

702
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:07,044
- They have a... The whole thing is like
it's an old palazzo. - Oh, wow.

703
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:09,253
And it's really, really beautiful.

704
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:11,544
But, you know, frantic in there.

705
00:44:11,628 --> 00:44:13,754
- Hey, you look great.
- Oh.

706
00:44:13,837 --> 00:44:16,420
I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

707
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:19,879
- Why?
- I don't know. I can't take a compliment.

708
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:22,629
You look terrific. Why not? I'm sorry.

709
00:44:22,712 --> 00:44:25,420
No, it's my problem.

710
00:44:25,504 --> 00:44:29,213
- Why? Does it make you feel guilty?
- Uh, maybe. I don't know.

711
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:31,838
You seem to have all
the answers, don't you?

712
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:34,213
I think it makes you feel guilty.

713
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:38,963
I think that you must have fantasies
of maybe somebody coming along that...

714
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:42,881
You probably have dreams about boats...

715
00:44:42,964 --> 00:44:45,089
or... ships, maybe,

716
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:49,839
or maybe even, you know,
like an elevator that...

717
00:44:49,922 --> 00:44:53,422
You're on an elevator and it goes
higher and higher to the top floor...

718
00:44:53,506 --> 00:44:56,090
and then it doesn't stop at the top,

719
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:58,507
it just goes right through the roof...

720
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,840
and it just sort of
flies you over the ocean.

721
00:45:03,923 --> 00:45:06,840
I think I'm gonna faint. I do.

722
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,174
- Are you okay?
- Uh, uh, no.

723
00:45:10,258 --> 00:45:13,133
I'm... I'm a little overwhelmed...

724
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:16,883
and I'm glad you're leaving tomorrow.

725
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:42,177
The next
morning, we left Venice.

726
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,427
Dad made a flight to Paris
and I went to New York.

727
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,552
I couldn't wait to tell
Mom about marrying Alberto.

728
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:51,218
He was so beautiful, so sensitive.

729
00:45:51,302 --> 00:45:55,594
My plan was to drop out of Columbia
after the fall term and move to Italy.

730
00:45:57,761 --> 00:46:00,678
- Uh, excuse me. That's mine.
- No, it's...

731
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:02,719
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

732
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:05,178
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's not mine.

733
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:08,679
- It's okay. We both like shopping
at Hunting World. - That's where I got it.

734
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:11,679
- Oh, God, now I know it's mine.
- It's all right. I'll give you a hand.

735
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:13,845
- Thanks.
- Um... your bra.

736
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:16,762
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Underwear.

737
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:18,887
Petrarch's sonnets. What do you do?

738
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:22,221
Um, depends who the guy
is. No, just kidding.

739
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:26,555
Um, I actua... 'Cause I work
for the Colombian drug cartel.

740
00:46:26,596 --> 00:46:29,555
- Yeah, I gift wrap
the cocaine. - Mm-hmm.

741
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:32,763
Why am I so nervous? I'm
a student at Columbia.

742
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:35,306
- Oh, is that right? My uncle teaches there.
- No.

743
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:38,972
Yeah. Math Department.
I'm, uh, Ken Grisley.

744
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:41,139
Djuna Berlin.

745
00:46:41,222 --> 00:46:44,556
Did I really want
to spend my life making pasta...

746
00:46:44,597 --> 00:46:46,972
and riding around in gondolas?

747
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:50,265
To tell you the truth, those
canals are awfully polluted.

748
00:46:50,348 --> 00:46:52,473
I mean, Alberto was cute,

749
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:55,723
but Ken was... hot.

While I'd been
away, an awful lot had happened.

759
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,938
Mom bought Skylar a
drop-dead wedding dress,

760
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:24,979
and Holden's father and
my stepdad became friends.

761
00:48:25,063 --> 00:48:28,022
They discovered a common
interest: horse racing.

762
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,730
So, they chipped in and
bought a thoroughbred.

763
00:48:30,772 --> 00:48:33,897
And Lane and Laura had a
great time at the beach.

764
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,022
But one hot summer weekend, with
everyone else in New York away,

765
00:48:38,105 --> 00:48:40,647
they found themselves in town.

766
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:02,899
- So, we're probably the only ones left
in the city this weekend. - Yeah.

767
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:07,274
We usually go to South Hampton, but
this weekend we had tickets to a show.

768
00:49:07,357 --> 00:49:10,942
I love the city when it's empty.

769
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:12,942
- Me too.
- Me too.

770
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:18,233
To make a long
story short, they've all become close.

771
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:22,192
His name... if you can believe
it... is Jeffrey Vandermost,

772
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:24,609
and he's heir to the
Vandermost millions.

773
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:28,984
Meanwhile, they're both in love with him,
and one of them's heading for a broken heart.

774
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:33,526
Fall was
particularly beautiful this year.

775
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:36,526
I think I like it even
better than spring,

776
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:39,569
and with October comes Mom's birthday.

777
00:49:39,652 --> 00:49:43,110
This year we invited Holden's
parents over to celebrate,

778
00:49:43,194 --> 00:49:46,902
but just before they arrived
we had an unexpected visitor.

779
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,902
That's a gorgeous color.

780
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,902
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

781
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:53,903
- These are from your ex-husband,
my biological father. - Oh! Joe!

782
00:49:53,986 --> 00:49:56,903
- Oh, look, everybody!
- You know what that is? That's caviar.

783
00:49:56,986 --> 00:50:00,445
Frieda, could you put this on
ice? Nothing like sturgeon eggs.

784
00:50:00,486 --> 00:50:02,403
- Are you expecting Mr. Ferry?
- I am, yes.

785
00:50:02,486 --> 00:50:04,403
- You are?
- Charles Ferry?

786
00:50:04,486 --> 00:50:07,404
He just got out of prison. He has
no family. I figured, you know...

787
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,404
- So he can join our family?
- What?

788
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:13,404
- You're letting a criminal come into this
house? - He's paid his debt to society.

789
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:15,904
Don't start. I don't wanna hear this.

790
00:50:15,987 --> 00:50:19,904
No! Society forgave him his debts.
He did not pay his debt to society.

791
00:50:19,987 --> 00:50:23,447
How did I wind up with a kid on the other
end of the political spectrum from me?

792
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:25,905
- Where did I fail?
- You didn't fail, Dad.

793
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:28,905
- If I was you, I'd start hiding the
silverware. - Don't be rude, Scott.

794
00:50:28,988 --> 00:50:31,905
He's coming over for just a drink.

795
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,905
You guys have everything.

796
00:50:33,988 --> 00:50:37,573
Mr. Ferry, hi. I'm... I'm Bob
Dandridge. This is my wife Steffi.

797
00:50:37,656 --> 00:50:40,573
Hello, Mr. Ferry. Welcome
to our home. Welcome.

798
00:50:40,656 --> 00:50:43,573
I'd like you to meet my daughter Skylar.

799
00:50:43,656 --> 00:50:46,073
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- This is Skylar and her fiance Holden.

800
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:48,073
I'm... I'm the fiance.

801
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:51,157
- Uh, can I get you something to dr...
- Nobody gets behind me.

802
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,157
Right. Okay. Sure.

803
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,365
- Uh, can I get you something to drink?
- Uh, vodka.

804
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:59,365
Right. Maybe, uh, on
the... Uh, or, or...

805
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:01,365
- Maybe right in the arm.
- Just... Just...

806
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:03,866
I'll, I'll get you a... Straight up.

807
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:05,866
Honey, Mr. Perr... Mr. Ferry. Sorry.

808
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:10,033
Uh, he's been living amongst vicious
killers. No wonder he's skittish.

809
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:13,033
- A lot of times a guy'll come up
behind ya and... Swish! - "Swish"?

810
00:51:13,116 --> 00:51:16,033
You get your blade out quick, you
stick it in him, or you're dead.

811
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:18,034
- Ahh.
- The blade. The blade.

812
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:21,034
H-Have you stuck a lot of
other inmates, Mr. Ferry?

813
00:51:21,117 --> 00:51:23,034
Enough.

814
00:51:23,117 --> 00:51:25,034
- Uh, the d... the doorbell.
- That's enough for me.

815
00:51:25,117 --> 00:51:27,034
- How many is "enough"?
- How is that?

816
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,534
- Would you like another one?
- Oh, it's your parents.

817
00:51:29,617 --> 00:51:31,868
- Hi! Hello. How are you?
- Ohh!

818
00:51:31,952 --> 00:51:33,868
- Good to see you, dear.
- Hi, Arnold.

819
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:37,368
- Happy birthday, Steffi.
- Oh, thank you, Lynn. Thanks for coming.

820
00:51:37,452 --> 00:51:40,368
Hi, Arnold. I have
someone I want you to meet.

821
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:43,368
Mr. Ferry. Mr. Ferry. I'd
like you to meet Mr. Ferry.

822
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:45,869
This is my good friend Lynn.

823
00:51:45,953 --> 00:51:47,869
- And this is Arnold.
- I must say...

824
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:50,869
- Mr. Ferry is just out of prison.
- Yes, I'm aware.

825
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:54,369
I'm lucky the parole came through, but
I was gonna get out one way or the other.

826
00:51:54,453 --> 00:51:56,994
- What exactly does that mean?
- Ice the guard.

827
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:58,994
- No pictures, sister.
- I'm sorry.

828
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:01,495
What do you mean, "ice the guard"?

829
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:03,995
- Get out through the ventilation shaft.
- Ice. Really?

830
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,495
Come up behind him with a box
cutter, rip out his carotid artery.

831
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:09,495
- Oh.
- What's a box cutter?

832
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:12,495
- May I have a glass of white wine?
- We have white wine.

833
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,496
You gotta be careful, though.

834
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,996
Guy on cell block four tried it,
didn't have all the angles figured.

835
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,997
- Got his tit caught in the wringer.
- His tit? Really?

836
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,122
- Oh, uh, the terrace.
- Let's go up to the terrace.

837
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:27,122
- Good idea. Let's get some
wine. - Big, wide-open spaces.

838
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:29,123
Are you sure this guy is rehabilitated?

839
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:32,123
Honey, he was in prison,
not a finishing school.

840
00:52:32,206 --> 00:52:34,123
Well, you know my sentiments,

841
00:52:34,206 --> 00:52:36,123
but very happy birthday.

- Ohh.
- Is that okay?

869
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,838
Okay? Honey.

870
00:54:11,921 --> 00:54:14,838
- I'm gonna grab a few drinks.
You want anything? - No, thanks.

871
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:18,338
But before you do, would you get Steffi's
present for me? I left it in the car.

872
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,631
- Oh, yeah.
- Holden, here.

873
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:25,422
Are you enjoying the view?

874
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:28,797
I like any view after years and
years in that stinkin' rat hole.

875
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:31,172
Oh. That's very vividly put.

876
00:54:31,256 --> 00:54:33,172
S-Sweetly honest.

877
00:54:33,256 --> 00:54:36,173
You know what it's like
in solitary confinement?

878
00:54:36,257 --> 00:54:38,673
No, I can't say that I do.

879
00:54:38,757 --> 00:54:41,673
I went to N.Y.U. I didn't
even stay in the dorm.

880
00:54:41,757 --> 00:54:45,673
- You know how long it is since I smelled
perfume? - Oh, do I have too much on?

881
00:54:45,757 --> 00:54:49,173
No, to me you smell like what
I think heaven would smell like.

882
00:54:49,257 --> 00:54:51,674
Oh. Well, thank you. That's really nice.

883
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:56,424
When you shook my hand before, I
thought my heart was gonna stop.

884
00:54:56,508 --> 00:54:58,424
Oh, that's sweet.

885
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:01,924
Uh, but remember, you've been
very deprived of female contact.

886
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:05,425
I used to lie in my cell at night
and dream of somebody like you.

887
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:07,759
Yeah.

888
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:11,259
Oh, uh, I took, um, a
criminology class in college.

889
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,925
- A very insight...
- You have very sensual lips.

890
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:17,759
Oh. O-Oh, well, i-it's a
part of me I rarely think of.

891
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,135
- Can I smell your hair?
- You wanna smell my hair?

892
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:24,926
Okay. You know what? It's
gonna be all gone soon.

893
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:28,426
I was thinking of cutting it. I
think Holden might like it short.

894
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,426
You know what I would
do if you were my girl?

895
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:33,761
It's a little chilly outside.

896
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:37,761
- Maybe I should get a shawl. - I would
make love to you in every room in the house.

897
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:41,552
On every bed.

898
00:55:41,594 --> 00:55:44,052
On every rug.

899
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:46,887
On every tabletop.

900
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,887
We also have some lovely
early American chandeliers.

901
00:55:52,428 --> 00:55:54,387
Let's go for a drive.

902
00:55:56,303 --> 00:55:59,762
Um, no. I don't think that
that would be such a good idea.

903
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:03,763
I haven't seen the ocean or been
up to Harlem or Chinatown in years.

904
00:56:03,846 --> 00:56:06,179
Oh, no, i-it's out of the question.

905
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:09,638
- Okay, but you can't blame me for tryin'.
- No.

906
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:12,638
I think that we should
get back inside before...

907
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:14,638
Before what?

908
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:17,139
Before you break your parole.

909
00:56:17,222 --> 00:56:22,139
If I took you in my arms and kissed
you right now, would you dime on me?

910
00:56:22,222 --> 00:56:24,680
- "Dime"?
- Turn me in.

911
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:27,389
Oh. Let's not find out.

912
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,390
Mmm.

913
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:41,806
How was it?

914
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,807
Uh...

915
00:56:45,891 --> 00:56:48,557
Very interesting.

916
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:52,057
I've never been kissed
by a sociopath before.

917
00:56:53,224 --> 00:56:55,849
I kissed you the best I could,

918
00:56:55,932 --> 00:56:58,850
considering the only practice I
had kissing in the last 10 years...

919
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:00,850
is with Vincent "The Thumb" Adatto.

920
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:14,018
Jeez.

921
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:17,018
Vincent "The Thumb" doesn't
know what he's missing.

922
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,559
Can I see you again?

923
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:22,559
Well...

924
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,977
You know, I'm getting married.

- Oh, wow. I can't believe this.
- Shut up, for once.

945
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:07,942
He's en route to New York now,

946
00:59:08,026 --> 00:59:09,942
and he's wonderful.

947
00:59:10,026 --> 00:59:12,442
It's been, like, a chance meeting,

948
00:59:12,526 --> 00:59:15,442
after all these years,
with a true soul mate.

949
00:59:15,526 --> 00:59:17,442
He senses my every need.

950
00:59:17,526 --> 00:59:19,943
It's like he knows what I'm thinking.

951
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:22,610
- It's like your fantasy come true.
- I... It is.

952
00:59:22,694 --> 00:59:25,194
I-I still can't believe it.

953
00:59:25,277 --> 00:59:29,235
You know, it's... it's not
that he's tall or handsome,

954
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:32,610
but he's, um... he's magical.

955
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:37,236
And he feels me in a way
that no man ever has before.

956
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,570
It's... He's romantic and he's sexy.

957
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,903
I had this dream that
I was in bed with him...

958
00:59:44,986 --> 00:59:48,279
and he was kissing my earlobes...

959
00:59:48,362 --> 00:59:52,404
and then he started
stroking my shoulder blades.

960
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:55,071
I nearly had an orgasm.

961
00:59:55,154 --> 00:59:58,071
I had lots
of neat stuff to tell Dad.

962
00:59:58,154 --> 01:00:00,987
He'd really made a big score with Von.

963
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:03,988
But now I've got to stop for a minute,

964
01:00:04,072 --> 01:00:07,322
because as much as we humans
like to think we control things,

965
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:09,822
that's not the way it works.

966
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:13,322
Suddenly, with no warning, Grandpa died.

967
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:17,323
It was in his sleep,
peaceful, with no suffering,

968
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,989
but it made philosophers of all of us.

969
01:00:20,073 --> 01:00:22,989
When your number is
up, your number is up.

970
01:00:23,073 --> 01:00:25,323
That's why it's very important...

971
01:00:25,406 --> 01:00:27,489
that we cherish each moment,

972
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:29,782
each moment of our lives,

973
01:00:29,824 --> 01:00:31,782
and not smoke.

974
01:00:31,824 --> 01:00:33,782
Smoke?

975
01:00:33,824 --> 01:00:37,782
Wh... I mean, he... Pop
smoked for 70 years, you know.

976
01:00:37,824 --> 01:00:40,282
- Well...
- He never exercised. He ate everything.

977
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:43,282
He ate cholesterol and, and fatty foods.

978
01:00:43,324 --> 01:00:45,783
He died at a healthy, ripe old age.

979
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:48,783
I haven't had steak in
so long. I love steak.

980
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:51,283
- Now you got him talking about food.
- Disgusting.

981
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:53,783
I'd kill for some marbleized meat.

982
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:58,951
They say six cups of coffee a day
prevents, like, prevents colon cancer.

983
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,909
Last week it was bad for you.

984
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:05,034
What's it all about? I mean...

985
01:01:05,117 --> 01:01:08,034
What are we doing? We're
rushing, we're rushing.

986
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:10,034
- Th-That's right.
- Where are we going?

987
01:01:10,117 --> 01:01:13,035
- They're so old.
- Into the void.

988
01:01:13,118 --> 01:01:16,077
That's it. The void is it, you
know. I never believed in God.

989
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,118
- Oh...
- No, I didn't, not even as a little kid.

990
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,618
I used to think... I remember this...

991
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,118
...even if He exists, He's done
such a terrible job, - Dad!

992
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,119
it's a wonder people don't file
a class action suit against Him.

993
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:30,119
You shouldn't be talking about...

994
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:33,119
There's gotta be some reason we're
here. It can't just be the new physics.

995
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:35,119
You gotta believe in something.

996
01:01:35,161 --> 01:01:37,119
The dignity of Man.

997
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:40,119
The flat tax, the right to
bear arms and school prayer.

998
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:43,120
- If there's nobody out there,
who are they praying to? - Stop fighting.

999
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:45,120
Please don't.

1000
01:01:45,162 --> 01:01:48,954
- Please don't start arguing in
front of Grandpa. - I can't believe you.

1001
01:01:48,995 --> 01:01:52,537
Wait a minute. He wasn't an
atheist. He wasn't a Republican.

1002
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,621
- He wasn't even a Democrat.
- Well, Mom, he must've been something.

1003
01:01:55,705 --> 01:01:57,955
- He was a foot fetishist.
- Yeah.

1004
01:01:58,038 --> 01:02:00,955
- It's the only group I remember
him belonging to. - That's true.

1005
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:02,955
He drove your mother crazy.

1006
01:02:03,038 --> 01:02:06,080
Pop, is that you?

1007
01:02:06,163 --> 01:02:08,580
I've got just one message for you.

1008
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:13,039
You work and work for years and
years, you're always on the go.

1009
01:02:13,122 --> 01:02:17,122
You never take a minute
off. Too busy makin' dough.

1010

1042
01:04:12,922 --> 01:04:14,839
That...

1043
01:04:14,922 --> 01:04:16,840
was unbelievable.

1044
01:04:18,965 --> 01:04:22,465
Just every...

1045
01:04:22,548 --> 01:04:25,590
thing you did and...

1046
01:04:25,631 --> 01:04:29,173
all the things you did.

1047
01:04:30,423 --> 01:04:32,341
Absolutely perfect.

1048
01:04:32,424 --> 01:04:34,841
Well,
actually, it wasn't perfect.

1049
01:04:34,924 --> 01:04:39,091
There was a moment in there when I
stroked when I should have hickeyed,

1050
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:41,757
but, you know, I apologize.

1051
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:43,757
I feel...

1052
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:45,925
I feel limp.

1053
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:49,508
You know, I'd really love
you to come to Paris with me.

1054
01:04:49,592 --> 01:04:51,508
- I'm serious.
- Yeah?

1055
01:04:51,592 --> 01:04:53,508
Paris?

1056
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:55,508
And then Bora Bora.

1057
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:58,508
Well, well, yes, Bora
Bora, but Paris first.

1058
01:04:58,592 --> 01:05:01,593
Then we'd work our way down
to a least one of the Boras.

1059
01:05:01,634 --> 01:05:04,259
We can live in your garret.

1060
01:05:04,343 --> 01:05:07,343
Uh, t-technically,
w-when I say "garret"...

1061
01:05:07,426 --> 01:05:09,593
I.. It's funny. It is a garret, and yet...

1062
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:13,052
- And drink wine and eat snails
'til the dawn comes up. - Snails?

1063
01:05:13,135 --> 01:05:15,552
Yeah. Remember?

1064
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:19,052
You said how you also loved waking
up in the middle of the night,

1065
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:22,052
...sitting in bed eating snails,
drinking wine. - Yes, yes. Yes.

1066
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:24,302
I said it was such a great coincidence.

1067
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:26,302
Well, they're... they're mollusks.

1068
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,303
I-I-I love, uh,
a good mollusk.

1069
01:05:29,886 --> 01:05:32,803
W-W-What do you mean,
the wedding is off?

1070
01:05:32,886 --> 01:05:36,011
- Exactly what I said. I gave back his ring.
- Why?

1071
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:39,511
Because there's someone else
I can't get out of my mind.

1072
01:05:39,595 --> 01:05:42,512
- But y-you're in love with
Holden! - No, Dad, I'm not.

1073
01:05:42,596 --> 01:05:46,512
At least I'm not sure I am, and I can't
cheat on him while I figure it out.

1074
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:49,512
- Cheat on Holden? He's gonna
be your husband! - No, Dad!

1075
01:05:49,596 --> 01:05:53,512
- In November. I'll show you. I got receipts from
caterers. - Bob, calm your denial mechanism.

1076
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:55,513
It's not that Holden isn't wonderful.

1077
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:59,013
It's just that somebody else has come
into my life and I must see where it goes.

1078
01:05:59,097 --> 01:06:01,972
- It wouldn't be fair to Holden if I didn't.
- Oh, fine! Okay.

1079
01:06:02,013 --> 01:06:04,972
Now that we've bought you
this fabulous wedding dress,

1080
01:06:05,013 --> 01:06:08,472
would you mind telling me who this new
Prince Charming is that suddenly emerged?

1081
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:11,473
- Well, you don't kn... You do, but not
like I do. - I'm sick.

1082
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:14,973
- Honey, what's the matter?
- My esophagus is going into spasms.

1083
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:18,473
- If my necktie goes up and down...
- Look what you're doing to your father.

1084
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:21,473
Tell me who has come
between you and Holden.

1085
01:06:21,515 --> 01:06:23,974
- Well, he's bright and charming...
- Yeah?

1086
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:26,974
and rough to the outside,
but that can change.

1087
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:30,349
- Are you gonna tell us, or is this
like a game show? -

1088
01:06:30,432 --> 01:06:32,349
You remember Charles Ferry?

1089
01:06:32,432 --> 01:06:34,349
- Pardon me?
- Charles Ferry.

1090
01:06:34,432 --> 01:06:37,349
For a minute I thought
she said Charles Ferry.

1091
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:40,350
- Now my esophagus is starting to move.
- Charles Ferry?

1092
01:06:40,433 --> 01:06:42,350
- Honey!
- The escaped convict?

1093
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:45,350
- Skylar! - Ex-convict.
He has a college degree.

1094
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:47,350
No, Skylar, let me tell you something.

1095
01:06:47,433 --> 01:06:50,350
You're having a psychotic
episode. You need help!

1096
01:06:50,433 --> 01:06:53,351
- You need shock treatment, or
industrial-strength Prozac. - Calm down.

1097
01:06:53,434 --> 01:06:55,351
Mom, you understand.

1098
01:06:55,434 --> 01:06:58,351
There is something incredibly
animalistic about him.

1099
01:06:58,434 --> 01:07:00,851
- We'll turn him over to the zoo.
- Oh, honey.

1100
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,351
- And yet he's like a child.
- Okay, we'll make it the children's zoo.

1101
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:06,852
- He's a criminal!
- Mom, I'm shocked.

1102
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:09,852
You've done nothing but
sing his praises for months.

1103
01:07:09,935 --> 01:07:11,852
Well, yes, as a social symbol.

1104
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:14,852
But as an actual person
to be with my child?

1105
01:07:14,935 --> 01:07:18,644
- How are you going to go out with this man?
- Guys, get out of here.

1106
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:21,145
You can't get behind
him. He won't let you!

1107
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:23,645
You try to scratch his
back, he'll knife you!

1108
01:07:23,728 --> 01:07:26,645
Under all that veneer
is a very soulful young attorney.

1109
01:07:26,728 --> 01:07:29,645
In fact, I was hoping you might
find a place for him in your firm.

1110
01:07:29,728 --> 01:07:32,645
I'll make him treasurer.
He can share a room with Holden.

1111
01:07:32,728 --> 01:07:35,646
Speaking as a woman, Holden
can be very animal too.

1112
01:07:35,729 --> 01:07:38,646
- Yes, Mom, but it's of the gerbil family.
- Oh, that's not...

1113
01:07:38,729 --> 01:07:41,646
- Get out of here!
- As your father, I forbid you...

1114
01:07:41,729 --> 01:07:43,646
to see this man Charles Ferry.

1115
01:07:43,729 --> 01:07:45,646
You will marry Holden as planned.

1116
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:49,272
As head of this house, I
command it! I decree it!

1117
01:07:49,313 --> 01:07:51,272
Thou shalt wed thy intended!

1118
01:07:51,313 --> 01:07:53,438
- Okay, come on, let's have...
- That's it.

1119
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,772
Let's get a drink. You're
sounding tiresomely Biblical.

1120
01:07:56,813 --> 01:08:00,688
"Tiresomely Biblical"? What is
this, Noel Coward with hockey?

1121
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:04,189
- She's not gonna waste her life like this
on a gangster. - Oh, she's a grown woman!

1122
01:08:04,273 --> 01:08:06,189
- You!
- What?

1123
01:08:06,273 --> 01:08:09,189
- You got him out of jail!
- This is my fault now?

1124
01:08:09,273 --> 01:08:11,981
Honey, what? What's wrong?

1125
01:08:12,023 --> 01:08:15,481
Jeffrey Vandermost asked
Lane out and not me.

1126
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:17,482
- Ohh.
- Oh, my God!

1127
01:08:17,524 --> 01:08:20,482
How am I gonna face
Arnold and Lynn Spence?

1128
01:08:20,524 --> 01:08:22,482
Is that all you're thinking about?

1129
01:08:22,524 --> 01:08:24,482
We bought a race horse together.

1130
01:08:24,524 --> 01:08:26,982
He's gonna want to cut it in half!

1131
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:29,982
We both liked him, and today
he asked if we could talk alone,

1132
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:31,983
so I got all excited.

1133
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,650
And then he asked me if I thought
Lane would go out with him...

1134
01:08:35,733 --> 01:08:38,150
if he asked her to a
dance in Connecticut...

1135
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:40,650
and that he had a mad crush on her.

1136
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:44,150

the money to pay for everything,

1164
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:23,073
and... and this car?

1166

Oh, this is a great idea to
take a walk here. It's beautiful.

Oh, good.

1170
01:10:38,825 --> 01:10:43,617
I just thought you'd wanna walk
around a little, see the fall leaves.

1171
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:45,617
Oh, they are stunning.

1172
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,117
It's amazing what you miss in the joint.

1173
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,117
There's no seasons. It's
just one long, gray nothin'.

What are your plans for the future?

1175
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,618
- I can't imagine you'd wanna work in the
restaurant forever. - You're right.

1176
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:00,243
Work all day for what? A few
lousy bucks. I got bigger plans.

1177
01:11:00,326 --> 01:11:03,493
- Like pursuing a law career.
- What?

1178
01:11:03,535 --> 01:11:05,493
A lawyer?

1179
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:07,494
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1180
01:11:09,536 --> 01:11:11,911
- You hear somethin'?
- A bird?

All right, here they
come. Timing's perfect.

1182
01:11:16,494 --> 01:11:18,911
- Move it!
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

1183

a pole up my ass? I'm goin'!

- Way to go, Ferry!

01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:30,037
- You got anything lined up?
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

1186
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,037
- Who's she?
- She's a friend.

1187
01:11:37,163 --> 01:11:40,121
Why'd you have to shoot?
You didn't have to shoot!

1188
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:43,121
- He was emptyin' the register!
- I got nervous!

1189
01:11:43,163 --> 01:11:46,746
Charles, just let me out
at the corner of Park and 93rd.

1190
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:54,247
Charles, let me out of this car!

1191
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,247
I want out of this car!

1192
01:11:59,164 --> 01:12:01,622
I will be quiet! Just let me out!

1193
01:12:01,664 --> 01:12:05,123
Shut her up, or I'll shut her up!

1194
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:09,123
Get out!

1195
01:12:20,499 --> 01:12:24,457
In October, Von
finally got up the nerve and left Greg.

1196
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:28,207
She bought a ticket on Air France
and took the first plane to Paris.

1197
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,874
By this time Dad had given up
his flat on the Left Bank...

1198
01:12:30,957 --> 01:12:32,875
and moved into a place...

1199
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:36,875
he knew would be straight out of
Von's fantasy of a Parisian apartment.

1200
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,875
In addition to taking guitar lessons,

1201
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:42,125
he traded in his word processor
for an old portable typewriter.

1202
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:44,125
Hi.

1203
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,126
Ahh!

1204
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:50,001
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

1205
01:12:50,084 --> 01:12:52,751
God, look at your place.

1206
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:57,168
This is, uh, out of a movie or, or
out of a dr... This is, like, my dream.

1207
01:12:57,209 --> 01:13:01,835
This is my dream apartment,
my dream view, right here.

1208
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,669
Back in
New York, it was Halloween.

1209
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,669
That's my favorite holiday.

1210
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:10,335
I mean, all the kids in the
building come trick-or-treating...

1211
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:13,044
and they all just look so great.

That's good! They're terrific!

1233
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,675
- Would you like some candy?
- What a banana!

1234
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,093
Nyaaaah!

1235
01:14:42,176 --> 01:14:44,301
- Holden!
- Hey.

1236
01:14:44,384 --> 01:14:47,343
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you!
- Yeah? I wasn't sure.

1237
01:14:47,384 --> 01:14:49,343
- I was worried.
- Oh, yes!

1238
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:53,176
- I'm... Holden, I'm so sorry.
- No, shh. It doesn't...

1239
01:14:53,259 --> 01:14:56,177
Mmm. It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1240
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,802
- Oh, I behaved so terribly.
- No, no, really, it was... it was me too.

1241
01:14:59,844 --> 01:15:01,802
- No, it wasn't.
- I missed you.

1242
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:03,802
- I really missed you.
- I missed you too.

1243
01:15:03,844 --> 01:15:05,802
I brought you Cracker Jacks.

1244
01:15:05,844 --> 01:15:08,803
Holden was so
much in love with my sister...

1245
01:15:08,845 --> 01:15:11,803
that it didn't mean a thing that
she had given him a hard time.

1246
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:14,803
Mom and Dad were so glad
to see them reunited.

1247
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:17,303
He gave her back the diamond ring,

1248
01:15:17,345 --> 01:15:21,303
only he wanted to be romantic, so he
put it in a box of Cracker Jacks...

1249
01:15:21,345 --> 01:15:24,137
and she swallowed it again.

1250
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:27,679
The rest of fall was
pretty normal... for us.

1251
01:15:27,762 --> 01:15:30,512
The only glitch we had
was on Thanksgiving.

1252
01:15:30,554 --> 01:15:33,887
Just after dinner,
Scott suddenly collapsed.

1253
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:35,887
Everybody panicked.

1254
01:15:35,972 --> 01:15:38,388
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

1255
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:42,680
There was blockage in an artery, but
it's all been dissolved, so he's fine.

1256
01:15:42,722 --> 01:15:46,180
- He's totally fine? There's no problem?
- Oh, no. Hundred percent.

1257
01:15:46,222 --> 01:15:50,681
Our scan indicated that the condition
occurred some time ago, perhaps a year,

1258
01:15:50,723 --> 01:15:54,681
so if he's exhibited any
strange or weird behavior,

1259
01:15:54,723 --> 01:15:58,806
it's probably because his brain
wasn't getting enough oxygen.

1260
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:00,764
And
wouldn't you know it,

1261
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:03,764
as soon as his brain
started functioning properly,

1262
01:16:03,848 --> 01:16:06,765
Scott resigned from the Young
Conservative Republican Club...

1263
01:16:06,849 --> 01:16:10,182
and started espousing left-wing,
Democratic, liberal philosophy.

1264
01:16:10,224 --> 01:16:14,057
Dad was overjoyed. He was
just as proud as can be.

1265
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:18,390
Remember I told you New York was
the most beautiful in the fall?

1266
01:16:18,475 --> 01:16:22,391
What I really meant was the
winter, at least when it snows.

1267
01:16:22,475 --> 01:16:24,391
Because under a blanket of snow,

1268
01:16:24,475 --> 01:16:28,683
New York City is truly gorgeous
and surprisingly peaceful.

1269
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:31,266
You know, when Christmas
comes we don't...

1270
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:34,976
We're not the kind of family that
hangs stockings or sings carols.

1271
01:16:35,017 --> 01:16:37,476
We don't have a goose or anything.

1272
01:16:37,517 --> 01:16:41,601
What we do do is head right for Paris and
spend our Christmas holiday at the Ritz.

1273
01:17:28,187 --> 01:17:30,105
Here, honey,
put your finger here.

1274
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:32,105
Do it, hard.

1275
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:34,105
- Well, he has a
fever. - Ahh-choo!

1276
01:17:34,188 --> 01:17:36,105
It's a cold.

1277
01:17:36,188 --> 01:17:39,605
I told you you should've put on some dry
clothes after you fell in the fountain.

1278
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,105
You go without me. I'll be all right.

1279
01:17:42,188 --> 01:17:44,106
We don't want to go without you.

1280
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:47,106
The Marx Brothers' are your
favorite movies. Mom, I feel so bad.

1281
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:50,106
- He should stay home if he feels sick.
- I'm gonna stay home.

1282
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:54,897
I'm so excited; I'm meeting this
guy named Guy, or this guy named Guy.

1283
01:17:54,981 --> 01:17:56,897
- Cool. Congratulations.
- Here, Dad.

1284
01:17:56,981 --> 01:17:59,857
- I brought you some tea.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

1285
01:17:59,898 --> 01:18:02,357
It's not gonna keep me awake?

1286
01:18:02,398 --> 01:18:05,357
No, it's completely herbal.
It's peppermint flavored.

1287
01:18:05,398 --> 01:18:07,982
- Hello, Joe. -
Joe! - Hi, Dad!

1288
01:18:08,023 --> 01:18:12,274
Oh, I'd say hello, but I'm sick and,
you know, you always catch everything.

1289
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:14,774
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

1290
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:16,774
- I'm not going tonight.
- Why not?

1291
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,941
- I knew it.
- What's wrong, Dad?

1292
01:18:19,024 --> 01:18:20,941
- Von left me.
- What?

1293
01:18:21,024 --> 01:18:22,941
What happened?

1294
01:18:23,024 --> 01:18:26,442
I have no idea, but she's
on her way back to New York.

1295
01:18:26,525 --> 01:18:29,442
When she first came,
everything was perfect.

1296
01:18:29,525 --> 01:18:33,150
She said it was like a
dream had come true for her.

1297
01:18:33,192 --> 01:18:36,234
And then suddenly, this morning...

1298
01:18:36,317 --> 01:18:40,818
Um, I want to go back home...

1299
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,818
to Greg.

1300
01:18:44,193 --> 01:18:46,110
Really?

1301
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:48,610
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1302
01:18:48,693 --> 01:18:50,651
Since when has, uh, this happened?

1303
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:52,985
I don't know.

1304
01:18:53,026 --> 01:18:55,111
Well, why?

1305
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:57,111
I... I...
I don't know.

1306
01:18:57,194 --> 01:18:59,611
I don't know how to explain it, exactly.

1307
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:02,111
Well, just tell me. You know, just...

1308
01:19:02,194 --> 01:19:05,694
Well, it's not that I don't
think that you're great. Okay?

1309
01:19:05,777 --> 01:19:07,819
- Um, I think you're great.
- Yeah?

1310
01:19:07,902 --> 01:19:12,487
Um, just, for years, you know,
I've been married to Greg,

1311
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:15,070
and, and he can be difficult,

1312
01:19:15,153 --> 01:19:20,112
and we've had our ups
and downs, certainly.

1313
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:23,113
- Since when did you have all these...
- I don't know.

1314
01:19:23,196 --> 01:19:27,946
It's just, I've... I've
always had this fantasy, okay,

1315
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,946
that, um...

1316
01:19:30,029 --> 01:19:33,113
that one day I would
meet the perfect man...

1317
01:19:33,196 --> 01:19:36,905
and he would fulfill my
dreams and I would have...

1318
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:39,405
the perfect life.

1319
01:19:39,489 --> 01:19:42,614
That fantasy, I think,

1320
01:19:42,697 --> 01:19:47,947
always sort of, um, was part of this
dissatisfaction that I had with Greg...

1321
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,947
and, and my life.

1322
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:53,615
And then you came along
and you seemed to know...

1323
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:56,948
every secret thing about me.

1324
01:19:58,906 --> 01:20:01,698
Let me put it this way.

1325
01:20:01,781 --> 01:20:04,698
I have seen my dream come true,

1326
01:20:04,781 --> 01:20:08,324
and my fantasy no longer tortures me.

1327
01:20:08,366 --> 01:20:10,824
I can deal with it.

1328
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:15,699
Yeah, but that's so neurotic.

1329
01:20:15,782 --> 01:20:18,699
Well, I know. I'm crazy.

1330
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,867
Well, but supposing I said to you...

1331
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:25,367
that none of this was really true;

1332
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:29,034
that this was all a facade
that I've been putting on;

1333
01:20:29,117 --> 01:20:33,368
that-that-that somehow
I had, you know, access...

1334
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:36,993
to your deepest feelings and your
needs and all your secret thoughts...

1335
01:20:37,035 --> 01:20:39,993
and, and I've been, I've
been playing this character...

1336
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:42,535
just to, just to win you over,

1337
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:45,535
to get you to like me, make you happy.

1338
01:20:45,576 --> 01:20:48,244
If that's what you told me,

1339
01:20:48,327 --> 01:20:50,744
then I'd say you were crazy.

1340
01:20:52,327 --> 01:20:56,036
So that's exactly why I'm
not going tonight. You know?

1341
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:59,036
Instead, I-I have plans
to go to Napoleon's tomb.

1342
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,370
- I'm gonna lie down next to him. That's
Christmas Eve for me. - That's so sad.

1343
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:06,370
- The women you pick.
- No, you're going out.

1344
01:21:06,453 --> 01:21:08,370
- Aaaaah-choo! -
Somebody's gotta take Mom.

1345
01:21:08,453 --> 01:21:11,370
- He's so sick.
- You're too sick to go out this evening?

1346
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:14,870
- I'm fine, as long as I don't move
my eyeballs. - He has a 101 temperature.

1347
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,871
- You're not going anywhere tonight.
- But I'm not in a Groucho mood.

1348
01:21:17,954 --> 01:21:19,871
- Aw, come on. You'll love it. Go.
- It's Christmas Eve.

1349
01:21:19,954 --> 01:21:21,871
It's Paris. There's a ball.

1350
01:21:21,954 --> 01:21:25,871
Besides, you're on the committee that
arranged the party for the Cinematheque.

1351
01:21:25,954 --> 01:21:29,621
- You have to go. Enjoy yourself.
- I'll go for a couple hours.

1352
01:21:29,704 --> 01:21:32,622
I gotta stay here, but
there's no reason you don't go.

1353
01:21:32,705 --> 01:21:34,664

our first Christmas Eve in Paris,

1391
01:23:37,964 --> 01:23:40,506
the month before we got married?

1392
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:42,548
I do, because that was...

1393
01:23:42,589 --> 01:23:46,048
that was when I knew that someday I
would absolutely have to live here.

1394
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:49,048
Mmm. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

1395
01:23:50,423 --> 01:23:53,882
I don't wanna panic you.
That was decades ago.

1396
01:23:53,924 --> 01:23:56,882
- I mean, decades, not, not...
- I know, I know. It was decades ago.

1397
01:23:56,924 --> 01:23:59,799
Do you remember that
cafe we used to go to?

1398
01:23:59,882 --> 01:24:03,299
Cafe Therese, or whatever,
with the cats? Do you remember?

1399
01:24:03,382 --> 01:24:06,133
- Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
- Yeah.

1400
01:24:06,216 --> 01:24:09,633
I hated that cat. I
mean, I-I-I hated...

1401
01:24:09,716 --> 01:24:13,133
Well, maybe that's why you were
scratching yourself all night.

1402
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:16,633
Was I scratching myself all night?
Is that what you noticed about me?

1403
01:24:16,716 --> 01:24:18,633
I certainly... I certainly did.

1404
01:24:18,716 --> 01:24:21,634
Well, I hated that cat.
I couldn't stand it.

1405
01:24:21,717 --> 01:24:25,134
But now that cafe is right around
the corner from where I live.

1406
01:24:25,217 --> 01:24:28,134
- You're joking. - Why would
I joke about something like that?

1407
01:24:28,217 --> 01:24:31,467
- You wanna go have a drink there?
- No.

1408
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:33,634
- Why not?
- Because we're drinking here.

1409
01:24:33,717 --> 01:24:37,635
Well, yeah, but... We can take our
mustaches off. Nobody's gonna know.

1410
01:24:37,718 --> 01:24:40,802
- What, are you having a nostalgic,
a sudden... - Yeah, I'm having a thing.

1411
01:24:40,885 --> 01:24:43,802
Sue me. I just thought
it would be kind of fun.

1412
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:47,802
- No, we can't sneak out... - Come on,
we'll take our mustaches off. No problem.

1413
01:24:47,885 --> 01:24:50,303
- That I'd like to do.
- Wouldn't you? Me too.

1414
01:24:50,386 --> 01:24:53,844
I never thought I'd hear you
say, "Take my mustache off."

1415
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:55,886
Please.

1416
01:24:55,928 --> 01:24:58,803
Anyway, we'll go. I-I'm
a little... I feel good.

1417
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:01,803
I've had three glasses of
champagne. I feel fabulous.

1418
01:25:01,886 --> 01:25:05,470
- Let's go see this place. - Yeah,
but y-you really wanna sneak out?

1419
01:25:05,554 --> 01:25:08,970
I do. It's not... We snuck
out before. Do you remember?

1420
01:25:09,054 --> 01:25:12,720
Remember that party with the
Hamilton-Wainwrights? It was so boring.

1421
01:25:12,804 --> 01:25:14,720
Oh, yes. Yes.

1422
01:25:14,804 --> 01:25:19,346
- I remember because we snuck out
through the toilet window. - Right!

1423
01:25:19,388 --> 01:25:23,013
The guy was singing "Climb Every
Mountain," and we couldn't bear it.

1424
01:25:23,096 --> 01:25:26,055
You knocked over the punch
bowl, if I remember correctly.

1425
01:25:26,096 --> 01:25:30,055
Yes, but you were the one who let out
the piercing shriek that got us caught.

1426
01:25:30,096 --> 01:25:33,222
Oh, and do you remember how
we made love? You know...

1427
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:35,722
- Ooh. Oh, I dropped...
- You dropped your cigar.

1428
01:25:35,806 --> 01:25:38,722
I know. Give me my cigar.
I dropped the cigar and...

1429
01:25:38,806 --> 01:25:40,722
You're so drunk.

1430
01:25:40,806 --> 01:25:43,389
I remember us making love, I, uh...

1431
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,515
- Candlelight. - I remember
the candles; I remember the hotel.

1432
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:50,140
I just don't remember you, unless
you were the one who was under me.

1433
01:25:50,223 --> 01:25:53,515
- Oh, now you're in character.
- I don't know where I am.

1434
01:25:53,557 --> 01:25:56,015
- I'm... I'm lost.
- Come on, let's go.

1435
01:25:56,057 --> 01:25:58,932
No, it's cold out there.
Our coats are in the car.

1436
01:25:59,016 --> 01:26:00,933
Forget it. It's a warm night.

1437
01:26:01,016 --> 01:26:02,933
Come on. Pretend you're young.

1438
01:26:03,016 --> 01:26:05,933
Well, I could for you.

1439
01:26:08,183 --> 01:26:10,099
You're better off without her.

1440
01:26:10,183 --> 01:26:13,600
How do you know? You never met her.

1441
01:26:13,684 --> 01:26:15,600
I know you.

1442
01:26:15,684 --> 01:26:17,600
Yeah. So? What does that mean?

1443
01:26:17,684 --> 01:26:20,600
A good psychiatrist
that listened to you...

1444
01:26:20,684 --> 01:26:23,684
would think that every time I get
involved with a woman, you get jealous.

1445
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:25,725
What are you laughing?

1446
01:26:25,767 --> 01:26:29,726
"Jealous." Joe, I just wish you'd pick
somebody that could make you happy.

1447
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:32,060
- Like who?
- I made you happy.

1448
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:35,060
- Yeah... I didn't say you didn't.
- I made you very happy.

1449
01:26:35,143 --> 01:26:38,185
- Hey... - When we weren't,
you know, at each other's throats.

1450
01:26:38,268 --> 01:26:41,811
- Does this ring a bell? This is
why I took you here. -

1451
01:26:41,894 --> 01:26:45,102
- Does this mean anything to you?
- Is this... Is this where we...

1452
01:26:45,186 --> 01:26:48,102
This is it, yes. That's why
I dragged you all over town.

1453
01:26:48,186 --> 01:26:50,477
Oh! Ohh! Oh, my God!

1454
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:53,477
- You remember this?
- This is where we stayed up all night.

1455
01:26:53,561 --> 01:26:57,145
I know. I held you in my
arms 'til the light came up.

1456
01:26:57,228 --> 01:26:59,687
- Do you remember that? Do you
remember that song? - Yeah, I do.

1457
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:03,187
'Cause I still sing that song.
I first heard it from you.

1458
01:27:03,228 --> 01:27:05,728

You know, over the years I often
wondered what would have happened...

1487
01:30:44,078 --> 01:30:45,995
had we stayed together.

1488
01:30:47,786 --> 01:30:50,495
That's something we're never gonna know.

1489
01:30:51,661 --> 01:30:53,578
We've managed to produce...

1490
01:30:53,661 --> 01:30:55,578
a fabulous daughter, though.

1491
01:30:55,661 --> 01:30:58,079
- I mean, she is
unbelievable. - Mm-hmm.

1492
01:30:58,162 --> 01:31:00,871
She's got your looks, fortunately,

1493
01:31:00,912 --> 01:31:04,371
and my... my magic personality.

1494
01:31:04,412 --> 01:31:06,871
- Yeah, she is wonderful.
- She's great.

1495
01:31:06,912 --> 01:31:10,412
And-And you've been very happy with
Bob, so that's been a good thing.

1496
01:31:10,497 --> 01:31:12,913
- Oh, he's wonderful.
- I think he's great.

1497
01:31:12,997 --> 01:31:16,413
I don't think you could've done
better. I think he's a fabulous guy.

1498
01:31:16,497 --> 01:31:19,413
Of course there have been
a few times, you will admit,

1499
01:31:19,497 --> 01:31:22,413
that, uh, you did call
me in dire emergency...

1500
01:31:22,497 --> 01:31:25,414
and I had to come by and bail you out.

1501
01:31:25,498 --> 01:31:28,414
- I know you did.
- Two major fights with Bob, I remember,

1502
01:31:28,498 --> 01:31:32,414
and one disgusting lump that
turned out to be completely benign,

1503
01:31:32,498 --> 01:31:34,914
though you were panicked beyond belief.

1504
01:31:34,998 --> 01:31:38,414
- You were there for me.
That's the main thing. - And you for me.

1505
01:31:38,498 --> 01:31:40,415
And I appreciate it.

1506
01:31:40,499 --> 01:31:43,415
I think, actually, that
we-we've been better friends...

1507
01:31:43,499 --> 01:31:45,415
than, than, than husband and wife.

1508
01:31:45,499 --> 01:31:47,749
Yeah, probably we have.

1509
01:31:47,832 --> 01:31:50,874
But, you know, nobody made
me laugh the way you did, Joe.

1510
01:31:50,915 --> 01:31:53,875
I love Bob with all my
heart. It isn't that.

1511
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:58,291
It's just that you could always,
you know, you could push that button.

1512
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:01,375
- Why is that so important?
- I don't know.

1513
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:04,208
I don't know. Maybe we're crazy.

1514
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:12,876
So, did that girl that dumped
you today, did she make you laugh?

1515
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:17,876
I don't know, I... I
have to put that behind.

1516
01:32:19,084 --> 01:32:21,042
You know.

1517
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:26,127
- Funny how life goes.
- It's amazing. Amazing.

1518
01:32:53,879 --> 01:32:55,962
Let's go. It's late.

1519
01:32:56,045 --> 01:32:58,420
It's definitely late.

1520
01:32:58,462 --> 01:33:00,420
Christmas Eve and late.

1521
01:33:00,462 --> 01:33:02,420

01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,797
I told Skylar someone should
