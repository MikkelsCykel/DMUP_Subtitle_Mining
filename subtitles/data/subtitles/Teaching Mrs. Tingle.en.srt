1
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,479
Mom?

2
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,240
Susie never showed up. I did a double.

3
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm so tired.

4
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,719
Finished.

5
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,839
You did? Oh!

6
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,639
That's great. Very well done.

7
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:31,159
So? You find out about it today?

8
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:34,520
just the rankings. Don't find out
about the scholarship till after finals.

9
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,959
How about the grant? Declined.

10
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,479
Same as the loans.
Dad uses me as a deduction.

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,959
Bastard. Yeah, but I still have a good
shot at valedictorian.

12
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,919
I mean, I could still get the scholarship.
And you will.

13
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,999
I've got complete faith in you.

14
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,679
Well, I gotta go. If I just
get through this week, I'll be fine.

15
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,079
Come here. I have to go.

16
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,279
I need a hug. I need one. Come on.

17
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,839
You're going to get to college.

18
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,318
I mean, look at this. This is brilliant.

19
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,799
My little girl the writer.

20
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,879
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna get out of here.

21
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,919
I just know it. You didn't do so bad.

22
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,679
Yeah.

23
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,719
But you're gonna go all the way.

24
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:27,679
So, you really think this is an A?

25
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:30,559
You're the A.

26
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,958
That teacher of yours isn't
gonna know what hit her.

27
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:19,278
Coach! Hey, Coach!

28
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:25,678
Wake up, will you?

29
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,038
That Trudie Tucker has
no business driving a Mercedes.

30
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,118
Listen, I need your senior prophecy
for the last issue. The deadline's tomorrow.

31
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,198
I don't know what to say. I hate that senior shit.

32
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:36,758
Just think of where you'll be in 20 years.

33
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,198
You're the writer, do it for me.

34
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:42,198
Okay, uh, how about, Miss Jo Lynn
Jordan, famous film Star, last seen

35
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:45,438
In rehab popping Percodan,
divorced from gay husband.

36
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:46,558
Perfect.

37
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,518
What does yours say? I haven't done mine yet.

38
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:51,437
Allow me. Leigh Ann Watson,
famous journalist,

39
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:54,518
wins the Pulitzer Prize for her
personal yet searing account...

40
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:56,637
of being a 38 year old virgin.

41
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:58,678
Watch it. Simple reminder.

42
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:02,918
Go, Man, go!

43
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,438
Hiya, Trudie. What you got there?

44
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:17,438
It's the Bastille. As in
the storming of the Bastille,

45
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,078
as in the French Revolution.

46
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:22,437
It's cute. I think we can do better than cute.

47
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,957
Don't you think so, Leigh Ann?

48
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,158
Good job. Very well done.

49
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:31,837
Good morning.

50
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,757
Oh, my God, there he is. Oh, he is such a

51
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:51,717
Canker.

52
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:52,957
With a wrought iron ass!

53
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,157
Dare me. What?

54
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:58,877
just say it. Dare me.

55
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:02,757
Okay, I dare you. Thank you!

56
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:10,156
Sorry about that. Hey, Jo Lynn, it's okay.

57
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,237
No, really, I should not be
in public with my feet. I'm sorry.

58
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:17,276
Hey, Leigh Ann, how's it going? She's good.

59
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:19,356
I'm the one who's kind of out of it.

60
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,116
Oh, yeah? What's wrong?

61
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,877
I just think a little bit of pity is in order,

62
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,037
since I have had this stirring
and passionate secret love for you...

63
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:28,556
since actually the third grade, and, um

64
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:39,836
But I feel much better now. Thanks. Yeah.

65
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:43,676
I cannot believe you just did that.
I can't either. Oh, my God!

66
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:45,196
You've gotta chill on the hair products.

67
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:46,717
The fumes are going straight up your nose.

68
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,876
It was this little voice inside of me
that just said, Do it!

69
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:51,996
That's why it's a little voice, Jo Lynn.
You're not supposed to listen to it.

70
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:55,117
No, Leigh Ann. You've gotta listen.

71
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,596
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, man.

72
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,316
There she is.

73
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:28,276
Excuse me.

74
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:34,515
Get out of the way!

75
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:35,836
Hey, man.

76
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:41,436
U h Good day, Coach. Mr. Potter?

77
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:45,996
May I have a moment? Morning,
Mrs. Tingle. How are you?

78
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:48,436
Fine, thank you. Mrs. Tingle.

79
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,916
Will you excuse us, Coach
Wenchell? Of course.

80
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,956
How can I help you
this morning, Mrs. Tingle?

81
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:56,635
Summer school starts in three weeks.
Did you receive my request...

82
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:58,835
regarding those necessary
research materials?

83
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,516
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about that.

84
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:03,035
It appears to be a matter of budget.
I was thinking

85
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:05,115
No, no, don't do that, Mr. Potter.
We so prefer...

86
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:07,035
that whistling wind effect you have on us.

87
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:10,475
Now, I requested those materials some time ago.

88
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:13,595
We don't have the money. Mr. Potter,

89
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,995
I'm sure if you take another look
at that nasty budget...

90
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:17,796
ingenuity will abound.

91
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,716
So, thank you in advance.

92
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:24,475
Oh, by the way, happy birthday.

93
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:26,755
It's not my birthday, Mrs. Tingle.

94
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:30,555
No, not your natal birthday. The A.A. one.

95
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:33,755
You've been sober How long is it now?

96
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:38,235
Four years. There. I knew it was this week.

97
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,475
Me and dates.

98
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:42,435
You know, that's the curse
of being a history teacher.

99
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,515
Well, congratulations.
That's quite an accomplishment.

100
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:50,074
just think, not one sip of alcohol
in over four years.

101
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:54,115
That's almost... unbelievable.

102
00:07:56,715 --> 00:08:01,755
Are you okay, Mr. Potter?
Yes, I'm fine. Just a little tired.

103
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:04,474
Oh. Late night?

104
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:15,115
I loved President Kennedy,

105
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,155
but despite my feelings for Jack,

106
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,554
he was, after all, a married Man,

107
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,235
so our affair remained secret.

108
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:27,075
But it endured. And it wasn't just about sex.

109
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:29,155
We helped each other.

110
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:31,875
John often turned to me for advice.

111
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,274
I encouraged him to pull out of Berlin,

112
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,955
advised him on the Cuban missile crisis,

113
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:42,155
and even encouraged him to sign
that silly old nuclear peace treaty.

114
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:46,955
So, in conclusion, I ask you...

115
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,514
to ask not what your mistress can do for you,

116
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:55,274
but what your mistress
can do for your country.

117
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:06,954
Thank you, Miss Jordan,

118
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:10,874
for that nauseating distortion
of American History.

119
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:12,634
I was merely trying to point out...

120
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:16,674
that our political leaders' indiscretions
have had a major impact on history.

121
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:19,714
And you chose to do it without
one shred of factual evidence,

122
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:21,594
leaving your project's merit

123
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:24,313
to be judged solely on a rather
tepid impersonation,

124
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:27,834
completely out of your very
limited range as an actress.

125
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,393
Now, take your seat.

126
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,194
Mr. Berry?

127
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:56,394
I, uh I I've been thinking about
getting into law enforcement...

128
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,833
after graduation, so I
thought for my project...

129
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:01,793
I'd create a medieval crossbow.

130
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:07,594
it's not loaded. This was a very popular means...

131
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:10,634
of protection during the early

132
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,593
during the early 15th century.

133
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:20,993
By placing a bolt in the chamber,

134
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:27,394
uh, the bowing of the wood
creates a pressure

135
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:39,553
Cool.

136
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,913
Don't tease us, Mr. Barry.

137
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:45,473
When you shoot, make it count.

138
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,833
It wasn't I mean, I didn't think that

139
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:54,953
No, because that world require a
cerebrum and a few other missing parts.

140
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:57,433
What you did was bring a weapon to school.

141
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,033
What you did is punishable
in a Court of law.

142
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,713
Now, sit down before I have you arrested.

143
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:11,673
Mr. Churner, dare I even ask?

144
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:23,832
Plymouth Rock.

145
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:33,873
Your work, Mr. Churner, is
very reminiscent of a young Man...

146
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,033
who sat in that same chair some 20 years ago.

147
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:40,633
He too had the words no future
printed on his forehead.

148
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,992
Give your father my best.

149
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:53,632
Miss Watson? Dazzle us, will you?

150
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:05,112
Well, I've created a 1 7th century journal.

151
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,872
One year in the life
Of an accused Salem witch.

152
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,992
Documenting actual events,
it contains 365 entries,

153
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:13,752
all written with quill and ink,

154
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:16,152
bound by leather and twine
and aged for authenticity.

155
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:20,632
it chronicles a young girl's
false imprisonment and unfair trial.

156
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,311
it took about six months

157
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,112
October 1 0, 1 692.

158
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:28,712
Another girl was burned at the stake today.

159
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,152
I fear William Griggs will point to me next.

160
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:35,592
I fear my future will be
nothing more than smoldering ashes.

161
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:39,992
if this be true, I pray the wind...

162
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:42,872
will carry my ashes far from Gallows Hull...

163
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:46,192
to a place that allows me to sing and dance...

164
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:48,151
in the open air.

165
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:55,671
Oh, how very moving.

166
00:12:57,712 --> 00:13:00,032
I tried not to get too carried away with the prose.

167
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,551
it's completely factual.
She was ultimately burned at the stake.

168
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,471
It's documented.

169
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,191
Always a victim,

170
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,671
aren't we, Miss Watson?

171
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:15,631
Well, there are similarities between
society today and 1 7th century Salem.

172
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,552
I guess that would be the irony of it all.

173
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,071
I'm well aware of what Irony is, Miss Watson.

174
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:25,111
You, however, should consult your dictionary.

175
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:27,551
Of course, I wasn't suggesting that it was

176
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:31,511
irony is the opposite of what is
or might be expected.

177
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,951
For example, if Miss Watson...

178
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:37,311
was expecting an A on her history project,

179
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:42,631
she might find the actual
result to be... rather ironic.

180
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,791
I pray your Salem witch...

181
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,711
escaped such literary infractions.

182
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,790
Please, sit down.

183
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,631
Miss Tucker?

184
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:26,230
You're number two. By one point.

185
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,431
Pity.

186
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,830
I know how much you were counting
on being valedictorian.

187
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,470
I'm really sorry, Leigh Ann.

188
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,390
And I take it you're number one?
Only by a smidge.

189
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:42,550
But who knows? Maybe you'll get an
A on that history project...

190
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,590
and just turn everything around.

191
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,030
Congratulations, Trudie.

192
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,310
Do you mean that? Thank you.

193
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,750
That is so sweet.

194
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,910
That's what's always impressed me
most you are so sweet.

195
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,670
And real.

196
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,950
I know things haven't been easy for
you and I love the way...

197
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,590
you're always able to rise above.

198
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,910
Thank you. It's so very evolved of you.

199
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,190
Sorry about that scholarship.

200
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,150
I hope you weren't counting on it. Oh, well.

201
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,070
Have a nice day.

202
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,070
I heard that. You can still get that scholarship.

203
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,830
How? You've got one week to take her down.

204
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:29,309
you're only behind by a point.

205
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,270
Study hard, and you can beat her easily.

206
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,910
You don't understand, Miss Gold.
History cost me big time.

207
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,510
Mrs. Tingle hates me.

208
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,430
Miss Tingle's a bitch. She hates everyone.

209
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,910
She even hates me.

210
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,390
You can do this, I know you can.

211
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,709
I believe in you.

212
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:46,150
There's one week left, and
Trudie Tucker has built this

213
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,549
Leigh Ann. Trudie Tucker...

214
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,389
is a pale faced Harvard trust fund
twit whose good grades...

215
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:52,789
are a result of good ass kissing.

216
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,669
She doesn't need the scholarship. You do.

217
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,949
As Guidance Counselor, you've
been my pride and joy for four years.

218
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:04,269
You deserve it. You just gotta
believe in yourself, honey, that's all.

219
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:07,950
Thank you, Miss Gold.

220
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:13,669
I can't believe I'm doing extra credit.

221
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:18,469
You need it. You have one week to
bump Bitch Trudie from the throne.

222
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,270
You know, I don't really have
to be a writer. I mean

223
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:23,589
I could do something a little more practical.

224
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,549
Forget that.

225
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,389
You are going to be valedictorian.
You're going to get your scholarship.

226
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,229
You're going to go to college,
and you're going to pursue your dreams,

227
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,429
and I am going to see to it.

228
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,149
My last piece of business
before I freak to Hollywood.

229
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:43,989
I'm gonna miss you.
All right, come here, cheese ball,

230
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:46,108
and don't make me cry.

231
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:47,989
You know I'm easy.

232
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:50,869
Can we make this a three way?
What do you say?

233
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,989
Now, what are you two lovely ladies doing...

234
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:57,669
on this hard, wooden floor?

235
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:01,149
Seating arrangements for graduations.
You are going to graduate, aren't you?

236
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,789
Celebration's al ready begun. Get serious.

237
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,588
Be cool. That's a no no.
You want a beer? I have more.

238
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,508
What are you trying to do, get us expelled?

239
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:12,908
I'll have one.

240
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,149
Jo Lynn Okay

241
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,428
Now, why is it we never dated?

242
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,669
We did, almost, once.

243
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,709
We were this close to hooking up
at Mandy Kate's birthday party.

244
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:26,708
Sophomore year, when I was
still an A cup with braces.

245
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:29,188
It was kind of a disaster. That was you?

246
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,508
I thought that was somebody else.

247
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,909
And why is it we never dated?

248
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,468
Could you cut the alcohol?

249
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,469
You are so typical. Some of us
would like to graduate.

250
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,348
And some of us could help you do that.

251
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:44,148
What is this? Oh, just Tingle's final exam.

252
00:17:44,348 --> 00:17:46,748
Where did you get that?
You're not the only brain around here.

253
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:48,788
We could get in serious trouble.

254
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,748
I made a copy of the original.
She'll never even know.

255
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,588
You sure it's authentic?

256
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:58,228
Tempting, isn't it? Sort of
brings up all those moral questions.

257
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,628
Slither away. Let's go.
Don't be so hasty, Leigh Ann.

258
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:08,428
You just think about it. I'll leave it right there.

259
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:10,388
What are you doing? You are such a loser.

260
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:11,388
Oh, really?

261
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,508
I think the race is still on
for that title, Miss Watson.

262
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,428
We were just

263
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:19,428
Doing seating arrangements for graduation.

264
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,028
Extra credit. Extra credit.

265
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,708
Has it come to that?

266
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:27,148
Actually, we were just
finishing up, right, Leigh Ann?

267
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:28,108
Right.

268
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:29,267
Take it easy, Miss Tingle.

269
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,468
Well, well, well.

270
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:44,148
Final exams aren't until next week, Miss Watson.

271
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:47,868
Look, Mrs. Tingle, it is not what you think.
Save it for Mr. Potter, dear.

272
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,027
Mrs. Tingle just let us explain, Mrs. Tingle.

273
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:53,467
The smartest girl in school caught cheating.

274
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:58,067
The irony of it all.

275
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:07,187
Shit! What's she gonna do?
She went to go turn us in.

276
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:22,867
Excuse me, Miss Banks.

277
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:25,827
Good afternoon, Mrs. Tingle.
What can I do for you?

278
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,667
I'm here to see Mr. Potter.

279
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:30,587
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Potter isn't in.

280
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,026
Is there something I can help you with?

281
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,067
Yes.

282
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:37,347
You can tell him his dereliction
of duty does not go unnoticed,

283
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:40,667
and it is urgent that I speak
with him first thing in the morning.

284
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:44,467
Understand? Certainly, Mrs. Tingle.

285
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,067
Skank.

286
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,307
Leigh Hey, what's up?

287
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:01,026
Basically, we're screwed.

288
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:02,386
What happened? What'd she say to Potter?

289
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,186
No, he's gone for the night.
She won't do it until the morning.

290
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:06,266
Good. That gives us time. For what?

291
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:07,987
Counteract. Solution mode.

292
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,066
It's her word against ours. We're dead.

293
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:14,226
Wait, I know.

294
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,226
Luke and I will go to Tingle and just
explain that you weren't involved.

295
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,666
Yeah, I'll tell the bitch the truth.
She won't believe you.

296
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:22,107
Yes, she will. She'll have to.
We'll just give her the facts.

297
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,146
No. it won't work. Look, face it.

298
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:27,826
We're going to be expelled.
No graduation, no nothing!

299
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,826
We'll just go to Tingle, okay? It's worth a shot.

300
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,546
This is such a bad idea.

301
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,066
We don't exactly have a lot
of choices here, Leigh Ann, okay?

302
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:40,907
Don't be so pessimistic.

303
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,586
Look at this place. It looks haunted.

304
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,386
You can't go to a teacher's house at night.

305
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,666
It's inappropriate.

306
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:51,386
This is never gonna work.
Yes, it will. Just follow me.

307
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:52,786
It's after dinner.

308
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,626
She's probably just had a feeding
and feeling a little giving.

309
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,186
Okay, who's gonna do the talking? I'll go.

310
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,986
No, Leigh, let me.

311
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:00,106
The innocent always look more
guilty when defending themselves.

312
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,226
I'll go. What are you gonna say?

313
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,825
The truth, of course.

314
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:06,426
Look, I'm gonna get you to college.

315
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:27,226
It's never gonna work.

316
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,065
What do you suggest, we kerosene the place?

317
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:30,826
All I'm saying is Tingle's not stupid.

318
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,545
Look, you wanna know why we never dated?

319
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:34,745
This, right here, shining example.

320
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,106
What?

321
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:46,785
Sit.

322
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:52,985
Mrs. Tingle, I...

323
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,985
I am so sorry to bother you at home,

324
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,025
bit it is urgent that I speak with you.

325
00:21:58,145 --> 00:22:00,466
You see, there's been
a horrible misunderstanding,

326
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,425
and I'd just like the chance to explain.

327
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:04,026
Um, well

328
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:07,345
You see, Leigh Ann wasn't cheating.

329
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:10,545
I mean, come on.
We both know she would never do that,

330
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,305
and I'm sure you're probably wondering...

331
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,905
how the exam got in her bag,

332
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:19,185
'cause I know that's
what I'd be wondering if I were you,

333
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:22,105
and, um okay, uh

334
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:28,184
it was me.

335
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:31,785
There. I stole the exam.

336
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:34,785
Leigh Ann wasn't involved at all.
I mean, if anything,

337
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:36,745
she was just trying to talk me
out of it, because

338
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:42,345
Well, l guess things just haven't
been going too well for me lately.

339
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:46,825
My mom has been
very, very sick.

340
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:50,905
Well, we had to take her to the hospital ...

341
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:53,265
because she got this blood clot in her leg, and,

342
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:57,345
she's actually in intensive care
right now because the blood clot...

343
00:22:57,465 --> 00:23:00,464
went up her leg and into her kidneys.

344
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:05,104
The doctors say it could be headed for her heart,

345
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:06,545
and...

346
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:08,944
maybe even her brain.

347
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:13,224
Well, they've been
watering down her blood, but...

348
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,904
things just aren't looking too good.

349
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:22,345
So I stole the exam.

350
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:26,824
For my mom. I guess I just thought...

351
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:30,025
that maybe if she could
live to see me graduate,

352
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,225
then maybe just

353
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:37,344
just maybe she

354
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:41,424
Mrs. Tingle, I'm

355
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,824
I really am so, so sorry.

356
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:48,864
You poor dear.

357
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,304
I pray you're a good waitress.

358
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:05,744
What happened? I cried real tears. I don't get it.

359
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:07,264
She's not human. We know that.

360
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:08,944
I'm sorry, Leigh Ann. I could try again.

361
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:10,464
I'll go. No, I'll go.

362
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,664
Why don't you just grab a beer?

363
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:24,984
Good evening, Mrs. Tingle.

364
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:26,983
Is it? May I come in?

365
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,223
Go home, Leigh Ann.

366
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,024
Please?

367
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,383
Sit!

368
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,103
Make it quick, Miss Watson.

369
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:03,383
Look, I've never cheated
on anything in my life.

370
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,423
I work really hard for my grades,
Mrs. Tingle, and I am not a cheater.

371
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:08,503
You can ask anyone. Where are you going?

372
00:25:08,663 --> 00:25:09,823
Come on

373
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:14,063
Do you have any idea what's
going to happen to me?

374
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,383
Grandsboro's finest...

375
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,543
caught cheating.

376
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:23,062
It'll be scandalous. Look, I am innocent.

377
00:25:23,703 --> 00:25:26,222
Oh, how moving.

378
00:25:26,543 --> 00:25:29,823
You know I didn't do it. Even the innocent...

379
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,823
sometimes burn at the stake.

380
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:35,542
Now, take your sniveling self
and get out of my house.

381
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:36,983
Not so fast.

382
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:42,663
Mr. Churner. To what do we owe the pleasure?

383
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:45,182
Go away. Here's the deal.

384
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:47,342
I stole the exam.
It was my doing and mine alone.

385
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:50,502
The role of savior does not
suit mediocrity, Mr. Churner.

386
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:54,463
I suggest you run along. Fuck you, lady.

387
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,742
Luke!

388
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:58,582
Get out of my house now. both of you.

389
00:25:58,703 --> 00:26:00,022
He didn't mean that, Mrs. Tingle. Apologize.

390
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,863
It's true. She wasn't cheating.

391
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:03,903
This isn't happening. I want the three of you...

392
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:06,223
out of the house immediately
before I call your parents.

393
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:08,382
That's not necessary. We'll just go.
Please, Mrs. Tingle.

394
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:10,262
Don't do this to her. She'll lose everything.

395
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:11,502
Leave my house now,

396
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:13,902
or the first call will be to the police.

397
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:18,303
Put the phone down Luke!

398
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,022
Luke!

399
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:22,583
What do you think you're doing? Put that down.

400
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:24,462
You're not calling the shots anymore, Tingle.

401
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:30,222
It's time for Tingle to learn a lesson.

402
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:31,182
No! Don't be stupid.

403
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:34,222
Put it down Not until she agrees to a few things.

404
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:38,262
And what might those
few things be, Mr. Churner?

405
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,662
You can't keep treating people the way you do.

406
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:44,662
No?

407
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,102
Luke!

408
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:54,062
You lose, Mr. Churner.

409
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:56,741
Now, get out of my house, all of you.

410
00:26:59,062 --> 00:26:59,942
No.

411
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,182
Luke, no!

412
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:05,582
Leave him alone!

413
00:27:21,461 --> 00:27:23,381
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

414
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,902
Did I do that? Yeah, Jo, you did that.

415
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:29,941
All right, let's get out of here.
No, we can't just leave.

416
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:32,021
Yes, we can. We can just go.
They're not gonna know we

417
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,101
No, we can't

418
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,701
Is she dead? I don't know. She's not moving.

419
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:45,941
No, no, you're wrong.
She's breathing. She has to be.

420
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:47,261
Make her breathe.

421
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,461
it grazed her. There's some blood,
but she should be fine.

422
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:01,981
She doesn't look fine. Oh, my God.

423
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,061
What do we do? Wait, let me think for a second.

424
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:06,101
How are we gonna explain this? Damn it

425
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,181
She'll press charges
Maybe we should just finish her.

426
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,221
No, we can't finish her
We have to think this through

427
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:15,861
Oh, God.

428
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:17,940
Should we just leave her there?

429
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,181
That's it.

430
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,700
You guys all right? Yeah.

431
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,221
I'm dizzy. Watch her head

432
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:28,100
Shit. Sorry.

433
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:30,221
Come on, let's just get her up there.
Come on, let's go.

434
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,261
How's her head?
it's minimal. She'll be all right.

435
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:35,901
Here, take this.

436
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:40,860
I found these. What are you doing?

437
00:28:41,061 --> 00:28:42,061
Tying her up.

438
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,261
No, you're not Did you see the way she
I unged at me? Come on.

439
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,181
Come on

440
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,101
What's the plan?

441
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,380
Well, when she wakes up, we'll reason with her.

442
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,261
Oh, yeah. We know how that works.

443
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,500
Do you have a better idea?

444
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:02,380
Yeah. Torch the place. call it a day.
What had better have been...

445
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,141
an attempt at humor,
because that is not an option.

446
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:05,740
This is way out of control.

447
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,421
So what, we just hang out here all night?

448
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,900
No, I mean... She's out. She probably
won't wake up until the morning.

449
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,580
I gotta go home and check on my mom.
She likes to leave cigarettes burning.

450
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:16,780
You know, she looks
kinda like that movie, you know,

451
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,500
where the demon chick
upchucks all over everybody.

452
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:21,820
She Exorcist. Yeah.

453
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,780
Don't screw this up. Hey, I'll stay with Luke.

454
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,660
I'll, um, tell my parents I'm at your place.

455
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Okay. I'll be back as soon as I can
and we'll try to think of something.

456
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,620
I'm not a sweet thing, Pa.

457
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,260
I blamed it all on Mary
and it wasn't even her fault.

458
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:07,299
I meant to be hurtful,
but it didn't stop my hurting.

459
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,820
Oh, honey.

460
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:35,340
The TV in the living room.
You don't mind, do you?

461
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,259
No. Oh, what happened?

462
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,459
Did Mrs. Tingle like your project?

463
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,939
Yeah. She really liked it.

464
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:52,139
Are you at the top of your class?

465
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:53,659
Yeah.

466
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:58,059
Go back to sleep. Oh, sweetie.

467
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:02,819
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

468
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:08,459
All your dreams are gonna come true.

469
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,539
Both our dreams.

470
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,499
I love you.

471
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,459
Now, if you're gonna grow up to be as pretty
as your ma, I think we ought a get

472
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,338
Untie me.

473
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:47,057
Oh, please. I need a doctor.

474
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:49,257
I'm in pain.

475
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:52,338
I'm sorry.

476
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:57,337
I didn't mean for this to happen. I know.

477
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:01,298
It's all right. just untie me, please.

478
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:11,538
It hurts.

479
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:13,378
Untie me.

480
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:18,337
I'm not supposed to do that. Oh, help me.

481
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:20,378
Please.

482
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:23,537
I know it was an accident.

483
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:28,097
I hit my head hard.

484
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:30,457
My My vision is blurry.

485
00:33:31,537 --> 00:33:35,417
Call an ambulance. Hurry.

486
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,297
Okay. No

487
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:42,697
Jo Lynn, please untie me. Please.

488
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:44,778
Okay.

489
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:46,298
Now.

490
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,337
Mrs. Tingle, I am so sorry about
all of this. it's just been

491
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:07,976
Stop right there, Mrs. Tingle.

492
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:15,417
So much for talking this out.

493
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:18,536
Nice performance, Mrs. Tingle.
Very subtle work.

494
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,297
The blurry vision detail.

495
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:22,737
Nice. Come here.

496
00:34:29,297 --> 00:34:31,056
Why don't you go home and get some rest

497
00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:33,376
I'd rather stay with you. I got it covered.

498
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,777
This was my fault to begin with.
Let me handle it.

499
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:37,257
I want to be here.

500
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:46,696
You know, this is kinda
the wrong time for this.

501
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,096
Okay. Come on, I'll walk you down.

502
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:27,976
That's enough peanut butter.
My fingers are raw.

503
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:29,296
What do you want next, huh?

504
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:33,576
Come... pickles? What do you
want next? H uh? Sour cream?

505
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:36,136
Show time

506
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:38,616
Are you ready?

507
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:41,456
Don't do it, be it.

508
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:47,336
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

509
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:50,696
Leaf in the wind.

510
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,416
Yeah. Ready.

511
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:06,176
Grandsboro High School. Eve Tingle here.

512
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,976
Yes, Mrs. Tingle. What can I do for you?

513
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:12,175
I won't be coming in today. I have a
touch of the flu and I've taken to bed.

514
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,535
What is it?

515
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:16,336
Well, I hope you're feeling better real soon.

516
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:20,415
It might be a few days.

517
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:22,535
I'll keep you posted.

518
00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:25,335
Well, you take as much time as you need.
The important thing is your health.

519
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:28,055
And don't hesitate to call us
if you need anything.

520
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:29,575
Bye now. Good bye.

521
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:35,215
Done. That woman hasn't been sick in over

522
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:37,695
Actually, I don't think she's ever been sick.

523
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:38,855
Do you think it's serious?

524
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:39,855
Oh, I hope so.

525
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:48,575
Good morning, Mrs. Tingle.

526
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:51,815
I hear you had quite an evening.
Let me get this off.

527
00:36:57,855 --> 00:37:00,095
So, how are you
this morning, Mrs. Tingle

528
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:05,295
We need to talk.
We need to discuss what happened...

529
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:07,055
so we can get our stories straight.

530
00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:08,935
Now, we've taken care of everything.

531
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:11,015
you're out sick today due to a touch of the flu,

532
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,335
and I think you should take this time to rest up,

533
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:16,054
let your head heal
and think about what you've done.

534
00:37:16,415 --> 00:37:18,855
Luke, Jo Lynn and I are fully aware...

535
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,934
that our behavior was out of line,
but we're truly sorry,

536
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,414
and we have learned from our mistake.

537
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:29,135
So, that should be enough for you.
You've done your job.

538
00:37:30,974 --> 00:37:33,575
And we would greatly appreciate it if we could...

539
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:36,015
just put this incident
behind us and get on with our lives.

540
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,254
So, do we have an understanding?

541
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:40,774
Oh, Leigh Ann.

542
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:45,574
You present yourself with
such self assured tenacity,

543
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:49,774
but your fear is showing around the edges.

544
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:54,054
You can do better.

545
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:57,174
Mrs. Tingle, we're trying. Work with us.

546
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,614
Okay, time for plan B.

547
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:06,895
And what would that be?
What's the matter, Mrs. Tingle?

548
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,894
Are you getting a little scared yourself?

549
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:11,334
Scared?

550
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:14,614
Oh, no, dear.

551
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:18,214
Things are just starting to get fun.

552
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:32,134
So, what's plan B? Jo, you watch Tingle.

553
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,933
I'm gonna go to school, take care of a few things,

554
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,173
and I'll be back with plan B.

555
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,294
Now, make sure she eats something
and immediately gag her.

556
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,734
You got it? And don't let her mess with your head.

557
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:43,494
Don't worry. The sow is mine.
I'll be back after school.

558
00:38:45,414 --> 00:38:48,213
So, um, like, you wanna
hang with me today?

559
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,974
I should probably hit
school, right, Leigh Ann?

560
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:51,334
We don't want to look obvious.

561
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,574
Come on, I'll give you a ride. Come on.

562
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:55,694
Okay.

563
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:17,973
Okay, class, I'm gonna be
filling in for a couple of days...

564
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:20,014
while Mrs. Tingle is out sick.

565
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:26,253
Yes, Trudie will Mrs. Tingle be okay?

566
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,613
Oh, yeah, it's just a bug that's going around.

567
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:30,533
Deadly bug, I hope.

568
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:35,453
Oh, God, I'm bored.

569
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:39,493
Bored, bored, bored.

570
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:45,893
I can't believe you don't have a TV.

571
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:49,373
I mean, it's like not having toilet paper.

572
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:54,533
I could be at home, watching Sally Jesse...

573
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:57,893
or Oprah or Jerry.

574
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:01,573
Where else are you gonna see...

575
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:06,532
Man Has Sex Change To Become Lesbian?

576
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:08,973
You think about that.

577
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:13,453
Oh, forget it.

578
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,053
Hey, you!

579
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:20,613
Oh, where'd you come from?

580
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:26,213
Oh, you're such a good little boy.

581
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,573
What's your name? What's your

582
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:37,932
All right. Oh, God, I'm bored.

583
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:11,532
What a lovely day for an exorcism!

584
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:28,452
The sow is mine! Screw you!

585
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:43,132
Nimi. Why you do this to me? Nimi.

586
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:44,852
Why?

587
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:48,611
Take me! Take me! Take me!

588
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:53,212
Repeat it! Take me! Take me! Repeat it!

589
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,891
Nimi. Why? Why? Take me!

590
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:12,611
You really should get a TV.

591
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:21,891
Study hard, Leigh Ann.

592
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:30,331
Plan B?

593
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:36,331
Basically, unless we're able to convince a
Court of law that we were the victims here,

594
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:39,931
we're looking at criminal assault
and conspiracy to cover up a crime.

595
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:42,411
We were victims. That woman
drove us to drastic measures.

596
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:45,210
Luke, we shot her with an arrow,
we tied her to her bed,

597
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,251
and we have held her captive
for the last 1 8 hours.

598
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:49,371
I think we've bypassed drastic measures.

599
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:57,131
I'm sorry, Leigh Ann.

600
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:03,371
Look, it's not your fault.

601
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:06,890
I mean, it is, but that's irrelevant now.

602
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:10,931
What if I had a way to convince her?

603
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,851
Okay, let's see.

604
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:23,090
Let's get this thing off of you. Ah, there we go.

605
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:26,851
Now, no biting.

606
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,490
Okay. Swim, swim, swallow.

607
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:32,850
Thank you.

608
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:35,170
You know, you could have
avoided this whole headache.

609
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:37,011
We both know Leigh Ann's not a cheater.

610
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,650
Such a loyal friend.

611
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,690
Tell me, don't you ever tire...

612
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,050
of playing second banana
to little Miss Perfection?

613
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,370
Hey, I'm nobody's banana.

614
00:43:49,651 --> 00:43:50,730
I have Star quality.

615
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,650
Then how come Leigh Ann
snagged the leading Man?

616
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,690
What, you mean Luke?

617
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,650
Look, Leigh Ann can't stand Luke.

618
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,250
She thinks he's a loser.

619
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,810
Oh, Miss Jordan.
As an actress, you really must learn...

620
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,810
to read between the lines.

621
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,450
No, no, no. She would never play me.

622
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,570
I'm her best friend
and she knows I'm into him.

623
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,570
Betrayal hurts, Miss Jordan.

624
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:25,810
I'd prepare that little
heart of yours if I were you.

625
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,690
Leigh Ann Mr. Churner.

626
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,530
What's her gag doing off?
How was school?

627
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,170
you're on the wrong side
of glib, Mrs. Tingle.

628
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:41,330
Should I be afraid, Leigh Ann?

629
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:46,850
Quivering in fear?
Tell me the appropriate reaction.

630
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:48,370
I'll work on it.

631
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:52,809
Any thoughts on plan B? Downstairs.

632
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:05,329
What do you think Black mail?

633
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,569
Dirty pictures.

634
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:09,129
I'll get into bed with Tingle,
and we'll use them to threaten her.

635
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:12,490
Oh, how scandalous. I love it.
do you think it'll work?

636
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:13,890
Yes. No.

637
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:17,769
Oh, it is wicked.
And wrong and immoral, and we

638
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,969
So is she. Leigh Ann,

639
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,530
you have always done the right thing,

640
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:25,049
and the best thing it's
gotten you is number two.

641
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,329
It is time for you to listen to that
little voice inside of your head.

642
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,329
Listen to it this time, for all of our sakes.

643
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,529
We're not gonna hurt her. We're just
gonna present her with options.

644
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:38,569
This can't be the only way
to get into college.

645
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:40,489
Okay, this is what you have to do.

646
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:44,449
You just need to think of this as if
you're an actress playing a role.

647
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:48,409
if you commit to the part and you
believe that it'll work, it'll work.

648
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:50,648
just this once, Leigh.

649
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,768
for your future. All of ours.

650
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:59,409
I don't even have a future,
but I know I don't want to go to jail.

651
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:02,448
think about your mother.
I mean, this would kill her.

652
00:46:12,928 --> 00:46:15,289
Well, if we're gonna go down,
we might as well make it count, right?

653
00:46:16,328 --> 00:46:20,489
Okay Operation Scandal underway.

654
00:46:20,728 --> 00:46:23,249
Now, we need, uh, a plan.
We need supplies.

655
00:46:23,368 --> 00:46:25,609
We need one naked high school student.

656
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:28,209
Sorry, Luke, but... camera doesn't lie.

657
00:46:28,408 --> 00:46:30,048
A bottle of wine and I'll be fine.

658
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,169
All right. I'll go back and get a camera.

659
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:34,488
Luke, you're in charge of feeding the devil,

660
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:36,569
and, Leigh

661
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:41,809
senior prophecy
everything is gonna work out okay.

662
00:46:42,248 --> 00:46:43,648
I promise.

663
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:46,528
I'll be back in a couple of hours
with the camera.

664
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:48,048
All right. I'll go grab some burgers.

665
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,008
I didn't know if you liked
mayo or mustard, so I got it plain.

666
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:55,807
But I have these packets, so
You want ketchup on your fries?

667
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:18,127
you're very good at this.

668
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:21,047
I suspect you've had practice.

669
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,407
Tell me, do you clean up
after your drunken father...

670
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,327
when he passes out each night?

671
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:30,887
You go straight for the jugular
every time, don't you?

672
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:35,527
May I have some wine?

673
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:49,926
Cabernet.

674
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:52,927
Rich and fill bodied.

675
00:48:55,247 --> 00:48:57,206
Rather bold selection, Luke.

676
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:02,686
That's the first time you've ever
called me by my first name.

677
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:06,006
What happened to Mr. Churner?
You should keep in mind, Luke,

678
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:09,686
that when this becomes a police
report, you have the least to lose.

679
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:11,687
Don't worry about me.
I don't care what happens.

680
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,887
Oh. of course.

681
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:18,206
Your concern begins
and ends with Leigh Ann.

682
00:49:20,487 --> 00:49:24,526
Don't worry, Luke.
She's attracted to you. I can tell.

683
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:27,006
No, Leigh Ann's pretty repulsed by me.

684
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:29,166
Oh, come on, Luke.

685
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:34,126
You've gotten one or two
cheerleaders drink in your time.

686
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:36,006
You know a thing or two about women.

687
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:40,286
Cleopatra rebuked Anthony...

688
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:43,006
simply because she desired him.

689
00:49:43,686 --> 00:49:44,966
Nah, it's different.

690
00:49:45,086 --> 00:49:47,166
Leigh Ann and I had our moment, and it passed.

691
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,166
Tell me about it.

692
00:49:53,006 --> 00:49:56,046
Back in the tenth grade, there was this... party...

693
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:58,486
where Leigh Ann and I
kind of hooked up once.

694
00:49:59,126 --> 00:50:01,006
The keyword being once.

695
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,446
I blew it.

696
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:09,366
She was uncomfortable at the party.
Little social dysfunction...

697
00:50:09,446 --> 00:50:11,366
as a result of studying way too much.

698
00:50:12,365 --> 00:50:14,246
She was hiding out in the bathroom.

699
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:18,405
I kept her company and we kind of...
had our own little party, you know?

700
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:21,046
Sounds incredibly Zhivago.

701
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:25,245
Yeah, but...

702
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:27,966
the next day, she acted like I was diseased.

703
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:33,485
I guess the guilt set in.
I never had another chance.

704
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:36,206
it was over before it began.

705
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:41,006
Guess I wasn't part of her master plan.

706
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:43,685
She's been kinda wild on me ever since.

707
00:50:43,846 --> 00:50:46,245
She done yet? Jo Lynn's back.

708
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:49,246
Enter Ophelia.

709
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:53,285
U h, yeah, pretty much.

710
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:57,005
Places, everyone. The plot is about to thicken.

711
00:50:58,085 --> 00:51:00,326
I, uh, opted for the disposable.

712
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,366
Now, I thought I'd keep this blocking
fairly simple. Mrs. Tingle,

713
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:06,045
thought I'd keep you right
where you are, straps and all.

714
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:08,365
Going for a whole bondage theme.

715
00:51:08,605 --> 00:51:11,485
And, like, my man... drop 'em.

716
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:15,805
Look. are you sure you want
to go through with this?

717
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:17,045
Yeah.

718
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:18,405
What was that?

719
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:27,365
Shit.

720
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:28,165
Who is it?

721
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,845
Coach Wenchell. What's he doing here?

722
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:32,125
Quick, gag her. Give it up, Leigh Ann. it's over.

723
00:51:32,245 --> 00:51:34,045
Mrs. Tingle, shut up. The coach is gonna come

724
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:44,045
Are the doors locked? Yeah.

725
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:56,725
What do we do now?

726
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,605
Nothing. He's going away.

727
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:14,204
Well, that was close.

728
00:52:21,444 --> 00:52:22,284
Shit.

729
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:38,444
Eve?

730
00:52:52,804 --> 00:52:53,884
Hello.

731
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:58,964
Eve?

732
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:05,364
Hello?

733
00:53:15,763 --> 00:53:16,924
Oh, my God

734
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:32,844
Stop! Don't come any closer.

735
00:53:35,324 --> 00:53:37,484
U h, you don't sound too good. How you doin'?

736
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:41,123
What is she doing? I don't know.

737
00:53:41,443 --> 00:53:45,764
I'm not well. But it's me... Spanky.

738
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:49,604
What are you doing here... Spanky?

739
00:53:51,723 --> 00:53:54,004
I miss my chili mama.

740
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:02,443
Hey, what's going on?

741
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:04,643
Please, Spanky, you have to go.

742
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:06,723
I need my rest.

743
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:23,843
Please, you're upsetting the dog.

744
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:26,323
I want my pom poms.

745
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:30,523
Okay, just... go downstairs, Spanky.

746
00:54:31,843 --> 00:54:33,403
I'll be right down.

747
00:54:34,283 --> 00:54:35,083
Yes

748
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:01,522
No. No. Pretty okay.

749
00:55:03,202 --> 00:55:04,203
Okay.

750
00:55:05,482 --> 00:55:06,403
No.

751
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:08,603
Scarf. This is fabulous.

752
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:10,763
Okay.

753
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:12,443
Perfume.

754
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:17,123
Wine. Okay.

755
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:56,002
Close your eyes. Okay.

756
00:56:02,522 --> 00:56:04,762
Oh, okay.

757
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:07,322
Remember last time?

758
00:56:08,122 --> 00:56:10,921
That, uh that thing you did with the thing?

759
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:24,562
Here. Relax.

760
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,442
Okay. Sit down, Spanky.

761
00:56:27,602 --> 00:56:28,962
All right.

762
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,161
Oh, this is gonna be good.

763
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:38,201
I love your smell.

764
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:46,481
Now drink up, Spanky. Okay.

765
00:56:46,721 --> 00:56:48,161
You're gonna need it.

766
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:52,921
Are you trying to get me drunk?
Because, I gotta tell ya,

767
00:56:53,122 --> 00:56:56,481
I have a very high tolerance for alcohol.

768
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:18,201
And when you...

769
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:26,841
Blow in my ear.

770
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:31,881
And, of course,

771
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,641
when you spank me.

772
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,321
Most of all,

773
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:45,960
I love it when you touch me just like that.

774
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,921
Have another drink.

775
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:57,401
So, Eve, when are we gonna kick off?

776
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:00,520
Spanky, one more drink.

777
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,560
just, just a few more sups, Spanky.

778
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,320
Spanky

779
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,800
Let Let go.

780
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,760
Let go. Let go.

781
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,040
Justa few more minutes and I'll Spanky!

782
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,120
Man, that was weird.

783
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,840
This has gotten completely out of hand.

784
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,480
I kept asking myself, What was
Mrs. Tingle doing in the gym anyway?

785
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,520
How scandalous. Yeah. This is a small town.

786
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,840
Infidelity's a big deal. These pictures
are gonna be a big hit at the parish,

787
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,160
where I think Coach Wenchell's
wife sings in the choir.

788
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,280
She coach and I will deny it.
No one's gonna believe you.

789
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,600
But we'll have pictures.
Fraudulent pictures.

790
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,759
it doesn't matter, Mrs. Tingle. The great thing
about a scandal is it doesn't rely upon fact.

791
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,520
And just look at the current climate.
Facts are no longer relevant.

792
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,679
So you can scream the truth
all you want, Mrs. Tingle,

793
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,479
but the damage will be done.

794
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,560
I love it.

795
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,120
Mrs. Tingle, you are just full of surprises.

796
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,680
if you weren't such a bitch, I'd really like you.

797
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:12,880
you're all gonna burn for this. I'll see to it.

798
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,760
Oh, threats, Mrs. Tingle, are a sign of weakness.

799
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:19,280
Get back there. Wait. Come here.

800
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,479
Shut him up, Jo.

801
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,719
Come on.

802
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:32,080
Okay, he's coming to.
Hurry. Where's the camera?

803
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:33,119
Over here.

804
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:35,920
Okay, just sit. There you go. Okay. Sit.

805
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:39,959
Don't do this, Leigh Ann.
you're gonna ruin this man's life.

806
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:43,799
Oh, the way you planned to ruin mine?

807
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,600
Stop it. Stop.

808
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:49,399
Quick, let's get this over with.

809
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,080
Let me see more of the coach's
face. Yeah, right there. Perfect.

810
00:59:54,279 --> 00:59:55,560
Okay. Hold on.

811
01:00:00,479 --> 01:00:01,999
Jo, you stay here with Tingle.

812
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:04,519
Why do I always have to stay with Tingle?

813
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:06,319
You stay with Tingle. I'll go with Luke.

814
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:08,079
would you cooperate, please?

815
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:12,119
Come on. is there something going on
here I don't know about?

816
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:13,799
What are you talking about?

817
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:15,839
We've got to go.

818
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:17,679
We'll be back as soon as we can.

819
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:20,639
Easy. All right.

820
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,439
We'll get him to the truck,
then I'll grab his bike.

821
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:40,959
Okay. That's it.

822
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:42,839
Hurry up. Wait. Hold on.

823
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:44,398
All right. Grab his legs. No, I'll get his legs.

824
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:45,918
You get his legs.

825
01:00:46,078 --> 01:00:47,399
I got his arm.

826
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:53,119
I'm gonna go get his bike.

827
01:01:31,038 --> 01:01:32,438
Come on. Let's get outta here.

828
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,958
Mrs. Tingle, you have been holding out on us.

829
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:44,598
You have got some nice stuff.

830
01:01:45,157 --> 01:01:47,637
I mean, some good shit.

831
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:55,037
Come on. it wasn't that bad.

832
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:57,078
just a couple of pictures.

833
01:01:57,998 --> 01:02:00,038
Nobody ever has to see 'em.

834
01:02:02,877 --> 01:02:05,398
Oh, Romeo, Romeo!

835
01:02:05,678 --> 01:02:07,758
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

836
01:02:08,797 --> 01:02:11,718
Yes. Hey, Mrs. Tingle, what's your dog's name?

837
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:14,557
What's your name?

838
01:02:14,718 --> 01:02:16,638
it's not Romeo, is it? Oh, come here.

839
01:02:18,637 --> 01:02:20,317
You could never play Juliet.

840
01:02:20,918 --> 01:02:22,998
You haven't the commitment, the soul.

841
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:27,717
Well, there's the Tingle
we all know and love, hmm?

842
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,798
You've never had a broken heart.

843
01:02:31,677 --> 01:02:34,077
Yeah, well, at least I have a heart.

844
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,597
So tell me, Mrs. Tingle,

845
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:39,957
what's the deal with you
and Coach Wenchell anyway?

846
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:43,797
I mean, is it just a physical thing,
or... do you love him?

847
01:02:44,157 --> 01:02:46,157
Coach Wenchell and I...

848
01:02:46,957 --> 01:02:48,918
have an understanding.

849
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:52,117
Oh. How romantic.

850
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:57,557
But, tell me, do you love him, or...

851
01:02:57,797 --> 01:02:59,637
are you just spank buddies?

852
01:03:00,837 --> 01:03:03,197
I'm fond of Coach Wenchell.

853
01:03:05,797 --> 01:03:07,837
Have you ever loved anyone, Mrs. Tingle?

854
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,156
I mean, you are a Missus.

855
01:03:11,357 --> 01:03:12,797
So whatever happened to mister?

856
01:03:13,677 --> 01:03:15,477
You scorin' alimony or what?

857
01:03:17,157 --> 01:03:18,517
He left.

858
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:20,957
When?

859
01:03:22,956 --> 01:03:25,517
What happened? You have to tell me.
Scoop, please.

860
01:03:29,797 --> 01:03:32,436
I, too, planned on leaving Grandsboro.

861
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:34,437
like you and your friends,

862
01:03:34,597 --> 01:03:37,717
I thirsted for more than this town could offer.

863
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,877
Then I met Richard.

864
01:03:42,076 --> 01:03:44,877
Absolutely strapping man.

865
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:47,516
Blue eyes, wide shoulders.

866
01:03:48,597 --> 01:03:50,077
He was dangerous,

867
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:53,836
reckless, everything I thought I always wanted.

868
01:03:55,516 --> 01:03:57,917
After a brief romance, we married.

869
01:03:59,076 --> 01:04:00,797
He was my world.

870
01:04:03,797 --> 01:04:06,316
Such a brilliant and desirable man.

871
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:12,276
But eventually his nature caught up with him,

872
01:04:13,636 --> 01:04:16,437
and his eyes began to wander,
towards a friend of mine.

873
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:18,357
Oh, no.

874
01:04:18,716 --> 01:04:21,276
A girl much prettier and more delicate than I.

875
01:04:22,596 --> 01:04:26,356
Someone who I never dreamed
would be a threat to me.

876
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:31,796
She was my best friend.

877
01:04:32,796 --> 01:04:35,196
That's why I was so devastated
to discover that...

878
01:04:36,236 --> 01:04:38,676
she was sleeping with Richard...

879
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,916
right under my nose.

880
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:44,556
My best friend...

881
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,756
who I trusted with all my heart,

882
01:04:48,675 --> 01:04:53,755
lying to me, betraying me,
stealing the only man I've ever loved...

883
01:04:54,796 --> 01:04:59,476
while I played the poor,
pitiful, little sidekick.

884
01:05:05,995 --> 01:05:07,915
you're lying.

885
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:10,756
Am I?

886
01:05:12,435 --> 01:05:15,956
There's nothing going on between those two.
Luke's not even into Leigh Ann.

887
01:05:16,155 --> 01:05:18,315
Luke's a man, Jo Lynn.

888
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:23,636
He'll always pursue that which
is unobtainable. it's in his nature.

889
01:05:27,275 --> 01:05:28,395
No.

890
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:31,075
They've been seeing each other
secretly since tenth grade.

891
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:31,876
Even I know the story.

892
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,116
It all started at some birthday
party where Leigh Ann hid

893
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,075
in the bathroom all night.

894
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:41,035
You were there.

895
01:05:41,795 --> 01:05:43,635
Leigh Ann is my friend.

896
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:47,035
Under this roof, Jo Lynn,

897
01:05:47,355 --> 01:05:51,075
I'd say I'm the closest thing
you have to a friend.

898
01:05:54,195 --> 01:05:55,835
it's not true.

899
01:05:56,595 --> 01:05:58,995
you're not too quick, Jo Lynn.

900
01:05:59,675 --> 01:06:02,675
You might just make it as an actress after all.

901
01:06:33,395 --> 01:06:35,154
We can pick 'em up tomorrow after 3:00.

902
01:06:38,355 --> 01:06:40,035
Hey, it's almost over.

903
01:06:40,155 --> 01:06:42,154
We're this close to getting an
A for the rest of our lives.

904
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,875
it's all gonna be okay.

905
01:07:16,674 --> 01:07:17,874
Jo?

906
01:07:19,394 --> 01:07:22,994
Where is she? I think she's upstairs.
I'm gonna go check on her.

907
01:07:23,274 --> 01:07:24,234
All right.

908
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:31,634
Where's Jo Lynn?

909
01:07:32,993 --> 01:07:34,274
She went home.

910
01:07:34,714 --> 01:07:36,114
Home?

911
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:40,754
Something about being sick and
tired of being your little lap dog.

912
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:43,954
What did you say to her?

913
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:46,154
Nothing...

914
01:07:48,474 --> 01:07:49,873
much.

915
01:07:49,994 --> 01:07:51,273
Tell me Hello?

916
01:07:52,353 --> 01:07:55,034
Hi, Mrs. Jordan.
May I speak to Jo Lynn, please?

917
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,553
Hi, Leigh Ann. She told me
to tell you she wasn't home.

918
01:07:57,674 --> 01:08:00,473
So whatever you two fought about,
I hope you can work it out tomorrow.

919
01:08:00,593 --> 01:08:03,114
I'm sure we will. Thank you, Mrs. Jordan.

920
01:08:03,753 --> 01:08:05,233
Good night. Bye, dear.

921
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:12,953
Your move.

922
01:08:17,233 --> 01:08:18,953
Why are you like this?

923
01:08:20,953 --> 01:08:23,594
Why are you so bitter and angry?

924
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,033
Why do you want to destroy me?

925
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:29,273
I don't want to destroy you.
I want to teach you.

926
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:33,393
Oh, that is bullshit.

927
01:08:34,473 --> 01:08:36,833
You know, you hide behind your
degree, but the reality is...

928
01:08:36,953 --> 01:08:39,033
is that you're jealous
of every student you teach.

929
01:08:40,873 --> 01:08:42,513
You never got out of this town, did you?

930
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,513
You went to high school here.
Now you teach here,

931
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:47,153
and you're going to die here.

932
01:08:49,273 --> 01:08:51,313
And you resent anyone who has a future,

933
01:08:51,473 --> 01:08:53,833
anyone who's gonna get out and have a life.

934
01:08:54,153 --> 01:08:58,393
No, I resent what you're going to do with that life.

935
01:08:59,272 --> 01:09:02,313
Selfish, mindless pursuits
of your generation...

936
01:09:02,553 --> 01:09:06,193
will only bring us closer
to destruction, and I despise it.

937
01:09:06,473 --> 01:09:08,633
That is not good enough, Mrs. Tingle.

938
01:09:08,913 --> 01:09:11,433
if you're disillusioned with the youth of today,

939
01:09:11,553 --> 01:09:13,033
you have no one to blame but yourself.

940
01:09:13,113 --> 01:09:14,673
Always the Salem witch

941
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:18,033
completely innocent, wrongly accused.

942
01:09:19,992 --> 01:09:21,833
ironic, isn't it?

943
01:09:22,553 --> 01:09:25,153
You still don't know what that word means.

944
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:27,272
Metaphoric, yes.

945
01:09:27,392 --> 01:09:28,912
Symbolic, maybe.

946
01:09:29,192 --> 01:09:31,512
But there's no irony involved.

947
01:09:31,713 --> 01:09:33,752
would you please look that word up?

948
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:36,553
Oh, I am on to you, Mrs. Tingle. you're over.

949
01:09:37,513 --> 01:09:39,632
you're trying to take as many
people with you as you can,

950
01:09:39,872 --> 01:09:42,072
but I am not scared of you.

951
01:09:42,193 --> 01:09:44,353
Who do you think you're fooling?

952
01:09:44,793 --> 01:09:46,232
you're so scared, I can smell it.

953
01:09:46,352 --> 01:09:50,912
Your fear is the most predictable
thing about you.

954
01:09:52,073 --> 01:09:54,872
You've lived your whole life in fear

955
01:09:55,032 --> 01:09:57,592
terrified of making a mistake;

956
01:09:57,752 --> 01:09:59,593
scared to death you won't get that A,

957
01:09:59,753 --> 01:10:02,073
that scholarship, that ticket out,

958
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:07,032
afraid you'll never escape
your mother and her name tag,

959
01:10:07,192 --> 01:10:10,272
or your father who won't return your calls.

960
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:13,872
That's why you've shunned Luke...

961
01:10:14,032 --> 01:10:17,072
and every other boy who's ever
tried to lay his hands on you.

962
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:20,432
You're afraid of getting that bad seed,

963
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:23,552
afraid of giving birth
to a child you never wanted,

964
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:26,552
a child you could only blame for
your own wretched existence

965
01:10:26,712 --> 01:10:29,952
stuck in a small town with a small life,

966
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:33,432
destined to become that very thing
you despise the most.

967
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:36,192
I know all about it, Leigh Ann.

968
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:37,952
I wrote the book.

969
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:42,512
I know you.

970
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:02,790
Hey. I found Tingle's grade book.

971
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:12,631
What's wrong with you?

972
01:12:30,071 --> 01:12:34,550
Oh, God. I've wanted this.
I've dreamt about this, exactly this.

973
01:12:34,991 --> 01:12:37,270
Yeah? Don't ruin it.

974
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:52,109
Mrs. Tingle's grade book.

975
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,269
it has all the history grades.

976
01:13:55,709 --> 01:13:58,749
What you get? I already know. I got a B

977
01:13:58,829 --> 01:14:01,069
We can fix that. No, I can't do that.

978
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:04,430
You have your history teacher
tied to a bed. Yes, you can.

979
01:14:04,629 --> 01:14:06,149
But it won't fix anything.

980
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:08,229
Trudie Tucker got an A.
She'll still be valedictorian.

981
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:11,109
Then we'll change her grade too.

982
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:12,909
No,... It's not right.

983
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:16,109
What's right anymore?

984
01:14:46,869 --> 01:14:50,189
I'm gonna burn in hell for this.
it'll be a party.

985
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:10,109
So what do you think happened to Jo Lynn?

986
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:11,589
I'll find out.

987
01:15:12,589 --> 01:15:14,909
I'll be back right after school,
and I'll pick up the pictures.

988
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:16,269
Yeah. Okay.

989
01:15:21,028 --> 01:15:22,388
Listen. about last night

990
01:15:22,508 --> 01:15:25,388
Hey, I know. it was just a one time,
animal thing...

991
01:15:25,548 --> 01:15:27,908
brought about by an intensely
masochistic situation.

992
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:33,029
And it was a lot of fun.

993
01:15:36,148 --> 01:15:38,588
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

994
01:16:18,028 --> 01:16:21,388
Now, Josephine was just a little slit bag whore...

995
01:16:21,588 --> 01:16:23,628
who was leaving her panties all over town.

996
01:16:24,308 --> 01:16:26,987
And Napoleon was a short, little asshole...

997
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:29,987
who was killing people 'cause
they were taller than he was...

998
01:16:30,147 --> 01:16:31,787
while Josephine was home
gang banging the townies.

999
01:16:31,907 --> 01:16:32,988
Brian.

1000
01:16:33,348 --> 01:16:36,307
And Napoleon had no idea. I mean,
the poor guy was just completely clueless.

1001
01:16:36,427 --> 01:16:38,387
He was off conquering countries
just as fast as he could

1002
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:40,147
'cause he wanted to get back to her...

1003
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:42,187
because he truly loved the hussy.

1004
01:16:43,747 --> 01:16:45,667
Yeah. Okay, that's all the review for today.

1005
01:16:45,787 --> 01:16:49,548
Now, Mrs. Tingle gave me her grade
book, so I have all your project grades.

1006
01:16:49,747 --> 01:16:51,147
I'm going to post the on the back.

1007
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:58,827
Jo. Hey, Miss Banks?

1008
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:00,227
Yes, Roger Jo.

1009
01:17:00,948 --> 01:17:02,588
Jo, wait up. Oh, yeah.

1010
01:17:02,988 --> 01:17:05,147
I got a C? Yeah. A what?

1011
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:07,948
A B?

1012
01:17:09,427 --> 01:17:11,907
Miss Banks Yes, Trudie.

1013
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:14,907
There must be some mistake. I got a B.

1014
01:17:15,027 --> 01:17:16,748
Well, no. I got it right out of the grade book.

1015
01:17:17,787 --> 01:17:20,227
Does this look like a B to you?

1016
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,947
Well, I what? I I don't know

1017
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,987
I have never gotten a B in my life.
I am an A student.

1018
01:17:29,107 --> 01:17:32,067
I'm the best student in this school.
Okay, Trudie, just calm down.

1019
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,307
This isn't a B. This is an A+. it's an A+

1020
01:17:36,467 --> 01:17:38,707
Okay, Trudie, just stop that now A B?

1021
01:17:39,027 --> 01:17:40,667
I don't think so.

1022
01:17:42,427 --> 01:17:43,467
Just move!

1023
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:03,307
Leigh Ann. There you are.

1024
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:04,427
Yes, Miss Banks?

1025
01:18:04,587 --> 01:18:06,187
I've been looking all over the place for you.

1026
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,107
Why? Well, it's about your history grade.

1027
01:18:08,186 --> 01:18:10,027
Apparently Mrs. Tingle's grade book was stolen.

1028
01:18:10,146 --> 01:18:10,986
What?

1029
01:18:11,147 --> 01:18:12,346
It turned up in Miss Gold's office.

1030
01:18:12,427 --> 01:18:14,467
Some of the grades were
altered; yours was one of them.

1031
01:18:14,587 --> 01:18:16,746
That's impossible.
No. I just spoke to Mrs. Tingle.

1032
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,026
What? You just talked to Mrs. Tingle?

1033
01:18:19,226 --> 01:18:20,347
Yeah.

1034
01:18:20,787 --> 01:18:22,346
Leigh Ann

1035
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:30,107
Jo.

1036
01:18:31,187 --> 01:18:33,066
Jo, look. We need to talk.

1037
01:18:33,186 --> 01:18:34,706
Did you call over here and pretend to be Tingle?

1038
01:18:34,826 --> 01:18:36,106
Did you? Did I what?

1039
01:18:36,266 --> 01:18:37,586
Did you speak to Miss Banks
about the grade book?

1040
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,946
I don't know what you're talking
about. I don't know what Tingle told

1041
01:18:40,026 --> 01:18:42,266
Look me in the eye and tell me that
you didn't sleep with Luke.

1042
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:45,226
Where did you hear that?
Did Tingle say something?

1043
01:18:46,066 --> 01:18:47,666
Wrong answer, Leigh Ann.

1044
01:18:50,546 --> 01:18:54,186
Yes... I did sleep with him.

1045
01:18:55,946 --> 01:19:00,026
Jo, I'm so sorry.

1046
01:19:02,346 --> 01:19:03,946
I didn't

1047
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:12,105
I didn't think that I knew, but

1048
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:14,426
I just listened to that little voice, like you said.

1049
01:19:14,585 --> 01:19:18,145
You pretend to be so innocent, but
in reality you'll do anything to win.

1050
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:21,386
you're worse than Tingle.
you're a Tingle in sheep's clothing.

1051
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:24,906
Look, Jo. Listen. I think
Tingle's free, and I need your help.

1052
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:26,706
Why don't you take
your passive aggressive shit

1053
01:19:26,866 --> 01:19:28,346
and go manipulate like's ass.

1054
01:19:28,425 --> 01:19:29,665
I'm tired.

1055
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:04,626
Luke.

1056
01:20:24,345 --> 01:20:26,185
Mrs. Tingle?

1057
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,345
Shit. Luke.

1058
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,705
Luke. Luke.

1059
01:21:12,465 --> 01:21:15,824
Mr. Potter, please.
Yes, it's about the grade book.

1060
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:39,664
Good afternoon, Miss Watson.

1061
01:21:39,945 --> 01:21:43,424
Mrs. Tingle. How long have you
been on the loose?

1062
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:46,464
Oh, catch up, Leigh Ann. We're way past that.

1063
01:21:48,144 --> 01:21:50,024
Then why haven't you called the police?

1064
01:21:50,184 --> 01:21:52,904
I just called Mr. Potter. He's on his way.

1065
01:21:53,904 --> 01:21:56,744
I caught one of my best students
cheating, and she and her lover...

1066
01:21:56,864 --> 01:21:59,624
stormed my house in anger
and tried to attack me.

1067
01:21:59,744 --> 01:22:01,304
No, I won't go along with that.

1068
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:03,704
I think you will.

1069
01:22:06,424 --> 01:22:08,104
You won't kill me.

1070
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,424
Oh, no.

1071
01:22:10,184 --> 01:22:13,583
What I have planned for you
is a fate worse than death.

1072
01:22:15,624 --> 01:22:18,943
You'll wear that name tag so well.

1073
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:23,904
That's all you care about, isn't it?

1074
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:27,664
You just want to see me fail.

1075
01:22:27,863 --> 01:22:29,464
it's your destiny.

1076
01:22:31,904 --> 01:22:36,144
Haven't you learned by now
that history always repeats itself?

1077
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:41,624
No. I won't go along with that. I won't do it.

1078
01:22:42,344 --> 01:22:43,903
Yes, you will.

1079
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:46,623
I'll be Tingle's alibi.

1080
01:22:46,864 --> 01:22:52,064
I'll tell how you orchestrated the
whole thing. I've got the pictures.

1081
01:22:53,464 --> 01:22:55,423
The black mail table turns.

1082
01:22:57,024 --> 01:22:59,784
I'm not going down with you, Leigh
Ann. You can ruin your life,

1083
01:22:59,904 --> 01:23:01,704
but you are not gonna ruin mine.

1084
01:23:08,503 --> 01:23:10,943
I thought you were my friend.

1085
01:23:16,263 --> 01:23:18,143
Your move.

1086
01:23:23,943 --> 01:23:26,303
Don't tell me I can't act.

1087
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:28,783
You won't shoot me. No?

1088
01:23:30,023 --> 01:23:31,223
No.

1089
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:32,343
Run

1090
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:42,223
Luke

1091
01:23:42,343 --> 01:23:43,903
Leigh! Leigh! Luke!

1092
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,783
Leave her alone

1093
01:24:02,183 --> 01:24:04,743
Okay, Miss Watson. Leave her alone

1094
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:43,982
is she dead?

1095
01:25:35,182 --> 01:25:36,542
Trudie.

1096
01:25:37,222 --> 01:25:38,622
Oh, my God.

1097
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:54,541
You killed her, Mrs. Tingle.

1098
01:25:55,781 --> 01:25:57,501
I didn't mean to.

1099
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:00,822
Shit.

1100
01:26:03,901 --> 01:26:07,142
Oh, good Lord. What happened? Holy shit.

1101
01:26:08,861 --> 01:26:11,981
Tell him what happened.
Tell him you shot her.

1102
01:26:12,221 --> 01:26:16,541
Yes, I I shot her. I didn't mean to.
I thought it was you.

1103
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:22,501
I don't know what I was thinking.

1104
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:27,941
I just... wanted you... to learn.

1105
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:29,941
No.

1106
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:33,021
You wanted me to fail.

1107
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:34,981
Yes.

1108
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:38,461
Yes, I wanted you to fail.

1109
01:26:41,701 --> 01:26:43,660
Now she's dead, and I've killed her.

1110
01:26:44,421 --> 01:26:45,781
A B?

1111
01:26:46,181 --> 01:26:48,261
Oh, Jesus. I don't think so.

1112
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:58,060
Well, not exactly.

1113
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,901
You knew?

1114
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:02,661
Cool.

1115
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:05,340
Well, I'm calling the police.

1116
01:27:05,941 --> 01:27:07,300
Mrs. Tingle,

1117
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:10,820
I have wanted to say this
to you for 20 years... you're fired.

1118
01:27:17,621 --> 01:27:19,780
Now, that's ironic.

1119
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:24,260
Well done, Miss Watson.

1120
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:32,741
And now it is with great pleasure
that I introduce...

1121
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:36,380
this year's recipient of the Board of
Excellence scholarship

1122
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,060
Miss Leigh Ann Watson.
