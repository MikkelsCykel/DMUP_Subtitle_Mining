Hi, Jack.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,010
You keep smiling.

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:07,690
You hear me?

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:11,130
Whatever you do,
you keep smiling.

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,331
Yeah, I'm gonna do that, Jack.

6
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:17,971
Yeah, so what happened to you,
buddy?

7
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:22,292
Oh Christ... Oh Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:31,853
Jesus Christ.

9
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:43,933
Chuck, I wanted to talk to him!

10
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,373
He'll be here in a few days.

11
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:47,333
Weather is clearing.

12
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:51,613
He's grabbing a flight
with some transport boys.

13
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:54,574
What is it?

14
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:58,374
I would give anything not to
have to tell you, Ethel Ann.

15
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,775
What?

16
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,934
Tell me what?

17
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:07,056
Tell me what?!

18
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,257
Hello?

19
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:33,777
Could I speak to Ethel, please?

20
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,697
Yes, this is Ethel.

21
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:38,817
This is Jimmy Reilly.

22
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:42,497
I found this ring
on Black Mountain

23
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:45,537
Where the plane crashed.

24
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,098
And I thought it might belong to
one of the airmen who got killed.

25
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,058
For Christ's sake!

26
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,339
Sorry.

27
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,858
Are you there?

28
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:57,179
Yes.

29
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,459
The ring says 'Ethel and Teddy'.

30
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,660
Ann.

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,180
Ethel Ann.

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,179
That's my name.

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,540
Oh, right.

34
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,140
Only, on the list of
dead guys there was

35
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,261
Sorry.

36
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:18,900
On the list of... deceased
there was Teddy Gordon

37
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,580
So I called the veterans people.

38
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,140
Only they said he wasn't married,

39
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,700
but he left everything in his Will
to Ethel Roberts.

40
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,421
And they had an address

41
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:28,901
They said you'd probably moved.

42
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:32,742
But you haven't.

43
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,462
The ring

44
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:37,301
Would you like me
to send it to you?

45
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:37,742
No.

46
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:40,822
No, no, no.

47
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:42,942
But it's yours.

48
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,022
No, it's his.

49
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:49,022
But he's... I mean, he's not here.

50
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:50,942
Then you keep it.

51
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,343
All right.

52
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:56,983
And we were married.

53
00:02:56,984 --> 00:03:00,783
Well, they said you weren't.

54
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,304
Hello?

55
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,344
Maybe she was cut off

56
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:07,224
Shall I call her back?

57
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,664
No, leave her alone.

58
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:13,305
You go home.

59
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,704
Can I leave it here?

60
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:15,145
What?

61
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:16,265
The ring.

62
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:20,266
It won't be safe
with granny around.

63
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:26,146
Mr Quinlan.

64
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:29,786
Thanks.

65
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:34,787
I'll let myself out then.

66
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,548
Come on, Jack.

67
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,668
Teddy, this is crazy.

68
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:04,468
I can't do this.

69
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,348
Well, you got him then.

70
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,748
We got a bit of a problem too.

71
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,508
We don't have time for a problem.

72
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,388
I'm not allowed to do this.

73
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,868
I haven't taken Final Orders.

74
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:12,148
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

75
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,229
She's gonna be here any second.

76
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,630
She's here now.

77
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,909
I think it was my mother's.

78
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,390
Ethel Ann?

79
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,229
He's marrying you?

80
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,950
Your folks
will never agree to this.

81
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:32,551
That's why they're not here.

82
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:40,191
Jack will you give me away?

83
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,592
Please.

84
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,472
Sure.

85
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,631
Wilbur,
are you going to marry us?

86
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:46,192
I can't.

87
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,311
You don't have a licence

88
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,031
Is this a church?

89
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,032
Yes.

90
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,072
And is God here?

91
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:55,912
What do you mean?

92
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:57,952
This man is going to war.

93
00:04:57,953 --> 00:04:58,912
I love him.

94
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:01,312
I want God to protect him.

95
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:06,352
So I'm asking you
is He here right now?

96
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,834
Yes.

97
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:13,234
Then marry us... In His sight.

98
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:25,674
You got rings?

99
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,234
Just the one.

100
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:28,275
One ring?

101
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:30,954
Well, it's the ring you gave me,
Teddy.

102
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:34,795
I had our names put inside it.

103
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:39,475
I'm gonna marry you with it and
then I want you to take it with you.

104
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:42,875
I got it for you, Ethel Ann.

105
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,515
This way you can remember me
wherever you go.

106
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:51,157
Okay. Okay.

107
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:56,196
Say the words, Wilbur.

108
00:05:56,197 --> 00:06:01,477
Matrimony is a holy state not to
be entered into lightly.

109
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,957
Because in the eyes of God
this is forever

110
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,117
And I mean forever.

111
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,598
Forever.

112
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:13,918
Teddy... do you take this woman,
Ethel Ann,

113
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,838
to be your lawful wedded wife
all the days that you shall live?

114
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,239
I do.

115
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,798
Ethel Ann do you
take this man, Teddy,

116
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:27,960
to be your lawful wedded husband?

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,280
I do.

118
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,599
I'll be yours till the day I die.

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,919
You better do whatever
you're gonna do with that ring.

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,721
Jack, will you?

121
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,761
By the power vested in me
by the state of...

122
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:59,201
No... can't say that.

123
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:03,602
Just say what you can say.

124
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:08,242
By the power vested in me,
by the God of Love...

125
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:12,442
who sees all things,
and hears all promises...

126
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:14,762
I now pronounce you man and wife.

127
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:18,803
You may kiss the bride.

128
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:17,688
Bloody great!

129
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,528
Do you know who we are?

130
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,689
No.

131
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,088
We know who you are.

132
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:32,368
You're a lucky lad, Jimmy.

133
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,128
Those Republican bastards
could have found you

134
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,048
if we hadn't been watching you.

135
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,248
Why were you watching me?

136
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:41,530
Do you know him?

137
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,770
No.

138
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,609
Yes, you do.

139
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,850
I don't.

140
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,809
He's lying to us.

141
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,569
Can you tell me who this is?

142
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,970
Me.

143
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,250
That's me.

144
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,531
Thank you.

145
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,970
And this man?

146
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,610
That's Mr Quinlan anything.

147
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:02,610
He's not done anything.

148
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,130
Where did you get those?

149
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:07,931
What about this one?

150
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:11,691
Have you seen him?

151
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,731
Take your time.

152
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,851
You've already told us a lot.

153
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,252
Hasn't he?

154
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,291
I haven't told you anything.

155
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,971
Yes, he has.

156
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,932
You've identified
two photographs.

157
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,812
That's very helpful.

158
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,772
His name is Cathal Thomas

159
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:27,732
By the way...

160
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,372
didn't you say
that you had seen him?

161
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:31,972
Or did you deny
not having seen him?

162
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,653
Yes.

163
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,814
No.

164
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:38,253
I didn't say anything.

165
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:39,493
But you just did.

166
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:43,134
He said yes.

167
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,293
I don't wanna help you.

168
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,093
But Mr Thomas will think that
you have been helping us.

169
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:51,374
That's what he thought
about this gentleman.

170
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,894
And, yes, you do know him.

171
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:59,415
That was his body
you found this morning.

172
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:03,215
But I thought that was
from the airplane.

173
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,615
Afraid not.

174
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,375
He was buried
there six months ago.

175
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:08,215
By Mr Thomas, actually.

176
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:12,296
As a punishment for helping us.

177
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:13,895
Thanks for finding him.

178
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:17,936
Now all we need to do
is find Mr Thomas.

179
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:20,256
Why don't we keep
the lad for a few days?

180
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:22,016
Let him watch some dirty videos.

181
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:25,176
I'll put the word out
how helpful he is.

182
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:27,816
Don't... don't be doing that.

183
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:31,577
Or of course
I could let you go right now.

184
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:37,497
But if, if I did do that could I
rely on your help in the future?

185
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:40,377
Like keeping an eye
on Black Mountain.

186
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:45,898
Letting me know
if you see him up there.

187
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,379
Yes?

188
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:48,459
Yes.

189
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,059
Yes.

190
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:53,458
I didn't hear that.

191
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,859
Did you say you are
gonna help us or not?

192
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,340
Yes or no?

193
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,420
Yes.

194
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,380
Good.

195
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,900
If we let you go
without roughing you up

196
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,820
they'd be suspicious,
wouldn't they?

197
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:16,180
So... say thank you.

198
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:17,461
Thank you.

199
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:38,262
Oh, Jimmy, where have you been?

200
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,222
Oh dear God!

201
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,582
You stupid idiot!

202
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,702
Mr Quinlan,
what are you doing here?

203
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,222
Mr Quinlan...

204
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:46,102
Jesus, it's you!

205
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,302
Don't hurt me, please.

206
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,103
You know me, then?

207
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,863
How come, when we've never met?

208
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:51,543
What did they do to you?

209
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,543
I told you not to go up there.

210
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:53,183
Would you look...

211
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:54,023
Leave him alone.

212
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:56,303
I told him about you, Cathal.

213
00:11:56,304 --> 00:12:00,024
I'll get you a cup of tea, son.

214
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:03,425
You're a bloody liar.

215
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,144
You've been talking with
the Special Branch, Jimmy.

216
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:08,544
You were seen.

217
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:09,984
I said nothing.

218
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:11,984
You found a body.

219
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:14,304
But you couldn't
keep your mouth shut.

220
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:15,745
You went to the police.

221
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:19,345
No, they were on the mountain
were watching for you.

222
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,145
They were they now?

223
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:23,145
So, let me guess

224
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:25,505
They showed you my photograph.

225
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:26,106
Right.

226
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,305
Asked if you'd seen me.

227
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:29,946
And what did you say?

228
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,427
Yes or no?

229
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:33,147
Yes

230
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:36,826
No... I don't know, I got confused.

231
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:38,347
Confused?

232
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:40,666
Little creep.

233
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:44,507
Do you want a bullet in the knees
or would you rather lose your balls?

234
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:45,507
Jesus, Cat!

235
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:46,627
He's just a kid.

236
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:47,547
He knows nothing.

237
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:48,987
Good for nothing

238
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:50,147
This is all your fault.

239
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:51,587
I kept telling him
not to go up the mountain.

240
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:52,587
Digging up the past.

241
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:53,867
Why can't you just let things lie?

242
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,387
We wouldn't wanna be
digging up your past.

243
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:56,548
Don't you dare!

244
00:12:56,549 --> 00:13:00,029
Shut up, the pair of you!

245
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:09,509
I got something planned
on that mountain.

246
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,949
So if I see you again there
will be another body up there.

247
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,549
He's my grandson, Cathal.

248
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,509
I'll shoot him, Eleanor.

249
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,271
Don't think I won't.

250
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:29,671
You better see me out the back.

251
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:41,591
I heard you were in trouble
Come here to find you.

252
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:43,551
Found Cathal instead.

253
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,711
You all know each other?

254
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:45,392
Yes.

255
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:48,711
You need to get out of Belfast
for a wee while.

256
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,152
But I've nowhere to go.

257
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:53,632
Yes, you have.

258
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,912
What's all that for?

259
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:58,593
I want you to do something for me.

260
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:02,432
I need to know if she's all right.

261
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,714
Who?

262
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:09,473
I want you to go to America.

263
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,393
I think you should
take it back to her.

264
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,994
All right?

265
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:30,435
Listen, you Republican shite
the IRA can be most unpleasant.

266
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,995
But if you mess with us,

267
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:36,156
you won't recognise
your granny's body.

268
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,435
Who are you?

269
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:39,955
Friends of Mr Maguigan.

270
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:42,635
He says you'll help us
find Cathal Thomas.

271
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:45,516
We know he's around here,
and up there in the mountain.

272
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,676
All you have to do
is lead us to him.

273
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:49,717
Yes.

274
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:54,796
We're watching,
Jimmy Every second.

275
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:58,678
I'll get it.

276
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,438
Yes?

277
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:08,557
It's me... I'm really sorry,
I had to call you.

278
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:12,118
Please, I need some help.

279
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,279
Jimmy?

280
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,638
I found a body, on the mountain.

281
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,878
I found a body!

282
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,678
What are you saying?

283
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,398
What are you telling me?

284
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,118
They never found a body.

285
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,399
Don't you tell me that,
you little bastard!

286
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,599
I'm an old woman,
and I wanna be left alone.

287
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,599
No, it's the IRA.

288
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,319
They buried a man on the mountain.

289
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,119
I found him.

290
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,879
I have to get out of Belfast.

291
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,999
Mr Quinlan said I should ask you.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,439
What do you want me to do?

293
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,000
Can I come and stay?

294
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,680
What, come here?

295
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:42,560
Please, just for a wee while.

296
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:43,441
Please.

297
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,960
But I don't even know you.

298
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,200
Mr Quinlan wants me
to bring you the ring.

299
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,961
I could give it to you... Please.

300
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:55,802
Just for a couple of weeks,
till it blows over.

301
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:03,843
Well all right, you can come.

302
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:05,763
Hey, Jack.

303
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:06,923
Chuck.

304
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:08,083
Good trip?

305
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,363
The worst.

306
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,282
This one is Teddy's.

307
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:12,363
Yeah.

308
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,282
Looks like you got yourself
a story there

309
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:16,363
Yeah.

310
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:19,643
She been crying?

311
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:20,164
No.

312
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:21,244
I have.

313
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:22,923
What happened to you?

314
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,323
Oh, I got shot up over Bremen.

315
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:28,563
Plexiglas in my eye
I might lose it.

316
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:30,283
I can't fly, can't even shoot.

317
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,724
I'm out of the war.

318
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,484
Ethel Ann is looking after me now.

319
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:38,245
That's good seeing how he
wanted you to take care of her.

320
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,084
He should have asked you, Jack.

321
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,885
She doesn't love me,
but I know she could love you.

322
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:44,965
I wish he'd asked you, Jack.

323
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:47,085
Well, he didn't.

324
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:50,365
And we promised.

325
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:52,845
You're the man, Chuck.

326
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,286
Let's do this.

327
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:00,367
Hi, Jack.

328
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,686
You better come inside.

329
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,406
What the hell is going on here?

330
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:06,166
She doesn't tell me a damn thing,
just someone is coming to visit.

331
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:06,767
Who?

332
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:07,686
Where from?

333
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:08,087
Ireland.

334
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:08,727
Belfast.

335
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,087
Belfast?

336
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:12,367
I don't wanna leave her alone,
Jack,

337
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,567
but I can't
take much more of this.

338
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:14,008
All right.

339
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:18,288
Go on, get out of here,
both of you.

340
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:22,407
You look like hell.

341
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,488
You wanted me to grieve

342
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,128
Would you go to
the airport for me, please?

343
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,008
I'll send Peter.

344
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,488
No, I want you to go yourself.

345
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:29,928
I don't even know who this guy is.

346
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:30,608
Neither do I.

347
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:32,888
Marie says he's from Belfast.

348
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:34,448
Well,
that is none of her business.

349
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:35,129
Look

350
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:37,048
Ethel you have got to talk to her.

351
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:39,129
Will you take your hands off me?

352
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,049
And who the hell
do you know in Belfast?

353
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,729
Who is this guy?

354
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,289
His name is Jimmy Reilly,

355
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,929
he's arriving at 12.10 tonight
on American 301.

356
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,729
Would you meet him at the airport?

357
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,010
You listen to me!

358
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:55,690
If you don't talk to Marie now,
you're gonna lose her.

359
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:57,850
She's gonna go.

360
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:00,850
You just tell her what happened,
she'll understand.

361
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:01,970
Listen to me.

362
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:05,291
All the love she ever got
was from her daddy.

363
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,771
All the kisses and hugs and
bedtime stories

364
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:12,411
and cuddles never from me

365
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,491
You think now
she will understand why?

366
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,692
I think you should
give her the chance.

367
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,132
Well that's what I intend to do.

368
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,773
Now, please go.

369
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:37,213
No, don't do that, please.

370
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:39,413
Just... come on in.

371
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:40,494
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,293
I'm real glad you're safe.

373
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,534
Look at that foot.

374
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,934
Must be hard for you,
not racing around.

375
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,855
Yeah.

376
00:18:52,015 --> 00:18:55,495
- Let me take these.
- Thanks.

377
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:00,175
Did they find a body?

378
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,296
No.

379
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,535
So there's no proof?

380
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,735
Ethel Ann, he's gone.

381
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:09,495
We could arrange
a memorial service.

382
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:10,536
Why?

383
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:14,696
We're the only ones
who will remember him.

384
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:17,976
There's no family now.

385
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:21,457
No children.

386
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:29,217
Was that his case I saw you
put in the hall?

387
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:32,337
I brought his things
back for you, yeah.

388
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,817
Let's bring it in.

389
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:35,937
Open it up.

390
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:37,377
There's plenty of time for that.

391
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:38,299
No.

392
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,338
No, let's do it now

393
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,179
Please.

394
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,219
Hiya.

395
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:46,338
You must be Jimmy.

396
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:47,458
How do you do?

397
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:47,939
I'm great.

398
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,178
I'm just great.

399
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:49,898
Come in, please.

400
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:50,818
Oh, thank you.

401
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,980
Through there.

402
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,379
Why did you do this?

403
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,179
This is Jack's son, Peter.

404
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,979
Jimmy Reilly.

405
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,420
Hello.

406
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,259
How do you do?

407
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,899
Nice to meet you.

408
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,419
Let me take that.

409
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,339
And this is my daughter, Marie.

410
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
Jimmy Reilly.

411
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:07,900
Hello... How do you doody?!

412
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,620
Did we speak on the phone?

413
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:11,140
Sit down, Jimmy.

414
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:12,300
How was the flight?

415
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:14,900
Oh, it was fantastic.

416
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,740
747 all the way.

417
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:17,540
Well, not all the way.

418
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,261
We had to fly to London first
then right across to New York.

419
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,381
And they gave us meals and all.

420
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:22,502
No charge.

421
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,581
And they had little
things of salt and pepper,

422
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:26,621
sachets, I've got some here.

423
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:28,701
And they had little bottles of Irish.

424
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:29,302
Free.

425
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:30,741
And there was a film.

426
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:34,302
And then we had to fly
from London to New York,

427
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:37,582
then from New York to Detroit,
and from Detroit to Branagan.

428
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,622
And it was really fantastic.

429
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:42,222
Jack, do you remember
when we used to take two,

430
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:45,143
three, maybe four days
to do the same thing?

431
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:51,463
We'd have to go from Belfast
to Iceland to Newfoundland.

432
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:52,744
Yes.

433
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,423
Dad... you all right?

434
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:58,704
Yeah, why don't you take
these cases upstairs.

435
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:03,265
Oh, thank you,
but this one is for you.

436
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,384
Mind if I put this on your table?

437
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:06,304
No, go ahead.

438
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:09,704
Just let me get the flowers there.

439
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:11,104
They made me open it up.

440
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,105
This whole thing is for me?

441
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:12,546
Yes.

442
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:16,266
They couldn't believe
what I had inside.

443
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,145
Look at this.

444
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,425
Part of the aileron.

445
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:21,985
Starboard wing.

446
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:25,506
And these are switches from
the radio operator's position.

447
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:30,306
And this is a piece of
Plexiglas curved,

448
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:32,346
from a gun turret.

449
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:39,267
And this... a pressure gauge.

450
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:40,628
Oxygen.

451
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:43,307
They had to breathe oxygen,
you know, they went that high.

452
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:44,907
Oh Jesus Christ.

453
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:46,307
All right, momma, that is enough.

454
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:49,547
Tell me what
this is about right now.

455
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:52,268
Look... is this all right?

456
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,668
I mean, this stuff
is just fantastic

457
00:21:53,669 --> 00:22:00,268
for me and I just thought would
you like to see the ring?

458
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,669
The what?

459
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:02,829
The ring.

460
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:07,149
It's my secret Mr Quinlan said
I can't keep secrets, but I can.

461
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,229
Except I told Mr Jack in the car.

462
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,309
What are you talking about?

463
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,829
I found it on Black Mountain.

464
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,269
Where the plane crashed.

465
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,590
In the war The B-17.

466
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:22,191
The B-17?

467
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:24,670
A B-17 'G' turret

468
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:28,550
It had the new chin it had double
50 calibre machine-guns.

469
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,230
And that's where I found the ring.

470
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:30,671
What ring?

471
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,511
Whose ring?

472
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:34,191
Mr Gordon's.

473
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:36,711
Well, your dad's.

474
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:40,111
Before he was, you know killed.

475
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:41,551
In Belfast?

476
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:42,592
Yes.

477
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:44,991
Are you just gonna
let this happen?

478
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,432
My daddy wasn't killed in Belfast.

479
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,672
He died here
a couple of months ago.

480
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,592
And his name wasn't Gordon,
it was Harris.

481
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,312
Chuck Harris.

482
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:57,392
Wasn't it, mom?

483
00:22:57,393 --> 00:23:02,714
Of course, he couldn't be
your dad You're too young.

484
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:03,793
Shall I put these away?

485
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:06,193
Maybe you don't
have a place for them.

486
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:09,273
I have a place.

487
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:11,153
Peter,
there's some tools out back.

488
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:13,554
A crowbar, some hammers.

489
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:15,514
Would you bring them to me,
please?

490
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:17,434
What... now?

491
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:19,874
Yes,
I need to take down this wall.

492
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:20,634
Stop, momma!

493
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:21,075
Don't

494
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,034
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

495
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:22,834
Take it easy!

496
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,194
This was daddy's house!

497
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,035
You are not going to smash it up.

498
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,755
This was
never your daddy's house.

499
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,675
He just let you believe it.

500
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,155
Then whose house is this?

501
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:34,195
Which of you gentlemen is
going to bring me the tools?

502
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:38,036
That's what you really want?

503
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:43,477
He kept all your letters.

504
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:46,516
I guess you don't
have a place for these.

505
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:49,396
Oh, I have a place.

506
00:23:49,397 --> 00:23:53,117
Did he have any photographs,
postcards?

507
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:53,678
Pocket.

508
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:57,278
Right side.

509
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:04,637
He never even got to write these.

510
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:08,478
Ethel Ann maybe we ought
to take some of this stuff down?

511
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,559
No.

512
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,118
Nobody should touch this wall.

513
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,678
We could make an album,

514
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,238
take the photos and
put them in a scrapbook.

515
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,358
This is his wall.

516
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,238
This is his house.

517
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,038
I don't want anybody

518
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,679
Ethel Ann, this is your house.

519
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,239
He left it to you.

520
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,799
He wouldn't like it
you living here every day,

521
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,520
this stuff staring down at you.

522
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,600
He was gonna build a shed out back.

523
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,200
We'll just use the wood.

524
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:40,920
Do you want us to build you a shed?

525
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:42,281
No.

526
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:46,361
No, I want you to board it up.

527
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:51,321
Don't touch it, just cover it up.

528
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:55,162
Is that really what you want?

529
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:58,207
This Teddy who was he?

530
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,687
Jimmy?

531
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,287
Sergeant Teddy Gordon.

532
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:14,887
Rear gunner on B-17337833.

533
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:19,327
He crashed June 1st, 1944.

534
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:23,209
He was killed.

535
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:25,089
Gordon?

536
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:31,089
Mrs Gordon.

537
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:37,249
All those years daddy lived in
another man's house.

538
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,009
I'm getting out of here right now.

539
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:39,809
Marie, your mother needs you.

540
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,049
You shut your mouth!

541
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,130
Shut your mouth!

542
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,330
He loved you!

543
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:56,330
In spite of all of this,
he loved you.

544
00:26:56,331 --> 00:27:00,371
But you never did, did you?

545
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:02,971
And all of his life he knew...

546
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:08,851
...you locked your love behind
a god-damn wall!

547
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:11,171
There was no proof.

548
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:15,492
And it was all I had left of him.

549
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:19,932
I don't care about him.

550
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:20,613
You bitch!

551
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:23,692
You shut daddy out!

552
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:28,013
And then you shut me out!

553
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:34,894
All of my life, all you have
ever done is shut us out!

554
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:39,053
Peter, can I please
come stay with you?

555
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:43,255
Go and get in the car.

556
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:49,654
You were kids then.

557
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:51,374
The both of you.

558
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,015
But you haven't been kids
for 50 years.

559
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:58,536
That wall should have
come down a long time ago.

560
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:10,337
Mrs Harris?

561
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:16,817
Mrs Harris,
I brought you the ring.

562
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:47,138
Gentlemen, the city of Belfast,
dead ahead.

563
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:47,980
Skip?

564
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,059
Do you think you could
fly this thing backwards?

565
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,659
Can't see a damn thing back here.

566
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,619
Oh, sure you can.

567
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,380
Just look out your ass
like you always do.

568
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,700
Oh, boy.

569
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,901
If the babes of Belfast only knew
what we had in store for them.

570
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:08,861
Maginty!

571
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:09,780
Mr Maginty!

572
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,660
Is it a raid?

573
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:11,500
Relax, Michael.

574
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:12,580
It's the Americans.

575
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:15,021
They've a new base near here.
No, I'm talking to somebody else.

576
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,301
You know what that means?

577
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:19,701
First, we're gonna
win this bloody war. See you tonight.

578
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:24,702
There will not be a single virgin
in Belfast by the end of the year.

579
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:45,063
Hey, Teddy!

580
00:29:45,064 --> 00:29:46,223
Hiya, Teddy.

581
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:47,623
Hi, Eleanor.

582
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:50,383
Why don't you join in the party?

583
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,863
Find some girl for yourself?

584
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:54,864
I'm fixed, thank you.

585
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:55,585
Shame.

586
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:57,384
Gorgeous man like you.

587
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:00,104
Climb down there.

588
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:02,344
Don't you know he's sworn
to eternal love?

589
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:05,224
Just like we are.

590
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:06,184
I need the powder room.

591
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:09,546
I won't be long, boys.

592
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:11,186
Come on.

593
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:12,465
I need some air.

594
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:12,866
Okay.

595
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:20,825
She is great.

596
00:30:20,826 --> 00:30:22,106
In every department.

597
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:23,107
I'll bet.

598
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:26,546
Yeah, I'm gonna marry her.

599
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:27,946
I'm gonna ask her tonight.

600
00:30:27,947 --> 00:30:29,466
Well, she's very

601
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:33,306
...popular... Jack,
you're drunk.

602
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:35,747
You got your girl.

603
00:30:35,748 --> 00:30:36,787
Why shouldn't I get mine?

604
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:37,867
No, get a girl.

605
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:38,467
Fall in love.

606
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,747
Not... with Eleanor.

607
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:41,188
Oh, yeah?

608
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:43,707
Who should I fall in love with?

609
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:47,307
How about Ethel Ann?

610
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:49,788
Don't you walk away from me!

611
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,308
You got your love.

612
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,388
You got her and you
gave her away to Chuck.

613
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,228
Not me, no.

614
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,148
Jack wasn't good enough.

615
00:30:56,149 --> 00:31:00,148
I did not give her to anybody!

616
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,028
"If I die, just pass her on

617
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,869
down the line to good
old reliable Chuck. "

618
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,389
Who cares what Jack thinks?

619
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you in love with Ethel Ann?

620
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,150
No.

621
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,869
No, I don't love her.

622
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,910
I wouldn't touch her.

623
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:19,590
I'm gonna marry Eleanor.

624
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:21,590
Why the hell shouldn't I?

625
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:25,831
She's a tart, Jack

626
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,831
Jesus, my ankle!

627
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:33,911
You broke it, you asshole!

628
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:36,751
I was lying, of course.

629
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:43,032
I loved Ethel so much it hurt
just thinking about her.

630
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:46,272
So did Chuck.

631
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:47,512
Three guys wanted her,

632
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:50,632
two of them got her,
and then there was me.

633
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:54,512
And when my ankle healed,
I signed on for more missions.

634
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,433
Stayed to the end.

635
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:57,273
52 missions.

636
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,633
Jesus, I should have died
100 times over.

637
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,793
Somehow I always came back.

638
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,753
And I could see how broken she was.

639
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:05,834
Real bad.

640
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:09,234
She depended on Chuck now.

641
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:10,834
He needed her.

642
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:13,394
I mean, he'd have lost
that eye but for her.

643
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:16,194
She wouldn't move out of
the house so he moved in.

644
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:17,594
I left them to it.

645
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:18,914
I got married.

646
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:21,034
Three times.

647
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:24,315
The only good thing that
came out of that was Pete.

648
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:29,636
And your mom wouldn't marry Chuck
for ten years.

649
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:32,595
Another five before you came along.

650
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:36,316
Your dad was so happy to see you.

651
00:32:36,317 --> 00:32:39,836
He nearly died ofjoy.

652
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:42,756
Now you know it all.

653
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:43,997
Do I?

654
00:32:47,117 --> 00:32:49,917
Why did they wait so long
to have me?

655
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:54,677
I guess she couldn't bring herself
to believe he'd never come back.

656
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:56,637
I mean, there was no body.

657
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,797
Everything burnt up.

658
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,478
Is he still trying to
get you to go back?

659
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:06,319
She's not going back, dad.

660
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:10,158
How is the Irish kid, Jimmy?

661
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:10,599
Jimmy?

662
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,959
Oh, jeez!

663
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,878
He's having a ball.

664
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:15,839
Your mom is taking him everywhere.

665
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,239
Oh God, he's a funny little guy.

666
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,239
She doesn't talk much, but,
oh boy, does he make up for it.

667
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,759
She never did have a son.

668
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,199
There you go.

669
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,681
And I guess I was an accident,
right?

670
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,001
Excuse me.

671
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:43,681
"I love you, Chuck. "

672
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:46,161
I never heard her say those words

673
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:47,042
Not once.

674
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:48,721
They had good times together.

675
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:50,801
They made a good couple.

676
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:53,401
They never spoke.

677
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:55,601
They both knew
what was behind that wall...

678
00:33:55,602 --> 00:34:00,162
and they didn't say a damn thing
to each other in 50 years.

679
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,482
Neither did you.

680
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:03,322
Well, we didn't need to.

681
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,322
Everybody needs to talk.

682
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:06,443
No, honey.

683
00:34:06,923 --> 00:34:10,083
Everybody needs to cry.

684
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:11,683
And your mother never did.

685
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:12,964
Not once.

686
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:17,684
You have to forgive her for that.

687
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:23,645
Do you ever wish you had just
pushed in and married mom?

688
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:35,285
Oh, no, don't ask me that, please.

689
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:37,125
Ask me anything you want,

690
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:41,125
but please don't ask me
that question.

691
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:44,205
I was... dead.

692
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:47,045
We all got killed
or maimed all of us

693
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:50,566
and Teddy didn't choose me.

694
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:53,926
And when he got killed,
I knew it was my turn to die next

695
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,646
...and I knew I deserved it!

696
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:58,166
That is not true.

697
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:07,808
They got a new navigator,
just a kid and he screwed up

698
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:09,888
Sorry.

699
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:15,768
It was my fault.

700
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,969
I should have been on that plane.

701
00:35:25,729 --> 00:35:27,568
Hey, Teddy,
how about that dance tonight?

702
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:29,729
Get yourself a new girl?

703
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,369
I got me a girl

704
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,169
Same one every night.

705
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,929
Yeah, but she's a long ways away.

706
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,369
No, si she's right here with me.

707
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,889
Tight squeeze down there.

708
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,291
You mind if I join in?

709
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:51,690
Langford, Langford,
this is F-Fox 338733.

710
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,930
Hell, how low does this cloud go?

711
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:55,690
All the way down,
by the look of it.

712
00:35:55,691 --> 00:35:57,171
You guys see anything?

713
00:35:57,172 --> 00:35:58,771
No, negative, skip.

714
00:35:58,772 --> 00:36:00,571
It's pretty dark out there.

715
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:01,451
Brad, you got a fix?

716
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,691
Well, yeah, kinda.

717
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:06,091
I mean we should be seeing
Belfast right below.

718
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:08,171
Navigator, you got a fix or not?

719
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:10,172
I think one of the beacons is out.

720
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:13,933
It's not making sense right now.

721
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:26,854
Jesus!

722
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:27,894
Jesus!

723
00:36:29,294 --> 00:36:30,053
Bloody hell.

724
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,733
Full flaps.

725
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,733
Full flaps!

726
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,574
Jesus!

727
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:39,615
Jesus Christ!

728
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:54,695
Two hoses,
seven bar pressure!

729
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:55,176
Michael!

730
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,615
Michael Quinlan!

731
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,255
What the devil
are you doing up here?!

732
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:00,935
You'll get yourself killed!

733
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:01,536
Priority!

734
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:02,416
Go!

735
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:04,297
Get down!

736
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:09,096
More tea, love?

737
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:09,937
Jesus!

738
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:11,536
No, thanks, no.

739
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:12,976
Plenty of tea.

740
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,257
He's late.

741
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:17,857
Very, very late.

742
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:19,177
He's not late.

743
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:23,858
Will you just sit down
or something.

744
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:28,777
He's here, Michael!

745
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:31,058
Oh, thank God, he's here!

746
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:32,339
He's here!

747
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:36,499
Granny!

748
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:45,779
Don't be dribbling
on my new shirt, granny.

749
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,540
Jimmy.

750
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,259
Mr Quinlan.

751
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,619
How about you?

752
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,299
Don't shut the door!

753
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,379
We have a guest.

754
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,260
Who?

755
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:05,301
Hello.

756
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:11,501
Is this your first
visit to Belfast?

757
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:13,381
God, I can remember
when there were

758
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:15,141
hundreds of Yanks around here.

759
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:15,902
Yeah.

760
00:38:16,142 --> 00:38:18,261
Lovely people,
we had a great time with them.

761
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,021
I nearly married one of them.

762
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:25,062
He kept saying to me,
"Would you come back to Branagan?".

763
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:26,223
Branagan?

764
00:38:26,463 --> 00:38:27,303
Yes.

765
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:30,022
Then he broke his foot.

766
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:32,142
Then he went back to Branagan.

767
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,582
And I never saw him again

768
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,303
And he was in a fight
truly, a fight over me.

769
00:38:37,304 --> 00:38:39,143
I know you wouldn't believe it now,
but he was.

770
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:41,823
He were gorgeous.

771
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:44,223
I'd have had him, all right.

772
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,664
Jack! Jack Etty.

773
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:52,344
How did you know that?

774
00:38:52,345 --> 00:38:55,624
You mean your Jack?

775
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,704
And my granny?

776
00:38:56,705 --> 00:38:57,584
That's disgusting!

777
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,905
Shut your mouth, young man.

778
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:04,505
So you would have known Teddy?

779
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:07,065
Teddy Gordon?

780
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:08,306
Teddy?

781
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:14,385
You see, I had so many of them

782
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:20,227
Well, no, I mean I knew
an awful lot of them.

783
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,826
Very friendly people.

784
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:23,347
Oh dear.

785
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:27,266
I have photographs somewhere.

786
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:29,586
What are you doing here,
Mrs Harris?

787
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:30,706
That's a rude question!

788
00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:32,507
What a question!

789
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:34,347
It was her idea

790
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:38,187
She just bought a ticket and came.

791
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:39,588
Fantastic.

792
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,229
Dad?

793
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:55,709
Dad?

794
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:56,989
Wake up.

795
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,629
She's gone.

796
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,229
She's gone. She's gone.

797
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,149
Belfast
to look for bits of him.

798
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,391
You're drunk.

799
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:12,911
Yeah.

800
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,670
I have been for some time.

801
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:16,271
Jack.

802
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:18,430
Dad never told her, did he?

803
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,670
That Teddy made him
promise to marry her.

804
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,111
Hell, no.

805
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:25,672
Why not?

806
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:28,311
It's like she had
Teddy's permission.

807
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:29,391
Why didn't you say something?

808
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:33,552
Because it was none
of her god-damn business!

809
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:36,151
You're a coward, dad.

810
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:37,671
And you're a liar.

811
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,832
You lied to Teddy and Chuck,

812
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,272
and worst of
all you lied to yourself.

813
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,112
You've always loved Ethel.

814
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:46,552
Go and get her!

815
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:48,952
Don't be stupid.

816
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:51,793
Oh, for God's sake, Jack,
go and get her.

817
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:54,273
She's your mother.

818
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:56,033
Go get her yourself.

819
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:56,794
No.

820
00:40:56,994 --> 00:40:57,673
You know what,

821
00:40:57,674 --> 00:41:01,394
I have better things
in my life to do.

822
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:06,594
Mr Quinlan
how was it that night?

823
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:10,114
Well, they say it hit
the ground somewhere here.

824
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:13,074
I think this is
where I found it.

825
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:13,715
The ring?

826
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:14,675
Yes.

827
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:16,594
And you're still
finding the pieces?

828
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:17,115
Yes.

829
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:18,276
Lots.

830
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:19,676
A buzzard.

831
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:23,035
He's here all the time, you know.

832
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:26,476
Keeps us company.

833
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,515
How about that.

834
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:31,957
We have them too.

835
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:36,356
Would you say Mrs Harris,

836
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:38,836
I'd like to know would you say,

837
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:45,357
on balance have
you led a happy life?

838
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,917
Well, I have to wait till
it's over and I'll work that out.

839
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:54,278
You're a strange man, Mr Quinlan

840
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:59,398
Do you believe in keeping
promises, Mr Quinlan?

841
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:00,639
Yes.

842
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,118
What about the promises you
make to the dead?

843
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,438
Do they count?

844
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:07,639
Even more.

845
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:10,278
I think promises are stupid.

846
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,239
Why?

847
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,039
Well I promise my granny
I'll wash the dishes.

848
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,000
And I mean to, but I never do.

849
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,200
You're never free of the promises
that you make, you know.

850
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:32,281
Even if you break them,
you're never free of them.

851
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:39,085
It's the German.
It's the bloody Germans!

852
00:43:39,086 --> 00:43:39,885
It's not the Germans, granny.

853
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:41,965
We have to get out of the house!

854
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:43,765
Contact, Pound Street,
one man down.

855
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:44,726
Wait out.

856
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:48,326
Are you all right?

857
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:49,686
I'm so sorry!

858
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:50,966
It's not usually like this here.

859
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:52,526
Belfast is a great place really.

860
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:53,966
Only we have to
get out of here right now.

861
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,686
- Get out? Why? Another bomb?
- There'll be another bomb.

862
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:59,087
There's always a second bomb.
We have to get out! Come on!

863
00:43:59,088 --> 00:43:59,648
Shit!

864
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,767
No pulse, he's a goner!

865
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,607
There's another fucking bomb!

866
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:05,368
Shit!

867
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:06,647
Clear the street!

868
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:08,287
Get everyone out now!

869
00:44:08,288 --> 00:44:08,928
Leave him!

870
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:09,807
We'll pick him up later.

871
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:10,728
Sir.

872
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:12,327
I'm so sorry.

873
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:14,168
I really am.

874
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:15,328
Come on, Mrs Harris.

875
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:16,888
Granny,
don't be bothering with that.

876
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,248
Granny, get out!

877
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:18,689
Come on!

878
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:21,368
Come on, Mrs Harris, quickly.

879
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:21,849
Move!

880
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:22,728
Clear the streets!

881
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:23,408
There's another bomb!

882
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:24,728
Move, move!

883
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:25,169
Come on!

884
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:27,889
Top of the street!

885
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,289
You stupid bitch!

886
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,929
Get out the back door!

887
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,370
Go!

888
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,090
Go!

889
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:40,771
Do not return to your houses!

890
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:44,490
Right, get that cover hose on.

891
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:46,370
Get them behind the wall.

892
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:47,371
Fergus.

893
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:48,291
Fergus?

894
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:49,610
Mr Quinlan.

895
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:51,010
Haven't seen you for a while.

896
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:52,410
I have friends down here.

897
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:53,371
Anyone hurt?

898
00:44:53,372 --> 00:44:55,011
Only that poor squaddie.

899
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:56,731
And they want us to go down there
and get him.

900
00:44:56,732 --> 00:44:59,291
And blow more of us to pieces.

901
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,371
We need to clear this area.

902
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:01,811
Take her in, would you?

903
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:04,732
You're okay.

904
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:19,774
- I know her. No, sir, She's my friend.
- You can't go back. No way.

905
00:45:21,574 --> 00:45:24,093
I told you before,
you can't go down there.

906
00:45:24,094 --> 00:45:25,533
Clear the area immediately!

907
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:29,894
There's another bomb there!
Get out of this street

908
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:35,695
Oh my God.

909
00:45:38,455 --> 00:45:42,375
Clear the area!

910
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,816
Oh God.

911
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,056
Get back here!

912
00:46:04,057 --> 00:46:05,656
What the hell are you doing?

913
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:07,216
Leave me be.

914
00:46:07,217 --> 00:46:10,456
There's something
I have to tell her.

915
00:46:10,457 --> 00:46:11,537
Hold it!

916
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:15,498
That's as far as you're going.

917
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,377
This is Pound Street, sir,
but we can't get through.

918
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:20,497
Oh, this is okay.

919
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:21,337
Thanks. Back!

920
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:22,098
Move back!

921
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:26,058
Get body cover on!

922
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:30,219
Oh God.

923
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:33,818
Oh Holy God!

924
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:35,019
Mr Thomas!

925
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:37,098
Please don't do it!

926
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,739
Mr Thomas!

927
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:41,100
Mr Thomas!

928
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,299
Come on, quick as you can.

929
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,340
Jack?

930
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,980
Jack Etty?

931
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,779
It's Eleanor.

932
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,019
Eleanor Reilly.

933
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,260
Jesus Christ, Eleanor.

934
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:56,340
You must be looking for
Teddy's girl.

935
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:58,100
Yeah, Teddy's girl.

936
00:46:58,101 --> 00:47:01,100
She's over there,
but we've all been evacuated.

937
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:02,140
There's been one bomb,

938
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:06,301
and they're saying
there will be another.

939
00:47:08,102 --> 00:47:11,741
Mr Thomas please.

940
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:15,182
You bloody little eejit!

941
00:47:16,462 --> 00:47:19,661
Get away from here!

942
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:23,383
Are you trying to
get yourself killed?

943
00:47:24,623 --> 00:47:27,862
We knew he'd be up here somewhere.

944
00:47:27,863 --> 00:47:28,903
Yes.

945
00:47:29,423 --> 00:47:32,983
Thank you, Jimmy.

946
00:47:34,744 --> 00:47:35,543
I'm sorry, sir, no further.

947
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:39,624
No, wait a second, please.

948
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:46,143
Mrs Harris?

949
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:48,464
Come slowly away, please.

950
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,264
There's another bomb here.

951
00:47:50,265 --> 00:47:51,185
I know.

952
00:47:51,425 --> 00:47:54,904
You move away, this is none of
your concern, Mr Quinlan.

953
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,104
Yes, it is.

954
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:59,224
Yes, it bloody is.

955
00:47:59,225 --> 00:48:02,145
You might survive, you know that?

956
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:04,345
Just with bits of you blown off.

957
00:48:04,346 --> 00:48:06,905
Arms, legs, eyes.

958
00:48:06,906 --> 00:48:09,665
I've seen it.

959
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,905
Teddy wouldn't like that, now...

960
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:11,506
No.

961
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:14,946
Nice try, Mr Quinlan.

962
00:48:14,947 --> 00:48:16,666
You're a brave man.

963
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:17,747
No.

964
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:21,147
No, I am not.

965
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:25,946
Do you think he looked like this
when he crashed?

966
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:27,348
No

967
00:48:27,668 --> 00:48:31,308
He was alive.

968
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:36,547
I was there.

969
00:48:36,548 --> 00:48:38,787
Help me, please.

970
00:48:38,788 --> 00:48:40,188
Help me!

971
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:41,029
What?

972
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:41,749
Help.

973
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:45,189
Help me, please.

974
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:53,428
Please, kid, take it.

975
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:55,989
Take the ring.

976
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:01,429
Promise me to tell her she's free.

977
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:08,710
Teddy says make her own choice
Ethel Ann.

978
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:11,190
Give her the ring.

979
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:14,510
Promise me.

980
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:15,991
I promise.

981
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:26,991
I didn't take it.

982
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:28,711
I should have found you.

983
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:31,831
Told you what he said.

984
00:49:31,832 --> 00:49:34,472
I looked for it.

985
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:36,552
All my life.

986
00:49:36,553 --> 00:49:38,433
The ring.

987
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:44,513
You were free.

988
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:49,634
He wanted me to tell you that.

989
00:49:49,674 --> 00:49:53,714
I'm so sorry.

990
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:23,076
Goodbye.

991
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:29,237
Ethel.

992
00:50:30,757 --> 00:50:32,357
Please!

993
00:50:32,557 --> 00:50:34,516
We have to go, Mrs Harris.

994
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:36,596
Have to go now.

995
00:50:36,597 --> 00:50:38,157
Come on.

996
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,158
No, no! No!

997
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,759
Have you ever been in love,
Mr Quinlan?

998
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,720
No.

999
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,639
Life is hard enough.

1000
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,240
So, is it possible to
love more than once?

1001
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:23,480
I know I have.

1002
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:26,801
That's for sure.

1003
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,441
We've left it a bit late.

1004
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:39,961
Well, that was my fault.

1005
00:51:39,962 --> 00:51:42,281
According to Marie,
it was my fault.

1006
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:44,081
I don't know why I should
get all the blame.

1007
00:51:44,082 --> 00:51:45,201
Because you're an easy target.

1008
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,281
You're getting too old
and too fat.

1009
00:51:47,282 --> 00:51:49,442
How come none of that
ever happened to you?

1010
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,162
It happened to me.

1011
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:50,963
Look.

1012
00:51:51,163 --> 00:51:54,602
But, if you promise to love
one person and no-one else,

1013
00:51:54,603 --> 00:51:56,682
for ever and ever?

1014
00:51:56,683 --> 00:51:58,602
You can't make promises like that.

1015
00:51:58,603 --> 00:52:00,362
Oh yes, you can.

1016
00:52:00,363 --> 00:52:02,643
You can't keep it.

1017
00:52:02,644 --> 00:52:06,404
Well worth making it, though.

1018
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:17,644
I'd love to fly.

1019
00:52:17,645 --> 00:52:19,764
I'll take you up some time.

1020
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:21,364
Teddy was gonna take me flying.

1021
00:52:21,365 --> 00:52:22,644
He promised.

1022
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:26,644
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy

1023
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:30,805
He was the greatest guy
in the world when he was alive.

1024
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:35,966
But once dead, my God,
what a pain in the ass!

1025
00:52:59,288 --> 00:53:03,328
What's happening to me?

1026
00:53:04,088 --> 00:53:08,408
You're grieving, girl.
