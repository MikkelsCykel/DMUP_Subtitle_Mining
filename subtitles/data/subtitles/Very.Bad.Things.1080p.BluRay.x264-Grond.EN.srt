checks, right?

00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:10,003
yeah,
I think so.

4
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:13,047

you think so?

5
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,050
I mean--what? I mean,
I sent a lot of checks.

6
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,549

I sent them all.

15
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:31,523
uh, honey, the tent?
I don't know about that.

16
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:34,026
you forgot
the tent check?

17
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:35,566
I th--

18
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:38,029
why? why would--
why did you forget
the tent check?

19
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,571
why? I forgot.
I forgot.

20
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,572
you can't play around
with these tent people.

21
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:43,576
you can't. you can't
play around with them.

22
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:44,576
I know. i've been
dealing with them,

23
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,036
and believe me,
i'm not playing with them.

24
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,040
kyle...

25
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,542
I have been
doing all of this
by myself, ok?

26
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,543
I know.
I have been
busting my ass.

27
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,546
I have done absolutely
everything, everything,

28
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:56,547
everything, everything,
everything by myself.

29
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:57,547
I know.

30
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,550
ok, everything has
been on my own, ok?

31
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:02,052
ok, i've been
doing it all.

32
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,053
I bet
you didn't forget

33
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:05,557
the bachelor party
checks.

34
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:10,060
ok...is that what this--
is that what this is about?

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,352
no!

36
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,562
because we could
talk about it.
no!

37
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:13,563
let's go over it
again.
no, no, no.

38
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:14,563
no, it's ok.

39
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,067
no, i'm just saying
that i'm sure

40
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,568
that those checks
found their way
to the mailbox.

41
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:18,569
that's all.

42
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,069
I wouldn't know.

43
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,573
it amazes me, you know,
it really amazes me

44
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,575
how you and your
little fun bunch can
become so organized

45
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,075
when it comes to
mobilizing to vegas.

46
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:27,579
it's not--
it's not me doing it.

47
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:28,579
it's them
handling it all.

48
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,872
and i'm sure that boyd
is the creative force
behind all of this.

49
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:34,583
yeah, boyd--boyd's
organizing the whole thing.

50
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:38,586
robert boyd is a big
sack of hot gas.

51
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:43,090
robert boyd.

52
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,095
tina...great, ok.
here's the deal--

53
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,097
we're talking 5 guys.

54
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:51,100
nice guys, tina.
my friends.

55
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,560
yeah. well,
i'm calling you directly

56
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:56,064
so you don't have
to go through the agency.

57
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:59,024
hey! could you please
not enter the house?

58
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,611
that's correct.
cash straight to you.

59
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:04,071
could you hold on?

60
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,616
could you please
wait off the property?

61
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,074
we're just trying
to sneak a peak.

62
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:11,076
well, just stay off
the property until
i'm off the phone.

63
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:12,038
why?

64
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,581
because that's the way
we do it.

65
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:15,581
chop, chop.

66
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:28,593
so, it's 5 guys,
900 bucks, just dancing.

67
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:30,095
anything else is extra.

68
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,513
are you in?

69
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,098
it's just how I feel.
I feel that, at some
point in time,

70
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,601
you're going to
have to reevaluate
some of your friendships.

71
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,602
well...ok.

72
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,066
specifically--
specifically who?

73
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:42,108
charles moore.

74
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,066
you don't like moore?

75
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:45,611
I just don't see him
in the big picture.

76
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,612
ok...but realize,

77
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:50,614
i've known him since
the third grade.

78
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:51,616
well, he's weird.

79
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,118
he's quiet.

80
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,118
he's weird.

81
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,120
hon, he just
doesn't talk a lot.

82
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:58,123
why? I mean,
is he mildly retarded?

83
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,624
he never speaks!
he's a mechanic.

84
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:02,628
well, he's weird, kyle,
and frankly, I really--

85
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:04,128
i--i expect more
from you.

86
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,130
yeah, ok, wh--
you expect more what?

87
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,592
you are going to be
hung over for 3 days,

88
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:11,595
like those guys
onoprahwho--
who get drunk

89
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,139
and have disgusting sex
with prostitutes,

90
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:15,140
and then they
go ahead, and they
just say their vows.

91
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,142
they say their vows
with the stench

92
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,103
of cheap hotel whore
sex all over them.

93
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:20,103
that's absurd.
listen to yourself.

94
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:21,644
it's vile, kyle.
it's not vile.

95
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:22,644
i've seen it
on television.
i'm not going to--

96
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:23,939
what do you mean
it's not vile?!

97
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,106
i'm not going
to marry you

98
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,649
with the cheap smell
of hotel whore sex--

99
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,650
I am not to be
common, kyle, ok?

100
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:30,112
I am a creature
like no other.

101
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,113
I know that.
I am a creature
like no other.

102
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,155
and I will not--i
willnot be common.

103
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:34,618
do you understand me?
I got you.

104
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,619
is that
too much to ask, kyle?
is it too much to ask?

105
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:38,621
you won't be common!

106
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,165
honey, take it.

107
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,167
are we going to eat,
or am I just going to--

108
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,126
honey...

109
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:47,629
do you love me?

110
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,631
of course i--
I love you.

111
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,631
of course I love you.

112
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:51,675
how much?

113
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,676
I love you
with all my heart.

114
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,178
kiss me.

115
00:04:58,138 --> 00:04:59,640
look, it's just
insecurity.

116
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:02,683
I don't know.
she's just really
been stressing.

117
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,188
it's insecurity,
nut-gnawing
gut-splitters.

118
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:06,688
what does that mean?

119
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,692
it means
she's insecure.

120
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:09,692
about what?

121
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,194
about--


122
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,694
mike berkow.

123
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:14,698
just a second.
all right, big man.

124
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,700
14.3. thank you.
17.5.

125
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:20,202
4-6...29.83...

126
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,702
at 9.

127
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:22,995
look at him.

128
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:24,704
i'm amazed
that the windows

129
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,208
don't blow out of their
fucking sockets

130
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:27,667
with all
the ass-puckering rage

131
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,210
in these
soulless lizards.

132
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,214
you know, I just--
I just want her to be happy.

133
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,589
same alarm clock
every morning,

134
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:34,716
same two pops on
the same snooze button.

135
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:37,803
same shower,
towel, toothbrush,
razor, blazer,

136
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:39,720
hair pump, gel spray.
it's a fucking epi--

137
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:40,720
the beatrice accounts.

138
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:42,224
it's an epidemic,
fisher.

139
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:43,724
you're getting
married, baby bub.

140
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,726
i'm not going
to candy coat it.
it just gets worse.

141
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,227
it's an 18-wheel
cement truck

142
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,731
that's going
to crush every bone
in your big body.

143
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,274
well, i'm not breathing
right lately, either.

144
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:52,816
course you're not.

145
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:55,319
i--i just start getting,
like, lightheaded and dizzy,

146
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:56,778
and then the next
thing I know, I realize

147
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,320
I haven't breathed in,
like--in two minutes.
that's because--

148
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,784
hey, hey, hey--
we're leaving from
my house in 3 hours, ok?

149
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,326
if you want to come,
you better get your
numbers in order by then.

150
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:04,329
all right,
first of all--

151
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:06,789
no "first of all."
i'm not in a game mood, ok?

152
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:08,790
we were having
a conversation, ok?

153
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:09,793
you never said
"excuse me."

154
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,793
i'm sorry.
fisher, i'm sorry.

155
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,793
that's all right.
we'll be there, adam.

156
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,836
I know you'll be ready.

gawky bitch boy.

159
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,845

161
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:25,805
panic junky,
I want to smack him.

162
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,310

163
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,810
kyle fisher.

164
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,312
we've got problems.

165
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,311
problems?

166
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,814
seating problems.

167
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:34,356
ok, well, uh--

168
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:36,817
ok, first they said
it wasunderstood

169
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:39,821
that we were supposed
to have gold-trimmed,
padded seats, right?

170
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,322
and now they're
trying to tell me

171
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:43,323
that there's some sort
of misunderstanding

172
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,826
and that now we can't
have padded ones!

173
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:48,828
ok, so what kind of seats
can we have, then?

174
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,330
nonpadded ones!

175
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,832
so what do
we do about it?

176
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,336
well, you're going
to go down there.

177
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:55,836
go down to where?

178
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:56,837
you're going
to go down,

179
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:57,838
and you're going
to straighten out

180
00:06:57,837 --> 00:06:58,755
those chair people.

181
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:01,343

00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:10,179
israel does not
have a king.

316
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,557
what the hell
do they have?

317
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:13,559
they have
a president--
president yahoo.

318
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,561
ok, i'd say to myself,
"yahoo"...

319
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:17,563
hee hee hee.

320
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:18,689
"take a look
at the map."
yeah?

321
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:20,107
"look what's
all around you.

322
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:23,068
"people who are wishing
horrible, bad, bad things

323
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,610
for you and your people."

324
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,029
the buck's going
to stop right here, buddy.

325
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:30,034
not going to happen
with me.

326
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,536
my kid don't know the 6 fucking
new england states,

327
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,036
he has trouble
with geography,

328
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:37,040
i'm not going to stick that shit
in his face.

329
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,541
i'm going to help
the little guy, you know?

330
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,544
that's right.

331
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:41,045
put him in the car.

332
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,544
take him to maine
for the lobster dinner.

333
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,545
that's how you teach a kid.
go skiing in vermont.

334
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,048
that's it.
take him skiing!

335
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:47,632
or yankee stadium
for a hot dog.

336
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:48,633
that's the way.
you got to--

337
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:51,135
i'm just saying, it's not--
you don't stare him down.

338
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,137
no, don't
stare him down.

339
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,138
i'm not going
to do it!

340
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:56,140
do not...
eyeball your kids.

341
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,644
that's my point exactly!

342
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:58,644
what?
what is your point?

343
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,146
take mexico!

344
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:02,146
think about it.
the mexicans would love it.

345
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:03,607
they're dying for
a little order down there.

346
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:05,609
first of all,
you get what i'm saying.

347
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:06,609
you know exactly
what i'm saying.

348
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:09,613
let the israelis
work it out!

349
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,615
they kind of
all look alike!

350
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,161
the jews
and the mexicans!

351
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,662
so I think, on a whole,
your average joe mexican's

352
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,624
going to have less of a problem
getting his head around

353
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,665
the whole fucking
assimilation thing!
am I right?

354
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:25,126
yeah!

355
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:26,671
I mean, I tell mine--

356
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:29,131
I tell mine
they're little men.

357
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,636
I tell them
that they're strong,

358
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,137
that they
make me feel joy.

359
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,182
I let them know, man.
I mean, I really--

360
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:39,643
I really let them know
that they are just--

361
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:41,644
just as important.
they mean just as much.

362
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:42,644
you know
what i'm saying?
mm-hmm. yes.

363
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:44,646
just as much, man.
yes, yes.

364
00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:46,146
and you're
their godfather.

365
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:47,149
I know,
and i'm honored.

366
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:48,650
no, no, no,
no, no.

367
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:49,901
no? i'm not.

368
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,652
no, no, you're
the godfather,

369
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:53,657
but i'm saying--
what i'm saying is,

370
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:56,116
if anything
ever happens to me--

371
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,158
oh, brother,
don't even--yeah.

372
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,161
don't worry about it.

373
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:03,164
becausethatis
the point here, ok?

374
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,668
that is what
i'm driving for.

375
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,670
because, man,
when the big storm comes

376
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:11,173
and all the forests
are knocked down

377
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:13,132
and all the rocks
have fallen away

378
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,678
and--and the leaves
are bare,

379
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:17,177
what's left?

380
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,182
what is left?

381
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,685
the little trees.

382
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:28,649
the little fellas
that the storm didn't see.

383
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:32,192
the tiny, little fellas.
that's where it's--

384
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:35,194
the stripper's here.

385
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:42,158
excellent.

386
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:44,245
gentlemen,

387
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:47,748

388
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,252

389
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:50,752

393
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,365

394
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,366
I can't do it.

395
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,368
i'm sorry.

398
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,501

00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:11,512
did you win anything?

405
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,016

406
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:15,017

sweet love to you

419
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:46,756

423
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:08,025

475
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,241
all right, all right,
just calm down.

476
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,658
it was
an accident!

477
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:12,201
everybody just
get a hold of themselves,
all right?

478
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:14,622
you are a lying deviant!

479
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:15,664
it was an accident!

480
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:17,164
are you sure--
yes, i'm sure!

481
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,168
what were you doing?

482
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,169
the floor was wet,
and so I slipped.

483
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:21,671
why was
the floor wet?!

484
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,172
I don't know.

485
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,173
why, goddamn it?!

486
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,174
why, you little
fucking pervert?!

487
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:28,135
come on, damn it,
take it easy.

488
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:29,721
you don't
fucking know!

489
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,679
calm down.

490
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:33,599
we're not helping
anything by losing
our temper.

491
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,145
let's just get
our heads together. ok?

492
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:41,189
whatever we associate
in our nervous system
determines our behavior.

493
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:45,860
you fucking guys.
you fucking guys.
you fucking guys.

494
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:47,696
you fucking guys!

495
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:49,656
now let's just
take a second here,

496
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:52,700
and take a hold
of the situation
and review our options.

497
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:53,577
we call the police!

498
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:54,703
ok, call the police,

499
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:55,703
that's good.
that's one option.

500
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:56,706
that is not an option!

501
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:58,207
this is not
multiple choice here.

502
00:21:58,206 --> 00:21:59,666
yes, it is!

503
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:00,664
there are always
options, adam.

504
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:01,665
you fucking guys!

505
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,210
we can definitely
call the police.

506
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:04,669
that's an easy call.

507
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:07,214
now, if we
call the police,
what happens?

508
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:08,716
they come up here,

509
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:10,175
they find
a dead prostitute
in the bathroom,

510
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:12,219
and then they ask us
what happened.

511
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:13,180
what the hell
are you going to
tell them?

512
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,182
you had nothing
to do with it?

513
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:17,183
you didn't know
she was a prostitute?

514
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:18,724
I mean, that it was
all michael here?

515
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:20,186
your brother,
by the way.

516
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:23,188
you don't mess around
with a homicide...

517
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:25,231
what about
the alcohol,
narcotics...

518
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:27,692
don't tell me
there are no options.

519
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,235
there are always
fucking options.

520
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:30,696
what is the choice?
what options?

521
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:39,703
we can bury her
out in the desert.

522
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,704
oh, sure, why not?

523
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:43,708
no, no,
he's right, he's right.

524
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,210
he's right.
he's right.

525
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,752
we could take
her up to red rock.

526
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:48,214
find some nice
quiet place

527
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:49,756
and just put her
in the ground.

528
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,757
we can do this.
we can get her
out of here.

529
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,761
have you lost
your fucking mind?

530
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,220
nobody knows
she's here.

531
00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:57,720
I called her personally.
nobody knows.

532
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,724
her blood is
all over the bathroom.

533
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:02,725
don't you think we
got a little bit of
a dna problem here?

534
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,728
it's a marble floor.
we can clean it up.

535
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:06,729
they've got
us on accessory
to murder, adam.

536
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:09,231
it's not accessory, ok?
I didn't do shit.

537
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,735
that's not
the point, adam.

538
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:13,237
I mean, the room is
covered with blow,

539
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:15,737
moore looks like
he went at it with
a fucking mountain lion.

540
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:18,741
I mean, the room looks
like the manson family
stayed here a month.

541
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,702
this is a major
thin-ice situation
we got here.

542
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:23,246
i'm getting
married, guys.

543
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:27,249
I have got a wife,
and i've got two boys, ok?
don't tell me.

544
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,254
let's just take
a vote, a simple vote.

545
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:33,255
we got two choices:

546
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:35,757
one, we clean up
this mess right now,

547
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,761
bury it out
in the desert,

548
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,220
go home,
and never look back.

549
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,223
or, we can easily
call the police,

550
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:44,810
roll the dice,
take our chances,

551
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,313
and pray to god
that it's only
michael who falls.

552
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:51,733
the choices are simple:
it's desert or police.

553
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:57,320
desert.

554
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,325
the fucking desert.

555
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:03,742
uh-uh.

556
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:04,829
fish,

557
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:09,499
I owe you, bro.
I owe you, man.

558
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:13,836
desert.

559
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:19,842
nobody knows
she's here.

560
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:23,680
oh, god...
oh, god.

561
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:36,025
how do we get her
out of here?

562
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:43,865
we can wrap her up
in blankets,

563
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,870
bring the car
around to the back
of the hotel,

564
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:48,868
lower her gently down
off the balcony,

565
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,872
put her in the car.
we're done.

566
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,873
jesus christ,
have you done this before?

567
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:58,879
the reality is,
you take away the horror
of the situation,

568
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:00,880
take away the tragedy
of the death,

569
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,885
take away the moral
and ethical implications

570
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:06,887
of all the crap
that you've had
conditioned and beaten

571
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:08,889
into your head
since grade one,

572
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:10,391
what are we left with?

573
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,891
what?

574
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:14,853
it's
a 105-pound problem.

575
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:19,357
105 pounds that's
got to be moved from
point "a" to point "b."

576
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:23,404
now, a straight line is
the shortest distance
between two points,

577
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:26,364
but we're denied
the luxury of a visible
straight line,

578
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:28,907
but that line exists,
and I see it.

579
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,327
I see that line.

580
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:33,913
trust me.

581
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,375
adam, trust me.

582
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:43,382
hotel security.
could you please
open the door?

583
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:44,881
oh, fuck.

584
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,888
hello?
hotel security.

585
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,891
what do they want?

586
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:57,855
shit.

587
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:00,397
oh, fuck.

588
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:01,691
they know.

589
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,692
calm down.

590
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,859
hello?

591
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,402
goddamn it, they know!

592
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:06,402
tell them right now!

593
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:07,906
just keep
your voice down.

594
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:11,908
they have cameras
in the ceiling.

595
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,411
shut up!

596
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,912
shh-shh.

597
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:17,915
we don't have time.
shut up. shut up.

598
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:18,917
shh.

599
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,376
he's gone.

600
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,924
he's gone.

601
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:34,764
hello?

602
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,267
hotel security.

603
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:39,726
hi, how are you?

604
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:41,729
y'all didn't
hear me knocking?

605
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,231
no,
we heard you.

606
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,733
mmm, yeah. you guys
making a lot of
noise tonight.

607
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:50,737
what is it,
a toga party?

608
00:26:54,242 --> 00:26:56,244
it's a bachelor party.

609
00:26:56,242 --> 00:26:58,244
well, y'all
going to have to
keep it down.

610
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:02,249
well, we will. we will.
we absolutely will.

611
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:04,252
listen,
we're very, very sorry,
we apologize.

612
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:05,794
we've been partying
a little hard,

613
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:09,255
but we're all getting
ready to go to sleep.

614
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:13,301
mmm-mmm.

615
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:18,222
well, this is going
to be a problem.

616
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,764
someone's going to
have to pay.

617
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:21,769
yeah, we're going to
take care of that first
thing in the morning.

618
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:22,769
yeah, you will.

619
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,771
what the hell gets
into you people?

620
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:27,774
drugs and alcohol.

621
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,780
well, I got
no problem with that.

622
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,780
dr. bigbucks.

623
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,284
hey,
how about a beer?

624
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,285
no. maybe
some other time.

625
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,789
listen,
we're very, very sorry,
we apologize.

626
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,290
we didn't mean any
disrespect to the hotel.

627
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,790
we're very sorry.

628
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,753
hey, hey,
don't worry about it.
don't worry about it at all.

629
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:49,795
just as long as
you keep it down.

630
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,298
what the fuck is that?

631
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,349
sir, please,
before you go in there,

632
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,769
I just want to explain.

633
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,770
can I talk to you
one second, please?

634
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,771
d-d-don't go
in there yet.

635
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,358
we were calling 9-1-1
right when you came,
I swear to god.

636
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,359
this is not
what it looks like.

637
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,865
go in there
and put your fucking pants on.

638
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,866
i'm not going to put
my pants back on.

639
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,329
no, you get dressed.
goddamn it, i'll handle this.

640
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,871
just get back.
just get back.

641
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,872
everybody just get--
just move back.

642
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:29,834
the floor was wet.
she completely slipped.

643
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:32,834
get me a phone.
just get me a telephone.

644
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,379
back up, back up!
he wants us to back up.

645
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:37,380
I want everybody
just to move back.

646
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,842
just take your
fucking hands off me!

647
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,559
clear a path!

648
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,899
don't let him bleed
on the carpet!

649
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,901
go on! get out!
get out!

650
00:28:58,401 --> 00:28:59,402
shut the door!

651
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:02,907
come over here!
help me!

652
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,408
jesus! oh, shit!

653
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:05,909
son of a bitch!

654
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:08,912
he'll bleed out.
he'll bleed out!

655
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:11,956
oh, my god!

656
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,459
you motherfuckers!

657
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,962
all right,
he'll bleed out.
he'll bleed out.

658
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,966
oh, die!

659
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,476
think anybody--

660
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:34,979
die!

661
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,981
die, you son
of a bitch!

662
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:10,472
it's all right.

663
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:14,476
come on.

664
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,520
come on.

665
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:27,029
bingo.

666
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:45,046
new plan.

667
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:48,050
no, no,

668
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,009
not so much of
a new plan

669
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,551
as a modification
on the old one.

670
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:51,554
i'm calling the police.

671
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,056
so help me god,
you touch that
fucking phone,

672
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:55,557
i'll bury you
with them.

673
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:58,559
surrender is
no longer an option.

674
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,062
I repeat, it is
not an option.

675
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:04,523
is there anyone
here who does not
understand that?

676
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:07,069
little gut check
time, fellas.

677
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:11,074
time for some serious
self-exploration.

678
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:12,574
how do I function?

679
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:15,578
for real,
no more bullshit.

680
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:19,579
can I keep my cool
when they bounce my bananas,

681
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,876
when they won't play my song,
et cetera, et cetera?

682
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:26,045
you get me?

683
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:27,587
do you get me?

684
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,047
not really, no.

685
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:31,552
that's not a problem.

686
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:36,055
understand not my words,
but follow my orders.

687
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:40,559
follow my orders.

688
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:47,566
let me be
the success coach.

689
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,741
wait a minute.

690
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:51,242
wait a minute.

691
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:52,745
wait, wait, wait, wait.

692
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,246
what?
we can't do this.

693
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:56,206
we've already
done this.

694
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,751
no, no, I mean
the suitcases.

695
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,752
we can't
bury them like this
in the suitcases.

696
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:01,751
why not?

697
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:05,256
because it's sacrilegious.

698
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:06,757
how do you figure?

699
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:09,719
according to jewish law,
the blood and the limbs

700
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,264
are considered to be
a sacred part of
the human spirit.

701
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:18,728
the body has to be united,
or the soul can't
rest in peace.

702
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:19,771
what the hell?
that's what
we're doing.

703
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,773
no, no, it's not.
we got their parts
all mixed together.

704
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:24,774
we can't do this
to them.

705
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:27,236
she's asian.
they don't have jews
in asia.

706
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:28,779
that is absolutely
not true.

707
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:31,572
michael, do they
have jews in asia?

708
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:33,242
huh?

709
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,784
they have--
yes, they do.

710
00:35:34,786 --> 00:35:37,288
they have jews in asia.
he is correct.

711
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:39,747
what the fuck are
we supposed to do?

712
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,294
we're going to have to
open up the suitcases.

713
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:44,294
we're going to
unpack the bodies

714
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:45,795
and reunite
the appropriate limbs.

715
00:35:45,797 --> 00:35:46,756
no fucking way!

716
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:48,048
that's what
we're going to do!

717
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,049
no fucking way!

718
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:49,883
we have to do this,
goddamn it!

719
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:51,801
adam, we got
to get going.

720
00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:53,221
the sun's coming up.
come on!

721
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,305
I am not flexible
on this.

722
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,357
let's do it.

723
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,322
i've got her head.

724
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:16,325
this is her head.

725
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,326
I got a combo situation.

726
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:19,827
do you have
any of him?

727
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,831
I have--that's her.

728
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:25,833
watch your step,
all right.

729
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:27,336
hey! hey!

730
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,338
i've got a mop.

731
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:33,341
just open
the fucking bags up!

732
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:34,341
adam, heads up.

733
00:36:34,674 --> 00:36:36,342
jesus christ!

734
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,347
don't just toss
it around, goddamn it!

735
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,348
show a little
fucking respect!

736
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,850
I have her lower leg.

737
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,854
ok, I have his upper leg
and her lower leg.

738
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,855
I have his upper leg
and her lower ,

739
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:49,859
leg and they don't
go together!

740
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:51,316
how do we
get started, adam?

741
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:53,317
look, if you
don't want to do it,
just sit the fuck down!

742
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:55,946
great fucking idea!
everybody's losing
their goddamned minds!

743
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:57,322
is this her stuff here?

744
00:36:57,321 --> 00:36:58,822
that's her!
that's him!

745
00:36:58,824 --> 00:36:59,825
all right,
let's do this.

746
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:03,369
all right,
somebody get his torso,
find his torso.

747
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,828
forget the head,
we'll just start.

748
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,374
we got the head.

749
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:09,376
we'll start
with black, then we'll go
to the asian, all right?

750
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:10,377
we're going to
make you very happy.

751
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:11,836
ok, you don't
do nothing.

752
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:13,338
I got toes!

753
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:14,339
ok, relax.

754
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:16,673
I got toes.
I have somebody's
toes.

755
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:32,855
ok?

756
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:39,865
all right.

757
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:59,882
allow me to be
the first to say

758
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:04,389
that what we have done here
is not a good thing.

759
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:06,888
it's clearly not
a good thing,

760
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:10,351
but it was, given
the circumstances,
the smart play.

761
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,356
i'm proud of us.

762
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,405
I am proud of each
and every one of us.

763
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,407
it's going
to be ok.

764
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,869
we performed
under the most complex

765
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:32,415
and nerve-shattering
of situations.

766
00:38:32,414 --> 00:38:36,877
I mean, each one
of us stood fast,
and we all delivered.

767
00:38:36,878 --> 00:38:39,380
I feel proud.

768
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:42,383
we're going to hell...

769
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:45,926
hell or prison,
whichever comes first.

770
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:48,929
that's wrong.
that is flat-out
wrong, adam.

771
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:51,389
you got to change
your associations.

772
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,893
hell is for cowards,
for hypocrites,

773
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:58,396
for people who fear
to live by the strength
of their own conviction.

774
00:38:58,899 --> 00:38:59,900
now, this is war!

775
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,901
given the circumstances
and given the fact

776
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:05,404
that we are alive
and they are not,

777
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:07,405
we've all chosen
life over death.

778
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,910
I mean, two wrongs
don't make a right,

779
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:11,410
so our conviction
and execution

780
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:13,411
would only mean
more death here,
not less.

781
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:14,914
I don't know, boyd.

782
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:18,876
just seems to me
ever since you started
this personal growth,

783
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:22,420
self-help, power
fucking dysfunctional
fucking bullshit,

784
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:24,922
you are all fucked up
in the head!

785
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:26,425
don't even go there.

786
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:29,428
you don't know
what the hell you're
talking about, all right?

787
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,932
personal strength has
nothing to do with this.

788
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:34,934
true, it's helped me
to unlock energies and see
my options more clearly,

789
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:37,395
but to give it credit
for all of this

790
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:39,937
is a little bit more
than they deserve.

791
00:39:41,939 --> 00:39:46,401
don't you think
we ought to say some
words over the bodies?

792
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:50,447
what kind of words?

793
00:39:50,446 --> 00:39:53,282
like a...a prayer.

794
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:57,578
go ahead.

795
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:08,256
dear god...

796
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:14,262
I don't fucking
know how to pray.

797
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:15,806
say what's
on your mind.

798
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:17,765
speak from the heart.
let it flow.

799
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:21,770
dear god...

800
00:40:24,274 --> 00:40:25,275
this is pathetic.

801
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:26,317
you're pathetic.

802
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:28,318
what did you say?

803
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:29,735
you're not a team player.

804
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:30,778
don't point at me.

805
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,781
you've never been
a team player.

806
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,282
that's why you don't
have any friends.

807
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,281
what are you
talking about?
I have friends.

808
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,781
the hell you do.

809
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:36,784
the hell
I don't.

810
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:38,286
you have
acquaintances.

811
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:40,287
business friends,
superficial
golf buddies.

812
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:41,287
you've always been
a fringe player.

813
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:42,790
don't point at me.

814
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,791
you have some
serious male-on-male
intimacy problems.

815
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:45,792
what are you fucking
talking about?

816
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,293
you can't deal
with men!

817
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:49,756
guys, maybe now is
not the time for this.

818
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:51,299
come on, fisher,
this is the perfect time.

819
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:53,299
this is the real time.
we're in the moment.

820
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,802
adam, your brother
and myself

821
00:40:55,802 --> 00:40:57,304
as well as several
others present

822
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:58,764
have always felt
that you were

823
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:03,269
a fully repressed,
living-in-major-denial,
lock-down flyboy.

824
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:06,771
what?

825
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:09,274
fire in the hole,
big guy.

826
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:11,277
what?

827
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:15,738
dear god, please forgive us for
what we've done here tonight.

828
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,283
we've lost our way.

829
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,784
speaking for myself,

830
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:23,787
I am deeply in
love with the woman
i'm about to marry,

831
00:41:23,788 --> 00:41:27,250
and I am very much
looking forward
to raising a family

832
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,252
and being a positive
member of society.

833
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,252
we promise,
if you forgive us,

834
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:34,298
that we will never forget
this tragedy

835
00:41:34,797 --> 00:41:36,799
and we will try
with all our power

836
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,303
to use it as
a daily reminder

837
00:41:39,802 --> 00:41:42,805
that we are on
this earth to do
good, not evil.

838
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:46,311
let us move from
this day forward with
new spirit and purpose.

839
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,311
you have given us
a second chance,

840
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:50,356
so let us take
that second chance

841
00:41:50,813 --> 00:41:52,357
and use it to fuel
our fires of productivity

842
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:56,318
so that the spirits
of the two people that
we buried here tonight

843
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,822
can forever live on
in our good deeds
and positive achievements

844
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:03,869
that we, from this day forward,
shall make our lives' work.

845
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:06,328
thank you, god,
and once again,

846
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:10,833
please give us your guidance
and your forgiveness. amen.

847
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,151
hello?

848
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:23,610
it's me.

849
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:25,155
hey!

850
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:27,615
i'm on the road.
we're running
a little late.

851
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,616
really? how late?

852
00:43:29,825 --> 00:43:31,118
um...like an hour.

853
00:43:31,118 --> 00:43:33,704
honey, did you check
on the chairs?

854
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,707
what?

855
00:43:34,707 --> 00:43:37,126
did you check
on the chairs?
ok.

856
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:39,169
okwhat?
what?

857
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:40,627
what. yeah.
what about the chairs?

858
00:43:41,128 --> 00:43:43,130
I left a message.
everything's
going to be ok.

859
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:45,673
yeah? you sound
a little funny, honey.

860
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:47,677
did you do the cocaine
last night?

861
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:49,178
um...nope.

862
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:52,680
i'm gonna be home
in, like, 4 hours,
ok, hon?

863
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:54,683
did you have fun?

864
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:56,184
was it fun, honey?

865
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,688
you think
he had kids?

866
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:00,188
what?

867
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:01,188
children.

868
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:04,694
do you think that man
was a father?

869
00:44:04,693 --> 00:44:06,654
I don't know.

870
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,655
I got a really bad
feeling...

871
00:44:09,198 --> 00:44:11,200
that he had children.

872
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,204
I don't know.
I think he was too young
to have children.

873
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:18,705
we're gonna burn
for this.

874
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,682
come on, guys.
daddy's home.
let's go. adam jr.

875
00:44:36,682 --> 00:44:39,685
where did you go, dad?

876
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:42,228
today is the beginning
of the rest of our lives.

877
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:43,689
hi, daddy!

878
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:45,691
oh...

879
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:47,692
honey! honey,
we have to go.

880
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:49,695
my soccer game's
today.

881
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:51,697
you were gonna drive
me and my friends.
you have to.

882
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,741
nobody says anything
to anybody...ever.

883
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:54,740
we're late.

884
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,200
right?

885
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:57,951
let's go.

886
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:01,748
the idea is to be able to,
like, look at everybody

887
00:45:01,747 --> 00:45:03,708
and know that they're all
in the same wedding, right?

888
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,212
I mean, I just want to
make sure that everything's
sort of pressed.

889
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:08,714
I don't want to look
like it's been hanging
on a hanger all the time.

890
00:45:08,715 --> 00:45:10,717
I want everything
to be, like...

891
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:13,260
I just want them to all
look like they're just...
you know, clean.

892
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:15,259
here, let me...

893
00:45:15,261 --> 00:45:19,223
let me help--
i'll help you with that.
your nails are filthy.

894
00:45:19,221 --> 00:45:21,724
I don't care--
like, just for the day,

895
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:24,227
all I ask is that
they're clean for the day.

896
00:45:24,226 --> 00:45:26,729
after that, I don't care
what happens, ok?

897
00:45:26,814 --> 00:45:27,690
ok.

898
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,733
hi, boyd.
hey.

899
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:32,236
ok, um, basically...
are you gonna stand
like this?

900
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:36,239
i'll stand any way
you would like me
to stand.

901
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:39,242
michael...

902
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:41,244
mike--what is--
what happened here?

903
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:44,747
he gave me a collar
center because I have
an irregular size.

904
00:45:44,748 --> 00:45:45,749
an irreg--

905
00:45:45,749 --> 00:45:48,710
i'm in between sizes.
my neck is wide, and...

906
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:50,212
this looks like
it hurts.
it does.

907
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:51,754
does it hurt?
yeah. I can't
really breathe.

908
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:54,255
is this your shirt?
did you bring this,
or is this theirs?

909
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:57,636
it's theirs.
ok, well, this is just
totally unacceptable.

910
00:45:57,635 --> 00:45:59,720
how are you feeling?
put your arms down.

911
00:45:59,722 --> 00:46:03,476
if you can just take it in
on the sides right here...
right here. right here.

912
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:11,730
he's got two kids,
goddamn it,
just like I said!

913
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:13,233
two fucking kids,
goddamn it!

914
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:18,238
calm the fuck down!
let's move on past
the fucking blaming shit.

915
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:19,781
ok, now, where'd
you get this?

916
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,782
at the newsstand
on third.

917
00:46:21,785 --> 00:46:23,787
fucking boyd,
that fucking idiot!

918
00:46:23,786 --> 00:46:26,747
goddamn it,
they're onto us!
they're not onto us.

919
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,293
boyd, did you read
the paper?

920
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,754
is that him?
is that him?
give me that!

921
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:35,296
goddamn it, calm down.

922
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:38,758
boyd, you fucking idiot!
this shit is coming down, man!

923
00:46:39,217 --> 00:46:40,260
that's just nothing.

924
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,762
that's just a stupid
missing persons thing,
that's all.

925
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:43,929
you got us into this mess!

926
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:45,765
I did?
from what I remember,

927
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,766
it was your rat-fuck
brother that decided
to play chop suey

928
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:49,767
with the hooker's
fucking head.

929
00:46:49,895 --> 00:46:51,272
will you shut up?!
calm down.

930
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:53,481
shut up! these fucking
phones aren't secure,
goddamn it!

931
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,275
just lighten up,
would you, please,
adam? all right?

932
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:58,778
just show some
character. walk through
some fucking fear.

933
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:00,279
don't talk to me
about character, pal.

934
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:02,283
watch the tone,
fella, ok?

935
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:03,283
fuck you, boyd!
give me the phone.

936
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:06,284
fuck you, too,
snake-eyes,
cocksucker!

937
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:07,786
fuck you!
shut up. boyd?

938
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:09,787
they have my credit card
imprint, you know that?

939
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,288
he hung up, goddamn it!

940
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,292
fucking asshole!

941
00:47:13,374 --> 00:47:14,792
fucking...

942
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:17,879
look what you did,
goddamn it!
look what you did!

943
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,383
refocus...your mind!

944
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:25,886
control...
your...fear!

945
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:34,396

00:47:36,397 --> 00:47:37,398
they're making me nuts!

948
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:38,899
no, they're singing.

949
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:40,402
it's a disgusting song.

950
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,902
well, you taught it
to them.

951
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,321
guys! guys, be quiet.

952
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:49,328
your daddy's in
a really, really bad mood,
and if you're really good,

953
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:51,828

00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:11,030

00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,533
they are screaming
like monsters.

981
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,536

00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,055
where are the whizzers?

1007
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:23,059
they didn't have
any whizzers.

1008
00:50:23,058 --> 00:50:25,060
what do you mean,
they don't have
any whizzers?

1009
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:27,061
they didn't have any
fucking whizzers, ok?!

1010
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:28,063
what are you doing?!

1011
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,523

goddamn problem?

1012
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:31,648

1014
00:50:38,032 --> 00:50:39,575
oh, oh...

1015
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:43,577
nice to see you.

1016
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:45,039
oh, my god!

1017
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,540
you look so beautiful!
I love that dress.

1018
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,043
oh, my god...
have you seen amanda?
oh, my god, come here.

1019
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:54,087
she's wearing the same
exact dress she wore
to heidi's wedding.

1020
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:55,089
i'm losing it, fish.

1021
00:50:55,547 --> 00:50:57,090
hey, now--
how's it going?

1022
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,551
nice to see you.
nice to see you.

1023
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:02,055
I got a migraine like
a fucking monkey kicking
in the side of my--

1024
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:05,057
I get you, I get you.
hi. hi, cynthia.
nice to see you.

1025
00:51:05,057 --> 00:51:06,559
hi, mr. and mrs. wilshire.

1026
00:51:06,558 --> 00:51:07,559
fish. fish--

1027
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,561
i'm sorry,
i'm not myself.

1028
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,061
just, please, not now.

1029
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:12,565
where's
the bathroom?

1030
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:14,065
it's just past--
where's the fucking
bathroom?!

1031
00:51:14,065 --> 00:51:15,567
it's past the bar!
excuse me.

1032
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:22,615
here's a picture
of kyle, age 4,

1033
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:26,119
and his good friend,
jo-jo the mule.

1034
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:28,619
now...

1035
00:51:28,913 --> 00:51:31,624
evidently,
when they got to camp,

1036
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:35,127
kyle and boyd over there
had some serious arguments.

1037
00:51:35,503 --> 00:51:36,629
try and get me
in the mouth.

1038
00:51:36,629 --> 00:51:37,630
shh.

1039
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:40,132
mr. fisher: ...who exactly
was kyle's best friend,

1040
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:42,135
boyd or the mule?

1041
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,136
well,
fish had a less than
normal relationship

1042
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:46,597
with that ass.

1043
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:50,600
you're
just jealous, boyd.

1044
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:53,145
well, be that as it may,

1045
00:51:53,394 --> 00:51:56,147
after camp came football,

1046
00:51:56,648 --> 00:51:58,108
and for those of you

1047
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:01,570
who didn't follow
the sports pages back in 1977,

1048
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,073
you might not remember
the peewee powerhouse
of oklahoma,

1049
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:08,158
who, under the leadership
of yours truly,

1050
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:13,164
managed to roll to
an auspicious league record
of 0 for 12...

1051
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:18,711
scoring exactly
not one damn touchdown.

1052
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:24,381
where are you going?

1053
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:25,927
oh...ho ho!

1054
00:52:25,927 --> 00:52:28,930
he was a husky kid then,
and he's a husky kid now...

1055
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:31,225
whose great talent
was persistence.

1056
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,934
they showed up.

1057
00:52:34,394 --> 00:52:37,898
they didn't score much.
they didn't score at all.

1058
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:39,897
ha ha! but they showed up.

1059
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,402
so...now i'd like
to propose my toast...

1060
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,863
to the groom and...
his wonderful bride.

1061
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:50,907
god bless.

1062
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:51,911
god bless.

1063
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:53,412
god bless.

1064
00:52:54,913 --> 00:52:56,915
adam,
what's wrong, man?

1065
00:52:58,415 --> 00:53:00,417
I can't--
I can't fucking breathe.

1066
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:01,876
what's wrong?

1067
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:03,419
fish, i'm sorry.
ok!

1068
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:04,881
you're freaking me
out, brother.

1069
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,924
that was definitely
not cool--definitely
inappropriate behavior.

1070
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:08,424
just shut up
for a second.

1071
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:10,428
negative!
this is not what
you've worked out

1072
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:11,929
in terms of
self-management
here, adam.

1073
00:53:11,928 --> 00:53:13,429
come on!
pull it together.

1074
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:14,933
he's having
some kind
of problem?

1075
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:16,432
what's the problem,
adam?

1076
00:53:16,432 --> 00:53:18,935
what is
the fucking
problem, huh?

1077
00:53:18,937 --> 00:53:20,438
come on.

1078
00:53:20,521 --> 00:53:22,940
I just--i just--
we're gonna get caught.

1079
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,441
we're not gonna
get caught.

1080
00:53:24,442 --> 00:53:25,944
I know we're gonna
get caught.

1081
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:27,444
they're eyeballing
my minivan.

1082
00:53:27,444 --> 00:53:28,946
who?
what?

1083
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:30,488
at the minimart.

1084
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,492
what the hell are
you talking about?

1085
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:33,951
they're
smoking me out!
who's smoking you out?

1086
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,951
nobody is
smoking you out!

1087
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:36,953
shut up!

1088
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:37,953
kyle!

1089
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,496
yeah? what, hon?

1090
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:40,497
honey...
yeah?

1091
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:41,956

1092
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,459
yeah, everything's fine.

1093
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:46,461
ok. can we go
back inside?

1094
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,004
yeah. sure.

1095
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:51,469
honey,now.now.

1096
00:53:51,466 --> 00:53:53,468
I just have these...
um, we have these...

1097
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,972
yeah, we got, uh...
groomsmen's last-minute
preparations to make.

1098
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:58,474
we've got a rehearsal
dinner going on inside.

1099
00:53:58,475 --> 00:53:59,976
dad, everything's
fine, ok?

1100
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:01,977
i'm in the middle
of my goddamn toast
in there!

1101

1165
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:13,020

1168
00:56:16,565 --> 00:56:19,026
I am definitely
not cool!

1169
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:22,570

family in there.

1174
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:35,081
just get it
the fuck over with.

1175
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:51,014

1176
00:56:56,061 --> 00:56:58,563

1178
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:07,572

my minivan!

1179
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:09,576
don't you dare!

1180
00:57:09,575 --> 00:57:11,577
hey, hey, hey--
my god!

1181
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,082
aah!
fucking christ!

1182
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,082
oh...

1183
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:20,083
oh...

1184
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:23,087
so it was some sort
of accident?

1185
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:25,088
yeah. he, uh...
he didn't realize.

1186
00:57:25,548 --> 00:57:27,591
I guess he just lost
control of the car.

1187
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,593
was there some sort
of argument?

1188
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:31,097
no, nothing like that.

1189
00:57:31,304 --> 00:57:33,598
we heard there was
some arguing going on.

1190
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:36,101
what, some kind of
sibling muscle-flex thing?

1191
00:57:36,434 --> 00:57:39,062
no, no, no.
they love each other.

1192
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:42,605
just, uh...we were
all just outside,
just talking.

1193
00:57:43,023 --> 00:57:44,608
we were just talking.

1194
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:47,111
what were you
talking about?

1195
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:49,613
uh, the wedding...

1196
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:51,115
married...wedding...

1197
00:57:51,322 --> 00:57:53,116
yeah, how it's probably
going to be the last time

1198
00:57:53,575 --> 00:57:55,577
for all of us
to be together...
to see each other...

1199
00:57:55,577 --> 00:57:57,579
before he gets married.
married. i'm
getting married.

1200
00:57:57,873 --> 00:58:00,125
a lot of people seem
to think there was
some hostility.

1201
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:01,584
unh!

1202
00:58:03,128 --> 00:58:04,588
how the fuck am i
supposed to comment

1203
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:06,088
on what a lot of other
people thought, huh?

1204
00:58:06,088 --> 00:58:07,631
I mean, listen,

1205
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,632
we've all suffered
an incredible trauma
here,

1206
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:12,637
and we're in full-on
grieving mode right now,

1207
00:58:12,634 --> 00:58:15,095
and your questions
are just a little bit
poorly timed.

1208
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:18,098
do you understand?
thank you very much,
officer randone.

1209
00:58:18,098 --> 00:58:19,099
easy, boyd.

1210
00:58:19,098 --> 00:58:21,100
no "easy boyd."
don't give me that shit.

1211
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:23,604
I got a friend in there
in pieces, for god's sakes.

1212
00:58:23,895 --> 00:58:26,105
how about a little
sensitivity, huh?

1213
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:31,613
there was no fighting
going on or nothing.
yeah.

1214
00:58:32,071 --> 00:58:33,615
unh, unh, unh!

1215
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:36,116

that guy's name?

1216
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:37,619

1217
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,119

is critical.

1220
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:46,127
he's, uh...asking
to speak to his wife.

1221
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:47,627
yes?

1222
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:52,592
it's bad. I just want
to warn you of what
you're going to see...

1223
00:58:53,676 --> 00:58:55,178

he's got nothing
left in his heart.

1231
00:59:31,502 --> 00:59:33,170
i'm gonna call it.

1232
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:34,715
time of death,
11:58 p.m.

1233
00:59:34,714 --> 00:59:36,716
i'm very sorry.

1234
00:59:36,715 --> 00:59:38,175

what are you
walking away for?

1239
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,687
what are you
walking away for?

1240
00:59:52,732 --> 00:59:55,193
the need to know is clear:

1241
00:59:55,194 --> 00:59:58,698

1242

1256
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:56,044

and you're
a murderer, ok?

1257
01:00:56,045 --> 01:00:58,547
you kill all,
and you are god.

1258
01:00:58,544 --> 01:01:01,005
ok, just take it easy.
I killed my--

1259
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:02,547

1261
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:06,511
aah!

1262
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,011
aah! unh!

1263
01:01:08,513 --> 01:01:10,014

1264
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:12,517
the memory of
the just is blessed,

1265
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:14,521
while the name
of the wicked

1267

the evil that men do
lives after us.

1268
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,067
easy.

1269
01:01:20,566 --> 01:01:22,068
get off me!

1270
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:25,071
the memory of
the just is blessed,
while the name--

1271
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:26,572
pick him up.

1272
01:01:26,572 --> 01:01:29,575
it's time
to confess your sins!
confess our sins!

1273
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:31,578
keep your voice
down, michael.

1274
01:01:31,577 --> 01:01:33,079
open the door!

1275
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:34,664
just shut your face!

1276
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:36,123
get in the car!

1277
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:38,125
get in there.

1278
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,627
the memory of the just
is blessed,

1279
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:43,132
while the name of
the wicked shall rot!

1280
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:44,132
michael! michael!

1281
01:01:44,132 --> 01:01:46,134
you will control
your conditioned
response.

1282
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,137
you will
pull yourself
together, mister!

1283
01:01:48,136 --> 01:01:50,096
all right!
are you hearing me?

1284
01:01:50,095 --> 01:01:51,096
yes.

1285
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:52,639
jesus.
he's cracked up.

1286
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:55,644
i'm not cracking up!
he is not
cracking up!

1287
01:01:58,061 --> 01:01:59,479
what have we done?

1288
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:01,647
what did you ask me?

1289
01:02:02,147 --> 01:02:03,606
I said,
what have we done?

1290
01:02:06,152 --> 01:02:08,612
yes, you did. now,
that is the question.

1291
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:12,160
that is exactly
the question we should
be asking ourselves.

1292
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,662
"what have we done?"
why don't you tell us.
what have we done?

1293
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:18,664
I just want
to get married.
exactly!

1294
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:20,665
exactly my point.
what's your
fucking point?

1295
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,668
i'm not talking
to you, moore.

1296
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:25,671
what's your point?!
what's your point?!

1297
01:02:27,673 --> 01:02:30,634
you want to know
what you're doing here?

1298
01:02:30,635 --> 01:02:32,679
you are love-pumping.

1299
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:37,640
you are protecting
all that is sacred
and beautiful

1300
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:41,187
and in sync with poetry
and sunsets

1301
01:02:41,186 --> 01:02:43,188
and little
newborn babies.

1302
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:45,149
you're walking the walk.

1303
01:02:45,566 --> 01:02:48,110
this is it, fisher--
the real stuff.

1304
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:50,155
you love this woman,

1305
01:02:50,402 --> 01:02:54,698
and nothing--
absolutely nothing--
supersedes love, man.

1306
01:02:55,157 --> 01:02:56,158
nothing!

1307
01:02:56,158 --> 01:02:59,161
I love you,
I love moore,
I love michael.

1308
01:02:59,162 --> 01:03:01,164
this car is
full of love!

1309
01:03:01,163 --> 01:03:04,166
but trust me,
we will do
what it takes--

1310
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:06,670
whatever it takes.

1311
01:03:16,678 --> 01:03:20,682
love does not lose.

1312
01:03:59,218 --> 01:04:01,220
michael. michael--
oh, michael...

1313
01:04:01,222 --> 01:04:03,683
i'm so sorry.
i'm so sorry.

1314
01:04:03,683 --> 01:04:06,227
no, it's not
your fault.
it's not your fault.

1315
01:04:08,687 --> 01:04:10,689
i'll get you
a new minivan.

1316
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,192
then you can be
the soccer mom.

1317
01:04:13,191 --> 01:04:15,193
you're
the soccer mom!
steady, boy.

1318
01:04:15,192 --> 01:04:17,194
no, it's not
your fault.

1319
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:20,741
no--michael,
watch the nose.
the nose!

1320
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:21,699
oh, michael.

1321
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:23,701
michael,
come on, let's go.

1322
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:25,161
oh, god. oh, oh!

1323
01:04:37,423 --> 01:04:39,216
i'm sorry!

1324
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:41,220
i'm sorry!

1325
01:04:41,303 --> 01:04:42,721
i'm sorry!

1326
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:44,721
oh! oh, my god!

1327
01:04:44,722 --> 01:04:46,223
i'm sorry!

1328
01:04:49,266 --> 01:04:50,684
canceled?!

1329
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:52,270
canceled?

1330
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:53,772
you're out of
your fucking mind.

1331
01:04:53,772 --> 01:04:55,273
nobody's talking
about canceling.

1332
01:04:55,275 --> 01:04:56,777
i'm just talking
about modifying.

1333
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,277
no way. no way!

1334
01:04:58,527 --> 01:04:59,779
can we just
talk it through?

1335
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:02,280
talkwhatthrough?
lookit, lookit...

1336
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,782
we are locked and
loaded here, right?

1337
01:05:03,782 --> 01:05:05,241
I mean,
we are nonrefundable.

1338
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:08,786
I have family at
the airport as we speak,

1339
01:05:08,787 --> 01:05:11,247
getting ready
to come here to see
us get married.

1340
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:13,290
do you understand?
I have a table full
of presents out there.

1341
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:15,294
just answer it!

1342
01:05:17,755 --> 01:05:18,756
hello?

1343
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:20,297
kyle, it's lois.

1344
01:05:20,297 --> 01:05:23,300
I was up at adam's study,
and I found a note.

1345
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:25,304
it seems to be
some sort of confession

1346
01:05:25,678 --> 01:05:29,307
about some horrible
thing he did to a woman
in las vegas, and...

1347
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:31,268
buried outside
of vegas, about boyd
being the ringleader...

1348
01:05:31,267 --> 01:05:33,269
she wants to know what
the hell's going on. i'm
starting to freak out.

1349
01:05:33,602 --> 01:05:35,813
we're goosed.
we're not goosed.
what's her disposition?

1350
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:37,816
regarding what?
did she sound pissed,
scared, hostile?

1351
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:40,233
did she say anything
about calling the police?

1352
01:05:40,317 --> 01:05:42,277
no, but she's definitely
pissed and hostile,

1353
01:05:42,568 --> 01:05:44,278
and she clearly is
starting to think that
something's not right.

1354
01:05:44,653 --> 01:05:46,279
we're goosed--
goosed by god!

1355
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,284
michael, would you please
calm down, all right?
what did you tell her?

1356
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:51,828
I told her I had no idea
what adam was talking
about in that letter.

1357
01:05:51,913 --> 01:05:53,832
did she believe you?
I have no idea.

1358
01:05:53,997 --> 01:05:55,332
you can tell when
people believe you.
it's obvious.

1359
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:56,833
I don't have that skill,
but if I had to guess,

1360
01:05:57,334 --> 01:05:58,752
i'd say that she
in no way believed me.

1361
01:05:58,835 --> 01:05:59,836
goosed!
shut up.

1362
01:05:59,836 --> 01:06:00,837
goosed!
stop it.

1363
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:02,337
goosed!
what's goosed?

1364
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,842
would you give him
another pill?
he's already had two.

1365
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:06,843
give him two more.

1366
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:08,844
we are goosed!

1367
01:06:08,846 --> 01:06:10,848
open sesame.

1368
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:13,349
jesus, boyd,
you're gonna o.d. him.
suck my ass!

1369
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:14,852
goosed!

1370
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:16,852
hey!

1371
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:18,270
I never
liked you, boyd.

1372
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:19,812
you're a sneaky
little fuck--
always have been.

1373
01:06:19,815 --> 01:06:21,817
what are you
talking about?

1374
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:22,817
don't sweet-lip me.

1375
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:26,319
I don't understand where
this personal attack
is coming from.

1376
01:06:26,446 --> 01:06:28,823
you're a liar.
I want to know what
happened in vegas.

1377
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:30,282
nothing happened
in vegas.

1378
01:06:30,826 --> 01:06:32,828
I don't want
to hear it
from the liar,

1379
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:35,286
so stick a plug
in it, boyd.

1380
01:06:35,493 --> 01:06:37,829
fisher, what
happened in vegas?

1381
01:06:42,668 --> 01:06:44,336
nothing happened
in vegas.

1382
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:46,380

1383
01:06:46,379 --> 01:06:48,631
nothing

1384
01:06:51,135 --> 01:06:52,386
michael...

1385
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:01,146
do you have something
to tell me?

1386
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:05,356
michael, just tell lois
nothing happened in vegas.

1387
01:07:05,357 --> 01:07:07,359

01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:21,414
lois, we were bad.

1392
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,878
we were very, very...
we were very, very bad.

1393
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:28,379
he's just upset about adam.
we're all a little upset.

1394
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:30,881
michael,

1395
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:33,843

1405

01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:14,341
3...
any more tense than it
has to be, all right?

1410
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,342
4...
just relax,
would you?

1411
01:08:16,344 --> 01:08:18,346
I am calling
the fucking police!

1412
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:19,847
ok, here's the deal!

1413
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:28,894
adam slept with
a prostitute in vegas.

1414
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:37,279
he was sick
with guilt.

1415
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,789
yeah.

1416
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:50,791
it's true.
no.

1417
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,795
it wasn't
the first time.

1418
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,758
adam had a...

1419
01:08:57,757 --> 01:09:01,261
adam had a thing
for...prostitutes.

1420
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:10,270
my adam?

1421
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,741
my adam? no...

1422
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:24,742
I don't believe it.

1423
01:09:25,116 --> 01:09:28,203
I don't believe it.
it's not true.

1424
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:30,204
not my adam!

1425
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,749
we're very, very sorry.

1426
01:09:32,873 --> 01:09:34,249
you're lying!

1427
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:36,254
you're a bunch
of liars!

1428
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:37,713
I don't believe you!

1429
01:09:38,129 --> 01:09:40,256
watch your fingers,
watch your toes.

1430
01:09:40,257 --> 01:09:42,718
all right, fellas,
I want you to listen to me.

1431
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:44,719
now, mommy's going to take
a little time-out,

1432
01:09:44,718 --> 01:09:46,720
and bunker's going to
keep you guys company,

1433
01:09:47,222 --> 01:09:50,225
and everything's going
to be ok--i promise.

1434
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:52,226
ok?

1435
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,230
ok.

1436
01:09:56,774 --> 01:09:57,775
take my cell phone.

1437
01:09:57,773 --> 01:09:59,775
after you drop
the kids off,
take michael home.

1438
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,235
put a couple drinks
in him so he'll sleep.

1439
01:10:01,234 --> 01:10:02,735
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1440
01:10:02,738 --> 01:10:04,240
just do it.
i'll call you later.

1441
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,240
what are you doing?

1442
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,159
i'm gonna take care
of business.

1443
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,161
what doesthatmean?

1444
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,663
what does that mean?
are you insane?

1445
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:13,664
do you actually think
I would hurt lois?

1446
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,168
she's the mother
of these kids,
for christ's sakes.

1447
01:10:16,165 --> 01:10:17,166
what's wrong with you?

1448
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:20,168
you got a real nasty side
to your thought process.

1449
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:24,674
look,
i'm sorry. it's
just for tonight.

1450
01:10:24,675 --> 01:10:27,678
lois is a mess,
michael is upset,
everybody's upset.

1451
01:10:27,677 --> 01:10:28,678
shut up!

1452
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,178
ok, I amnotcanceling
this wedding.

1453
01:10:30,181 --> 01:10:31,683
I don't want you to.
I won't even discuss it.

1454
01:10:31,682 --> 01:10:33,183
nobody's
discussing it, ok?

1455
01:10:33,183 --> 01:10:35,185
i'm just gonna bring
them back home. i'm
gonna come right back.

1456
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:37,271
you have to pick up the cake
in the morning, early.

1457
01:10:37,687 --> 01:10:40,273
don't we have somebody
to do that for us?

1458
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:42,774
yeah. you.


1459
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:44,777
what...?

1460
01:10:44,777 --> 01:10:45,778
ok. ok.

1461
01:10:46,194 --> 01:10:47,195
aah!

1462
01:10:49,365 --> 01:10:51,200
why did I have to...

1463
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,785
aw, jesus
fucking christ!

1464
01:10:55,537 --> 01:10:57,539
evil bastards!

1465
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:00,794
aah, you hear
that buzzing, fish?

1466
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:01,794
buzzing?

1467
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:03,795
yeah, like a...

1468
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:07,301
like a fucking chirping
in the back of my skull.

1469
01:11:08,802 --> 01:11:10,304
I don't hear anything.

1470
01:11:10,303 --> 01:11:13,306
yeah, well,
it's a nasty problem.

1471
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:14,804
deedee? deedee.

1472
01:11:14,806 --> 01:11:17,809
boom! bing, bing, bing.
bam, bam, bam.

1473
01:11:33,783 --> 01:11:35,284
ahh...

1474
01:11:35,283 --> 01:11:39,788
dad used to bring home
these sparklers for me
and adam, you know?

1475
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:42,791
sparklers!

1476
01:11:42,959 --> 01:11:44,795
we'd go out back,
the 3 of us,

1477
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,796
and we'd hold it up
to the sky

1478
01:11:46,795 --> 01:11:49,297
and watch
the explosions of light
and sparks, you know,

1479
01:11:49,297 --> 01:11:52,300
and dad would be all,
"wait for it. here it comes.
watch for it.

1480
01:11:52,299 --> 01:11:54,301
ok, here it comes.
here comes the wah-hoo."

1481
01:11:54,471 --> 01:11:55,305
wah-hoo?

1482
01:11:55,304 --> 01:11:57,807
wah-hoo! the sparkler
would burn hot,

1483
01:11:58,223 --> 01:11:59,808
then hotter,
then even hotter,

1484
01:12:00,309 --> 01:12:02,311
and then there'd be this
one moment of pure burn

1485
01:12:02,812 --> 01:12:04,814
when that little fucker
would cook perfect--
just perfect.

1486
01:12:05,315 --> 01:12:07,818
it would only last a second,
but that second was it.

1487
01:12:07,815 --> 01:12:08,816
it wasit.

1488
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:10,817
and that's what dad had us
looking for, man.

1489
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:12,821
are you with me?
the wah-hoo moment?

1490
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,822
that's exactly right.
that's what i'm driving at:

1491
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:17,323
man burning at
his absolute--

1492
01:12:17,324 --> 01:12:18,826
all the forces
coming together,

1493
01:12:18,826 --> 01:12:21,328
burning just perfect--

1494
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,331
perfect harmony.

1495
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:23,791
that's what
i'm driving at.

1496
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,333
are you with me?

1497
01:12:25,332 --> 01:12:26,792
I think so.

1498
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,795
i've been looking
for that flash.

1499
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:30,337
i've been looking,
and i've been looking,

1500
01:12:30,337 --> 01:12:32,339
and I can't find it.

1501
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,800
and what if it
already happened,
you know?

1502
01:12:33,799 --> 01:12:34,800
my moment.

1503
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,095
what if it happened,
and I didn't even
see it?

1504
01:12:43,309 --> 01:12:44,310
lois?

1505
01:12:45,309 --> 01:12:46,853
lois?

1506
01:12:46,853 --> 01:12:47,854
adam...

1507
01:12:47,853 --> 01:12:49,813
no, it's boyd.

1508
01:12:49,816 --> 01:12:51,234
I just want you
to know

1509
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,235
just how much
I didn't appreciate

1510
01:12:53,234 --> 01:12:55,236
that
personal attack.

1511
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,240
i'm really offended!

1512
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,284
uhh! no!

1513
01:13:05,244 --> 01:13:06,245
uhh!

1514
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:10,250
you picked the wrong woman,
motherfucker!

1515
01:13:11,252 --> 01:13:12,754
aaaahhhhh!

1516
01:13:12,753 --> 01:13:16,214
auuuuughh god!

1517
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:18,257
ahhhhhh!

1518
01:13:18,259 --> 01:13:19,260
ow!

1519
01:13:19,427 --> 01:13:20,762
it's over, baby.

1520
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:24,265
i'm gonna
turn myself in.

1521
01:13:24,556 --> 01:13:25,766
no.
after the wedding,
of course.

1522
01:13:26,057 --> 01:13:27,768
after the wedding,
out of respect.

1523
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:29,268
I don't think
that's a good
idea--

1524
01:13:29,352 --> 01:13:30,771
no, no, no, no, no.
you don't understand.

1525
01:13:30,771 --> 01:13:32,272
out of respect
for fisher.

1526
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:33,773
out of respect
for you--

1527
01:13:33,775 --> 01:13:34,776
listen to me,
listen to me--

1528
01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:36,777
respect for your wife

1529
01:13:36,777 --> 01:13:39,237
and your wedding,
ok? all right?

1530
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:40,239
do you hear where
I am here?

1531
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:41,280
I appreciate it.

1532
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,782
you're just being
too hard on yourself.

1533
01:13:42,782 --> 01:13:43,783
no, no, no, no, no.

1534
01:13:44,282 --> 01:13:45,283
this is my doing, ok?

1535
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:46,746
just stop.

1536
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:47,746
i'm gonna have a spark
of my own, all right?

1537
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,084
ahh!

1538
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,710

1542
01:14:05,303 --> 01:14:06,221

1543
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:09,808

01:14:23,195 --> 01:14:24,196

1550
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:25,199
listen...

1551
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,283
if you think
about names,

1552
01:14:27,283 --> 01:14:29,244

1553

1555
01:14:33,248 --> 01:14:35,291
this stuff will

1556
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:37,252

1557
01:14:39,252 --> 01:14:41,254

01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:42,299

1559
01:14:42,632 --> 01:14:44,300
ok, here's the deal.

1560
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,302
and it's a good one.
lois is cool.

1561
01:14:46,303 --> 01:14:48,806
it's a pacified
situation.

1562
01:14:48,805 --> 01:14:51,266
whoa, whoa.
what do you mean?

1563
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:53,809
she's resting,
she's comfortable.

1564
01:14:53,977 --> 01:14:55,270
the only thing is,

1565
01:14:55,268 --> 01:14:57,270
you still got
michael there,
right? right?

1566
01:14:57,271 --> 01:14:58,272
yeah.

1567
01:14:58,813 --> 01:14:59,814
ok, great.

1568
01:15:00,314 --> 01:15:01,816
she wants to see him
in person.

1569
01:15:02,107 --> 01:15:03,316
she, uh...

1570
01:15:03,318 --> 01:15:05,320
she needs to grieve
with her family.

1571
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:07,280
just a little
family time.

1572
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:08,780
right now?
yeah.

1573
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:10,326
well, isn't it
a little late?

1574
01:15:10,325 --> 01:15:13,787
get over here
and don't be so
goddamn selfish!

1575
01:15:19,835 --> 01:15:22,838
ok, you guys
wait in the car.

1576
01:15:22,837 --> 01:15:24,839
i'm gonna
take him in.

1577
01:15:24,838 --> 01:15:26,840
she just wants to
see him alone.

1578
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:28,843
lois wants
to see me?

1579
01:15:28,843 --> 01:15:30,845
here we go,
big guy.

1580
01:15:30,846 --> 01:15:32,306
upsy-daisy!

1581
01:15:33,847 --> 01:15:36,308
yes. she wants
a big hug,
big family hug.

1582
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:37,644
come on.

1583
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:39,312
one foot in front
of the other...

1584
01:15:39,812 --> 01:15:40,646
there you go.

1585
01:15:40,812 --> 01:15:41,813
hey, fisher?
yeah?

1586
01:15:41,815 --> 01:15:44,359
i'm gonna do this,
and then we're gonna
go to fatburger.

1587
01:15:44,358 --> 01:15:45,818
ok, big guy.

1588
01:15:47,821 --> 01:15:48,822
lois is
in the house.

1589
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:51,324
come on, michael,
get in the house.

1590
01:16:06,338 --> 01:16:07,839
you know...

1591
01:16:09,339 --> 01:16:12,342
i'm thinking about
maybe making a move.

1592
01:16:12,343 --> 01:16:13,344
a move?

1593
01:16:13,344 --> 01:16:15,846
yeah. greenpeace.

1594
01:16:15,847 --> 01:16:16,848
greenpeace?

1595
01:16:16,847 --> 01:16:17,848
yeah. yeah. yeah.

1596
01:16:17,848 --> 01:16:20,351
maybe go up to
the north pole,
the arctic.

1597
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:23,853
tag polar bears
with dart guns.

1598
01:16:23,854 --> 01:16:26,357
i've always had
pretty good aim.

1599
01:16:54,384 --> 01:16:56,928
michael was in love
with lois.

1600
01:16:56,927 --> 01:16:59,888
that's what
michael and adam
were arguing about

1601
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,892
in the parking lot.

1602
01:17:02,016 --> 01:17:04,352
michael killed adam
in a jealous rage,

1603
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:06,310
lois rejected michael,

1604
01:17:06,312 --> 01:17:09,274
he strangled her
to death...

1605
01:17:09,273 --> 01:17:13,152
and he shot himself
in the head.

1606
01:17:13,152 --> 01:17:15,154
happens all the time.

1607
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:23,454
that lois, she fought
like a fucking comanche.

1608
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:28,458
well, I don't see how this
could have been kept from you.

1609
01:17:28,668 --> 01:17:30,962
last month, adam and lois
changed their will.

1610
01:17:30,961 --> 01:17:34,506
they requested that you two,
as a married couple,

1611
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,508
be custodians of record
for their estate,

1612
01:17:36,717 --> 01:17:41,221
including all properties,
cash holdings,
security holdings,

1613
01:17:42,763 --> 01:17:44,264
and...children.

1614
01:17:44,599 --> 01:17:48,227
adam had a $500,000 term
life insurance policy.

1615
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:49,686
what does that mean?

1616
01:17:49,771 --> 01:17:52,190
that means we have
$500,000 to help
raise the kids.

1617
01:17:52,272 --> 01:17:53,148
no!
yes.

1618
01:17:53,148 --> 01:17:53,940
no!
yes.

1619
01:17:54,273 --> 01:17:55,733
actually, no.

1620
01:17:55,903 --> 01:17:59,740
adam failed to make
his last payment,
so his term life lapsed.

1621
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:03,240
but he did have
a pension account
worth $150,000

1622
01:18:03,408 --> 01:18:05,827
and the house,
valued at 350,000.

1623
01:18:05,826 --> 01:18:07,369
ok, so where does
that leave us?

1624
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:09,373
150 and 350,

1625
01:18:09,372 --> 01:18:11,374
that takes us back up
to 500,000.

1626
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:13,375
not even close.
the property value's down.

1627
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:15,880
the house is worth
100,000 less...

1628
01:18:15,879 --> 01:18:18,340
3 credit cards...

1629
01:18:18,549 --> 01:18:20,301
the minivan payments...

1630
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:24,220
and the income
and the state taxes
assessed on his i.r.a...

1631
01:18:24,388 --> 01:18:26,891
that leaves you
in the neighborhood of...

1632
01:18:27,389 --> 01:18:30,851
$14,223.

1633
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:32,395
are you fucking
kidding me?

1634
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:36,816
the hell did
you do that for,
you little asshole?

1635
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,819
what are you
gonna do about it,
you little fucker?

1636
01:18:38,816 --> 01:18:40,234
come on, hit me!

1637
01:18:40,403 --> 01:18:42,863
hey, hey,
come on--enough,
enough, enough.

1638
01:18:44,363 --> 01:18:45,322
so...

1639
01:18:45,322 --> 01:18:46,907
when's the wedding?

1640
01:18:47,325 --> 01:18:48,326
tomorrow.

1641
01:18:49,327 --> 01:18:51,371
we're getting
married tomorrow.

1642
01:18:51,832 --> 01:18:53,375
i've had enough
of you two devils!

1643
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:54,917
enough! enough!

1644
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:57,878
excuse me for a moment.

1645
01:18:59,671 --> 01:19:00,380
enough!

1646
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,423
what is going on?

1647
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,881
these are
your clients' kids!
look at these--

1648
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,427
it's gonna be ok.

1649
01:19:04,884 --> 01:19:06,428
it's not ok.

1650
01:19:06,885 --> 01:19:09,388
it's not ok.
it's not ok.

1651
01:19:09,389 --> 01:19:10,890
we're gonna be fine.

1652
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:13,351
we have to cancel.

1653
01:19:13,352 --> 01:19:15,396
no. no, we don't,
no, we don't.

1654
01:19:15,394 --> 01:19:16,895
it's gonna be ok,
honey--

1655
01:19:16,895 --> 01:19:18,397
it's gonna be ok.

1656
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:19,897
do you love me?

1657
01:19:20,276 --> 01:19:22,903
kyle...
it's gonna be ok.

1658
01:19:23,235 --> 01:19:25,404
w-w-we killed
a woman.

1659
01:19:26,906 --> 01:19:28,408
what are you
talking about?

1660
01:19:28,408 --> 01:19:29,909
in vegas.

1661
01:19:30,202 --> 01:19:32,413
michael killed
a woman.

1662
01:19:32,662 --> 01:19:35,415
michael killed her--
he hit her head
and she bled.

1663
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:38,917
and she...she died.

1664
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:42,920
but there was nothing
we could do about it,
so we buried her.

1665
01:19:43,129 --> 01:19:44,922
who's dead?

1666
01:19:45,089 --> 01:19:46,924
the prostitute's dead.

1667
01:19:47,093 --> 01:19:48,428
you fucked
a prostitute?

1668
01:19:48,427 --> 01:19:49,928
no. michael did.

1669
01:19:50,345 --> 01:19:51,889
it was an accident,
michael did it.

1670
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:53,432
where is she?

1671
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:55,933
she's buried
in the desert.

1672
01:19:56,434 --> 01:19:59,937
you left
a dead prostitute
alone in the desert?

1673
01:20:00,188 --> 01:20:02,482
she's not alone.

1674
01:20:02,522 --> 01:20:04,441
boyd went--

1675
01:20:04,526 --> 01:20:06,445
boyd went crazy.

1676
01:20:06,444 --> 01:20:08,488
he went nuts,
and he started
killing everybody.

1677
01:20:09,029 --> 01:20:11,490
he killed a guard.
he killed michael.

1678
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:12,491
he killed lois--

1679
01:20:12,491 --> 01:20:15,035
stop, ok?
just stop right there.

1680
01:20:15,037 --> 01:20:17,998
I don't want to hear
any more of this, ok?

1681
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:21,000
I told you not to do
that stupid fucking
bachelor party thing.

1682
01:20:21,335 --> 01:20:22,544
I know.

1683
01:20:22,835 --> 01:20:24,337
you were warned!
I know.

1684
01:20:24,461 --> 01:20:26,004
you were warned, kyle!
you were warned!

1685
01:20:26,465 --> 01:20:28,008
I told you your friends
were just jackasses!

1686
01:20:28,466 --> 01:20:30,009
I know!
and i'm sorry.

1687
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:34,010
i've waited
27 years, ok?

1688
01:20:34,011 --> 01:20:38,015
27 years I have
focused and prepared

1689
01:20:38,016 --> 01:20:40,477
to walk down
that aisle,

1690
01:20:40,559 --> 01:20:42,520
and I will not
be derailed.

1691
01:20:42,855 --> 01:20:45,066
I will not be
embarrassed,

1692
01:20:45,315 --> 01:20:46,525
and I will not
be denied!

1693
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:48,526
so tomorrow,
I am walking down
that aisle,

1694
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:51,446
come hell or high
fucking water!

1695
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:30,065
ok!

1696
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:31,066
showtime.

1697
01:21:31,524 --> 01:21:32,525
we're about
two minutes out.

1698
01:21:33,069 --> 01:21:34,070
moore?

1699
01:21:34,278 --> 01:21:36,071
better take
your position.

1700
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:37,531
chop-chop!

1701
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:40,536
let me see you.

1702
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:45,038
there you are.

1703
01:21:45,998 --> 01:21:48,041
you look great, man.

1704
01:21:49,586 --> 01:21:51,045
go get 'em.

1705
01:21:51,587 --> 01:21:53,756
hoooo...

1706
01:21:56,884 --> 01:22:00,053
this is a situation
that defies judgment.

1707
01:22:00,261 --> 01:22:02,555
we have acted
and shown courage

1708
01:22:02,764 --> 01:22:06,934
of a nature
not known by most.

1709
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:10,522
you've got a warped
though process.

1710
01:22:10,521 --> 01:22:12,607
your brain doesn't
function properly.

1711
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:13,526
whatever you say,
kojak.

1712
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:14,568
i'm serious.

1713
01:22:14,568 --> 01:22:15,569
no, no, no--

1714
01:22:16,027 --> 01:22:17,612
i'mthe serious one
here, ok?

1715
01:22:17,614 --> 01:22:18,531
i'm the serious one.

1716
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:20,033
i'm the guy making
the fucking plays.

1717
01:22:20,447 --> 01:22:22,616
i'm the indian runner,
for chrissake,

1718
01:22:22,698 --> 01:22:24,784
and I want my money!

1719
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:27,370
what money?

1720
01:22:27,453 --> 01:22:28,579
blood money!

1721
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:31,626
insurance dollars
which you have
thus far

1722
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,795
somehow let
slip your mind
to tell me about!

1723
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:37,632
you're sick.

1724
01:22:38,091 --> 01:22:40,093
if you think
you can fuck me,
fish,

1725
01:22:40,635 --> 01:22:41,636

1754
01:24:12,638 --> 01:24:14,182
in the toilet.

1755
01:24:16,642 --> 01:24:19,645
we're gonna
get started, ok?

1756
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,793
dearly beloved,

1757
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:28,797
we are all here today
because two very
special people,

1758
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:29,797
laura and kyle,

1759
01:25:30,297 --> 01:25:31,298
have found each other.

1760
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:35,301
you can't...spawn
the salmon man!

1761
01:25:35,386 --> 01:25:38,305
when I see
two young people
in love as they are,

1762
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:42,310
I find myself
renewed and inspired
because the spirit--

1763
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:44,310
rise!

1764
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:47,814
with hope for
the future and joy.

01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:49,732

1766
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,819

1767
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,278

the rings, please?

1768
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:54,280
i'm on my way!

1769
01:25:54,573 --> 01:25:56,283
the rings.
we need the rings.

1770
01:25:56,574 --> 01:25:57,366
I don't have
the rings.

1771
01:25:57,575 --> 01:25:59,243
I got the ring!

1772
01:25:59,325 --> 01:26:00,827

1774
01:26:03,537 --> 01:26:04,329
excuse me.

1775
01:26:16,299 --> 01:26:18,259
oh, god.

1776
01:26:21,804 --> 01:26:23,848
oh, god...

1777
01:26:24,058 --> 01:26:24,892

1781
01:26:59,091 --> 01:27:00,926
now we can begin.

1782
01:27:02,345 --> 01:27:05,848
do you, kyle,
take this woman laura

1783
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,348
to be your wife
and helpmate

1784
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,851
in sickness and in health

1785
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:11,311
along life's highways,
wherever they may take you,

1786
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:13,813
until death do you part?

1787
01:27:13,816 --> 01:27:14,817
I do.

1788
01:27:14,816 --> 01:27:16,818
and do you, laura,
take this man kyle--

1789
01:27:16,817 --> 01:27:18,276
I do.

1790
01:27:18,486 --> 01:27:19,862
you may
kiss the bride.

1791
01:27:27,244 --> 01:27:28,328
hey, guys?

1792
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:29,787
listen, I need two minutes
with him.

1793
01:27:29,789 --> 01:27:31,332
i'll be right out.

1794
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:32,791
baby, I just want you
to know that all this,

1795
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:34,793
everything I did,
is 'cause I love you

1796
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,794
and I wanted you
to have that wedding

1797
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:38,337
like you always
wanted to have, ok?

1798
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:39,797
you and moore
are gonna go move
those fucking bodies,

1799
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:41,297
do you
understand me?

1800
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,844
and you're gonna
bury boyd with them.

1801
01:27:43,301 --> 01:27:44,302
and in fact,
you know what?

1802
01:27:44,844 --> 01:27:46,846
you're gonna
fucking put moore
in the ground, too.

1803
01:27:46,931 --> 01:27:48,850
you want me
to kill moore?

1804
01:27:48,849 --> 01:27:50,851
I know he's
your only friend
left, ok?

1805
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:52,309
but he is
a loose string,

1806
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:53,312
and you are gonna
have to start

1807
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:55,313
fucking flushing
the toilet
like a big boy,

1808
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:56,312
do you
understand me?

1809
01:27:56,311 --> 01:27:57,312
laura?

1810
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:58,816
fuck!

1811
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,316
you know...

1812
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:01,818
you guys, listen--

1813
01:28:01,817 --> 01:28:04,778
two minutes, please.
just make my apologies for me.
do your job.

1814
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:06,406
and while
you're at it,
you know,

1815
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,366
just get rid of
that fucking dog.

1816
01:28:08,368 --> 01:28:09,828
the dog?

1817
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,328
I don't care
what you do,
get rid of him.

1818
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:12,830
lose him
in the desert.

1819
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,831
you want me to kill
the dog?

1820
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:16,333
do you love me?
yes.

1821
01:28:16,332 --> 01:28:17,375
do you?
mm-hmm.

1822
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:18,376
do you love me?

1823
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:19,376
mm-hmm.

1824
01:28:19,376 --> 01:28:21,378
do you love me?
mm-hmm.

1825
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,386
do it?

1826
01:28:29,386 --> 01:28:30,888
laura!

1827
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:31,891
fuck!

1828
01:28:33,307 --> 01:28:35,350
I told you
two fucking minutes!

1829
01:29:57,471 --> 01:29:59,515
i've been thinking.

1830
01:29:59,514 --> 01:30:03,059
i've been thinking
about what you said
that day--

1831
01:30:03,061 --> 01:30:05,063
the prayer.

1832
01:30:05,061 --> 01:30:06,563
about using
this whole mess

1833
01:30:07,064 --> 01:30:08,566
to bring out
the good in me.

1834
01:30:11,027 --> 01:30:12,028
I think there's a lot
of truth in that.

1835
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,572
i'm gonna pursue
some options.

1836
01:30:18,033 --> 01:30:20,578
I want to join that
big brother thing.

1837
01:30:20,578 --> 01:30:21,579
yeah.

1838
01:30:21,997 --> 01:30:24,583
I want a black one.

1839
01:30:24,581 --> 01:30:27,083
I want a little
black brother.

1840
01:30:27,082 --> 01:30:30,544
it's a big problem,
it seems to me,

1841
01:30:30,546 --> 01:30:31,547
you know?

1842
01:30:32,088 --> 01:30:35,091
lack of racial
integration,
that's a big one.

1843
01:30:35,092 --> 01:30:37,094
don't you think?

1844
01:30:38,553 --> 01:30:39,554
kyle?

1845
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:56,569
do you love me?

1846
01:31:12,587 --> 01:31:15,090
that ought to be
about the end of that.

1847
01:31:16,589 --> 01:31:19,092
yup.

1848
01:31:31,605 --> 01:31:33,607
because that is
the point here, ok?

1849
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:36,609
that is what
i'm driving for.

1850
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,612
when the big storm comes

1851
01:31:38,609 --> 01:31:40,069
and it knocks down
all the forests

1852
01:31:40,071 --> 01:31:42,073
and all the rocks
fall down

1853
01:31:42,072 --> 01:31:44,616
and all the leaves are bare,
what is left?

1854
01:31:45,116 --> 01:31:47,576
what is left?

1855
01:31:47,577 --> 01:31:50,580
the little trees.

1856
01:31:51,122 --> 01:31:54,125
the little fellas
that the storm didn't see.

1857
01:31:54,127 --> 01:31:56,421
the tiny little trees.

1858
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,463
ok, boys, let's hear
the badger oath.

1859
01:32:42,964 --> 01:32:44,966
come on, boys,
let's hear it
one more time.

1860
01:32:44,966 --> 01:32:46,468
a badger is great.

1861
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:50,471
a badger faces
great adversity...

1862
01:32:51,972 --> 01:32:53,474
a badger
is economical,

1863
01:32:53,684 --> 01:32:55,978
saves for
the unforeseen.

1864
01:32:56,061 --> 01:32:57,479
a badger is sanitary,

1865
01:32:57,853 --> 01:32:59,980
keeps his mind
and body pure.

1866
01:32:59,981 --> 01:33:00,982
yes.

1867
01:33:01,483 --> 01:33:02,942
come on, let's see
the badger salute.

1868
01:33:02,941 --> 01:33:03,942
aw, no!

1869
01:33:03,944 --> 01:33:05,946
come on, let's see
the badger salute.

1870
01:33:07,905 --> 01:33:08,989
yes.

1871
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:10,449
shit!

1872
01:33:11,492 --> 01:33:12,993
the hell with it.

1873
01:33:12,993 --> 01:33:14,495
come on, give me
your hand.

1874
01:33:14,494 --> 01:33:15,995
I don't need
any help!

1875
01:33:15,998 --> 01:33:19,460
if you don't
reach out to me,
I can't help.

1876
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:21,001
leave me alone!

1877
01:33:21,003 --> 01:33:23,464
your new mommy's
coming.

1878
01:33:23,963 --> 01:33:25,465
your new mommy's--

1879
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:28,511
come on. come on, now.
we're gonna make it.

1880
01:33:29,008 --> 01:33:30,510
let's talk about
our feelings.

1881
01:33:30,592 --> 01:33:31,968
I hate you
and your bitch wife!

1882
01:33:32,096 --> 01:33:33,514
get your own crutch,
stump boy!

1883
01:33:33,805 --> 01:33:35,515
please clean
the bathroom.

1884
01:33:35,764 --> 01:33:38,433
let's talk about
our feelings.
how do we feel?

1885
01:33:38,559 --> 01:33:39,977
a little help?

1886
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:41,979
