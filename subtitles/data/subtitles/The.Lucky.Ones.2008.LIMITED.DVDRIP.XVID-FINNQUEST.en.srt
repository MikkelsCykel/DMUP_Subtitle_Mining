00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,194
The key is listening to the signals
and hearing what they're saying.

2
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,026
If she touches you soft,

3
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,498
that's how she wants to be touched.

4
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,900
You do that until you can hear her get wet.

5
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,666
You gotta know women. I'm serious.

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,833
Last time I went home,
my girl was so grateful,

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,007
she went right outside and
started washing my car.

8
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,009
Detailed it.

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,446
Everything. Just to thank me.

10
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,975
Now, we gotta stop talking about pussy

11
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,543
'cause if we're not careful,
this is gonna get us killed.

12
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,679
Especially in this neighborhood,

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,781
and I'm not gonna let pussy get us killed.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,318
Wanna go left?

15
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,987
All right, get around this right here.

16
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,155
Move left.

17
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,698
Watch it.

18
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,428
Come on, man.
You gotta speed up.

19
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,864
Sarnt, you ever had
two girls at the same...

20
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,269
Go! Go! Go!

21
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,809
Go! Go!

22
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,003
Fire! Fire! West!

23
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,739
I.E.D. I.E.D. I.E.D.

24
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,304
Five points south of Najaf.

25
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,314
Third vehicle.

26
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,315
We got it.

27
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,113
That was fucked up!

28
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,546
Came right through the door!

29
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,748
Shit, that was close.

30
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,381
You all right, sir?

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,390
What?

32
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,359
You all right?

33
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,055
Yeah.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,154
Sarnt, look.

35
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,163
What?

36
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,790
Look at your pants, Sir.

37
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,158
Did you tell your girlfriend
what happened yet?

38
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,097
No, sir.

39
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,564
You're gonna have to tell her.

40
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,604
I'll tell her when it's working again, sir.

41
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,231
Okay.

42
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:58,107
But you don't become
functional overnight.

43
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,612
You're gonna have to be
patient with yourself.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,841
She's gonna have to be
patient with you.

45
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,181
Can you do that?

46
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,617
I guess.

47
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,953
All right, then.

48
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,857
Good luck to you, Sergeant.

49
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,827
Thank you, sir.

50
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,261
I've gotta be on there.

51
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,701
I don't want to miss this plane.

52
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,601
Told you already.

53
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,435
- You gotta see the MCNCO.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,634
- Airport?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,643
Sergeant T.K. Poole.

56
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,149
Listen, buddy, all I want to do
is get back to my wife and kid.

57
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,879
- You gotta help me out here.
- I just go by the list.

58
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,580
Can I see the list?

59
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,692
Hey. Here it is.

60
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,753
Hey.

61
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,397
Sergeant Fred Cheaver.

62
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,231
648. Reserves.

63
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,362
Hello. It's right here.

64
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,872
That's how you spell it?

65
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,532
With a C-H?

66
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,577
How else would you spell Cheaver?

67
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,043
Probably lots of ways.

68
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,171
Not in English.

69
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,708
<i>Welcome aboard</i>
<i>Flight 6240 to New York.</i>

70
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,310
<i>Our estimated flying time</i>
<i>this evening to JFK</i>

71
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,788
<i>will be 8 hours and 20 minutes.</i>

72
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,237
Hey.

73
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,968
We're all on the same team.

74
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,275
You got leave?

75
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,402
Yeah. 30 days.

76
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,741
Oh, yeah?

77
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,905
Me, too.

78
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,846
How long you got?

79
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,407
The rest of my life,
thank you very much.

80
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,078
My tour's over.

81
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,621
I'm going home.

82
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,507
If we go down in the water...

83
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,279
you're gonna be sitting pretty.

84
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,144
What?

85
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,853
I said if we crash in the ocean,
your donut's gonna come in handy.

86
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,122
It'll be like an extra life preserver.

87
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,926
If we crash in the ocean,
it's not gonna matter.

88
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,266
Don't talk about planes crashing
when you're on a plane.

89
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,634
Why not?

90
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,504
It's basic common sense.

91
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,668
It's the same reason
that when you're on a cruise ship,

92
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,938
they're not showing <i>Titanic.</i>

93
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,001
It scares people.

94
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:54,176
Who wants to think about
drunk pilots and midair collisions?

95
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,881
Nothing you can do about it, anyway.

96
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,532
It's good to be home.

97
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,102
We're gonna miss the whole thing.

98
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,469
What the hell?

99
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,383
<i>Please do not leave</i>
<i>your baggage unattended.</i>

100
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,682
<i>All unattended baggage</i>
<i>will be confiscated.</i>

101
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,245
Oh, God. I gotta get to Vegas.

102
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,348
I can't be sitting around here.

103
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,188
You're going to Vegas?

104
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,989
Yeah. I'm going to Vegas.

105
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,031
- Hey, are you going to Vegas?
- St. Louis.

106
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,360
Excuse me.

107
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,924
Do you know what happened here,
why all the flights are cancelled?

108
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,196
There was a blackout here.

109
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,999
The city was dark for five hours.

110
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,302
The lights just came back on
a little while ago.

111
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,403
The lights are back on in the Northeast,

112
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,036
but the planes are still not moving.

113
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,241
Airline officials say it could be
at least two days

114
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,375
until they get their planes
to the right airports

115
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,578
and resume their schedules.

116
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,678
- Two days.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,723
They don't know shit.

118
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,850
Supposedly, planes are flying
out of Pittsburgh,

119
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,894
but they can't even get us there
till tomorrow night.

120
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,861
And even that's a big maybe.

121
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,259
Well, it's nice meeting you all.

122
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,561
I'm outta here.

123
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,727
Good luck.

124
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,735
Where are you goin'?

125
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,398
I want to rent a car
before there's none left.

126
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,373
It's 14 hours to St. Louis.

127
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,741
Drive all night, be there
having dinner with my wife tomorrow.

128
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,781
Sure as shit not gonna stay here
while they run out of food and water.

129
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,426
Hey, man.

130
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,758
I bet you planes
are flying out of St. Louis.

131
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,593
Probably.

132
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,259
Maybe I can catch a flight
to Vegas from there.

133
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,767
Me, too.

134
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,664
Okay. But we split
everything three ways...

135
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,335
gas, rental, insurance, everything.

136
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,038
No free rides.

137
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,254
That's it. Sorry. No cars left.

138
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,455
You got nothing?

139
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,758
Nothing.

140
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,888
Can you believe this?

141
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,956
Maybe we can call the Army.

142
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,999
The Army?
What's the Army gonna do?

143
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,231
You guys in the Army?

144
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,499
Yeah.

145
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,640
Were you over there?

146
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,540
Just got back.

147
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,875
Come here.

148
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,278
All right, listen.

149
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,782
I do have one car left.

150
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,182
I'm supposed to hold it
for my boss, but screw it.

151
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,277
You guys can have it.

152
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,755
Oh, my God. That's so nice!

153
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,756
Thank you!

154
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,985
Oh, no.

155
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,526
Thank you.

156
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,401
Sure is beautiful.

157
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,172
I guess we don't have time to stop.

158
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,444
No. We don't have time to stop.

159
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,783
I never been to New York before.

160
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,017
You been to New York, Sarnt?

161
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,956
I'm stationed at Fort Drum.

162
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,619
I've been there a million times.

163
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,629
I thought you were from Las Vegas.

164
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,221
No.

165
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,929
I'm not from Las Vegas, either.

166
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,764
Well, my friend's from there.

167
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,140
That's his guitar.

168
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,143
Well, it was his guitar.

169
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:44,581
I mean, he got killed,
so I'm just taking it back to his family.

170
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,483
That's a real nice thing to be doing.

171
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,973
You must be a good dancer, huh?

172
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,341
Oh, no. My wife's a good dancer.

173
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,074
I just try to keep up.

174
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,810
She loves all those Latin dances.

175
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,251
Samba, merengue, tango.

176
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,255
She's a looker, huh?

177
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,121
Yes, she is. Yeah.

178
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,661
What she's doing with someone like me,

179
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,129
I'll never know, and I'm not gonna ask.

180
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,598
We're lucky ones, aren't we?

181
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,262
We made it through in one piece.

182
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,433
I got shot in the leg, but all I gotta do
is put some goo on it, so...

183
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,170
Did you get shot... Sarnt?

184
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,179
No. I caught a piece of shrapnel.

185
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:50,781
Where?

186
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,613
Outside of Najaf.

187
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,915
No. I mean where on your body.

188
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,616
Thigh.

189
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,885
Upper thigh.

190
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,983
How about you, Sarnt?

191
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,489
I had back surgery.
Three crushed vertebrae.

192
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,690
What happened?

193
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,963
Porto John fell on me.

194
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,163
What?

195
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,466
Was it full?

196
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,302
No. It was...

197
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,739
It was brand-spanking-new.

198
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,299
It was completely sanitary.

199
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,902
We were setting up a camp
outside of Bandar,

200
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,880
and it fell off a forklift.

201
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,540
Well, don't tell the ladies that.

202
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,983
You gotta find something
better than that.

203
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,543
You kidding?

204
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,714
I love that Porto John.

205
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,758
Best thing that ever happened to me.

206
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,952
A week later, my unit
shipped off to Mosul,

207
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,494
got shot to pieces.

208
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,325
The shitter saved my life.

209
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,391
Wish I could've brought it home,
set up a shrine.

210
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,998
If I have another kid,
I'm gonna name him Porto John.

211
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,666
That's...

212
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,505
Porto John Cheaver.

213
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,445
They all look so good.

214
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,319
I don't know what to order.

215
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,756
What can I get for you?

216
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,990
Give me the Number 8, the Number 9,
and the Number 10.

217
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,031
Coffee, orange juice, and milk.

218
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,497
Good, huh?

219
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,341
I tell you, this woman's smart.

220
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,378
She's got plans for us.

221
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,209
You... Can't...
She's dying to get married

222
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,578
'cause I'm her ticket to the top.

223
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,640
How are you her ticket to the top?

224
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,743
She's a lieutenant.
She outranks you.

225
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,287
No. Right now she does.

226
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,447
I mean, she's got the connections,

227
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,047
but I got the juice.

228
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,616
I mean, it's like a merger between us.

229
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,390
You know? She's gonna get me
into Officer Candidate School.

230
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,158
I'm gonna move up the ranks.

231
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,097
Then I'm gonna run for office.

232
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,362
And you have to have
a good head of hair to run for office,

233
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,869
and I have a good head of hair.

234
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,108
So your fiancée is meeting you in Vegas?

235
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,439
No. She's stationed at Fort Dix.

236
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,739
I'm gonna meet her there afterwards.

237
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,076
Oh, I get it.

238
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,048
First, a little fun at the tittie bars.

239
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,584
No. I got business to take care of.

240
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,177
You paying back a gambling debt?

241
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,244
Wrong again.

242
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,919
Randy had a gambling debt.

243
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,255
Yep.

244
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,659
That's why he had to rob Lucky Jim's.

245
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,325
He stole $50,000 so he could
pay back the loan sharks.

246
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,198
But then of course,
the cops got on his tail, and...

247
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,760
and that's when he enlisted.

248
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,305
You know, he just went...

249
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,931
went right into the Army
and disappeared.

250
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,373
It was the perfect getaway.

251
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,673
See, that's exactly
what the Army doesn't want.

252
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,580
The Army's got standards.

253
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,139
Like, it... it means something.

254
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,151
It's not like lowlifes and gangbangers.

255
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,277
What?

256
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,617
The last thing we need is trash
like your pal Randy.

257
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,418
- They don't want...
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

258
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,890
- Whoa!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

259
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,984
That "trash" saved my fucking life!

260
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,291
He pulled me outta that truck
when I got shot!

261
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,764
And he took a fucking bullet
in the fucking head!

262
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,735
All I got left is his fucking guitar!

263
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,501
Get back in the car.

264
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,543
Get back in the car!

265
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,477
I ought to kick your ass!

266
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,808
Oh, you're gonna kick my ass.

267
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,111
Yeah. I could do it, too.

268
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,310
I'd just push you
down a flight of stairs,

269
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,784
punch you in the kidney.

270
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,651
You'd better have eyes
in the back of your head.

271
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,088
This is not... We don't have time
for ass-kicking stops.

272
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,126
You just say you're sorry,
and let's get going.

273
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,184
- I'm not sorry!
- I'm not talking to you.

274
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,526
- Say you're sorry.
- No. I'm not gonna say I'm sorry.

275
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,692
That's like saying I'm sorry
that the sky's blue.

276
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,234
Come on, man. You just...

277
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,270
You just insulted her dead friend. Huh?

278
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,033
Come on. Suck it up.

279
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,334
Say you're sorry. Let's go.

280
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,568
I'm sorry that you got so upset.

281
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,509
Okay?

282
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,273
No. That's not an apology.

283
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,609
But it's pretty close.

284
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,773
Come on, let's go.

285
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,976
That's not an apology.

286
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,185
Come on. Let me in.

287
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,022
Dude, let me in.

288
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,854
I can't.

289
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,860
Just press the key thing, man.

290
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,259
The keys are in the car.

291
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,423
Shit.

292
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,372
What the fuck were you thinking?

293
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,572
I was thinking I had two fucking nut cases
throwing shit, getting into a fight.

294
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,638
- We didn't fight.
- This is not my fault.

295
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,774
Well, it's sure as shit not our fault.

296
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,284
We didn't lock the keys in the car.

297
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,047
Whatever. We need a coat hanger.

298
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,214
Coat hanger's not gonna work
on a late model car.

299
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,952
You need a Slim Jim.

300
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,154
Well, you know what?
I don't have a Slim Jim.

301
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:44,965
Thank you.

302
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,916
So, they went on this worldwide tour,

303
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,283
and they... they got...
'cause they got this contract.

304
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,753
And they got to meet the queen,

305
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,380
and they got to meet the president.

306
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,220
And after that,

307
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,955
Randy got the guitar from his daddy,

308
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,792
who got it from his granddaddy,

309
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,025
who got it from Elvis.

310
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,260
Elvis.

311
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,302
Come on.

312
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,927
It's true.

313
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,302
That guitar's worth a lot of money.

314
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,694
She's a beaut, don't you think?

315
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,690
Yeah. I already got one, though.

316
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,700
- You do?
- Yeah.

317
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,361
Me, too.

318
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,371
That's great. What color?

319
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,805
So, how is it over there?

320
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,640
You guys see any action?

321
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,804
- Yep.
- Yeah.

322
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,370
Yeah?

323
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,439
Well, we all think
you're doing a hell of a job.

324
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,575
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

325
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,278
No, no. Thank you.

326
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,548
You know, we get clients all the time

327
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,023
in the dealership who want
their Hummers outfitted just like yours.

328
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,890
The desert camouflage, the whole bit.

329
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,362
One guy even put armor on his H1.

330
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,457
They want bullet holes?

331
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,435
Yeah, they probably do.

332
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,028
Hey, check this out.

333
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,665
Push that third button right back there.

334
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,674
Not bad, huh?

335
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,767
Yeah.

336
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,937
Yeah. Bet you guys
don't have that on your vehicles.

337
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,648
No, sir, we don't.

338
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,521
You got it?

339
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,289
- That didn't take long.
- Thank you.

340
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,580
I have to use the bathroom.

341
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,410
I'll pull over by those bushes.

342
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,544
No, I said "use the bathroom,"

343
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,884
not squat by the side of the road.

344
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,741
And the weird and wacky talent
this week is...

345
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,788
Congratulations, Wayne.

346
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,766
All yours.

347
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,274
Do you want to play pool, or...

348
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,775
pinball or something?

349
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,935
Nah. We should get going.

350
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,444
Okay.

351
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,287
Turn it down!

352
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,294
Turn it off!

353
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,528
Is this a good show?

354
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,526
Yeah.

355
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,136
I've never seen it before.
Is it new?

356
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,607
Not that new.

357
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,570
I've haven't really seen
much of anything lately

358
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,981
'cause I've been overseas
the past 14 months, and...

359
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,541
you know, I'm in the Army.

360
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,354
But I'm home on leave for 30 days,

361
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,823
so I'm just... I'm hoping to catch up.

362
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,827
I like your jacket.

363
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,262
It's okay.

364
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,730
What's the "I" stand for?

365
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,499
Indiana.

366
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,062
You know, the college and the state

367
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,801
where you're standing right now.

368
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,778
Yeah, you know, I was thinking
of going to college when I get out, but...

369
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:16,836
Do you like it?

370
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,247
Do you think you could be quiet?

371
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,845
Sure, I can be quiet.

372
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:25,947
Good.

373
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,031
No way.

374
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,642
You know, I'm limping
because when I was over there,

375
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,085
I got shot in the leg.

376
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,748
That wasn't very smart, was it?

377
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,519
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

378
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,224
Back off! Back off!

379
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,269
What's wrong with you guys?

380
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,598
Back off!

381
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,038
Calm down.

382
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,574
No, that's right. Be afraid.

383
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,200
No, be very afraid.

384
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,266
Go, go, go!

385
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,276
All right!

386
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,983
Yeah! We won!

387
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,853
Kicked their college asses!

388
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,653
Kicked their college asses!

389
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,991
Oh, this girl's crazy.

390
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,391
Yeah.

391
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,091
Just glad I didn't have my weapon.

392
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,481
TV! TV! TV!

393
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,257
- I wish we had some booze.
- Yeah.

394
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,630
Check my bag.

395
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,499
Doctor in Germany gave me
a bottle of schnapps.

396
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,976
And a tough night here at the arena
for the home team.

397
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,637
- Thank you.
- All right.

398
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,790
Not bad.

399
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,890
I mean, what you really want
after a fight is whiskey

400
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,826
'cause it mellows you out.

401
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,127
If you want to get mean, you drink gin,

402
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,169
vodka if you want to zone out,

403
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,261
and you save tequila
for when you want to get crazy.

404
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,929
She didn't need tequila tonight.

405
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,742
Did anybody see a straw around here?

406
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,340
No. Why?

407
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,906
'Cause if you drink through a straw,

408
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,815
it gets you drunker.

409
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,875
That's not true.

410
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,148
Of course it is.

411
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,154
That's ridiculous.

412
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,123
How could that be true?

413
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,184
Well, I don't really know how it works.

414
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,355
It just... It...

415
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,661
It just gets in...
It just goes in faster.

416
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,860
Oh, it's just one of...

417
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,402
one of the mysteries of life?

418
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,438
- Is that what you're saying?
- Uh-huh.

419
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,671
Shit, man.

420
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,373
You okay?

421
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,775
I was...

422
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,149
You know.

423
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,251
Sorry.

424
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,963
Honey, it's me.

425
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,365
You there?

426
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,369
Pick up.

427
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,966
Okay. Well, we got held up a little bit,

428
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,010
but we'll be rolling in
in about two hours or so.

429
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,052
Is that the Mississippi?

430
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,484
That's it.

431
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,425
I always wanted to go
on one of those riverboats.

432
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,087
You know?
Do you think maybe we could stop?

433
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,493
No.

434
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,154
Pat!

435
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,790
Pat!

436
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,002
Honey! I'm home!

437
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,568
Honey?

438
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,781
Sure you got the right house?

439
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,150
Yeah.

440
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,587
Can't believe your own dog
doesn't know you.

441
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,182
We don't have a dog.

442
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,530
Yes, sir.

443
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:18,098
You have a good life here, Cheaver.

444
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,016
There you are.

445
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,088
Fred.

446
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,091
You're home.

447
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,773
I missed you.

448
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,870
God, I missed you.

449
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,913
Let me get the dog to stop.

450
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,414
Whose dog is that?

451
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,911
Mine.

452
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,218
No, no, no.

453
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,693
Pogo, you come with me.
Yes. You come with me.

454
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,389
Yes. Yes. Yes.

455
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,523
I'm gonna put you in here for a while.

456
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,794
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

457
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,267
Mommy loves you.

458
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,663
So.

459
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,101
Where you been all my life?

460
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,278
How's your back?

461
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,783
It's fine.

462
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,717
Doesn't matter now.

463
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,311
Scott spent the night at Brad's house.

464
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,619
He should be back soon.

465
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,885
Great.

466
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,789
Where are your friends?

467
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,657
They're out back.

468
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,432
Don't you think we should get them?

469
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,729
Well, sure. Yeah.

470
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,360
- Let 'em in.
- Okay.

471
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,370
Welcome.

472
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,448
Can I get you something to drink?

473
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,847
Yeah.

474
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,719
Do you want one, Fred?

475
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,618
No. Thanks.

476
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,655
Well, I bet you're all glad to be back.

477
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,422
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

478
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,892
Excuse me for a minute.

479
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,299
Sit down.

480
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:44,987
So.

481
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,853
How are you?

482
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,120
Fine.

483
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,856
Are you sure?

484
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,862
Is anything wrong?

485
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,922
No. Nothing.

486
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,466
Something's wrong.

487
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,163
I don't see you

488
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,969
for almost two years, and then...

489
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:06,976
I don't know.

490
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,104
Well...

491
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,772
I don't know, either.

492
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:17,684
Well, I guess they say that...

493
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,816
you know, that...

494
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,326
it's difficult at first, and...

495
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,692
I'm sorry. I jus... I really am.

496
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,026
I just can't do this.

497
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,192
Everyone told me to wait,
but I don't see the point.

498
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,403
You know me.
I'm no good at pretending.

499
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,531
Pretending about what?

500
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,366
Fred, you're not gonna like this.

501
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,401
Okay.

502
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,010
Okay.

503
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,245
I think I w...

504
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,885
I need a divorce.

505
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,889
What?

506
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,585
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,629
But to go around pretending
for a week that it's not true,

508
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,288
well, that didn't seem fair to you, either.

509
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,856
Wait a minute...

510
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,596
I come home, and...

511
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,467
Why do...
Why do you want a divorce?

512
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,943
I didn't plan it this way.

513
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,139
It just happened. You were gone.

514
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,183
I'm sorry, but I've moved on.

515
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,746
You gotta be kidding.

516
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,118
I got a new job, and I'm finally happy.

517
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,488
Finally happy? What...

518
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,458
You mean you weren't...
you weren't happy before?

519
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,391
Well, I guess I was. I don't know.

520
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,019
I... I...

521
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,301
You seeing someone else?

522
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:40,132
- No.
- You can tell me.

523
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,196
I'm not seeing anyone else.

524
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,934
I don't want to see anyone else.

525
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,135
I'm happy being alone.

526
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,577
I want to be alone.

527
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,945
I know that sounds harsh,
but it's the truth.

528
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,984
I am happy.

529
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,121
Without you.

530
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,658
Oh, my God.

531
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,990
This is what makes a guy flip out.

532
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,657
He's gonna strangle her.

533
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,165
If it were you,
you wouldn't strangle her.

534
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,065
Okay.

535
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,763
Shoot her. Whatever.

536
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,336
Hey.

537
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,971
- What's up?
- Hi.

538
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,016
Who are you?

539
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,018
Friends of your dad.

540
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,986
My dad?

541
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,578
- He's...
- Scott.

542
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,788
Dad!

543
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,795
It's good to see you.

544
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,724
Wow! Look at you.

545
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,301
How are you?

546
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,536
I'm good.

547
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,477
How are you?

548
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,978
Just great.

549
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,347
So.

550
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,079
Did Mom tell you?

551
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,985
Yeah.

552
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,182
You surprised?

553
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,487
Yeah.

554
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,423
Can you believe it?

555
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,523
Stanford.

556
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,465
- What?
- I got into Stanford.

557
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,627
What?

558
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,795
Yeah, I got in!

559
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,168
You got into...

560
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,228
I got into Stanford.

561
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,672
Oh, yeah!

562
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,039
Oh, my... Yes! All right!

563
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,509
- I did it.
- I knew you could do it!

564
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,842
Yeah, and I got a scholarship
that'll pay for half the tuition.

565
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,212
- Fantastic.
- And I made six grand working this year.

566
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,446
- Excellent.
- And I need $20,000 to pay for the rest.

567
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,350
That's not so great.

568
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,449
Well, I told him I'm not sure
we can come up with the $20,000.

569
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,723
It's doable.

570
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,630
I'll just get my old job back,
and if we have to,

571
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,565
we'll take a second mortgage
on the house.

572
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,398
We have a second mortgage already.

573
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,600
Well, then we'll sell
the fucking house, all right?

574
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,235
Okay. Well, it took the Schneiders
two years to sell theirs.

575
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,405
I need the money in three weeks
or I lose my place.

576
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,574
I'll get you the money.

577
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,810
I promise.

578
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,051
Can I talk to you?

579
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,522
What are we doing here?
We should be focused on Scott.

580
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,619
I am focused on Scott.

581
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,824
We gotta make sure we can do this for him,
pool our resources, whatever it takes.

582
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,460
Why do you need a divorce right now?
I just don't get it.

583
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,901
I'm sorry, Fred.

584
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,802
But this is what I want to do.

585
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,363
Now, I've had some papers drawn up,

586
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:34,207
and I just want to stick to the plan.

587
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,255
Listen. We're gonna keep it together.

588
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,124
We're gonna stay calm.

589
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,892
Look, there's no killing yourself
or anyone else, okay?

590
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,228
Hey, you're gonna get through this.

591
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,324
All right? Do you hear me?

592
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,338
This is fine right here.

593
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,973
Here you go.

594
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,142
Cheaver.

595
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,244
Cheaver.

596
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,584
Come on, what's your plan?

597
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,988
I'll take you guys to the airport

598
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,152
and then I'm gonna drive
straight to Salt Lake,

599
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,216
see my brother.

600
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,788
I'm not going back home.

601
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,196
I can tell you that much.

602
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,132
What about your kid?

603
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,501
I'll figure something out.

604
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,267
Your brother should lend you the money.

605
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,707
My brother is in Debtors Anonymous.

606
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,007
Fred?

607
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,505
I thought that was you.
You're back.

608
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,515
Hey, Carl.

609
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,778
- Hi.
- What's up?

610
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:48,819
How'd it go over there?

611
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,478
Great.

612
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,886
You know, it went great.

613
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,253
Well, we all missed you...

614
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,518
you know, seeing you every day.

615
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,618
Well, I'm coming back.

616
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,218
I'm just gonna take a few days off,

617
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,355
and then it's nose-to-the-grindstone time.

618
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,365
I gotta earn some money.

619
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,491
Yeah.

620
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,469
But, you know,
since Alan's been in charge,

621
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,471
he's just been running
the company into the ground,

622
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,700
and then that lawsuit...
you heard about that.

623
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,242
No.

624
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,111
Already laid off 60 guys, including me.

625
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,639
Shit.

626
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,049
They're shutting down
the whole place next month, so...

627
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,043
Fuck.

628
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,557
Yeah.

629
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,590
Fuck!

630
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,393
- Hey!
- Fuck!

631
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,660
Oh, my goodness.

632
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,996
Fuck!

633
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,627
Okay, there's no need for that.

634
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,000
Take good care of yourself.

635
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,705
Don't drive straight through, okay?

636
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,905
You'll get into a wreck.

637
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,915
Not a bad idea.

638
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,245
What?

639
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,285
Catch a telephone pole going 90.

640
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,854
Collect some life insurance money.

641
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,911
No, no, no.

642
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,218
No, no. Forget that.

643
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,849
'Cause insurance doesn't pay for suicide.

644
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,224
Yeah. Not if it's an accident.

645
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,059
- Enough with the crazy talk, please.
- Yeah.

646
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,359
- You're not being serious...
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

647
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,990
- Okay, good. Good.
- It's just a joke.

648
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,591
Yeah, have a nice flight.

649
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,103
And good luck to you.

650
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,231
- All right.
- Drive safe.

651
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,235
- You're on the wrong side, pal.
- Yeah, I know.

652
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,678
You know what?
It's all right, 'cause I'm driving anyway.

653
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,977
What?

654
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,244
We're coming with you.

655
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,808
- No, you're not.
- Yep.

656
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,978
Of course we are.

657
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,351
- No, you're not. You got a...
- Yes.

658
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,889
You have a flight to catch.

659
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,822
We'll fly out of Salt Lake City.

660
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,416
I feel pathetic enough, all right?

661
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,791
Crying don't mean you're pathetic, okay?

662
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,762
I'm fine.

663
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,798
Yeah, you're great.

664
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,162
That's why we're coming with you.

665
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,566
We want to meet your whole family.

666
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,341
This is what you gotta do.

667
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,645
Okay, Cheaver, you gotta get
your finances in order.

668
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,242
All right, you buy a house,

669
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,310
you gotta have an exit plan.

670
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,049
You gotta know how
you're gonna sell it.

671
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,016
You're right.

672
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,561
Hey, easy there, cowboy.

673
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,920
It's for my back.

674
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,794
So what you gotta do

675
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,735
is buy an apartment house, rent it out,

676
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,203
live in the basement for free.

677
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,208
Six months later, you borrow on it
and buy another one.

678
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,343
Am I still living in the basement?

679
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,744
Absolutely.

680
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,875
Take a left.

681
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,679
You can get around this.

682
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,555
Yeah, a man's gotta be indispensable.

683
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,650
You want to move up in the world,
you gotta have skills.

684
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,126
Basic skills.

685
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,628
Yeah, what are your skills?

686
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,221
Leadership.

687
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,891
I'm a leader.

688
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,434
Me, too.

689
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,094
No, you're a private.

690
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,536
That's the opposite of a leader.

691
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,073
You know computer?

692
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,699
Yeah, kinda.

693
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,177
You're at a disadvantage
if you don't master computer skills.

694
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,075
You gotta build on that.

695
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,119
Learn a new word every day, and...

696
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,881
get comfortable with it.

697
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,989
Do you know where you're going here?

698
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,059
I got a sense of it.

699
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,563
I think you might be making your way
around to the east.

700
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,056
No. I'm good.

701
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,601
Cheaver, we going the right wa...

702
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,602
Do you think he's okay?

703
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,108
He took a ton of those pills.

704
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,336
Cheaver!

705
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,543
Wake up, man!

706
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,315
Cheaver!

707
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,547
Come on, man! Wake up!

708
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,455
T.K., watch it!

709
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,458
Oh, my God.

710
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,933
Holy shit!

711
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,606
Oh, my God.

712
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,971
Are you all right?

713
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,142
Yeah.

714
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,448
Oh, my God, T.K., you're so lucky.

715
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,317
Yeah, well...

716
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,118
I'm a lucky guy.

717
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,990
What the hell were you doing, T. K?

718
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,861
- He stopped short.
- It was a red light.

719
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,399
It was a red light.

720
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,294
There's nothing I could do.
He stopped...

721
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,338
I can't fucking afford it!

722
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,840
Hey, guys.

723
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,736
I think it opened up.

724
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,573
Come on, keep pressure on it.

725
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,084
They said a left at Templeton.

726
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,954
Did you see Templeton?

727
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,154
There it is.

728
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,725
What the hell?

729
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,172
We need a doctor.

730
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,265
Well, the doctor isn't in till 3:00,

731
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,639
so you're gonna have to wait.

732
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,575
Oh, it can't wait.
Is there a nurse?

733
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,874
No.

734
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,879
You know what?

735
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,880
I'm gonna treat her myself.

736
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,881
What do you mean?

737
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,713
I'm a doctor. An Army medic.

738
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,685
You can't just go in there!

739
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,983
You have to wait!

740
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,124
Yikes.

741
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,326
Here, you're gonna
have to take off your pants.

742
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,925
Yeah.

743
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,809
- Does that hurt?
- It's okay.

744
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,613
Have you ever done this before?

745
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,924
No.

746
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,825
But sometimes you gotta put things out

747
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,556
just to get things done, you know?

748
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,723
Mm-hmm.

749
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,701
You're gonna be fine.

750
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,069
Hey, thanks.

751
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,507
No problem.

752
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,776
Hey, you mind if I use your phone?

753
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,389
Hey, babe.

754
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,482
Sorry I missed you,

755
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,891
and I do miss you,

756
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:16,490
but I'm gonna be
another day or two, so...

757
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,591
I love you. Okay.

758
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,226
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

759
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,146
How you doing, Cheaver?

760
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,142
I'm okay.

761
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,243
Yeah, you gotta give us those pills.

762
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,651
We're not gonna let you off yourself.

763
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,225
If you kill yourself, Cheaver,
do you know where you go?

764
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,087
Hell?

765
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,663
Worse.

766
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,362
The Lake of Fire.

767
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,369
Lake of Fire?

768
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,370
Yeah.

769
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,770
You don't want to go there.

770
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,067
I feel like I'm in it.

771
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,914
Hello.

772
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,040
Theodore?

773
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,606
Yeah.

774
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,619
I think it's your girlfriend.

775
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,247
Hey, baby. How are you?

776
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,948
No. No.

777
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,583
No, the other guy got shot in the leg.

778
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,128
He's the one whose wife left him,
so we're driving him to Salt Lake City,

779
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,187
and then I'm going right home.
Okay, babe?

780
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,000
No, I'm with two guys.

781
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,030
All right. Well, let...

782
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,006
Let me call you back, okay?

783
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,906
I love you, too, baby.

784
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,207
Okay. All right. Bye.

785
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,948
Oh, my Lord. You're one good liar.

786
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,350
You know that?

787
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,251
But just so you know,
that's not a good thing.

788
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,017
That just makes you a big phony.

789
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,718
Well, most of what I said was true.

790
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,761
Except you forgot the part
about the tittie bars.

791
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,456
That's 'cause I'm not going
to a tittie bar.

792
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,433
Seems to me if you can't tell
your soul mate the truth,

793
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,560
then maybe she's not
really your soul mate.

794
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,231
I didn't say she was my soul mate.

795
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,604
If Randy lied to me...

796
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,337
I'd take that guitar,

797
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,610
and I would bust it over his head
and the damn lap dancers, too.

798
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,275
There's no lap dancer!

799
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,253
Okay, so tell her the truth.

800
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,221
Why can't you just tell her the truth?

801
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,688
Forget it. Just...

802
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:21,690
I don't get it.

803
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,386
What's the big problem?

804
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,519
- The big problem?
- Yeah.

805
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,723
Is that I got wounded in the dick.
That's the big problem.

806
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,958
What?

807
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,193
But I thought you said...

808
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,826
Yeah, and it doesn't work.

809
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,394
I can't get it up.
Okay? You happy?

810
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,269
No.

811
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,637
Why are you going to Vegas?

812
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,907
I got the name of a place in Vegas
where they got real pros,

813
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,914
and I'm gonna see if they can get me hard.

814
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,210
Hookers?

815
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,410
No. High-end girls who know
how to handle special cases.

816
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,917
Why don't you let your fiancée do it?

817
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,956
Because she doesn't know
where I'm wounded.

818
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,753
She's not gonna be interested
if she knows I'm not working right.

819
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,794
- No. You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do know that.

820
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,226
You gotta give her a chance.

821
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,527
If it's not working,
she and I got nothing to talk about.

822
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,964
Well...

823
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:09,130
even if it doesn't work,
you can still pleasure her.

824
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,138
That's true.

825
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,301
Yep. He can do threesomes.

826
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,503
With another girl.

827
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:15,738
No, another guy.

828
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,045
The guy does it with T.K.'s fiancée
while T.K. watches.

829
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,516
- Just...
- Colee...

830
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,883
Or you can use a vibrator.

831
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,514
They make 'em real lifelike these days.

832
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,421
You can even strap it on,

833
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,983
or, you know, they can put
this thing inside your penis.

834
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:35,794
It's like a balloon, and all you gotta do
is just pump it, pump it up.

835
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:36,798
- Colee?
- Yeah?

836
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,061
Enough.

837
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,933
Well, it's just about
how much you love her.

838
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,605
Rent-a-car folks gave me
the go-ahead, so I can do it.

839
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,116
But there are about five jobs ahead of you.

840
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,209
- Shit.
- All right.

841
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,678
So, what are you doing after Vegas?

842
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,345
Gonna go see your mom or...

843
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,389
I haven't spoke to my mom
in three years.

844
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,788
No?

845
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,021
Why not?

846
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,427
She kicked me out
of the house when I was 16.

847
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,965
Wanted to spend more alone time
with her boyfriend.

848
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,268
The only people
I really want to talk to now

849
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,399
are Randy's family.

850
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,001
I'm gonna stay with them from now on.

851
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:58,809
Well, you can use my phone,
tell them we're running late.

852
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,679
No, that's okay.

853
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,616
They don't even know I'm coming.

854
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:06,980
They don't?

855
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,888
Nope.

856
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,868
You know that family
Colee's bringing the guitar to?

857
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,169
She thinks she's gonna live with them.

858
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,109
They're gonna be her family.

859
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,876
That girl's living in a dream world.

860
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,117
Plus she's got no skills.

861
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,069
Thanks.

862
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,882
Looks good.

863
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,214
Where's Colee?

864
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,344
I don't know.

865
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,354
- That girl you were with?
- Yeah.

866
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,583
I think she went across
the street to the church.

867
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,509
Can I help you?

868
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,411
We're just looking for someone.

869
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,244
Are you friends of Colee?

870
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,546
- Yeah.
- She told me to look out for you.

871
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,245
Just come this way.

872
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:52,484
He stopped me and then he said,
"What do you do?

873
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:56,225
"What do I do?"
"What business are you in?"

874
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,236
And it's funny 'cause I always say,
"Well, I'm in the love business."

875
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,237
And don't you know the Lord himself

876
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:08,335
is chairman of the board
of this love business.

877
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,471
Think about it.

878
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,072
He is, isn't he?

879
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,051
And so then, you've got to ask yourself,

880
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,848
don't you want to be
in business with the Lord?

881
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,116
Hey! Come on in.

882
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,953
I know I sure do.

883
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,652
'Cause the Lord takes responsibility

884
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,354
even when you make mistakes,
doesn't he?

885
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,726
He's really good, isn't he?

886
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,561
That's what I call a good C.E.O.

887
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,034
Now, in the spirit of our Lord,
who died for our sins,

888
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,230
let's reach out to each other
with a greeting of peace.

889
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:39,036
Peace be with you.

890
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,304
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah, I know.

891
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,845
Peace be with you.

892
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,415
Now remember the folks behind you, too.

893
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,249
- Don't be shy.
- Peace be with you.

894
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,652
And if any of you are troubled,

895
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,659
I encourage you to speak out.

896
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,558
Testify.

897
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,531
I'm hoping you can pray for us.

898
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,060
We're soldiers home on leave,
and my friends here are troubled.

899
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,834
Cheaver has a very bad back
and a broken marriage

900
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,603
and he wants to take his own life.

901
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,838
And T.K.'s wounded
in the private parts,

902
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,881
which is why he's lying to his fiancée
about going to whores.

903
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:27,387
Thank you, sister.

904
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,651
Lord, bring your healing touch

905
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,249
to Sister Margaret's arthritis...

906
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,687
and give her daughter strength and faith

907
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,256
in the final days of her pregnancy.

908
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:38,665
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

909
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,127
And be sure to say a prayer...

910
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,194
Please stand, sir.

911
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,536
Get up.

912
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,078
It's your turn.

913
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,052
Lord, help these soldiers,

914
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:02,523
who have given so much for this country.

915
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:06,722
Ease the burden of pain
from Brother Cheaver's back

916
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,992
and heal his broken spirit.

917
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,363
Amen.

918
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,629
And for Brother T.K., make his wounded...

919
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,330
whole again.

920
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,339
Amen.

921
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,872
You soldiers from Kansas City?

922
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,711
No, sir.
We're just passing through.

923
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,410
Well, I hope you're hungry.

924
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,316
We're having quite a shindig tonight.

925
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,718
Happens to be my birthday.

926
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,119
Happy Birthday.

927
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,589
That's very nice of you but...

928
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:38,150
I'm Stan Tilson, and you don't need
to be polite about it.

929
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,163
I want you folks to come and that's it.

930
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,728
We don't have time for this.

931
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,171
Well, you can't say no
to that kind of invitation.

932
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,038
Half of healing is fellowship.

933
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,943
We'll have a quick bite
and be on our way.

934
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,883
Ah, welcome, welcome.

935
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,481
Now, we don't start for a little while,

936
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:11,220
but you folks make yourselves
right at home.

937
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,697
What are those?

938
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,289
Lobster.

939
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,696
Big lobster.

940
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,170
- Ask her for umbrellas.
- How many chairs do we need?

941
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,767
I've got five set up here,
so I need to get a few more.

942
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,676
Give me a hand right here.

943
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:34,080
This guy's got some serious dough.

944
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,345
Happy Birthday.

945
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,056
Would you care for some stuffed endive?

946
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:46,255
No, thank you.

947
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,162
It really is. The place looks fabulous.

948
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,668
I work for my dad.
I work in commodities.

949
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:53,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

950
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,634
Cool. Yeah, my dad's a drill instructor.

951
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,900
Yeah, I got a brother stationed in Korea

952
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,307
and another brother
who's in basic training.

953
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,312
So your whole family's in the Army?

954
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,712
Yeah. I mean, just about.
You know, my mom's not.

955
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,807
Our whole family is in finance.

956
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,010
- Cool.
- Yeah.

957
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,383
These are the soldiers that Dad invited.

958
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,614
This is my brother Peter.

959
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,486
Right. Welcome home.

960
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,150
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

961
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,251
No, thank you.

962
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:21,024
It's a big mess over there, isn't it?

963
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,758
Well, of course it is. It's a war.

964
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,163
War is messy.

965
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,099
It can't be all perfect.

966
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,261
How would you know?

967
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,463
Well, how would you know, Peter?

968
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,836
We don't exactly see you over there.

969
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,603
But I'm not for the war.

970
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,110
I don't think it's a great thing.

971
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,271
Neither do I.

972
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,644
Since when?

973
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,273
I can change my mind, can't I?

974
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,339
Like everybody else.

975
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,648
Yeah, go ahead, change your mind.

976
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,018
But these guys are stuck over there.

977
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,523
That's not the point, Peter.
I mean, you don't get it.

978
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,752
You just don't get it.

979
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,090
You can't change your minds, can you?

980
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,562
You can't just leave?

981
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,155
No, not really.

982
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,497
We do get some R&R.

983
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,196
These guys are screwed and for what?

984
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,363
- Guys...
- For what?

985
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,304
Can we just argue about golf, please?

986
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,103
There's a lot at stake over there, Peter.

987
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,575
Yeah, a lot of money.

988
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,612
Barbara, what's the name of that woman

989
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,579
who's always trying to get
that Saturday morning tea time?

990
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,445
- Angela Morton.
- Right.

991
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,040
That's her big cause.

992
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,882
What do you really think we're fighting for?

993
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,014
What are you doing over there?

994
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,559
Honestly, we're just trying to stay alive.

995
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,788
Stay alive?

996
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,352
I bet that's not too easy.

997
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,125
Stay alive? Jesus Christ.

998
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,190
If that's your attitude,
no wonder we're losing.

999
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,530
Bob!

1000
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,001
Hey, that's nice.

1001
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,095
Well, I don't have to listen to this crap.

1002
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,537
- Come on.
- No, but you just...

1003
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,666
Can't you just shut up for once?

1004
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,906
- What?
- You always do this.

1005
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:43,911
I'm sorry.

1006
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,969
It's okay.

1007
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:45,980
It's fine.

1008
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,415
Parties are supposed to be fun.

1009
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,486
White wine, please.

1010
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,022
So you're a soldier, huh?

1011
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,022
Used to be.

1012
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,727
You saw a lot?

1013
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,736
Enough.

1014
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,638
So they have girls in the military now?

1015
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,335
Yes, ma'am.

1016
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,934
Is that your friend?

1017
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,645
The girl I'm with?

1018
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,239
We're sharing a car.

1019
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:23,946
You married?

1020
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,787
I'm separated.

1021
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,226
You?

1022
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,289
What's that mean?

1023
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,770
It means "mmm."

1024
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,306
Okay.

1025
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,814
Do you know how to dance?

1026
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,406
As a matter of fact, I do.

1027
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,575
Cheaver's got some skills.

1028
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,134
I think she likes him.

1029
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,382
Do you wanna dance?

1030
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,446
Can you dance?

1031
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,021
Of course I can dance.

1032
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,426
Nah, I meant your leg.

1033
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,396
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,901
I don't know. We could try.

1035
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,938
Does it hurt?

1036
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:51,303
Yeah, a little, I guess.

1037
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:55,037
I think if you put your foot on mine...

1038
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,601
Put my foot on yours?

1039
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,271
Yeah.

1040
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,111
- Like, on your toes?
- Sure.

1041
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,151
- How's that?
- Yeah.

1042
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,709
- We can try that.
- All right.

1043
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,753
- Yeah, that helps it.
- Does it?

1044
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,315
Okay.

1045
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:16,655
Wow.

1046
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:17,820
What?

1047
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:24,996
You actually know how to be nice.

1048
00:57:51,963 --> 00:57:54,363
Where'd Cheaver go?

1049
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:55,421
I don't know.

1050
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,494
Cheaver?

1051
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:08,569
Where the hell is he?

1052
00:58:10,281 --> 00:58:12,340
Maybe he went home with that woman.

1053
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:14,112
He better not have.

1054
00:58:14,185 --> 00:58:16,779
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

1055
00:58:16,854 --> 00:58:17,912
Cheaver!

1056
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:30,695
Nah, I don't want to stay here.

1057
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:34,363
Hey! These people are nice.

1058
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:35,963
And we gotta sleep sometime.

1059
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,099
Yeah, you could have slept
while I was driving.

1060
00:58:38,176 --> 00:58:39,643
Look, we'll find Cheaver in the morning

1061
00:58:39,711 --> 00:58:42,009
and then we'll get going, okay?

1062
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,207
I think these are the guest rooms.

1063
00:58:44,282 --> 00:58:45,579
I'm gonna take this one.

1064
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,242
- Okay.
- Okay.

1065
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:48,615
All right.

1066
00:58:52,156 --> 00:58:54,590
- Good night.
- Good night.

1067
00:59:51,149 --> 00:59:52,411
Oh, my...

1068
00:59:52,483 --> 00:59:55,475
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

1069
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:06,025
I think I found Cheaver.

1070
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,893
Oh, yeah.

1071
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,508
I think I'm fixing to come!

1072
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:36,190
Don't stop.

1073
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,557
Who's that?

1074
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:38,993
It's just my husband.

1075
01:00:39,063 --> 01:00:40,360
- What?
- Don't stop.

1076
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:41,921
Keep going.

1077
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:43,466
Give it to her good, soldier.

1078
01:00:46,237 --> 01:00:47,568
There's someone else in there.

1079
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:02,978
Cheaver, that woman wanted
to make a train with you.

1080
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:05,878
Do you still want to kill yourself?

1081
01:01:05,957 --> 01:01:07,754
Not at the moment.

1082
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:08,883
There's still hope, you know.

1083
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,450
That woman wanted you.

1084
01:01:10,528 --> 01:01:11,961
Yeah, and that man wanted you, too.

1085
01:01:12,029 --> 01:01:13,291
It's not funny.

1086
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,759
"I think I'm fixin' to come!"

1087
01:01:39,624 --> 01:01:43,219
I told this guy in the band
about Randy's guitar,

1088
01:01:43,294 --> 01:01:45,819
and he thinks it might
be worth thousands of dollars

1089
01:01:45,897 --> 01:01:48,229
or maybe even more.

1090
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,824
- Great.
- Whatever.

1091
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,488
It'd be nice to go hiking
when we get to the Rockies,

1092
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:13,148
don't you think?

1093
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:14,248
Have a picnic.

1094
01:02:14,325 --> 01:02:16,657
No.

1095
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:58,595
Denver, Colorado.

1096
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,108
Where are we?

1097
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:16,016
What are you doing?

1098
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:17,577
You'll see.

1099
01:03:37,808 --> 01:03:39,935
It's a good one.

1100
01:03:40,011 --> 01:03:43,003
I know a guy who'd come over here right now
and give you ten grand for it.

1101
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,240
10 grand?

1102
01:03:44,315 --> 01:03:45,577
10 grand.

1103
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,379
But...

1104
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:52,286
it looks like someone
just got 22 at auction.

1105
01:03:54,225 --> 01:03:56,955
$22,000?

1106
01:03:57,028 --> 01:03:59,428
It's a very special instrument
you've got there.

1107
01:03:59,497 --> 01:04:01,192
Yes, sir.

1108
01:04:04,902 --> 01:04:06,563
Jeez.

1109
01:04:06,637 --> 01:04:10,073
$22,000!

1110
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:12,974
You didn't believe me.

1111
01:04:13,044 --> 01:04:16,309
No, I thought it was just a stolen guitar.

1112
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,404
It's not stolen.

1113
01:04:17,481 --> 01:04:18,948
It belonged to his daddy.

1114
01:04:19,016 --> 01:04:20,574
But he stole something, right?

1115
01:04:20,651 --> 01:04:22,346
Yeah, he robbed a casino.

1116
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,978
Lucky Jim's.

1117
01:04:24,055 --> 01:04:25,249
That's right.

1118
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:26,585
Walked in there by himself,

1119
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:28,682
and he walked out with $50,000.

1120
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:32,661
So Randy was, like, a bad ass, right?

1121
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,958
Yeah.

1122
01:04:34,031 --> 01:04:35,862
He was a good person, too, you know.

1123
01:04:35,933 --> 01:04:37,366
Came from a great family.

1124
01:04:37,435 --> 01:04:41,132
- He just robbed a little bit, is that it?
- Hello?

1125
01:04:41,205 --> 01:04:43,765
- Hey, Scott.
- Why'd he start robbing?

1126
01:04:43,841 --> 01:04:45,900
He just got, you know,
into a little bit of trouble.

1127
01:04:45,977 --> 01:04:49,504
Well, your mom and me have...

1128
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:53,414
some things we have to sort out.

1129
01:04:56,754 --> 01:04:58,654
No, no, it has nothing to do with that.

1130
01:04:58,723 --> 01:05:00,384
You're going to Stanford.

1131
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:03,359
We're gonna get you to Stanford.

1132
01:05:03,427 --> 01:05:05,759
No.

1133
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:08,890
No, no, no.
That is not a good idea.

1134
01:05:08,966 --> 01:05:11,434
No. Do not do that.

1135
01:05:11,502 --> 01:05:13,299
I will get you the money.

1136
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:16,033
I will take care of it.
I said I will and I will.

1137
01:05:16,107 --> 01:05:20,066
Promise me you will not do that.

1138
01:05:22,313 --> 01:05:24,679
All right.

1139
01:05:24,749 --> 01:05:28,583
I'll call you later.

1140
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,280
All right. And...

1141
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:33,288
I love you.

1142
01:05:33,357 --> 01:05:34,722
Fuck.

1143
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:38,621
So what's up?

1144
01:05:39,797 --> 01:05:43,494
Kid thinks he's got it all figured out.

1145
01:05:43,567 --> 01:05:46,661
He's gonna get the money by enlisting
in the fucking Army.

1146
01:05:46,737 --> 01:05:48,637
$20,000 signing bonus,

1147
01:05:48,706 --> 01:05:50,765
has to put off college
for God knows how many years,

1148
01:05:50,841 --> 01:05:52,331
but he's okay with that.

1149
01:05:53,511 --> 01:05:55,741
Well, that sounds like a pretty good idea.

1150
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:57,337
That is not a good idea.

1151
01:05:57,415 --> 01:05:58,848
They'll send him right over there.

1152
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:00,144
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1153
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:04,720
Maybe he could go to a state school.

1154
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:06,916
No. You got a shot at Stanford,

1155
01:06:06,991 --> 01:06:08,049
you go to Stanford.

1156
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:09,490
Exactly.

1157
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:16,729
The problem is you can't
go there for free, you know.

1158
01:06:16,801 --> 01:06:19,463
I gotta get the money.
Get the money.

1159
01:06:19,537 --> 01:06:23,234
I'm gonna just...
I'll get the money.

1160
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:29,141
I'm worried about you, Cheaver.

1161
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:33,380
I'll figure something out.

1162
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:36,750
If you're so worried about him,
why don't you give him that guitar of yours?

1163
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:40,018
What? I can't give him Randy's guitar.

1164
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:42,184
Why not? It's a stolen guitar.

1165
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:43,726
It's not stolen.

1166
01:06:43,794 --> 01:06:47,093
It belongs to his family.

1167
01:06:47,164 --> 01:06:49,689
Besides, I mean, I don't see
the problem, you know.

1168
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:52,327
I enlisted and I went over there.

1169
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:53,893
Yeah, but what choice did you have?

1170
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:57,771
And if I was gonna sell the guitar,
don't you think I'd use it

1171
01:06:57,842 --> 01:06:59,434
to pay for my own goddamn college?

1172
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,137
Yeah, but it wouldn't be Stanford.

1173
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:03,737
You don't know that.

1174
01:07:03,814 --> 01:07:06,510
Come on, the guy's gonna kill himself
if you don't give him that guitar.

1175
01:07:06,584 --> 01:07:09,417
I'm not gonna kill myself,
and I don't need your guitar.

1176
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:11,148
All right, what are you gonna do then?

1177
01:07:11,222 --> 01:07:12,814
I'm gonna skip Salt Lake,

1178
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,983
I'm gonna go to Vegas with you guys,

1179
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:17,687
I'm gonna borrow some money
off my credit card,

1180
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:20,059
and I'm gonna turn it into $20,000.

1181
01:07:20,131 --> 01:07:21,723
Oh, you gonna play poker?

1182
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:23,664
No, I was thinking roulette.

1183
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:25,065
You play red and black,

1184
01:07:25,136 --> 01:07:27,696
guess the right color three times,
I got the money.

1185
01:07:27,771 --> 01:07:29,705
If I was you,
I'd stick to the skills games...

1186
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:31,468
either blackjack or Texas hold 'em.

1187
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:33,373
But whatever you do,
just stay away from craps.

1188
01:07:33,444 --> 01:07:36,004
That is the stupidest idea.

1189
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,377
Why?

1190
01:07:37,448 --> 01:07:39,848
It's crazy.

1191
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:42,750
You can't just go to Vegas
and make $20,000.

1192
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,117
That's just... You're dreamin'.

1193
01:07:44,188 --> 01:07:46,053
Wait a minute. He's dreaming?

1194
01:07:46,123 --> 01:07:47,454
Yeah.

1195
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:49,390
He's the one who's got the stupid idea?

1196
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:52,520
You're traveling
all the way across country

1197
01:07:52,596 --> 01:07:55,121
to visit a family that you've never even met.

1198
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,463
Like, they don't know you're coming.

1199
01:07:57,535 --> 01:07:59,799
They don't even know you exist.

1200
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:01,804
You think they're gonna
love you or take care of you?

1201
01:08:01,872 --> 01:08:03,840
Like, he's not the one who's dreaming.

1202
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:07,542
Christ.

1203
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:09,636
Are you...

1204
01:08:09,713 --> 01:08:11,146
You gotta be kiddin...

1205
01:08:11,215 --> 01:08:13,206
I don't want him to lose his money.

1206
01:08:13,284 --> 01:08:16,879
Listen. Don't worry about me, okay?

1207
01:08:16,954 --> 01:08:18,387
Don't worry about me.

1208
01:08:18,455 --> 01:08:20,286
I have to give 'em the guitar.

1209
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:23,258
I have to give it to them.

1210
01:08:23,327 --> 01:08:26,160
- But they don't even know you.
- I don't know you!

1211
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:29,996
Whoever heard of giving $20,000
to someone that you just met?

1212
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:33,059
Yeah, but the guy's desperate.
He's all fucked up.

1213
01:08:33,137 --> 01:08:34,297
Enough.

1214
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:35,838
I can pay for my own kid's college.

1215
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:37,635
I'm just trying to help you, man.

1216
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,175
You wanna talk about fucked up?

1217
01:08:39,243 --> 01:08:40,676
Look in the mirror.

1218
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,375
I'm not the one trying to kill myself, buddy.

1219
01:09:14,245 --> 01:09:17,009
Colee...

1220
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:18,378
Colee stop crying.

1221
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:21,441
I can't give you the guitar.

1222
01:09:21,518 --> 01:09:24,214
I can't give it to you.

1223
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:26,722
I know. It's okay.

1224
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:29,987
It's not okay.

1225
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,188
I want to give it to you,
but then I won't have...

1226
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:37,423
I won't have anywhere to go.

1227
01:09:47,711 --> 01:09:50,908
Colee. Come on, Colee.

1228
01:09:50,981 --> 01:09:52,778
All right, listen.

1229
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,978
How about you stop crying
and we'll stop.

1230
01:09:57,054 --> 01:09:58,214
What do you mean?

1231
01:09:58,289 --> 01:10:00,189
You been wanting to sightsee, right?

1232
01:10:01,225 --> 01:10:02,522
Yeah.

1233
01:10:02,593 --> 01:10:05,426
Okay, so we'll go somewhere,
do something.

1234
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:09,565
Could we have a picnic?

1235
01:10:11,101 --> 01:10:12,295
Yeah, a picnic. Whatever.

1236
01:10:12,369 --> 01:10:13,393
Yeah.

1237
01:10:44,134 --> 01:10:46,364
You know, you can leave
your guitar in the car.

1238
01:10:46,437 --> 01:10:48,371
I'm not gonna steal it.

1239
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,108
Well, you might not think you are,

1240
01:10:52,176 --> 01:10:53,768
but I'm not chancing it.

1241
01:10:53,844 --> 01:10:56,074
I don't want to get ditched.

1242
01:10:56,146 --> 01:10:58,137
Why? Does that happen to you a lot?

1243
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:04,282
Look at these rocks.

1244
01:11:04,355 --> 01:11:06,016
That's a skipping rock.

1245
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:07,421
That would go far, huh?

1246
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:08,958
Yep.

1247
01:11:09,026 --> 01:11:10,960
Hey, that's a fossil.

1248
01:11:11,028 --> 01:11:12,086
That's a nice one.

1249
01:11:12,162 --> 01:11:14,392
- It is?
- A mollusk. See?

1250
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:19,860
The poor little guy
winds up getting squished

1251
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:21,996
between two rocks.

1252
01:11:28,946 --> 01:11:31,176
Why do we have to go back?

1253
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,485
I like it here. It's fun.

1254
01:12:11,488 --> 01:12:13,820
Oh, fuck.

1255
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:16,758
- T.K.
- What?

1256
01:12:16,827 --> 01:12:18,089
Guess what.

1257
01:12:18,162 --> 01:12:19,561
What?

1258
01:12:21,865 --> 01:12:24,857
I got your problem solved.

1259
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:27,369
What problem?

1260
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:30,430
I was in the bathroom

1261
01:12:30,507 --> 01:12:33,032
and I met these real nice girls,

1262
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:35,601
and they travel around
in that RV over there.

1263
01:12:37,014 --> 01:12:39,778
And what they do
is they're sex workers.

1264
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,442
But they're real professional.

1265
01:12:41,518 --> 01:12:43,679
And I told them about
your problem and they said...

1266
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:47,212
- You gotta stop telling people that!
- But they said they could take care of it.

1267
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:48,656
And they said they'd give you a discount

1268
01:12:48,725 --> 01:12:50,488
'cause you're a serviceman
wounded in the war.

1269
01:12:50,561 --> 01:12:51,994
Sounds like a good deal to me.

1270
01:12:52,062 --> 01:12:54,257
That's what I thought.

1271
01:12:55,265 --> 01:12:57,062
What do you think?

1272
01:13:05,042 --> 01:13:06,407
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

1273
01:13:06,477 --> 01:13:09,207
- Hi.
- So here he is.

1274
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:10,507
This is T.K.

1275
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:14,073
T.K., this is Brandi,
Kendra and Savannah.

1276
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:15,743
- Hey.
- Hey.

1277
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:17,218
So how does this work?

1278
01:13:17,287 --> 01:13:19,312
Does he just pick one of you or...

1279
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:21,584
Yep, or he can have all three.

1280
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,118
How much?

1281
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:26,924
He's so cute, I'll do it for free.

1282
01:13:26,997 --> 01:13:28,521
For free?

1283
01:13:28,599 --> 01:13:29,588
How does that sound?

1284
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:32,899
Don't worry. She'll get it going.

1285
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,562
If she can't, nobody can.

1286
01:13:36,306 --> 01:13:38,501
You come with me.

1287
01:13:39,943 --> 01:13:41,035
Okay.

1288
01:13:43,213 --> 01:13:44,339
You're all right?

1289
01:13:48,185 --> 01:13:49,982
We're here for ya.

1290
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:58,726
- Colee?
- Yeah?

1291
01:13:58,795 --> 01:14:00,160
Come on.

1292
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:04,734
You all right?

1293
01:14:06,003 --> 01:14:07,937
Yeah.

1294
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:11,803
- What?
- Colee.

1295
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:14,343
No good deed goes unpunished.

1296
01:14:20,684 --> 01:14:22,345
- What's wrong?
- I got to...

1297
01:14:22,419 --> 01:14:23,386
You getting cold feet?

1298
01:14:23,453 --> 01:14:25,148
No, I gotta get something in my stomach...

1299
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:26,587
What's the problem?

1300
01:14:26,657 --> 01:14:29,091
I haven't eaten anything except a hot dog
in the last 24 hours.

1301
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:30,820
So what? Eat later.

1302
01:14:30,894 --> 01:14:32,555
Well, I need to up my electrolytes.

1303
01:14:32,629 --> 01:14:34,028
You know, I need
a PowerBar or a Gatorade...

1304
01:14:34,097 --> 01:14:35,621
Okay. Do you have anything like that?

1305
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:39,567
No. We just got Coke and tossed salad

1306
01:14:39,636 --> 01:14:41,331
and Marlboro Lights.

1307
01:14:41,405 --> 01:14:43,396
Hey, T.K., I saw a store on the way in.

1308
01:14:43,473 --> 01:14:45,373
All right, well...

1309
01:14:45,442 --> 01:14:48,775
I guess they're gonna go to the store.

1310
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:53,548
Get me a fried egg sandwich on a roll!

1311
01:15:02,092 --> 01:15:03,787
Are you mad at me?

1312
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,226
No.

1313
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:08,457
I'm sorry.

1314
01:15:08,532 --> 01:15:11,695
I was just trying to help.

1315
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:13,793
I should just keep my big mouth shut.

1316
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,667
Don't worry about it.

1317
01:15:21,812 --> 01:15:23,973
Wow, look at those clouds.

1318
01:15:41,832 --> 01:15:43,766
Wow, it's really coming down.

1319
01:15:50,774 --> 01:15:52,833
That's a good one.

1320
01:16:05,222 --> 01:16:06,917
This is unbelievable.

1321
01:16:27,611 --> 01:16:30,045
Wow.

1322
01:16:36,153 --> 01:16:37,814
Holy shit.

1323
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:40,186
Holy shit is right.

1324
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:45,794
Get out of the car.

1325
01:16:47,164 --> 01:16:48,392
I'm not getting out of the car.

1326
01:16:48,465 --> 01:16:49,989
You stay in this car you might die.

1327
01:16:50,067 --> 01:16:51,796
If I leave the car I might die.

1328
01:16:51,868 --> 01:16:55,360
T.K., open the door and get out.

1329
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:27,802
It's okay.

1330
01:17:27,871 --> 01:17:30,499
You're gonna be fine.

1331
01:17:45,355 --> 01:17:49,655
Okay. Is it gone?

1332
01:17:49,726 --> 01:17:52,627
Oh, my God.

1333
01:17:52,696 --> 01:17:54,163
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1334
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:55,892
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1335
01:17:55,966 --> 01:17:58,491
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1336
01:18:00,537 --> 01:18:02,334
- Is it working?
- What?

1337
01:18:02,405 --> 01:18:03,963
Is it working?

1338
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,974
As a matter of fact, yeah, I think...

1339
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:08,772
Yeah, it's working
pretty good right now, so...

1340
01:18:08,845 --> 01:18:11,075
That's great.

1341
01:18:11,148 --> 01:18:13,082
Oh, no. Okay.

1342
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:14,117
Yeah, that's working.

1343
01:18:14,184 --> 01:18:17,551
That's great.

1344
01:18:17,621 --> 01:18:19,987
Yep.

1345
01:18:20,056 --> 01:18:23,321
Wow.

1346
01:18:23,393 --> 01:18:25,190
We should get out.

1347
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,877
Hey, chief!

1348
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:43,037
Guess what.

1349
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:44,045
What?

1350
01:18:44,114 --> 01:18:45,843
His penis works.

1351
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:48,111
What do you mean?
You got wood?

1352
01:18:48,185 --> 01:18:50,949
Yeah. Definitely wood.

1353
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:52,818
So we don't need
these ladies anymore?

1354
01:18:52,889 --> 01:18:55,619
Nope. He's all fixed up.

1355
01:18:55,692 --> 01:18:57,592
He could pound a nail with that thing.

1356
01:18:57,661 --> 01:18:59,492
Pound a nail?

1357
01:18:59,563 --> 01:19:01,087
How do you know that?
Did you touch it?

1358
01:19:01,164 --> 01:19:03,792
No, I didn't have to.
It was just pokin' right into me.

1359
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:05,596
It's a miracle.

1360
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:08,160
You are one lucky bastard, T.K.

1361
01:19:19,249 --> 01:19:20,273
You all right?

1362
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:22,716
Yeah, you don't seem too happy...

1363
01:19:22,786 --> 01:19:24,048
considering.

1364
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,088
I'm all right.

1365
01:19:26,156 --> 01:19:27,384
Yeah, I get to see my girlfriend,

1366
01:19:27,457 --> 01:19:29,721
go back down range
like nothing ever happened.

1367
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:32,227
T.K., what are you worried about?

1368
01:19:32,295 --> 01:19:33,762
You're on a lucky streak.

1369
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,457
I don't think so.

1370
01:19:35,532 --> 01:19:37,659
I mean, you can only get lucky
for so long, you know?

1371
01:19:37,734 --> 01:19:39,964
Streaks don't last forever,
and I've been burnin' some karma.

1372
01:19:40,036 --> 01:19:42,504
Hey, you can't think that way.

1373
01:19:42,572 --> 01:19:44,563
It's gonna mess your head up,
get you in trouble over there.

1374
01:19:44,641 --> 01:19:48,133
Yeah, you gotta forget about luck.

1375
01:19:48,211 --> 01:19:50,270
I mean, look at Randy.

1376
01:19:50,347 --> 01:19:52,781
Robbing Lucky Jim's, not getting caught.

1377
01:19:52,849 --> 01:19:55,443
That was lucky. Amazing.

1378
01:19:55,518 --> 01:19:58,954
But maybe if he had have got caught,

1379
01:19:59,022 --> 01:20:01,752
he would have gone to jail
and he wouldn't have enlisted,

1380
01:20:01,825 --> 01:20:02,849
and then he might be alive.

1381
01:20:02,926 --> 01:20:04,951
That might be luckier.

1382
01:20:05,028 --> 01:20:07,690
So, you know, just don't think about luck.

1383
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:12,328
I'm on my third tour.
The odds aren't good.

1384
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:18,663
Maybe you need to change the odds.

1385
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:20,232
Maybe you don't go back.

1386
01:20:21,778 --> 01:20:22,938
You can go to Canada.

1387
01:20:23,013 --> 01:20:24,207
Take a break.

1388
01:20:24,281 --> 01:20:27,580
No, I can't go to Canada, man.

1389
01:20:27,651 --> 01:20:29,278
You're a coward if you go to Canada.

1390
01:20:29,352 --> 01:20:31,946
Yeah, but you're a coward that's alive.

1391
01:20:32,022 --> 01:20:33,853
Plus you've done your service.

1392
01:20:33,924 --> 01:20:36,154
Given a lot.
More than most people.

1393
01:20:36,226 --> 01:20:37,352
I can't do it, you know.

1394
01:20:37,427 --> 01:20:38,985
They got shit football in Canada.

1395
01:20:39,062 --> 01:20:40,359
Become a hockey fan.

1396
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:42,421
No.

1397
01:20:42,499 --> 01:20:44,126
I don't know anyone up there, anyway.

1398
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,292
We'll come visit you.

1399
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:47,233
I've never been to Canada.

1400
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:48,965
- Yeah.
- Nah.

1401
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:51,007
- Yeah.
- I'm good.

1402
01:21:36,019 --> 01:21:38,044
Hey! There's Lucky Jim's.

1403
01:21:40,991 --> 01:21:44,051
Robbing a casino's a ballsy thing to do.

1404
01:21:44,127 --> 01:21:45,754
In a weird way, you gotta admire it.

1405
01:21:45,829 --> 01:21:49,765
You know, he was wearing
a gorilla mask when he did it.

1406
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,892
On Halloween
about three years ago.

1407
01:21:51,968 --> 01:21:55,199
Nobody even looked twice
at a guy running down the street

1408
01:21:55,271 --> 01:21:57,102
wearing a mask and carrying a gun.

1409
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:09,645
I'm happy for you, T.K.

1410
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:12,187
You know, you're going home
to your girlfriend,

1411
01:22:12,255 --> 01:22:13,916
and that's gonna be real nice.

1412
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,458
You just treat her right.

1413
01:22:16,526 --> 01:22:17,458
Okay.

1414
01:22:17,527 --> 01:22:18,926
When you get married,

1415
01:22:18,995 --> 01:22:21,486
let me know 'cause I want
to send you something.

1416
01:22:21,564 --> 01:22:23,293
You got lots of celebrating to do.

1417
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:26,164
You got your bridal shower
and your engagement party...

1418
01:22:26,236 --> 01:22:27,168
All right, Colee.

1419
01:22:27,237 --> 01:22:28,727
- Rehearsal dinner...
- Stop, stop, stop.

1420
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:31,137
It's gonna be nice.

1421
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:33,801
Just take care.

1422
01:22:37,747 --> 01:22:39,772
That was a bit forward.

1423
01:22:41,051 --> 01:22:42,450
Good luck at the tables.

1424
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:43,611
Listen to me.

1425
01:22:43,686 --> 01:22:46,382
You go home,
do what you need to do there.

1426
01:22:46,456 --> 01:22:48,617
If I were you, I'd think twice
about going back.

1427
01:22:50,393 --> 01:22:52,520
Well, if I go home, I'm going back.

1428
01:22:52,595 --> 01:22:56,725
You know, my whole family's in the Army,
so it's almost the same thing.

1429
01:22:59,569 --> 01:23:02,129
Well, see you guys.

1430
01:23:11,414 --> 01:23:15,976
So, uh, you sure you don't want me
to drive you over to Randy's?

1431
01:23:16,052 --> 01:23:18,714
No, I gotta do this by myself.

1432
01:23:18,788 --> 01:23:20,016
Thanks.

1433
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:22,024
I'll take a taxi.

1434
01:23:22,092 --> 01:23:24,083
Well, if you need anything,

1435
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,889
you give me a call.

1436
01:23:25,962 --> 01:23:27,520
All right?

1437
01:23:29,732 --> 01:23:33,065
I'm real sorry about that guitar.

1438
01:23:33,136 --> 01:23:34,694
Forget it.

1439
01:23:36,306 --> 01:23:38,137
You bring it to them.

1440
01:23:40,176 --> 01:23:41,939
They're gonna love you.

1441
01:23:52,489 --> 01:23:56,755
...worried about blowing up
some abandoned Iraqi tanks

1442
01:23:56,826 --> 01:23:58,418
and other personnel carriers...

1443
01:23:58,495 --> 01:23:59,427
What'll it be?

1444
01:23:59,496 --> 01:24:02,624
Can I get a shot of tequila?

1445
01:24:02,699 --> 01:24:06,897
Suddenly, out of an alleyway, wham!

1446
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:10,497
There comes an RPG
and missiles from the air.

1447
01:24:10,573 --> 01:24:12,803
We have been trying
to get a live report...

1448
01:24:12,876 --> 01:24:14,741
Can you make that a double?

1449
01:24:41,037 --> 01:24:42,595
- Yes?
- Hi.

1450
01:24:42,672 --> 01:24:45,800
I'm Colee Dunn.

1451
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:47,775
I was a friend of Randy's.

1452
01:24:47,844 --> 01:24:50,711
We served together and...

1453
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,805
this is his guitar.

1454
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,087
Well, come in.

1455
01:24:59,155 --> 01:25:01,419
And these flowers are for you, too.

1456
01:25:04,127 --> 01:25:05,992
Thank you.

1457
01:25:06,062 --> 01:25:08,462
We love flowers.

1458
01:25:11,267 --> 01:25:13,758
Here we are.

1459
01:25:13,836 --> 01:25:17,636
You know, you have
such a beautiful home.

1460
01:25:17,707 --> 01:25:19,072
Thanks.

1461
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:22,578
I guess you didn't...

1462
01:25:22,645 --> 01:25:25,910
you didn't really need the flowers.

1463
01:25:25,982 --> 01:25:29,315
Well, we're always happy for more.

1464
01:25:29,385 --> 01:25:31,751
We have a flower
wholesaling business, so...

1465
01:25:31,821 --> 01:25:34,517
Randy probably told you that.

1466
01:25:34,591 --> 01:25:36,081
Of course, he never liked working there.

1467
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,218
You know boys.

1468
01:25:38,294 --> 01:25:42,697
Always trying to prove they're men.

1469
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:44,232
I guess working in a flower shop

1470
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:48,066
didn't quite go with that.

1471
01:25:48,137 --> 01:25:49,764
I must say, I didn't even know

1472
01:25:49,839 --> 01:25:52,307
that Randy played the guitar.

1473
01:25:53,943 --> 01:25:56,571
I thought that...

1474
01:25:56,646 --> 01:25:59,012
I thought that
maybe you gave it to him.

1475
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:04,848
It wasn't in your family?

1476
01:26:04,921 --> 01:26:05,979
No.

1477
01:26:06,055 --> 01:26:09,422
Our family was never too musical.

1478
01:26:09,492 --> 01:26:12,984
So I don't know where he would have
gotten such a nice guitar.

1479
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:18,427
That's funny.

1480
01:26:42,759 --> 01:26:44,249
How are you doing today, sir?

1481
01:26:45,928 --> 01:26:47,725
I'll know in about 30 minutes.

1482
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:52,125
Never too old to sign up.

1483
01:26:52,201 --> 01:26:55,170
You ever think about it?

1484
01:26:55,238 --> 01:26:57,331
I just got out.

1485
01:26:57,407 --> 01:26:59,136
That'd be the best time to get back in.

1486
01:27:00,243 --> 01:27:01,904
Yeah.

1487
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:11,377
There you go, sweetie.

1488

- You sure?
- Yes.

1495
01:27:39,048 --> 01:27:43,109
Just tell us some more
stories about Randy.

1496

Okay...

1497

All right, I'm gonna get that.
Tom, that toast is burning.

1498
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:01,902
Shannon, this is Colee.

1499
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:03,666
Colee served with Randy.

1500
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:04,934
Hi.

1501
01:28:05,007 --> 01:28:06,099
Hi.

1502
01:28:06,175 --> 01:28:09,542
And this is little Jessie.

1503
01:28:09,612 --> 01:28:12,274
He looks just like
his daddy, don't you think?

1504
01:28:12,348 --> 01:28:13,872
He's got Randy's eyes.

1505
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:16,851
But he's got a bald spot just like you.

1506
01:28:17,954 --> 01:28:20,252
Give me that baby.

1507
01:28:20,323 --> 01:28:22,951
Stop it.

1508
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,620
That's my boy. Yeah.

1509
01:28:40,943 --> 01:28:42,570
How you doing?

1510
01:28:44,313 --> 01:28:45,575
I'm good.

1511
01:28:45,648 --> 01:28:48,378
I'm sorry, Colee.

1512
01:28:48,451 --> 01:28:50,715
You didn't know about Shannon, did ya?

1513
01:28:50,787 --> 01:28:53,950
Yeah, I knew.

1514
01:28:54,023 --> 01:28:55,285
I knew about that.

1515
01:28:55,358 --> 01:28:58,122
He's a damn fool, Randy.

1516
01:28:58,194 --> 01:28:59,855
He never slept with the girl but once.

1517
01:28:59,929 --> 01:29:01,453
He barely knew her.

1518
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:03,931
But she got pregnant.

1519
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,333
Then he disappeared
and, of course, we felt responsible.

1520
01:29:07,403 --> 01:29:08,961
She was gonna have a baby.

1521
01:29:13,976 --> 01:29:16,706
It doesn't change
whatever you had with Randy.

1522
01:29:16,779 --> 01:29:18,906
Hope you know that.

1523
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:29,621
<i>This is the final call for Air Canada</i>
<i>Flight 63 to Vancouver.</i>

1524
01:30:29,085 --> 01:30:31,918
He's looking at me to see
if it's okay to eat them.

1525
01:30:31,988 --> 01:30:33,615
- Yes, you may eat them.
- You go right ahead.

1526
01:30:33,689 --> 01:30:34,986
That's delicious.

1527
01:30:38,761 --> 01:30:40,251
Hey, Colee.

1528
01:30:40,329 --> 01:30:43,765
I just want to say

1529
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:47,735
that Jeanie and I
have talked about this,

1530
01:30:47,803 --> 01:30:51,034
and seeing that you're
kind of out of touch

1531
01:30:51,107 --> 01:30:53,575
with your own family,

1532
01:30:53,643 --> 01:30:57,943
well, we want you to know that...

1533
01:30:58,014 --> 01:30:59,276
that you're welcome to stay here

1534
01:30:59,348 --> 01:31:00,679
for the rest of your leave.

1535
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,274
Really?

1536
01:31:09,525 --> 01:31:11,254
Wow, that's...

1537
01:31:14,797 --> 01:31:16,355
That's so nice.

1538
01:31:18,467 --> 01:31:20,367
I have something that I want to say, too.

1539
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:31,369
Shannon...

1540
01:31:31,447 --> 01:31:33,711
there's a couple things that you should know.

1541
01:31:37,753 --> 01:31:41,746
Randy... he loved you
with all his heart and soul,

1542
01:31:41,824 --> 01:31:44,850
and he talked about you all the time.

1543
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:51,589
And, you know, he knew
that he had made a big mistake

1544
01:31:51,667 --> 01:31:54,602
and he was gonna make it up to you.

1545
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:00,736
And, Tom and Jeanie,
he just loved you so much.

1546
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:02,505
He knew what great parents you were

1547
01:32:02,578 --> 01:32:07,447
and grandparents, too, and...

1548
01:32:07,516 --> 01:32:11,043
and he was just so looking forward
to coming home.

1549
01:32:15,324 --> 01:32:17,485
Ya'll have been so nice to me.

1550
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,822
And I think I should go.

1551
01:32:18,894 --> 01:32:20,725
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, no...

1552
01:32:20,796 --> 01:32:21,728
You can stay, can't ya?

1553
01:32:21,797 --> 01:32:23,264
No, I think I should go.

1554
01:32:26,769 --> 01:32:30,671
And, you know, I was thinking...

1555
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,901
would it be all right if I took that guitar?

1556
01:32:32,975 --> 01:32:34,840
Randy's guitar?

1557
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:37,310
Is that okay?

1558
01:32:39,415 --> 01:32:41,007
You take it.

1559
01:32:42,918 --> 01:32:45,512
You're welcome to it.

1560
01:32:47,757 --> 01:32:49,588
Thank you.

1561
01:33:25,361 --> 01:33:26,555
Excuse me.

1562
01:33:26,629 --> 01:33:29,928
I have a friend who I think got arrested.

1563
01:33:29,999 --> 01:33:30,966
You just brought him in.

1564
01:33:31,033 --> 01:33:32,557
- What's the name?
- Poole.

1565
01:33:32,635 --> 01:33:33,659
T.K. Poole.

1566
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,740
Yeah, we got him.

1567
01:33:39,809 --> 01:33:41,242
Can I see him?

1568
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:43,175
He's still being processed.
You're gonna have to wait.

1569
01:33:45,648 --> 01:33:46,740
What'd he do?

1570
01:33:46,816 --> 01:33:48,647
Doesn't say.

1571
01:33:48,718 --> 01:33:51,448
Must have done something.

1572
01:33:55,858 --> 01:33:56,825
Hello?

1573
01:33:56,892 --> 01:33:58,291
Cheaver!

1574
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,260
Guess what. I got the guitar.

1575
01:34:00,329 --> 01:34:02,490
I told you not to worry about that.

1576
01:34:02,565 --> 01:34:05,033
Are you still in Vegas?
Can I come meet you?

1577
01:34:11,907 --> 01:34:13,841
- Hey.
- Hey.

1578
01:34:22,618 --> 01:34:24,108
How is he?

1579
01:34:24,186 --> 01:34:25,619
They won't let me see him.

1580
01:34:25,688 --> 01:34:28,589
Well, what did he do?

1581
01:34:28,657 --> 01:34:30,648
I don't know.

1582
01:34:35,865 --> 01:34:38,265
Sir? When can we see our friend?

1583
01:34:38,334 --> 01:34:39,824
You can't.

1584
01:34:39,902 --> 01:34:42,166
Listen, we gotta see him.

1585
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:43,933
He's in the Army. We all are.

1586
01:34:44,006 --> 01:34:46,065
And he's home on leave for just 30 days.

1587
01:34:46,142 --> 01:34:47,837
Now you might not know what that's like...

1588
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:50,538
I know just what that's like.

1589
01:34:50,613 --> 01:34:52,774
I was a Marine in Desert Storm.

1590
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:56,680
Well, then maybe you can help us out.

1591
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:08,391
I have my problems
with my approach shot.

1592
01:35:08,464 --> 01:35:10,022
Oh, see, yeah.

1593
01:35:10,099 --> 01:35:12,067
All you gotta do is just shorten up
that back swing,

1594
01:35:12,134 --> 01:35:15,103
and I guarantee
you'll hit the green every time.

1595
01:35:16,806 --> 01:35:18,239
That's it.

1596
01:35:18,307 --> 01:35:19,774
Like, I don't like to brag,

1597
01:35:19,842 --> 01:35:21,139
'cause bragging doesn't come easy to me,

1598
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:24,702
but, you know, last time I played
Number 4 at Kuwait City,

1599
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,270
I got a hole in one.

1600
01:35:26,348 --> 01:35:28,373
- Aw, come on, you're bullshitting me.
- No. I'm serious.

1601
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:31,578
And it was amazing because
the ball never even hit the grass.

1602
01:35:31,654 --> 01:35:33,884
It just dropped straight in the hole.

1603
01:35:33,956 --> 01:35:35,287
There was nothing but cup.

1604
01:35:35,357 --> 01:35:37,552
Swear...

1605
01:35:37,626 --> 01:35:39,491
That's amazing.

1606
01:35:39,562 --> 01:35:40,586
Beautiful, beautiful.

1607
01:35:40,663 --> 01:35:41,687
You know these two?

1608
01:35:43,332 --> 01:35:45,095
Yeah. Hey, guys.

1609
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:46,794
Hi.

1610
01:35:46,869 --> 01:35:48,734
Hey, your friend here is a real hero.

1611
01:35:48,804 --> 01:35:50,965
Yeah, we know, but why is he here?

1612
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,770
He's here because
he served his country honorably

1613
01:35:53,843 --> 01:35:57,108
and then he came back
and took responsibility for a past mistake.

1614
01:35:57,179 --> 01:35:58,476
That's as brave as it gets.

1615
01:35:58,547 --> 01:36:00,412
What's the charge?

1616
01:36:00,482 --> 01:36:01,574
Armed robbery.

1617
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:02,810
Armed robbery?

1618
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:04,648
What did he rob?

1619
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,689
You ever heard of a casino
called Lucky Jim's?

1620
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:14,126
Yeah.

1621
01:36:14,196 --> 01:36:15,629
Yeah, I heard of that.

1622
01:36:15,698 --> 01:36:19,293
So you robbed Lucky Jim's?

1623
01:36:19,368 --> 01:36:21,962
Yeah.

1624
01:36:22,037 --> 01:36:25,632
And couldn't keep it a secret anymore.

1625
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:28,336
The guilt was just keeping me up at night.

1626
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:30,935
A guy who can man up
to his past got my respect.

1627
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:37,476
Could we have a moment alone with him?

1628
01:36:37,553 --> 01:36:39,418
Is that all right with you?

1629
01:36:39,488 --> 01:36:40,978
Yeah.

1630
01:36:46,462 --> 01:36:48,657
Lucky Jim's?

1631
01:36:48,731 --> 01:36:50,130
Why are you doing this?

1632
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:53,032
Well, like you said,
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1633
01:36:53,102 --> 01:36:55,002
Find a way to stay alive.

1634
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:57,368
What, to keep from going back?

1635
01:36:57,439 --> 01:36:58,838
Yeah, it's perfect.

1636
01:36:58,908 --> 01:37:01,376
No. You're gonna go to prison.

1637
01:37:01,443 --> 01:37:03,775
Look at me.
Prison's gonna be easy on a guy like me.

1638
01:37:03,846 --> 01:37:05,871
I got it all figured out.

1639
01:37:05,948 --> 01:37:07,347
I can get a college degree in there.

1640
01:37:07,416 --> 01:37:10,317
These guys said I'll be out in 18 months.

1641
01:37:10,386 --> 01:37:12,479
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1642
01:37:12,554 --> 01:37:13,680
You'll be an ex-con.

1643
01:37:13,756 --> 01:37:15,849
- Yeah, but a living ex-con.
- Right.

1644
01:37:15,925 --> 01:37:18,917
T.K., this is crazy.

1645
01:37:18,994 --> 01:37:20,586
Everybody okay in here?

1646
01:37:20,663 --> 01:37:22,358
- Yep.
- Yes.

1647
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:24,922
You didn't get hit too hard in the head
fighting over there, did ya?

1648
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,126
No, sir. No.

1649
01:37:26,201 --> 01:37:30,262
Well, then you're all very funny.

1650
01:37:30,339 --> 01:37:33,365
So funny you can get your asses
the hell out of here.

1651
01:37:33,442 --> 01:37:37,378
You think I got time to waste,
Mr. Big Shot Hero?

1652
01:37:37,446 --> 01:37:39,346
You rob Lucky Jim's?

1653
01:37:39,415 --> 01:37:40,507
Yes, sir.

1654
01:37:40,582 --> 01:37:42,379
That's interesting.

1655
01:37:42,451 --> 01:37:45,079
'Cause Lucky Jim's
has never been robbed.

1656
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:50,383
Sure it has.

1657
01:37:50,459 --> 01:37:52,723
I checked all the records.

1658
01:37:52,795 --> 01:37:56,526
And I just got off the phone
with Lucky Jim himself.

1659
01:37:59,134 --> 01:38:00,761
Now come on, get out of here.

1660
01:38:00,836 --> 01:38:02,463
Take a walk.

1661
01:38:13,349 --> 01:38:14,543
T.K., you okay?

1662
01:38:15,551 --> 01:38:17,576
Hey.

1663
01:38:17,653 --> 01:38:19,348
Oh, man.

1664
01:38:19,421 --> 01:38:21,946
I can't believe I almost did that.

1665
01:38:24,626 --> 01:38:25,752
I can't believe I did that.

1666
01:38:25,828 --> 01:38:28,797
Don't worry. We get it.

1667
01:38:32,368 --> 01:38:34,336
I'm sorry, guys.

1668
01:38:34,403 --> 01:38:36,132
- Don't worry about it.
- Nah, I'm real sorry.

1669
01:38:36,205 --> 01:38:38,139
It's okay.

1670
01:38:38,207 --> 01:38:40,937
Now I'm fucked up.

1671
01:38:45,214 --> 01:38:47,512
Wow, it's official.
I'm fucked up.

1672
01:38:49,518 --> 01:38:51,145
Did you guys know how fucked up I was?

1673
01:38:53,522 --> 01:38:56,423
Didn't really show... that much.

1674
01:38:56,492 --> 01:39:00,155
I gotta reevaluate.

1675
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:01,628
You know what?

1676
01:39:01,697 --> 01:39:03,631
I'm starting to see things
more clearly right now.

1677
01:39:03,699 --> 01:39:05,428
Good.

1678
01:39:05,501 --> 01:39:07,560
Great.

1679
01:39:07,636 --> 01:39:09,126
I realize that...

1680
01:39:13,375 --> 01:39:16,071
I don't know shit, man.

1681
01:39:16,145 --> 01:39:18,136
Fuck.

1682
01:39:19,982 --> 01:39:21,506
I don't know shit.

1683
01:39:22,885 --> 01:39:25,353
You know some things.

1684
01:39:25,421 --> 01:39:26,353
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1685
01:39:27,423 --> 01:39:29,152
You got the basic skills.

1686
01:39:37,566 --> 01:39:40,262
So how were Randy's parents?

1687
01:39:40,335 --> 01:39:42,030
They were real nice.

1688
01:39:42,104 --> 01:39:43,469
Good, I'm glad.

1689
01:39:43,539 --> 01:39:46,007
And so was Randy's girlfriend
and his baby, too.

1690
01:39:46,075 --> 01:39:47,303
- Oh. God.
- Ouch.

1691
01:39:47,376 --> 01:39:48,468
Yep.

1692
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:52,775
But look, I got the guitar,

1693
01:39:52,848 --> 01:39:54,679
and, Cheaver, I want you to have it.

1694
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:57,480
That's real sweet of you,

1695
01:39:57,553 --> 01:40:00,317
but I don't need it.

1696
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:02,679
I got the money.

1697
01:40:02,758 --> 01:40:04,658
- What?
- How much did you win?

1698
01:40:04,726 --> 01:40:09,163
I didn't win anything.
I didn't even place a bet.

1699
01:40:09,231 --> 01:40:10,357
I reenlisted.

1700
01:40:10,432 --> 01:40:12,957
You what?

1701
01:40:13,035 --> 01:40:14,900
You what?

1702
01:40:16,438 --> 01:40:18,269
I reenlisted.

1703
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:20,240
Got a $20,000 signing bonus.

1704
01:40:20,309 --> 01:40:22,573
I'm all set.

1705
01:40:22,644 --> 01:40:24,202
That's insane.

1706
01:40:24,279 --> 01:40:25,712
You're calling me insane?

1707
01:40:25,781 --> 01:40:27,476
Cheaver, I got you the guitar.

1708
01:40:27,549 --> 01:40:29,540
Sell it. Get the money that way.

1709
01:40:29,618 --> 01:40:32,553
You need that guitar
more than I do, Colee.

1710
01:40:32,621 --> 01:40:35,146
No. I got Army money saved up.

1711
01:40:35,224 --> 01:40:37,351
I'm gonna be fine.

1712
01:40:37,426 --> 01:40:39,724
And I'm gonna find my mom
and patch things up,

1713
01:40:39,795 --> 01:40:41,160
so you take it.

1714
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,562
No. I'm going back.

1715
01:40:43,632 --> 01:40:45,099
Recruiter called my home unit.

1716
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:46,930
They're transferring the paperwork now.

1717
01:40:47,002 --> 01:40:49,493
You can get out of that.

1718
01:40:49,571 --> 01:40:51,903
I don't know that I want to.

1719
01:40:51,974 --> 01:40:54,568
Cheaver, take the guitar.

1720
01:40:54,643 --> 01:40:56,167
Please.

1721
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,873
You take that guitar, Colee.

1722
01:41:02,217 --> 01:41:04,014
It's your guitar.

1723
01:41:04,086 --> 01:41:05,519
Yeah?

1724
01:41:05,587 --> 01:41:07,987
Yeah.

1725
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:11,183
Thank you.

1726
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:14,991
No. Thank you.

1727
01:42:00,943 --> 01:42:02,535
Sergeant.

1728
01:42:03,845 --> 01:42:06,245
T.K.

1729
01:42:06,315 --> 01:42:07,282
How are ya?

1730
01:42:07,349 --> 01:42:09,715
Good. Good.

1731
01:42:09,785 --> 01:42:11,480
So you got here.

1732
01:42:13,655 --> 01:42:15,748
Excuse me.

1733
01:42:19,428 --> 01:42:21,123
- Look who it is.
- Hey.

1734
01:42:21,196 --> 01:42:23,528
- How are ya?
- Good. How are you doing?

1735
01:42:23,599 --> 01:42:25,567
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing?

1736
01:42:27,903 --> 01:42:28,870
Where's your guitar?

1737
01:42:28,937 --> 01:42:30,336
Did you sell it?

1738
01:42:30,405 --> 01:42:32,100
Sell it?

1739
01:42:32,174 --> 01:42:34,108
Hell, no. I'm learning how to play it.

1740
01:42:34,176 --> 01:42:35,905
- You're learning to play it?
- Yep.

1741
01:42:35,978 --> 01:42:37,468
All right.

1742
01:42:40,148 --> 01:42:42,708
How's your fiancée?

1743
01:42:42,784 --> 01:42:45,218
She's fine.

1744
01:42:45,287 --> 01:42:47,778
But she's not my fiancée anymore.

1745
01:42:52,861 --> 01:42:54,158
Where are you going?

1746
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:55,457
I'm going to Diyala.

1747
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:57,964
- Where are you going?
- Anbar.

1748
01:42:59,935 --> 01:43:01,368
Where are you going?

1749
01:43:01,436 --> 01:43:02,926
Tikrit.
