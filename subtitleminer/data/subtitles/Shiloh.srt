1
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,927
Hey, look up there.

2
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,566
We got him now. Yes, sir.

3
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,079
Idiot!

4
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:21,383
Come here, stupid mutt.
You go down there and get that coon.

5
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,586
Go! Go!

6
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:30,397
Flea-bit hound!

7
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,465
Come back here. Come on!

8
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,592
I wouldn't shoot you.

9
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,006
Here, boy.

10
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,232
Come on.

11
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,444
Suit yourself.

12
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,406
Here, boy.

13
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,507
Here, girl?

14
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:03,710
Forget it.

15
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:09,691
Come on, boy.

16
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,130
See? I wouldn't hurt you.

17
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:21,234
Oh, man. What happened to your eye?

18
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,600
Where do you come from?

19
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,204
Come on, boy.

20
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,540
Come on.

21
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,350
Come on, boy.

22
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,386
Come on, boy.

23
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,539
Hi, Mrs. Wallace.

24
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:01,508
- You been rolling in the mud?
- No, I slipped.

25
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:05,169
You know better than to bring
that thing in here.

26
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,472
Sorry.

27
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:16,423
- Marty, what's new?
- Not much, Doc. Looking for a job.

28
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,594
Not much to do around here.

29
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,320
You know, Sam does the sweeping up.

30
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,896
There's nothing else.

31
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,330
Wait. Sam and Marty
can collect bottles.

32
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:29,232
I'll take them down to
the recycler myself.

33
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:32,174
You've said that for months.

34
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,744
- Sam and Marty can do it.
- I don't think Sam wants to.

35
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:39,240
I'd love to.

36
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,849
Eight houses, three bottles.

37
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,454
I'm going home. This was a bad idea.

38
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,115
- Maybe there's another job.
- There's no jobs here.

39
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,022
This place is dead.

40
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,528
- Why do you need to work so much?
- I want a bike.

41
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,428
Dad says if I want it,
I gotta pay for it.

42
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,838
- We'll figure something out.
- No, we won't.

43
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,201
I'm never getting a bike.

44
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,378
Mrs. McCallister needs
some yard work done.

45
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:13,276
Forget it. I'll see you later.

46
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:16,683
- Want to do something tomorrow?
- I gotta help my dad.

47
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:20,720
- You want me to come with you?
- No. I'll see you around.

48
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,083
What do you keep
following me around for?

49
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:53,686
Well, you can't come home with me.

50
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,407
Look, I can't have a dog.

51
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,981
I'll already be in deep
because I'm dirty and wet.

52
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,682
Please go home, boy.

53
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,092
It's all wet.

54
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,725
Come on.

55
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,068
It's gonna be okay.

56
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,922
Hold on.

57
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,185
- What happened to you?
- I slipped.

58
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:09,589
Take it off.

59
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:14,960
This is damp, honey.

60
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,402
Are you following
your grandmother to the grave?

61
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:21,372
You know how fast pneumonia sets in.

62
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:24,808
- Listen, there's this dog...
- Honey, the shirt.

63
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,410
- Whose dog is that?
- What dog?

64
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,680
- In front of the house.
- It followed me.

65
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,918
- Where did you find it?
- In Shiloh, across the bridge.

66
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:41,961
By the river? I bet
it's Judd Travers' new hunting dog.

67
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,496
- Great.
- Judd got a new hunting dog?

68
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,032
- Why don't he treat it right?
- Whose dog?

69
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,294
We don't know.

70
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,439
- He ain't treated right?
- Look at his eye.

71
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,632
He's cut bad. How it acts.

72
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,368
- Scared to pee, almost.
- Watch your mouth.

73
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,273
- Sorry.
- Just because his eye is cut...

74
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,347
...don't mean he's been hit.

75
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:05,714
- Don't have to mark a dog to hurt him.
- Pay him no attention, he'll go.

76
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:07,912
- Carry me.
- Did you help Mama today?

77
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,992
- Did she?
- No.

78
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,922
Fibber.

79
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:24,039
Poor little Shiloh dog looks tired,
doesn't he?

80
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,446
Shiloh.

81
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,787
You gonna eat that meat
or play with it?

82
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,393
- Not hungry.
- Don't give it to that dog.

83
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,564
- What's the dog gonna eat?
- Nothing here.

84
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,796
Eat your food.

85
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,733
- He doesn't want it.
- Eat your dinner, Marty.

86
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,203
- I don't feel like it.
- You got a problem?

87
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,502
How can you be so mean
about that poor dog?

88
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:04,236
He's hurt bad.

89
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:07,575
That dog is going back
when I've finished eating.

90
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:12,083
If that's Judd's dog, he won't
have sense to get back by himself.

91
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,813
We'll put him in the truck
and drive him.

92
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,561
- What's that?
- I said, "Yes, sir. "

93
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,286
Eat your food.

94
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:31,634
There you are. Good dog.
I got something for you.

95
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,105
Let's go.

96
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:44,582
- Maybe we can keep him one more day.
- Please. Get in the truck.

97
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,382
- It has ticks, though.
- So? Judd will take them off.

98
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:52,220
- What if he doesn't?
- That's his concern, not yours.

99
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:56,387
It's not your dog. Get in the truck.

100
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,334
Judd cheats people.

101
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:13,743
He got Mrs. Wallace so frazzled,
she gave him change for 20, not 10.

102
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:20,712
He kills deer out of season. Remember
the buck he hit with his truck?

103
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,413
I saw the buckshot.

104
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,993
How do you report someone
who don't treat his dog right?

105
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,688
He's one out of 50,000 mistreated.

106
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,961
This one came to me for help.
That's why he followed me.

107
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,939
I want to make sure
he's treated right.

108
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,165
Get this out of your head.

109
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:43,573
No mind of ours how he treats it.

110
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,306
What if it was a child
and it was shaking like this dog?

111
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,447
It's not a child
and it's not your dog.

112
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:55,215
I want you to quit going on about it,
you hear?

113
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:58,086
- You hear?
- I hear.

114
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,600
- Ray, how you been?
- Hey, Judd.

115
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,576
- You getting out?
- No.

116
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,044
I want to make sure
he belongs to Judd first.

117
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,377
- Nice day.
- Yeah, sure is.

118
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:28,455
- How's your mama?
- Not so good. Thanks for asking.

119
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:32,021
What brings you here?
Forgot to deliver some bills?

120
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,493
No, it seems that my boy
found this beagle.

121
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,065
- Thought it might be yours.
- Thought I'd lost that hound.

122
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:40,394
Show him the dog.

123
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:47,169
- That's him.
- Bring him on down, boy.

124
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,937
Come on, don't take all day.

125
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,648
Where you been?

126
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,556
- Don't kick him!
- He needs more than a kick.

127
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:12,063
It's the third time in three months
he's run off. He is fast.

128
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,798
Well, you got your dog. We'll keep
an eye out if he runs off again.

129
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,474
If he does, I'll shoot him.

130
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,802
What happened to his eye?

131
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,576
I don't rightly know.

132
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:31,078
- You better not hurt him, or else.
- Or else what?

133
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:35,351
Whatever it takes
to make him a good hunting dog...

134
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,288
...and keep him from running off,
I'll do it.

135
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,689
If you treat it right,
it won't run.

136
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:44,354
These are working dogs.
This is my livelihood.

137
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:48,298
If I ain't got meat
to sell the butcher in Sistersville...

138
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:49,630
...I got nothing.

139
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,830
Well, I guess you know your business.

140
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,236
Certainly your dog.

141
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,603
Come on, boy.

142
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,542
If you find him
wandering around again...

143
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,477
...you best do the right thing
and bring him back to me, all right?

144
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:08,987
- I'll bring him back.
- If he wanders off again...

145
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:12,922
...I'll whup the living daylights
out of him. Guaranteed.

146
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:15,653
- You touch him...
- Get in the truck.

147
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,999
Thank you, Ray.

148
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,924
A dog is a man's property.

149
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,356
We did what we had to do.

150
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,665
- I was thinking about that dog...
- The answer is no.

151
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,867
- I know, but...
- No more talk about it.

152
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,769
What about that bike?
You were looking for a job.

153
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,040
If I get a job it's to
buy Shiloh from Judd.

154
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,619
- It has a name now?
- I found him on the Shiloh Bridge.

155
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,288
It's not your dog to name.

156
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:51,585
I'm not gonna wait
until I find him dead on the road.

157
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,194
How do you propose to feed the dog?

158
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,961
I'll find a way.

159
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:01,264
When your grandma got sick,
I had to remortgage the house.

160
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,439
I do my part.
I take care of Becky and Dara Lynn.

161
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,543
The bank owns this house.
Until we own it, there will be no dog.

162
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,581
I hope if your mama was sick,
you'd also take care of her.

163
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,317
- Morning, Marty.
- Morning.

164
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,545
Hi, princess. Oh, I'm late!

165
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,247
You help Mama, all right?

166
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,460
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.

167
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,430
- What's up with you today?
- I don't know.

168
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,332
Just look for a job, I guess.

169
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:38,870
Let me brush your hair.

170
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:50,776
- You got that dog on your mind?
- Thinking don't cost nothing.

171
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,250
I'd love a dog.

172
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:57,016
- You know he won't budge.
- Maybe you could say something.

173
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,023
There's nothing to say about it.

174
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:02,720
It's not that he doesn't want a dog,
he's worried about money.

175
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,296
I need to get a job too.

176
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,992
If you love something, you
take care of it. Like Grandma.

177
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,797
It's not a toy, it's a living thing.

178
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:17,206
Dad won't change his mind,
and you won't stand up to him.

179
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:19,642
Don't talk to me like that.

180
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,405
Sorry.

181
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:38,097
You want a dog instead of a bike.
How much will he cost?

182
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,393
Jeez, I don't know.

183
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:42,331
Probably 20 or 30 dollars.

184
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,474
- You won't make that from bottles.
- I guess you're right.

185
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,507
I know how you love that dog.

186
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,147
I found a stray cat.
Mangiest thing you ever saw.

187
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,514
Grandpa said no way,
but Grandma said I could keep it.

188
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,153
On account of my parents
had just died.

189
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:04,250
Anyway, I loved that cat so much.

190
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:07,917
- I called her Blackie, she was black.
- What happened to her?

191
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,597
She got run over and killed.

192
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,468
We buried her in the garden.
Grandpa cleaned up the street.

193
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,861
Man!

194
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,631
- What are you doing with those bugs?
- Letting them go.

195
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,973
They don't deserve to be locked up.

196
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:27,638
I gotta get going.
Where are you headed?

197
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,479
Mrs. McCallister's.
See if she'll hire me for yard work.

198
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:42,455
- Make sure you make it secure.
- Yes, ma'am.

199
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,261
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I had it backwards.

200
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:54,374
Be careful. I don't want to fall.

201
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:59,411
- Is it straight now?
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

202
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,395
- That's a very good job, Marty.
- Thank you.

203
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:19,892
Here you go.

204
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:33,047
- Hey, boy.
- How come you ain't out hunting?

205
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:34,875
I got work to do.

206
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,983
I'll hunt Friday. Possums.

207
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:38,948
- How are the dogs?
- Good.

208
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:41,412
But they're all chained.

209
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:47,324
- I'm training the beagle you found.
- Where is he?

210
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,860
He's caged alone
until he learns how to behave.

211
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,832
- Can he come out?
- No, I'm training him.

212
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:05,479
- That ain't right, locking him up.
- I fed him, so he don't starve.

213
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,809
That's no way to keep a dog
from running off.

214
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:13,180
- What do you know about it?
- A dog is the same as a kid.

215
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:16,414
You don't treat a kid right,
he'll run off too.

216
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:21,457
You know, if that was true, I
would've run off when I was 4.

217
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:24,564
As long as I can remember,
Pa took a belt to me.

218
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,629
Had welts on my back so raw
I could hardly put my shirt on.

219
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:32,065
I didn't run off.
Didn't have no place to go.

220
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,434
I turned out, didn't I?

221
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,370
Turned out how?

222
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,746
You trying to get smart with me?

223
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,418
No, I was just asking
how you turned out.

224
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:47,554
Somebody who was beat
since they was 4.

225
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,917
I'd feel real sorry.

226
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:54,518
Well, don't go wasting
your sorry on me.

227
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:58,162
Ain't nobody ever felt sorry for me.

228
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:01,735
And I never felt sorry for nobody.

229
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,637
Sorry is something I can do without.

230
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:17,748
- What's his name?
- He ain't got a name.

231
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,648
Don't name any of my dogs.

232
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:23,985
Dogs one, two, three, four, five.
That's what I call them.

233
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:27,423
When I want them, I whistle.
When I don't, I kick them.

234
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,860
"Get out! Scram! Idiot!"
That's their names.

235
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,028
His name's Shiloh.

236
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,776
- What do you want?
- I'll work this summer.

237
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:48,075
Saving up to buy a dog.
Maybe you'd want to sell me Shiloh?

238
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,985
Fat chance.
That'll be the best hunting dog I got.

239
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:55,452
I'll pay you good. What did he cost?

240
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:59,323
I got him cheap. 35 dollars.

241
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,655
But after I'm through training him,
I won't get rid of him.

242
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,130
You wouldn't sell him for any amount?

243
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:10,830
Well, everything has a price.

244
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,366
No way you'll ever
have enough to buy him.

245
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:27,586
What are you doing?

246
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,724
Your grandpa paid me two bucks
to sweep the porch.

247
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:32,951
- How much is it so far?
- Seven bucks.

248
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:36,289
I wonder if Judd would sell Shiloh
if I had $100.

249
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,295
He has so much spite in him.

250
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,730
If Shiloh messes up,
he'll shoot him.

251
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,528
How did he get so mean?

252
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:46,969
My dad said that Judd's dad was so
mean, nobody went near their house.

253
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,576
- Sounds as mean as Judd.
- Yeah, worse.

254
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,112
If you find a real stray,
you won't have to pay for him.

255
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:58,616
That's not the point. Shiloh needs
me. I never had anybody need me.

256
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:02,783
- What about me?
- Don't be gross.

257
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,860
I wonder what he's doing.

258
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,559
Get 'em, boy!

259
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,735
Come on, boy. Go!

260
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:21,135
Go!

261
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,370
Move, dumb mutt!

262
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:27,043
Get back here, boy. Come on!

263
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,537
What are you doing here?

264
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:43,324
- What's the matter?
- I thought I heard a dog bark.

265
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:45,219
Probably Baker's shepherd.

266
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:49,989
- Marty, everything all right?
- Just going up the hill, Dad.

267
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,966
You know, Marty should be
spending time with friends.

268
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:59,971
I saw Mr. Howard the other day.
I think Marty and David...

269
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,506
...should spend time together.

270
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,270
Sure. I'll call Celia about it.

271
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,259
You're gonna
have to stay here tonight.

272
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,622
I'll get some stuff to clean this up.

273
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:33,265
Judd Travers isn't gonna
hurt you again.

274
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:37,100
This'll be your house
till I figure out what to do next.

275
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,447
Be still. I'm gonna pull it out.

276
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:54,220
Stay.

277
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,302
Good boy. Stay.

278
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:12,246
- What's the hurry, son?
- Just getting the. 22.

279
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:15,041
- What for?
- Shoot some cans.

280
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,047
Isn't it late for that?

281
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:22,221
Why don't you call David Howard?
You can get together tomorrow.

282
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,151
I don't know.
I have a lot to do around here.

283
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:31,859
Why don't we make hot chocolate
and watch TV? There's a mystery on.

284
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,932
I was about to put the cans out.

285
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:35,466
Can't that wait?

286
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,665
- Okay.
- Good.

287
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:58,815
Where are you going?

288
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,451
To the bathroom.

289
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,562
This is the kitchen.

290
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:10,235
- Hey, Marty!
- Yeah?

291
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:13,603
- You all right?
- Yeah.

292
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:23,947
- We won't be long. Be good.
- See you, Mom.

293
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,682
Girls, let's go.

294
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:32,091
Bye!

295
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,891
Shiloh, got some more food for you.

296
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,005
Marty!

297
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:55,011
Hey, Sam. Here I am.

298
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,012
- Is that Judd Travers' dog?
- Yeah.

299
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:03,850
Look, Sam.
You can't tell anyone, okay?

300
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,758
Come on, boy.

301
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:11,324
Let's go to the creek
and get some water.

302
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,125
His name's Shiloh.

303
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:16,066
What do your folks say about Shiloh?

304
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,431
- Nothing.
- You mean, they don't know?

305
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:23,668
- No.
- Wow, it's like a real big secret.

306
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:27,974
I hope it stays that way
until I've figured things out.

307
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:34,153
Thanks. I gotta fix up that shed.

308
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:36,683
- Can I help?
- Sure.

309
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:35,342
Perfect.

310
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,081
Come on, Shiloh.

311
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:50,689
- Don't your folks come up here?
- No, hardly ever.

312
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:54,335
Sometimes Dara Lynn and Becky
watch me shoot at cans.

313
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,733
- Will they tell on you?
- Yeah. They wouldn't mean to...

314
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,770
...it would just slip out.

315
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:05,611
I don't know. I hate lying,
but I promised Shiloh.

316
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:09,141
Besides, he'll be in the shed
if anyone else is home.

317
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,113
What if Judd Travers looks for him?

318
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,911
I have $10 so far.

319
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,387
If I keep working, I'll have enough
that he can't turn me down.

320
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,327
What if Judd finds out you have Shiloh
before you have the money?

321
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,054
I don't know.

322
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,026
I can't give Judd the chance
to hurt him again.

323
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:32,632
You might just be the best boy I know.

324
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,275
Sam, why did you have to do that?

325
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,563
- Morning, Judd. How are you doing?
- Just fine, Mrs. Wallace.

326
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,069
- Morning, Doc.
- Morning.

327
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:13,244
I'm looking for my dog
and was wondering if you'd seen it.

328
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:15,848
The other night I saw a stray mutt.

329
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,042
No, this is a beagle, purebred.
About a year old.

330
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,519
A little banged up,
got in a dog fight.

331
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:26,990
- Maybe you're better off without him.
- He could be a fine hunting dog.

332
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:30,894
How about you?

333
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,398
You seen my dog?

334
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:36,626
No.

335
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:46,643
Maybe you could put a sign
in your window for me?

336
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,816
I guess we could do that, sure.

337
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,515
My pleasure.

338
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,048
Well, thank you.

339
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,520
I hope you find him.

340
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:06,691
I'm not putting up any signs.

341
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:09,893
Okay, Ma.

342
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,606
Mom, do you mind if I take
some biscuits for Mrs. Young's?

343
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:21,304
No, not at all.

344
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,617
You have a funny appetite these days.
Saving everything for later.

345
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:35,762
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey there. What's your hurry?

346
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:38,056
I ran to see how fast I'd get here.

347
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,962
Marty, you want to
go down to the creek?

348
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,228
- Sure.
- Can we come too?

349
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,498
You have that appointment
at Sue's, remember?

350
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,336
See you later.

351
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:51,671
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

352
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:55,942
I knew they'd be friends.

353
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:59,681
- I bet they're kissing out there.
- Oh, stop.

354
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:04,386
Judd Travers came to the store
asking about Shiloh.

355
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:06,287
What did he say?

356
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,928
He said he's valuable
and he wants him back.

357
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,622
- What did you say?
- Nothing, except I haven't seen him.

358
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,729
Mrs. Young's gonna pay me
five bucks to paint her fence.

359
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:21,431
Then I'll have 15.
I'm gonna need about 50 bucks.

360
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,870
Probably.

361
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:30,912
I buy the base and then
I custom blend the colors.

362
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,344
And I have other ones as well.

363
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:37,921
I can sell them to you
for $1.70 a bottle.

364
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:41,789
$1.70? Well, let me think about it.

365
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,863
You know, the ladies
are real happy with Sheffield's.

366
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,558
Yes, but they cost
over 2 dollars a bottle.

367
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:53,035
Let me check it out.
I'll give you a call.

368
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:56,436
And if Joan really marries that guy...

369
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:59,174
...you've got the manicurist's job.

370
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:02,508
Wonderful. Thank you very much.

371
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:06,309
- I'll leave a sample, if it's okay.
- Sure. That'll be nice.

372
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:10,883
Hi there.

373
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,720
I just wanted to give you a treat.

374
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:15,293
Thank you.

375
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:17,259
Girls, let's go.

376
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:20,659
- Hi there. How are you?
- Everything okay?

377
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,894
- I'm great. Thanks, Sue.
- Bye-bye.

378
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,764
I'm gonna do something with that hair.

379
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,741
You've done a marvelous job.

380
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,609
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- Sure does. Here.

381
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:38,149
Thank you very much.

382
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:41,185
If you could recommend me,
I'd be grateful.

383
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,687
- I'll make a point of it.
- Thank you.

384
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:58,468
I made $5 getting rid of cans for Doc
and $5 for Mrs. Young's fence.

385
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:01,870
- I've saved $20 so far.
- That's terrific.

386
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,068
- Will you buy us something?
- That's Marty's money.

387
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:09,375
- What are you gonna spend it on?
- I might just save it for a while.

388
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,779
You know what
I've been thinking about?

389
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:16,218
- A dog.
- Louise, please, not you too.

390
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,459
I know how badly he wants a dog.
I was a boy once.

391
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,953
A dog isn't a one-purchase thing.

392
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:25,655
There's shots, vets, toys and food.

393
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:29,428
When I sell the nail polish,
we'll have extra money.

394
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:32,162
We'll talk about it later.
It'll still be no.

395
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,405
Excuse me, but this is a family,
we all have a say.

396
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,909
You all can say whatever you like.

397
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,081
I say, "no dog, no way. "

398
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,249
Can I be excused?

399
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,413
You got something to do?

400
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,646
I just want to walk around.

401
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:52,418
You should spend time with a friend.

402
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,651
Sam is a friend.

403
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,852
Sam is a girl. This is a boy.

404
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:59,123
I want him to have a pal
and not be lonely.

405
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,395
You got to make a daily plan for
the rest of the summer.

406
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,765
Why are you being so tough on him?

407
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,033
He's a big help to me.
He worked at Mrs. Young's...

408
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:11,473
...he was picking up cans.

409
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,580
I've said my piece.
You know where I stand.

410
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:18,480
I'm going to go practice my aim.

411
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:22,281
- Why don't you go with him.
- I got the news in five minutes.

412
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,489
I wonder who that is.

413
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:32,699
- Evening, Judd.
- Evening.

414
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,231
What can I do for you?

415
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:37,427
Have you had dinner?
I can heat something up.

416
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:41,096
I ain't looking for a meal,
I'm looking for a dog.

417
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,376
That new dog run off again?
Haven't seen him on my route.

418
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:48,707
If I find him this time,
I'm gonna break his legs.

419
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:52,943
Come on. A dog with
four broke legs ain't no dog at all.

420
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,384
How about you, boy?
I bet you seen him.

421
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,686
Your dog? I haven't seen a dog
around this house all day.

422
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:05,127
You must've seen him.
He likes to follow you around.

423
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:11,264
- Maybe you just don't know it.
- No way, I would've seen him.

424
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,964
Here, dog!

425
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:19,112
When you went to recycling...

426
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:21,713
- ... did you see him?
- I saw the Baker's shepherd.

427
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,613
He gets loose, but I didn't see
any beagles on the road.

428
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,315
You keep a sharp eye out.

429
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:32,014
If you see him, don't get any ideas.

430
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,888
Throw a rope around him
and drag him over.

431
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:36,563
You hear?

432
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,231
You hear what he said?

433
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:41,662
Yes, sir.

434
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:45,961
Thank you.

435
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:49,868
Wouldn't the sheriff get on you
if you hurt that dog?

436
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:54,477
The law never told me
what I can't do with my dogs.

437
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,479
They won't start now.

438
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:01,251
It's like the Bible says.
Animals were put here for us.

439
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:04,715
They got no other purpose or feelings.

440
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:09,662
Have a nice evening.

441
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,700
What are you doing here?

442
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:01,606
Come on.

443
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,242
Oh, boy, Shiloh.

444
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,386
You know, Shiloh?
Some day you're not gonna be a secret.

445
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,853
Even if I have to run away with you,
Judd's not getting you back.

446
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,324
Really, my folks are nice.

447
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,257
We just can't afford a dog right now.

448
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,630
I gotta get home and sleep.

449
00:40:56,837 --> 00:41:00,068
You stay here like a good boy.
Don't run off.

450
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,566
Lie down. Stay.

451
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:04,209
Stay, stay.

452
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,818
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.

453
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:31,128
What are you doing?

454
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:33,397
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

455
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:35,507
- Quit it.
- Quit it.

456
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:37,742
Quit it.

457
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:41,172
- You're no fun.
- You're no fun!

458
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:43,316
- You're no fun.
- Quit it!

459
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:45,951
I'm going to the creek.
I'll be back soon.

460
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:49,281
- I want to go too.
- I'm looking for a snake stick.

461
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,515
I'm looking for a snake stick.

462
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:54,558
It must have a long handle
and a strong fork.

463
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,357
- Why?
- It was the meanest snake ever.

464
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,502
- What snake?
- The one I saw on the hill yesterday.

465
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:05,831
Must've been four, no, five feet long.

466
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,235
Looking for a leg
to wrap itself around.

467
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,967
Kill it. Blow its head off!

468
00:42:11,178 --> 00:42:13,942
You've been watching
too much stuff on TV.

469
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,008
Let's get in the house.

470
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:27,293
Come on. Hey, buddy. How you doing?

471
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:29,394
Yes, yes. I got the food.

472
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,871
I know you're still hungry.

473
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:40,700
So am I. That was half my breakfast.

474
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:43,467
We'll play later on.

475
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:45,110
Go back in the shed.

476
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:47,313
Go. Good boy.

477
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:57,988
- How are you doing?
- Hey, Doc.

478
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:05,123
Can you sell me some old cheese or
lunchmeat for 50 cents?

479
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,664
I don't want your money.

480
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,631
I'll try and find
something not too bad.

481
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,327
Don't want your family
to get sick.

482
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:13,165
It'll be fine.

483
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:15,103
They all have strong stomachs.

484
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:20,212
- Why are you selling that old food?
- It's not old.

485
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:31,152
Don't keep that cheese
more than a couple of days.

486
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,723
- Thank you.
- Tell your mama...

487
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:37,056
...if she's behind in her bills that
she has an open account here.

488
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,531
It's not like that.

489
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:41,860
You don't have to explain.

490
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,362
You're embarrassing him.

491
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,936
Please don't say anything
to my mother about this.

492
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,173
- Thanks.
- You want me to walk with you?

493
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,846
You better finish
your work here first.

494
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,039
I got stuff to do at home.

495
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,377
- I'll see you around.
- Bye.

496
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:01,777
How could you do that?

497
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:03,278
Do what?

498
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,984
Just because they're hurting is no
reason to sell them spoiled food.

499
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:13,927
I think they're okay.

500
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:16,034
No, it's all over town.

501
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,797
That boy has been asking for food
and a job all summer.

502
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:22,976
I'm afraid the Prestons
really are hurting.

503
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,047
Honey, I don't understand.

504
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:31,206
Mrs. Roper makes that turkey
and gives it to us. Why?

505
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,216
What do you mean?
You do a good job for her.

506
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,686
What about the tuna sandwich
in Mrs. Kingle's mailbox...

507
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:39,984
...and that half cherry pie
in the Saunders'.

508
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:44,460
Used to be Mrs. Ellison
would leave me banana bread.

509
00:44:45,532 --> 00:44:47,932
What? Do I look thin or something?

510
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:52,438
Maybe you're the best mail carrier
they ever had.

511
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,164
- You ever think of that?
- You think so?

512
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:56,875
Really?

513
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:04,310
Here you go.

514
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:15,187
That's to keep it cool and fresh.

515
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:19,026
And that's to keep the raccoons out.

516
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,224
One last bite.

517
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,459
Come on.

518
00:45:25,172 --> 00:45:26,434
Let's go.

519
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,992
Good boy.

520
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:52,028
$20 so far.

521
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:57,159
Judd says he won't sell you, but when
I stick $50 in his face, he will.

522
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:01,704
I gotta go home.
Be a good boy and stay here.

523
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:22,361
What are you doing?

524
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,828
Have I got frown lines on my face?
Tell me the truth.

525
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,637
I don't see any.

526
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,831
You don't see any lines
here by my chin?

527
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,873
All I see is a pretty face.

528
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:39,005
Why, thank you.

529
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,737
Give me a kiss.

530
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:44,549
I'll have some of that squash later.

531
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:55,424
Finish up for me.
I'm gonna check on the girls.

532
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:08,868
- Watch out.
- I'll get that, Mommy.

533
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,101
I'll throw one from here.

534
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:20,209
I'll watch from here.
Becky, you throw one in.

535
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,978
I'll toss you one.

536
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:25,317
How are you doing?

537
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:02,090
How long have you had
this dog up here?

538
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,623
A few days, I guess.

539
00:48:08,335 --> 00:48:12,931
You've had Judd's dog up here and told
him you didn't know where it was?

540
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:14,902
I didn't say I didn't know.

541
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:18,236
Just that I hadn't seen him
in our yard.

542
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,384
Will you help me
find a way to keep him?

543
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:30,987
- We have to tell Dad.
- No, we don't. Not yet.

544
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:34,092
I'm not used to keeping secrets
from your dad.

545
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:36,785
- Please don't tell him.
- I've got to.

546
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:41,457
If he finds out that I knew and
didn't tell him, he won't trust me.

547
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,136
He'll make me give him back.

548
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:47,434
I know he will.

549
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:50,873
What else can we do?

550
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:55,946
If Judd comes to our house,
he'll have to fight me to get him.

551
00:48:57,117 --> 00:49:01,247
Promise me one night you won't tell
Dad so I can figure things out.

552
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:07,118
You won't run off with the dog,
will you?

553
00:49:08,328 --> 00:49:09,727
Look at me.

554
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:14,667
Don't ever run away from a problem.

555
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:21,404
Now, I can promise
not to tell your dad tonight...

556
00:49:21,608 --> 00:49:24,168
...if you promise not to run off.

557
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,676
I won't run off.

558
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,678
- Then I won't tell him tonight.
- Or in the morning.

559
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,443
I gotta have at least
one day to think.

560
00:49:36,256 --> 00:49:38,281
His name's Shiloh.

561
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,595
Hello, little puppy.

562
00:50:37,684 --> 00:50:39,549
Marty, take a flashlight.

563
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,293
Get out of here.

564
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:04,703
Please don't die, Shiloh.

565
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,415
Take the gunnysacks on the porch...

566
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:16,086
...and put them on the floor
of the truck.

567
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:18,086
Don't take him back to Judd.

568
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:21,454
- He'll shoot him.
- Get the gunnysacks like I said.

569
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:41,114
Honey, get the keys to the truck.

570
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:51,448
- What is it? What's he got?
- A dog.

571
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,321
- Here. Is he alive?
- Barely.

572
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,202
Sorry, Shiloh.

573
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,645
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

574
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:27,688
Dr. Wallace!

575
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:36,468
- What's up?
- Got a dog here. Hurt real bad.

576
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:49,410
Easy.

577
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:52,885
He sure is bleeding.

578
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,978
First we make sure
he doesn't get infected.

579
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,316
Hold that for me.

580
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:02,593
How did it happen?

581
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,125
Big old shepherd got him.

582
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:17,473
I promise, he'll feel better.
He won't feel any pain.

583
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:19,403
Here we go.

584
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,171
Easy, easy.

585
00:53:23,049 --> 00:53:24,175
Thank you.

586
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:27,547
Whose dog is he?

587
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:31,212
- He's Judd Travers'.
- Where did you find him?

588
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:34,683
- I had him.
- You what?

589
00:53:34,895 --> 00:53:36,123
I had him.

590
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:39,264
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh is right.

591
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,095
Judd doesn't deserve him.
Marty treats him good.

592
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,397
- He's dying because of me.
- Let's go to the other room.

593
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:48,972
No, I'm gonna stay with Shiloh.

594
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:04,152
Not a bad job, if I say so myself.

595
00:54:04,524 --> 00:54:07,652
Tell you something,
this guy's a fighter.

596
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:09,853
Will he be okay?

597
00:54:10,063 --> 00:54:12,964
Come by tomorrow
and we'll see how he's doing.

598
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:17,694
- What do we owe you?
- One of your wife's cherry pies.

599
00:54:17,904 --> 00:54:20,737
I'm serious.
My boy will pay for your time.

600
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:23,603
I will. I promise.

601
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:30,640
It's gonna be okay, boy.

602
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,347
- Is he gonna be all right?
- I hope so.

603
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,025
- Can't thank you enough.
- Thank you, sir.

604
00:54:42,228 --> 00:54:44,355
You're welcome. Any time.

605
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:58,369
Marty loves that dog so much.

606
00:54:58,578 --> 00:55:02,275
I wish Ray could talk
some sense to Judd.

607
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:05,076
After all, they were boys together.

608
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:07,682
Nobody can talk sense to Judd.

609
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:30,966
What else don't I know?

610
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:35,842
- What?
- You hiding Judd's dog.

611
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,415
- What else are you keeping from me?
- Nothing.

612
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:41,382
- How do I know that's not a lie.
- It's not.

613
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,957
Your saying so doesn't make it true.
That's the problem with lying.

614
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:49,490
What should I have done?

615
00:55:49,696 --> 00:55:54,326
Let him wander around so Judd can beat
the living daylights out of him again?

616
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:57,264
- Did you want me to do that?
- Do what's right.

617
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,835
What's right?

618
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:05,944
You got to go by the law.

619
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:09,343
Man that pays money for a dog,
owns that dog.

620
00:56:09,549 --> 00:56:13,007
- You don't like it, change it.
- What if there's no time?

621
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:15,517
He could be dead
the way Judd treats him.

622
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:19,055
You think Judd is the only one
hard-hearted toward animals?

623
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:20,590
Open your eyes to yourself.

624
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:26,290
How many times do you see a hungry,
chained-up animal in a yard?

625
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:30,333
How many times do you think about
how unhappy that dog is?

626
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:35,231
You're face to face with an animal
that pulls at your heart.

627
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:37,601
All at once you have to change things.

628
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,904
There's gotta be a first time.

629
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:43,640
You're right about that.
It's the first time you lied.

630
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:47,148
If Shiloh is okay, I gotta keep him.

631
00:56:47,353 --> 00:56:49,844
You don't have to do anything.

632
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:53,719
I promised Shiloh I wouldn't
give him back to Judd.

633
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:56,953
We'll go to Judd tomorrow
and tell him the truth.

634
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,097
But I've saved up some money.

635
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:01,563
If I can make a deal,
you won't stop me.

636
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:04,100
If you keep this up
there'll be trouble.

637
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,906
What if Judd Travers finds out?

638
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:11,942
If Doc doesn't say anything,
nobody would know.

639
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:15,603
I can make a fence
so the Baker's shepherd can't get in.

640
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,074
Please.

641
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,289
Just till Shiloh's better.

642
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:29,121
Judd will take one look at Shiloh
and shoot him!

643
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:34,159
We have to get him better, Dad.
I'll pay Doc's bills, I promise.

644
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,268
You can have my money for the next
three years. I'll deliver the paper.

645
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:41,865
Please.

646
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:47,473
We'll keep him till he's well.
That's it.

647
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:50,712
Then we take him back to Travers.

648
00:57:59,092 --> 00:58:02,858
<i>- I just found out myself.
- You're keeping secrets from me.</i>

649
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:07,362
<i>People are trying to give us food.
Like I can't feed my family.</i>

650
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,094
<i>- Judd mentioned the dog and he lied.
- He loves the dog.</i>

651
00:58:11,304 --> 00:58:15,035
<i>- Now he's got you on his side.
- He's our son.</i>

652
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,606
<i>I know.</i>

653
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:09,525
- What?
- Where's the doggy?

654
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:13,055
Doc Wallace's.

655
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,270
- You want some breakfast?
- No, thanks.

656
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,939
I'll head over to the Wallaces'.

657
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,768
Here's a sandwich
if you want it for later.

658
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,376
Thanks.

659
00:59:41,794 --> 00:59:45,127
I'll take the bandages off
in a couple of days.

660
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:50,430
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

661
00:59:56,843 --> 01:00:00,142
- I saved up, it's only $20.
- I don't want your money.

662
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,311
Please, Doc. Take the money.

663
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:09,184
Tell you what. I'm gonna give you
$20 worth of dog food.

664
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,058
What's wrong?

665
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:24,829
I gotta give him back to Judd. When
he sees him hurt, he'll shoot him.

666
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,598
You really love that dog, don't you?

667
01:00:29,742 --> 01:00:31,676
You must find a way to keep him.

668
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,540
You don't know
what I've been through.

669
01:00:35,248 --> 01:00:37,944
You feel like the whole world's
against you.

670
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:43,221
See that picture up there?

671
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,156
That's Sam's parents.

672
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,156
Eddie, the father. Clara, the mother.

673
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:52,798
And that little itty-bitty thing,
that's Sam.

674
01:00:55,335 --> 01:00:57,394
I never saw a picture of them before.

675
01:00:58,137 --> 01:00:59,627
Clara was...

676
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,470
...my princess.

677
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:09,074
We were babysitting Sam...

678
01:01:10,683 --> 01:01:12,617
...the night of the accident.

679
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,350
I'll never forget social services.

680
01:01:16,456 --> 01:01:18,856
They jumped all over us.

681
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:23,020
They said we were too old...

682
01:01:23,229 --> 01:01:27,256
...to raise a child and we didn't have
financial stability.

683
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:32,294
I thought it was a joke, I've been
practicing medicine for 40 years.

684
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,972
- But you were able to keep her.
- Yes, after a fight.

685
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:43,342
The love of Sam gave us our strength.

686
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,609
We would have sacrificed anything...

687
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,981
...to keep her.

688
01:01:52,425 --> 01:01:53,915
Sometimes...

689
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,157
...the greatest test of love...

690
01:01:59,031 --> 01:02:02,831
...is how much you're willing
to fight for it.

691
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:05,867
You think about that.

692
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,107
This dog is gonna need a lot of love.

693
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:14,034
Go get him.

694
01:02:25,558 --> 01:02:26,923
I love you.

695
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:44,100
This will do just fine.

696
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:47,471
Let's put him over here.

697
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,483
Nice and gentle. That's it.

698
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,414
There you go. Nice and gentle.

699
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,180
Girls, be very careful with his leg.

700
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,326
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.
Keep an eye on him.

701
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,620
He's licking my hand.

702
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:09,026
Will you come pet this dog?

703
01:03:09,635 --> 01:03:12,934
No good getting attached to a dog
we gotta give back.

704
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,757
Stay. Stay.

705
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,514
Judd won't sell the dog.

706
01:03:56,716 --> 01:04:00,174
- Besides, with Doc's bills...
- Marty settled that.

707
01:04:00,386 --> 01:04:03,378
Don't go guessing
another man's business.

708
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,251
The Doc has every right
to charge us full rate.

709
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:07,785
You know he won't.

710
01:04:07,994 --> 01:04:11,088
Watch what he does
when I put a sock under his face.

711
01:04:12,465 --> 01:04:14,023
Let me try it.

712
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,103
It's Judd.

713
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:32,250
Girls, go on upstairs.

714
01:04:42,862 --> 01:04:46,025
Ray Preston, Mrs. Young told me
you got my dog.

715
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:49,793
He's right there. He's hurt.
We've been taking care of him.

716
01:04:50,002 --> 01:04:52,698
I'll be danged. I can't believe it.

717
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:01,105
Somebody knows my dog is missing,
takes him in...

718
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,875
- ... and don't tell me.
- Nobody wants to hear it's been hurt.

719
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:08,053
We wanted to make sure
that he pulled through.

720
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:10,953
Tell Judd how the dog come to be here.

721
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,681
Go ahead.

722
01:05:14,594 --> 01:05:17,290
He come here
because you been mistreating him.

723
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:22,333
The second time I hid him
in the woods. Dad didn't know.

724
01:05:22,535 --> 01:05:26,437
The Baker's shepherd got loose
and hurt Shiloh.

725
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:29,904
- Who?
- Shiloh. That's what I'm calling him.

726
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,500
Shiloh got hurt really bad.

727
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:35,738
It was my fault because
the shed wasn't safe.

728
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,509
Doc Wallace patched him up.

729
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:45,448
Boy, put the dog down.

730
01:05:49,895 --> 01:05:51,760
Look what you done to my dog.

731
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:03,568
I never mistreated my dogs.

732
01:06:04,677 --> 01:06:07,407
I never caused an injury like this.

733
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:11,344
It wouldn't have happened
if you'd brought him back.

734
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:16,844
He was wrong to hide the dog
and he will pay Doc Wallace.

735
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:20,992
As soon as he's strong,
we'll drive him over to you.

736
01:06:21,193 --> 01:06:22,751
Let us keep him until then.

737
01:06:22,962 --> 01:06:24,589
Excuse me, Judd?

738
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:27,864
Marty's got awful attached
to that dog.

739
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,928
How much do you want for him?

740
01:06:36,642 --> 01:06:38,576
This dog is not for sale.

741
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:41,602
I paid good money
to get a hunting dog...

742
01:06:41,814 --> 01:06:43,907
...and this is the best
I ever had.

743
01:06:45,017 --> 01:06:48,316
If you want to take him
till he's better, that's okay.

744
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:52,116
You got him tore up
and you will pay the bill.

745
01:06:53,325 --> 01:06:57,591
- But I want him back by Sunday.
- You'll have him back by Sunday.

746
01:06:59,031 --> 01:07:01,591
I don't believe
you allowed this to happen.

747
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:09,303
I'm not giving him back.

748
01:07:09,508 --> 01:07:11,339
What are you gonna do?

749
01:07:12,078 --> 01:07:16,913
First thing in the morning, I'll go
talk to Travers and settle this.

750
01:07:28,894 --> 01:07:33,024
Look, Judd. I love this dog
and I'm not giving him back.

751
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:35,496
I've saved up some money and...
Oh, yeah?

752
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:36,690
Go ahead and try.

753
01:07:36,902 --> 01:07:40,394
You can beat, punch and kick me.
I'm not giving up the dog.

754
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:18,206
What do you think you're doing?

755
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:21,470
You could get shot sneaking up
on somebody like that.

756
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,580
I was on my way to see you.

757
01:08:28,154 --> 01:08:30,554
You caused me to miss my shot.

758
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:36,826
Sounds like the day
might not be a total loss.

759
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,495
Rabbit ain't in season.

760
01:08:42,568 --> 01:08:44,229
What are you? The game warden?

761
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,267
There's a $200 fine
for killing rabbit out of season.

762
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:51,107
I didn't kill no rabbit, did I?

763
01:08:52,077 --> 01:08:54,045
What about this?

764
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,742
You set this trap?

765
01:08:56,749 --> 01:09:00,583
Boy, are you trying
to stir up trouble?

766
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:07,583
Don't you know that I can put you
in your place real quick?

767
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,787
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

768
01:09:11,697 --> 01:09:15,224
Like the dog I found
with a bullet in its head?

769
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:18,528
I know whose bullet that was.
I told Dad.

770
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:22,540
If my folks find a bullet in
my head, they know whose it is.

771
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,039
Come on, simmer down.

772
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,041
I got lots of game up here.

773
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:33,116
I'll let you keep that rabbit. Don't
tell me your mama wouldn't like that.

774
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:35,981
I don't want the rabbit.
I want Shiloh.

775
01:09:36,188 --> 01:09:38,247
Set that rabbit free.

776
01:09:38,457 --> 01:09:40,857
You came here to set me up.

777
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,791
It's Sunday, the day
you told me to bring your dog back.

778
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:49,096
You'll have to fight me first
to get him back.

779
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:50,992
I mean to keep that dog.

780
01:09:51,203 --> 01:09:54,639
If you expect me to keep my mouth
shut, you'll make the trade.

781
01:09:57,576 --> 01:09:59,635
Let me get something straight.

782
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:04,746
You're telling me
that if I let you have my dog...

783
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:07,347
...you'll keep your mouth shut?

784
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:11,749
You gotta do more
than keep your mouth shut.

785
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,949
You gotta promise not to come up here
spying on me.

786
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,323
I ain't gonna spy.
You know it's wrong.

787
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,590
I'll tell the warden
to watch out for illegal game.

788
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,893
Ain't you something.

789
01:10:24,336 --> 01:10:25,769
Wait a minute.

790
01:10:26,772 --> 01:10:29,206
I paid $35 for that dog.

791
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:32,133
I want $40 for it.

792
01:10:32,344 --> 01:10:36,371
I'm working hard.
I'll get the money to you by and by.

793
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:39,346
I don't want any money by and by.

794
01:10:39,551 --> 01:10:41,678
I want something right now.

795
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:43,787
You're gonna have to work for it.

796
01:10:44,556 --> 01:10:45,989
You got a bargain.

797
01:10:47,893 --> 01:10:51,920
You gotta work for me four hours
a day, five days in a row.

798
01:10:52,398 --> 01:10:53,660
I'll do it.

799
01:10:53,866 --> 01:10:56,164
- Keep your mouth shut.
- I will.

800
01:10:57,202 --> 01:10:59,261
How do you get her out of this?

801
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:01,598
Boy, if you ain't a mess.

802
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,177
Look out.

803
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,609
When will you clear all these traps?

804
01:11:12,818 --> 01:11:15,651
I'm not. That will be your job.

805
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:20,681
Start by picking
that one up right now.

806
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,734
I want that wood split, stacked.

807
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:37,431
I want the weeds cut.

808
01:11:37,643 --> 01:11:41,602
Whatever I think of to be done,
that's what you'll do.

809
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,179
No, put it over there.

810
01:11:48,287 --> 01:11:50,255
Hang it on the nail.

811
01:11:52,324 --> 01:11:55,384
- I want you here starting tomorrow.
- I'll be here.

812
01:11:55,594 --> 01:12:00,156
I want it in writing that
after I do 20 hours of work for you...

813
01:12:00,366 --> 01:12:01,924
...Shiloh belongs to me.

814
01:12:02,768 --> 01:12:03,996
In writing?

815
01:12:07,373 --> 01:12:09,398
You stay right there.

816
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:19,750
Put whatever you want on the back.

817
01:12:20,786 --> 01:12:22,845
My hands are dirty.

818
01:12:25,157 --> 01:12:26,988
It's my hunting calendar.

819
01:12:31,897 --> 01:12:34,695
"Beagle hunting dog... "

820
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:39,569
Sign it.

821
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,298
- I'll be here tomorrow.
- Wait.

822
01:13:17,509 --> 01:13:21,809
If you ever tell anyone
about that rabbit or them traps...

823
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:24,212
...you're gonna be one sorry boy.

824
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,444
You got my word.

825
01:13:43,769 --> 01:13:46,465
- Where you been?
- Went to see Judd Travers.

826
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:50,938
- I'm buying Shiloh.
- Judd said he wasn't selling his dog.

827
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:53,737
I talked him into it. He needs help.

828
01:13:53,946 --> 01:13:57,279
If I work 20 hours it'd be worth
the $40 he wants for Shiloh.

829
01:13:57,483 --> 01:13:59,849
I don't believe it.

830
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:02,953
- Shiloh is your dog?
- Not yet, but he will be.

831
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:05,089
That's wonderful! Ray?

832
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:08,987
Judd said he wasn't selling his dog.
What went on?

833
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,822
I told him I wasn't
giving Shiloh back.

834
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:15,227
- You said that to Judd?
- Only thing I hadn't tried.

835
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:17,698
It must be because Shiloh's hurt.

836
01:14:17,903 --> 01:14:20,497
- He's getting rid of a lame dog.
- That's what I figured.

837
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:26,601
Well, puppy, are you a new member
of the household?

838
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:47,956
I brought in 10 traps.
That's all I can find.

839
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:49,759
That's all there were.

840
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:52,937
- Any catches?
- They were all empty.

841
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,131
You see that patch of land?

842
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,908
I want you to clean this mess up.

843
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,471
Then I want you to work the ground.

844
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,606
I mean to plant some corn on it.

845
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:14,922
What are you waiting for? Get to work.

846
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:55,995
Come here, boy.

847
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:58,627
Come here!

848
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:04,764
Move that stuff from there to there.

849
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:07,476
- But...
- Don't question me.

850
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,014
After you're through with the garbage.

851
01:16:13,552 --> 01:16:16,544
Before you do that,
get the couch in the house.

852
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:20,949
Bring me a beer.

853
01:16:30,936 --> 01:16:33,564
Don't touch it, then I can't read it.

854
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:35,404
I'm not sick.

855
01:16:37,609 --> 01:16:41,773
It's 100 degrees.
I don't think you should go tomorrow.

856
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,881
I'm going. I've gotta stick
to my promise.

857
01:16:46,051 --> 01:16:47,712
For Shiloh.

858
01:16:49,221 --> 01:16:51,553
All right. Tell Judd to take it easy.

859
01:16:52,057 --> 01:16:54,548
Work inside the house, okay?

860
01:16:57,162 --> 01:16:58,754
Here we go.

861
01:16:59,131 --> 01:17:00,621
I'm telling you.

862
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:16,543
See that big piece of wood?

863
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,911
I want you to roll it over there...

864
01:17:20,118 --> 01:17:22,882
...take this wedge, drive it in it...

865
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,989
...then you hit that wedge
with a sledgehammer.

866
01:17:26,992 --> 01:17:30,257
You get pieces small enough
to fit into my stove.

867
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:32,886
Got that?

868
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:09,961
You're sure doing a lot of work
for nothing.

869
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:12,033
Shiloh's something.

870
01:18:12,337 --> 01:18:14,601
You don't think
you'll get my dog...

871
01:18:14,806 --> 01:18:18,105
...because of some handwriting
on a piece of paper?

872
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:22,337
That paper ain't worth nothing
except to blow your nose on.

873
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:25,744
- It ain't got a witness.
- What do you mean?

874
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,943
You don't know what's legal
and what's not, do you?

875
01:18:29,154 --> 01:18:32,783
You show a judge a piece of paper
without a witness signature...

876
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:36,085
...he'll laugh you
out of the courthouse.

877
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:41,493
Someone has to sign it
who saw you strike a bargain.

878
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,863
Ain't nobody here except my dogs.

879
01:18:48,707 --> 01:18:52,370
What are you, boy? Some kind of fool?

880
01:19:05,624 --> 01:19:09,321
What are you breaking your back for?

881
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:11,189
I want that dog.

882
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,430
There he is.
I want to check his leg.

883
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,670
It's healing pretty well.

884
01:19:29,648 --> 01:19:32,173
Dad, what's a witness?

885
01:19:32,384 --> 01:19:36,184
Someone who sees something happen
and swears it's true.

886
01:19:36,388 --> 01:19:38,822
If you make a bargain,
do you need a witness?

887
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,424
If you want it legal, I guess.

888
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:44,220
Why? What are you thinking of?

889
01:19:44,429 --> 01:19:48,229
Just thinking about selling things.
Land and stuff.

890
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:51,766
You're not thinking of selling my land
to buy Shiloh?

891
01:19:54,606 --> 01:19:57,666
- Let's have a look.
- I'm all right.

892
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,811
Does it feel good to be in your room?

893
01:20:01,012 --> 01:20:03,310
Did you get the job?

894
01:20:03,582 --> 01:20:05,675
Yeah, I got the job.

895
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,853
And you are my first customer.

896
01:20:09,187 --> 01:20:12,315
All I can do is stick to my side
of the deal and see what happens.

897
01:20:12,524 --> 01:20:14,754
- You should tell your folks.
- It's between Judd and me.

898
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,794
I don't want Judd mad
and having bad feelings.

899
01:20:18,997 --> 01:20:22,125
Or worry about Shiloh
while I'm at school.

900
01:20:22,334 --> 01:20:25,633
I'm the one to square this
and I'll finish the job.

901
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,608
What do you think?

902
01:20:38,517 --> 01:20:40,144
Paint it again.

903
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:44,452
Paint it again.

904
01:20:57,035 --> 01:20:59,003
That's about it.

905
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:16,414
- Kind of tired.
- You couldn't have worked me harder.

906
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:19,055
You done everything I asked too.

907
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:24,420
I'll take good care of Shiloh.

908
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,224
You ain't keeping him.

909
01:21:29,234 --> 01:21:32,692
- But...
- I told you. The deal's off.

910
01:21:33,104 --> 01:21:36,699
But we made a bargain.
You can't go back on it now.

911
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:43,837
What time you want me
to pick up my dog?

912
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:48,214
You come for Shiloh,
bring the sheriff.

913
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,155
Get on home, boy. Get on home.

914
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:56,759
Get on home. Scram!

915
01:21:56,962 --> 01:21:58,520
Keep away!

916
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:03,394
- Pick up no stick to me, boy!
- You're never getting Shiloh back!

917
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:32,191
<i>I'll whup the daylights out of him.
You'll never have enough to buy him.</i>

918
01:22:32,397 --> 01:22:35,628
<i>What are you? Some kind of fool?</i>

919
01:22:59,024 --> 01:23:01,356
What do you want?

920
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:04,892
- Where are your folks?
- Dad's on his way back.

921
01:23:05,096 --> 01:23:08,259
- You got something that belongs to me.
- No, I don't.

922
01:23:08,466 --> 01:23:11,765
I worked hard for this dog.
I ain't giving him up.

923
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:14,302
I want my dog back.

924
01:23:14,506 --> 01:23:16,736
Get off my property.

925
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:19,768
I want you to take this leash...

926
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:22,970
- ... and put it around his neck.
- No.

927
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:24,079
Go on, Shiloh.

928
01:23:31,022 --> 01:23:34,389
- Leave my dog alone!
- What are you doing?

929
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:37,618
Keep away from me, just keep away.

930
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,536
You all right?

931
01:23:50,408 --> 01:23:53,639
- Better control your boy.
- Get out of here, Judd!

932
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:57,715
- Dog is my property.
- We had a deal.

933
01:23:57,916 --> 01:24:01,909
Maybe it won't make legal sense, but
you and I know we made a bargain...

934
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,055
- ... and you lied to me.
- That makes us even.

935
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,256
Why don't you and me
discuss this man to man?

936
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,988
I'm through with discussing, Ray.
That dog is mine.

937
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:18,197
Judd, you can't take Shiloh.

938
01:24:20,672 --> 01:24:21,832
You take Shiloh...

939
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,910
...and you have forever
made an enemy of me.

940
01:24:26,111 --> 01:24:28,875
Don't mess with me.
I'm in the right.

941
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,278
And you know it.

942
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,111
He's gonna kill Shiloh!

943
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:35,650
Stay here.

944
01:24:53,438 --> 01:24:54,700
Wait, Judd. Wait.

945
01:25:00,979 --> 01:25:03,345
All I had was your word.

946
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:07,981
Ain't that worth something to you?

947
01:26:12,317 --> 01:26:14,342
Shiloh, huh?

948
01:26:23,161 --> 01:26:24,685
Go on! Get!

949
01:26:53,424 --> 01:26:55,392
You know what, Marty?

950
01:26:55,693 --> 01:26:58,491
I think you got yourself a dog.

951
01:26:59,497 --> 01:27:01,761
I got myself a dog.
