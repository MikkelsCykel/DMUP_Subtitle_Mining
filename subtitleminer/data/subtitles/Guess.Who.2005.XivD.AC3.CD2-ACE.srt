00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,123
This isn't like us at home,
laughing about this bullshit.

2
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:10,060
It's my father's house, Simon.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,224
What do you want me to do,
go upstairs and apologize to him again?

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,358
No.

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,768
Let the storm pass. It'll be fine.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,907
Besides, he dared you!

7
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:23,205
- He double-dared! He called me chicken.
- I heard!

8
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:26,714
- I can't be called chicken.
- You have to watch him on those.

9
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:31,680
You know? I'm fresh out of ideas
as to how to impress your father.

10
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:35,622
Telling black jokes is never a good idea,
but that's just me.

11
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:37,021
You think?

12
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,927
I'll talk to him.

13
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:51,297
Say nice things about me.

14
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:54,866
No, I'm not going to say nice things
about you. You are still punished.

15
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,974
Baby, I'm a good guy.
I like ribs, too. I don't...

16
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,754
Why are you being so mean to me?

17
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:06,450
- My grandfather's out there.
- He's not going to come in.

18
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,154
- This is my mom's kitchen!
- She's not going to come in.

19
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:11,627
You're still gonna do the dishes.

20
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,560
- Get off me.
- Fine, I'll do the dishes.

21
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,093
Here, do the broccoli one.

22
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:24,133
- Dad, I have to talk to you.
- What?

23
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,412
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't start it. Mr. Nappy Head did.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,212
Dad, Simon's a good man.
He has a good heart.

25
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,515
- A good man?
- You put him on the spot.

26
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:33,849
You really think so?

27
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:35,912
What is your problem with him anyways?

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,583
Besides the fact, of course, that he's white.

29
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:42,356
You gonna get in a heap of trouble
talking to me like that.

30
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:46,226
Don't care nothing about that man
being white. He's hiding something.

31
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:47,768
What? NASCAR?

32
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,230
You thought I didn't know?

33
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:55,568
Of course I knew.
We talk about everything, Simon and I.

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,842
Daddy, I love him,
and you need to start respecting that.

35
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:04,878
Then you respect me enough to tell me
in advance who you're bringing home.

36
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,423
- I didn't think you'd care.
- But you weren't sure.

37
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,722
- So you decided to test me.
- No, of course not.

38
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,421
- So you're looking for a reaction?
- No.

39
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:12,826
So what are you looking for?

40
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:17,062
I'm looking for you to tell me
that it's okay for me to be with him.

41
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,910
I'm scared.

42
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:29,907
Okay?

43
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,750
I'm really scared, Dad.

44
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,922
I know things are different now
and times have changed...

45
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:40,892
but you should really hear the kind of things
that people say to us sometimes.

46
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,087
And the way they look at us.

47
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,933
I need you to tell me
that it's okay to be with him.

48
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:54,170
Baby, me telling you it's okay
is not gonna change the world.

49
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,677
Dad. But it would change my world.

50
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,471
It will change my world
if I know that you're behind us.

51
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,985
I'm always behind you, sweetheart.

52
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:05,753
And I love you.

53
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,184
It's my job to keep you safe.

54
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,253
And I don't trust that kid.

55
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,678
- Hey, baby.
- Yes.

56
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:35,480
I'm trying to figure out where he got
all those doggone black jokes.

57
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,920
What do white people do, take a class...

58
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,481
sit around and think of new jokes
about the black man?

59
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,322
I don't know, Percy.

60
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,755
You need to let that one go.

61
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:48,994
Come on, sweetheart.
We need to practice the tango.

62
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,300
I told you. I ain't doing no doggone tango.

63
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:54,240
Why? You think you can't dance anymore?

64
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:57,868
No. I think the tango's a stupid dance
and I ain't doing it.

65
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:01,546
Marilyn...

66
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:06,278
why can't we do the hustle?
What's wrong with the hustle?

67
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:10,022
Because the hustle is a stupid dance...

68
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:12,184
and I want to do the tango.

69
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,958
Look here, woman,
can't we do this some other time?

70
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,472
I gotta take Dad back to the home.

71
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,838
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

72
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:19,856
Shut up!

73
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:26,738
All right, stop.
Okay, move a little to your left.

74
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,504
- Okay.
- All right, kiss me.

75
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:31,547
This is the exact spot
where I had my first kiss.

76
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:35,749
No! I'm not going to kiss you in the spot
that you had your first kiss.

77
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:38,249
- No.
- Why not?

78
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:41,450
It's some other guy's spot.

79
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,584
Fine.

80
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,662
- What was his name?
- Curtis Booker.

81
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,096
He had these big old Bucky Beaver teeth.

82
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,330
But he was such a nice boy.
He was a good kisser, too.

83
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:55,098
- Better than me?
- Way better.

84
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,864
- Way better?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,808
- Did he grab your ass?
- No.

86
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,844
- Squeeze it?
- No. We were 13.

87
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:03,380
- Grab you down here?
- No. Come on!

88
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,286
- Slow down.
- Come on.

89
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:14,787
- There's a car! Get out of the way!
- Come on! Yeah!

90
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,796
Okay, be careful.

91
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:28,433
So, this is my favorite spot.

92
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:32,370
It's pretty amazing, huh?

93
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:35,174
All right, so it's not...

94
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,447
the top of the world, but it's nice.

95
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,956
It's a fort.

96
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,758
It's a gun placement.

97
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:50,229
When I was little, I would sneak
out of the house in the middle of the night...

98
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:54,565
and just come out here and just dream.

99
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:56,231
Yeah?

100
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,767
Weren't you afraid of sneaking
out of your house?

101
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:02,368
Please. I'm not afraid of Percy Jones.

102
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,676
Well, that makes you and... you.

103
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,888
Okay, so this is just Cranford.

104
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:18,859
But it's a great place to grow up.
It's a good place to raise a family, too.

105
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,497
You know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

106
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,831
What? Live in the suburbs?

107
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:31,872
No. Tell your parents
about our engagement this weekend.

108
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,808
Simon, I told you not to look at him
straight in the eye.

109
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,347
I don't think Percy Jones is ready.

110
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,315
I think Percy Jones needs more time.

111
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,125
A lot more time for Percy Jones.

112
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:50,354
- Are you getting cold feet, Simon?
- No.

113
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:54,198
No, I'm not getting cold feet.

114
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,062
I can't wait to marry you.

115
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,007
Make babies with you.

116
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:05,081
Give me a daughter that looks just like you.

117
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,148
I can work on that.

118
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,620
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:16,290
And hopefully, I can be a good dad.

120
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,492
I think you'll be a great dad.

121
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:22,657
You're never gonna be
like your father, Simon.

122
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:28,699
Maybe I can be like yours.

123
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,366
- Like Percy?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,038
- No.
- Baby, Percy Jones is a good dad.

125
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:35,576
He's there for you.

126
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:38,613
He cares about you. He loves you so much.

127
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,180
He does.

128
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,255
We just have to get him to love you.

129
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:47,920
Maybe we can start by getting him to take
the padlock off the basement door.

130
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,822
It's not going to happen.

131
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,692
Why don't you give me
a little Curtis Booker?

132
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,328
I can't believe I told you that.

133
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:59,238
- Come on, baby, a little Bucky Beaver?
- No.

134
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:02,068
No. How about some Simon Green?

135
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,412
Marilyn, you cut off the porch light?

136
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,151
That's my girl.

137
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,438
Very stylish.

138
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:02,843
I need to take a quarter inch off the pants.
I can do it here. Let me have them.

139
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,539
What, you mean take the pants off?

140
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:08,071
I could do with you in them
but I don't want to poke you with my needle.

141
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,085
You keep your eyes on the pants,
you hear me?

142
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:24,600
Mr. Jones, do you know
where the extra chairs are?

143
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,795
What are you, blind?
They're against the wall.

144
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,102
- When you go out, close the door.
- Right.

145
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:32,076
Percy, put some pants on.
We got people in the house.

146
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:34,807
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sweetheart. I didn't realize.

147
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,077
How long's it gonna take?

148
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:39,948
- Two shakes of a lamb's tail.
- Whatever the hell that means.

149
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:42,213
Mercy, Percy! Keep your shirt on!

150
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,277
Or take it off. Whatever.

151
00:11:44,556 --> 00:11:48,048
Could someone answer
that damn phone? Thank you!

152
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:54,289
- Jones residence.
- This is Reggie. Who's this?

153
00:11:55,435 --> 00:12:00,169
- This is Theresa's boyfriend.
- Jamal! What's up, man?

154
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:03,335
- Percy told me all about you.
- What's that?

155
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,676
My name is Reggie.
Percy told me all about you, man.

156
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:07,840
He did?

157
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:12,114
You know what we should do?
Get together and play some hoops, man.

158
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:14,612
I don't really play hoops.

159
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:17,484
Come on, man. Don't be shy.
Why are you being shy?

160
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,692
Percy told me that you went to Howard.
He said you almost went pro.

161
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,333
- He said that?
- Yeah.

162
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,268
He was bragging all about you, Jamal.
But listen...

163
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:30,636
two things.
One: Could you autograph the issue...

164
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:34,701
of Jet for me? And the other thing is,
I would love to meet the Cosbys.

165
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,578
When I say love to meet them,
I mean I love to meet them.

166
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,681
- I'll see what I can do.
- I feel like I grew up with them.

167
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:43,219
Let me get Percy for you.

168
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:46,086
You know, in the '80s and whatnot and...

169
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:49,990
- It's for you. It's Reggie.
- We were talking about the Cosbys.

170
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:53,292
- May I have some privacy, please?
- But, yeah, you know what I mean?

171
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:55,928
- And shut the door.
- I'd still love to meet them.

172
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:57,458
Theo...

173
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,203
Reggie. What did you find out?

174
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:04,902
You were right about Simon Green.
He is no longer at J.P. Oliver.

175
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:07,004
Come on. Give me my pants.

176
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,845
- Jamal, huh?
- Don't start.

177
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,979
This isn't about me. It's about you
and your job, that you don't have anymore.

178
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,852
- What?
- Yeah. Move out of my way.

179
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:18,422
Hey, baby!

180
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:22,028
Theresa! Come here, sweetheart.
Daddy needs to talk to you.

181
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,862
- Don't listen to him.
- What are you talking about?

182
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:28,495
Your boyfriend's unemployed, lost his job.
He got fired a couple days ago.

183
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:30,299
I did not get fired! I quit!

184
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:32,569
You quit? Why didn't you tell me this?

185
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:35,702
- It's complicated.
- It's complicated when you're a liar.

186
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:40,077
I'm a liar?
What about the lies you told Reggie?

187
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,740
- Jamal?
- Who's Jamal?

188
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,481
- He's good friends with the Cosbys.
- What about NASCAR?

189
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,988
That was nothing, and I admitted it.

190
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:50,322
- You admitted that you lied.
- You tried to kill me with a go-kart.

191
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,090
At least I can drive.

192
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:55,292
This crazy ass almost got us arrested.
Now we both got court dates.

193
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,234
I can't believe you checked up on me.

194
00:13:57,302 --> 00:14:00,169
- You kept asking me for money.
- I never asked you for money.

195
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,764
- You asked my father for money?
- $50,000 loan, baby.

196
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,310
- I did not. He trapped me into it.
- You're a liar.

197
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,142
You were checking up on him?

198
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,911
He forced my hand.
You're my daughter and he's not worthy!

199
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,612
- That's not for you to decide.
- Right!

200
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,621
And what about you, lying to me?
You said you would never lie.

201
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,212
You ain't gotta go over there.

202
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,724
I thought I could get another job.

203
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,820
I was gonna tell you,
but I didn't want to ruin the big weekend.

204
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:24,264
You said we would
always tell each other the truth.

205
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,530
Like how you told your parents
about me being white?

206
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:31,470
- I knew they wouldn't care about that.
- I don't care. I care that you're a liar.

207
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,739
That's bullshit! You care.
He has to care. It's human nature.

208
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:38,403
That means that you care that I'm black?

209
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,311
- Do you?
- Dad!

210
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:45,576
No. It doesn't matter what I say.
You people are gonna think I'm a racist.

211
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:49,387
- You hear that? "You people."
- I know. I heard. What people?

212
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,394
The people in the yard.

213
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:58,361
That's what I'm... See?
I say one thing and I'm a racist!

214
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:01,338
- No, Simon, you're a liar.
- And a racist.

215
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:05,538
Where do you get off calling me a racist?
I have a black girlfriend!

216
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,010
- You had a black girlfriend!
- Have.

217
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,708
Past tense! Had!
And let me tell you something else, son...

218
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:13,548
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

219
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:17,350
- He got fired from J.P. Oliver!
- I did not get fired! I quit!

220
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:19,948
- I told you to stay out of Theresa's life.
- Thank you.

221
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:22,721
He can't just walk in our house,
telling our baby lies.

222
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:25,288
- I'm not lying!
- I don't think so!

223
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:29,399
- The party's off, Percy.
- Woman, you must be crazy.

224
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,669
I don't want to say my vows with you.
It would be a lie before God.

225
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:35,072
Marilyn, we're saying
some goddamn vows tomorrow.

226
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,669
- Yeah, he got a book and everything.
- Would you shut up?

227
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:40,776
You got your vows out of a book?

228
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,786
No. Don't listen to him! I got a book.
I'm using it for inspiration.

229
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:47,617
- He wrote it down word for word.
- You're going to get hurt.

230
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:49,783
- That is so pathetic!
- Come on, Marilyn!

231
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:53,419
Because if memory serves me correctly,
I used to be inspiration enough.

232
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,758
You still are!

233
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,959
You'd be inspiration to me. He neglects you.

234
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,626
Marilyn, get your ass back here!

235
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:02,036
I got a $200 cake coming tomorrow!

236
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:05,803
Sixty pounds of shrimp!
Sixty pounds of shrimp, woman!

237
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,776
I had to take a second on the house!

238
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:11,302
- She looked angry.
- Marilyn, don't let me raise my voice now!

239
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,078
You gonna force me to use the muscle!

240
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:14,517
Hope you like seafood.

241
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:23,995
Theresa! Wait!

242
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,462
Come on!

243
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,265
- They'll be back.
- No, they're not coming back.

244
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,864
They gotta come back.
Sixty pounds of shrimp!

245
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,966
Come on, baby. Pick it up.

246
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,404
Answer that phone, sweetheart,
and it will be your last.

247
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:46,676
Let me borrow your car.

248
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:50,453
What? You can't go chasing behind
no women. Have some dignity!

249
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,721
Besides, you can't even drive
a damn go-kart!

250
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:58,928
Trouble in paradise?

251
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,652
Baby, we need to talk about this.

252
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:19,551
You should call me
and we should talk about it like adults...

253
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:22,150
because adults communicate
when they have problems.

254
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:25,856
I'm looking at your photos on the wall
and they're beautiful.

255
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:30,866
Beautiful photos. I don't think that
I compliment you on your work enough.

256
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:35,773
You know what? You're being rude.
That's what you're being. So call me back.

257
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:40,512
Baby, I'm sorry. You're not being rude.

258
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,707
You have all the reason in the world
to be upset with me right now.

259
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:47,981
You shouldn't be calling me back.
If I was you, I wouldn't call me back.

260
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:50,017
Baby, call me back.

261
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:52,089
Call me back, baby.

262
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,288
I'm looking at your bulletin board
and there's a picture of you...

263
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:59,095
sitting next to a guy and I think
that that guy might be Curtis Booker.

264
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,068
He looks like he's got Bucky Beaver teeth.

265
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:03,434
He looks a lot older than 13!

266
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:06,567
So I don't know how you feel about it,
but it's gone!

267
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,838
Old Curtis Booker can go bye-bye!

268
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,905
Baby, do you have any Scotch Tape?

269
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:17,420
You're acting like I cheated on you,
and I've never cheated on you...

270
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:21,549
except for that one time with myself,
and you caught me.

271
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,765
Hello.

272
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:40,538
Darlene! How you doing?
This is Percy Jones.

273
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:44,639
I'm looking for Marilyn. She left a little
earlier. I thought she'd be back by now.

274
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:48,312
- I'm sorry. Now, who is this?
- Percy Jones.

275
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:51,320
I'm sorry, Percy.
I must have fell asleep on the couch.

276
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,585
Baby, you say you looking for Marilyn?

277
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,993
- Have you seen her?
- Well, now, what happened?

278
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:58,327
What'd you say to my sister, Percy Jones?

279
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,928
Nothing.

280
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:04,296
Listen, if you hear from her,
can you let me know?

281
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:08,639
Will do. And I look forward to seeing you
tomorrow at the party, right?

282
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:11,544
- Yeah, it should be a lot of fun.
- Goodbye.

283
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,152
Girl!

284
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:28,422
You will never guess
who was just on the phone!

285
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,029
- Who?
- A Mr. Percy A. Jones.

286
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,097
Percy A. Who?

287
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,331
Yeah, well, baby, he is feeling the pain now!

288
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:43,106
Mom. Is that gonna be your last one?

289
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,149
It might be, baby. And it might not.

290
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:49,678
You should be over there
trying to work this out with Dad.

291
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:53,122
I should be over there trying to work it out
with Simon. Mom, please.

292
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:57,186
Child, leave your mom alone.
They ain't going nowhere.

293
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:00,096
Your man quit his job and didn't tell you.

294
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,834
- Got to nip that shit in the bud.
- Yes.

295
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,529
No. But... Look, I have 15 missed calls.

296
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:09,398
- Fifteen, Mom. Fifteen!
- Fifteen?

297
00:20:09,477 --> 00:20:11,603
Your baby got 15 missed calls!

298
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,910
- Bullshit. Let him wait!
- That's true.

299
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,312
I'm gonna call him now.

300
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,909
- No, you're not!
- No. Don't you dare!

301
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:21,718
Child, you take your finger off that trigger!

302
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,852
Did he lie to you, Theresa?
Did he lie to you?

303
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,293
Yes, he did.

304
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:30,622
So, if you don't want him to do it again,
let him feel the pain!

305
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,505
Look, honey, and if you want him
that bad, you've got to train him.

306
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,803
My God, if what he's giving you
is that good...

307
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,572
and then you still don't want him,
send his pasty ass to me!

308
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:50,117
- All right, one more!
- Two!

309
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,916
There you go, baby!

310
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:59,325
Here's to you, baby.

311
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:05,561
I gotta go to work in the morning. Hello?

312
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,307
- Sorry, Marcus.
- I'm sorry, baby.

313
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,904
You want a taste?

314
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,987
Thank you, Marcus.

315
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,655
This is my house.

316
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:55,286
- She won't answer the phone.
- She don't want to talk to you.

317
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:58,726
- Can I get something to drink?
- What, vodka?

318
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:02,494
Yes. Vodka. I would like some vodka.

319
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,768
Sorry, Charlie. No vodka.

320
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:08,738
There's gotta be something around here.
Marilyn was throwing an anniversary party.

321
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:09,900
Is throwing a party.

322
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:11,271
- Was.
- Is.

323
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,840
- Party's off, dude.
- The party is on, dude.

324
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:17,351
You won't find no liquor in here.
This is a Christian home.

325
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,542
Bingo.

326
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:23,320
With a house full of sinners.

327
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,520
Marilyn's got good taste in vodka.
This is, like, a $50 bottle.

328
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,688
Give me that. Give it here.

329
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,894
- Can I at least have a little bit?
- No.

330
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:37,203
Just a taste.

331
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:43,066
Come around here and get those
two glasses over there. Hurry up.

332
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:47,804
Who's playing?

333
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,885
Played. That's history.

334
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,852
New York Giants' first Super Bowl win.

335
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,420
Talking about Phil Simms. L.T.

336
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:06,092
You ever play?

337
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:11,298
- I told you before, no.
- Pitiful.

338
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,621
All right, let's do it.

339
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:24,349
Do what?

340
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:37,900
- Fumble!
- You said you weren't gonna hit me!

341
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,736
Touchdown! Yeah, baby.

342
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:44,105
- This is where your hands go.
- Where am I gonna be?

343
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:46,578
- You're on the bottom. I'm on the top.
- All right.

344
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,877
Okay, so you hold this frame.

345
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:52,014
One and step. Right.

346
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:53,520
- I'm leading.
- Okay.

347
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:55,216
Back. Nice. Step.

348
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:57,659
Left. Good. Double-time.

349
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,763
- Okay, no. See? This is...
- What was wrong with that?

350
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:04,230
- You're screwing around.
- I'm not.

351
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,461
You're getting crazy here,
not holding your frame.

352
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:09,301
There must be space between us.
Not like when we're sleeping.

353
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:10,567
You can't be, like, up here.

354
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:13,805
You're not holding your frame.
It's a structured dance.

355
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:16,704
- Okay, so back up.
- Your mama taught you this?

356
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:19,716
Yes, I used to help her in the dance studio
on the weekends.

357
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,980
- Step. Two.
- You get fired from there, too?

358
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:25,045
No. I didn't get fired from this job. I quit.

359
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:29,885
Was it over money? Because if it wasn't,
this doesn't make any sense.

360
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:32,865
I had a difference of opinion
with the management.

361
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,527
They weren't ready for a guy like me.

362
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:38,930
I don't get it.

363
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:41,063
And heads. No, you're doing great.

364
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,737
I ain't talking about this.
I'm talking about you and Theresa.

365
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:46,837
You ain't got nothing in common.

366
00:24:47,448 --> 00:24:48,847
For example:

367
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,287
You don't like sports. Theresa loves sports.

368
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:56,450
You're a businessman. She's an artist.

369
00:24:56,958 --> 00:25:00,190
You're white. She's black.
Did I miss anything?

370
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:04,796
No. That's just it. She's everything I'm not.

371
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:09,631
You know, she's my other half.
Without her, I'm not whole.

372
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:13,737
You know, the thing
about meeting your other half is...

373
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:16,300
you're walking around,
you think you're happy...

374
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:17,606
you think that you're whole.

375
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,479
Then you realize you ain't shit without her.

376
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:22,346
Then you can't go back to being a half...

377
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,684
'cause now you know what it's like
to be a whole.

378
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,553
You know what I mean?

379
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,789
Yeah, I do.

380
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,861
And I still got it.

381
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,565
- That was nice.
- Real nice.

382
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,533
- I liked the snap.
- You like that?

383
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,331
- I think you hurt me.
- Percy Jones, boy.

384
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,008
Good morning.

385
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,475
Looks like I missed a fun night.

386
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,882
- Just sitting up here, watching football.
- That's how it always starts.

387
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,418
- Where's Marilyn?
- She stayed all night at Darlene's house.

388
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:59,354
She must be really mad.

389
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:02,056
Wait. You knew where they were
the whole time?

390
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,893
Yeah. I thought they'd be back by now.

391
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,125
- Did you apologize?
- I didn't do anything.

392
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,565
Exactly!

393
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:12,306
Dante, please. Don't try to play
that metrosexual mind game on me, okay?

394
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:14,370
Okay. All right.

395
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,639
Let's go get them.

396
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,714
You don't understand.

397
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:26,388
They done called all their friends
and sat up all night ragging on men.

398
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:29,893
They've worked themselves up
into a man-hating frenzy.

399
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,026
- How many women?
- I guarantee you, large numbers.

400
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,328
Sisters.

401
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:39,796
You can't just walk in on a bunch
of angry black women. You'll die.

402
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:43,434
Well, we'll just have to go out like men.

403
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:47,237
- He's right, Percy.
- I know he's right.

404
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:49,111
But I'm still scared.

405
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:52,076
- Keep talking. What are you saying?
- Like that, a little.

406
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,016
- I'm liking it.
- Thank you.

407
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:56,213
You gonna share your colors?

408
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,783
You're one of them sisters
who don't share colors.

409
00:26:58,859 --> 00:26:59,883
No, I'm not.

410
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:01,324
Give up your secrets, honey.

411
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:04,760
This is gorgeous. Pink Passion.
Every woman needs this.

412
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,162
A little Pink Passion?

413
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:07,495
You know what I always say?

414
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,335
A little bit of makeup, a little bit of hair
ain't never hurt nobody.

415
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:14,033
How did I know
she would be wearing Pink Passion?

416
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:22,146
- Yes, they're in there.
- Maybe I should go first.

417
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:25,745
Are you crazy? I'm the one
that got experience in this sort of thing.

418
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:28,485
You just pay attention.
I'll show you how it's done.

419
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,526
Here, straighten yourself up.

420
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:33,084
If you go up in there,
you go in looking like a man.

421
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:35,222
- Wipe this off.
- You got something.

422
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:36,891
Thank you. Yeah.

423
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:41,969
- Man, I'm not gonna...
- No. We gotta do this.

424
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,244
Well, well, well.

425
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:54,080
- Lf it isn't Mr. Percy Jones.
- It is I.

426
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:55,814
It's about time you showed up.

427
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:57,684
- What's up?
- I'm well.

428
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:02,990
- Percy.
- Marilyn.

429
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:07,926
Marilyn, may I speak to you in private
over there, please...

430
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,867
so the ladies can continue eating?

431
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,837
Oh, no! You go on home with that.

432
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:15,396
- It's not going down like that, my brother.
- No way, no how.

433
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:19,343
You know better than that, Percy.
You got something to say, say it here.

434
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:20,971
In front of everybody.

435
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:23,884
Step up to the chalk line and be a man.

436
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,653
I married you, didn't I?
Don't that count for something?

437
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:32,718
- Hell, no!
- What does he want, an award?

438
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,227
That don't count for nothing!

439
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,764
It really doesn't count.

440
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:38,426
- Come on, man.
- I know, I'm just...

441
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:45,969
Oh, hell.

442
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,531
I was wrong, okay?

443
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:49,771
- It's a good start, Percy.
- Keep going!

444
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:52,179
I've been wrong for a long time.

445
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:54,682
Ever since I forgot...

446
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:58,289
that you are my better half.

447
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:01,522
Hell, Marilyn, you're everything I'm not.

448
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:05,188
Without you, I'm not whole.

449
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:08,366
Look. Let...

450
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:16,936
Baby, before I met you,
I thought I was all that.

451
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:21,276
And then you came into my life,
and I realized that I wasn't all that.

452
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:26,442
Wasn't even half of that.

453
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:29,087
I might have been a quarter of that.

454
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:30,851
But then you left me last night!

455
00:29:30,924 --> 00:29:34,087
And, baby, I remembered
how it felt to be without you.

456
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:37,689
And let me tell you something.
I ain't shit without you!

457
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:39,223
- Dad.
- Man.

458
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,270
And I forgot about that.

459
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:43,927
And I'm sorry.

460
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,268
Baby, marry me.

461
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:54,281
Make me whole again.

462
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:56,912
- I love you, Percy.
- I love you, too.

463
00:29:57,955 --> 00:30:01,013
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- You go, Marilyn, bad girl!

464
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,616
Kiss your baby.

465
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:04,957
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

466
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,328
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
I'm sorry, baby.

467
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:11,099
I feel so much better!

468
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:13,601
- Isn't that lovely?
- Get off that.

469
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:24,946
I guess it's my turn.

470
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,151
All right.

471
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:32,924
That's going to be a tough speech to follow.

472
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:36,195
- It was a great speech, Perce.
- Thank you.

473
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:40,459
- I had something similar in mind.
- Great minds think alike.

474
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:43,003
Admitting you were wrong
would be a great start.

475
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,595
Yes, it would.

476
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,299
Right.

477
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,099
Go ahead, man.

478
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:54,275
Baby, I was wrong!

479
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:57,380
What are you doing?

480
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,954
I want to see your sexy body
go bump, bump, bump.

481
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:05,285
We have to talk in private.

482
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:08,160
I don't wanna hear it. No. Mom?

483
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,368
Just stay here and talk about it
in front of everybody!

484
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:13,960
Ladies, please.

485
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:17,199
Take your man
and go work out your business.

486
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:18,742
That's right.

487
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,838
Go on.

488
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,206
Thank you.

489
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:25,614
- Don't let him work on you.
- That ain't right.

490
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,517
- Did he say "bump, bump, bump"?
- Yeah, and it's Percy's fault.

491
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,884
It's all your fault!

492
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,722
Those kids are in love and they finally
liked each other and you all interfere.

493
00:31:33,794 --> 00:31:38,696
My love right here.
Don't tell me how to define my love!

494
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,558
Lord have mercy.

495
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:46,865
Baby.

496
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:49,101
Come on.

497
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:55,072
I was trying to impress your father.

498
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:58,279
I didn't want to show up here
and be the unemployed fiancé.

499
00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:02,188
I've never lied to you before
and I'll never lie to you again, ever.

500
00:32:02,257 --> 00:32:05,157
You lied about asking my father for a loan.

501
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:08,562
That was an omission that was tied
to a previous lie. That doesn't...

502
00:32:08,631 --> 00:32:10,428
And I look like an idiot to you.

503
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,561
No. You look a little bit
like Percy Jones, though.

504
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:18,104
I can't believe you're trying to be funny.

505
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:21,372
- Baby, come on.
- Why do you have to be funny right now?

506
00:32:21,444 --> 00:32:22,968
Don't touch me!

507
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:25,977
You need to calm down.

508
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,351
You made me look like an asshole in there.
Don't tell me to calm down.

509
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:32,050
I think you were doing
a pretty good job of that yourself.

510
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,182
Not telling them about me?

511
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,554
And then I pitched in and I blew it, okay?

512
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,394
I panicked when I found out
that Nathan was blackballing me.

513
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:44,424
I thought if I could score this IPO, I'd have
enough money until I got another job.

514
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:47,962
- But I was doing that for you.
- What am I, your mother?

515
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,667
I don't need you to take care of me.

516
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:52,608
I want you to do things with me,
not for me, Simon!

517
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:54,977
- Will you just talk to me?
- I am talking to you.

518
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,878
- You're talking at me.
- I am talking to you.

519
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:01,616
But you need to talk to me and tell me
how am I supposed to believe in you...

520
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,988
when you don't trust me enough
to tell me the truth?

521
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:08,494
How do we get past this, with this skin,
if we don't have each other's back?

522
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:12,398
- Okay, I'm always gonna be the white boy.
- And I'll always be the black girl.

523
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:16,199
But at least I'm here and willing to deal
with it, and I don't know about you.

524
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:20,141
I don't know. And eventually, if you're
gonna quit on me, just do it and don't...

525
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:22,540
I'm standing right here!

526
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:25,844
What more do you want from me?
What do you want from the white boy?

527
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,282
I've been here busting my ass
to make you happy!

528
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:31,719
Then let me make this easy for you!
The engagement is off!

529
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:32,981
Fine.

530
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,823
- Good.
- Great.

531
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:39,189
Great.

532
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,780
I'm in Jersey!

533
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,823
- Okay, stand still now.
- I'm still.

534
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,086
You all right?

535
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,729
I'm fine.

536
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:18,330
I'm great. It's going to be a great day, Dad.

537
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:21,670
- It sure is.
- Yes. I'm gonna take lots of pictures.

538
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:25,415
- So you better smile big for me, okay?
- I will.

539
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:28,849
And no crying.
Mom said you cried last time.

540
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:31,510
I was not crying, I was sweating...

541
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:32,915
from my eyeballs.

542
00:34:34,057 --> 00:34:36,958
Hell, I was nervous.
I knew I was making a big mistake.

543
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:38,689
A 25-year mistake.

544
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:41,428
And going for 25 more.

545
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,532
Sweetheart?

546
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:48,061
Why don't you call that man?

547
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,630
You know he got his cell phone on.
You know he does.

548
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:53,075
He's probably waiting on the 5:15 train.

549
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:56,112
We got a party going on.
You get his ass back here!

550
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,011
How many missed calls you have last night?

551
00:34:58,082 --> 00:34:59,276
Thirty-three.

552
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,546
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

553
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:03,912
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

554
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,787
Thirty-three missed calls?
Sweetheart, that's major.

555
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:12,760
And you know the man is unemployed, yes,
but he calls you. So give him that.

556
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,624
Thirty-three missed calls?
And you can't call him once?

557
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:20,271
- Girl, don't be so proud.
- No. Daddy, it's not...

558
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:23,504
Pride ain't nothing
when it comes to matters of the heart.

559
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:25,068
It's not that.

560
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:28,076
- It's not?
- No.

561
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:42,861
- I was going to marry him.
- What?

562
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,135
We were going to announce
our engagement this weekend.

563
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,377
So, you see?

564
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:59,381
I have you to thank...

565
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:03,148
because you saved me from a big heartache.

566
00:36:05,357 --> 00:36:08,190
Sweetheart, I just don't
understand something.

567
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,594
- Why did Simon quit his job?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

568
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:15,864
Why would a man quit his job on the day
he's gonna meet his future father-in-law?

569
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:20,133
Maybe he got tired of waiting
for that promotion that never happened.

570
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:23,568
Simon's a rising star, Dad.

571
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:27,344
- He really is.
- I believe that.

572
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:30,884
But that boss of his is just not a nice man.

573
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:33,979
- You ever met him?
- A couple of times.

574
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:37,424
He was always friendly, kind of.

575
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:42,027
But he always had
this look in his eyes, you know?

576
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:45,227
Just not a nice man.

577
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:48,535
But he was Simon's mentor, so...

578
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:50,999
Whatever.

579
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:53,305
Let it go.

580
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,371
Today is about you and Mom.

581
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:01,347
Now, first picture of the night.

582
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,977
- Let me get my... On my good side.
- Smile.

583
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,752
I don't want Mom to see me like this.

584
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,864
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too.

585
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,019
Damn!

586
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:48,462
No.

587
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,436
Do not do this to me, Percy Jones!

588
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:54,602
We have a schedule! Tick-tock.
Everything works. Timing.

589
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:55,838
I'll be right back.

590
00:37:55,913 --> 00:37:57,846
- Timing!
- I'll be right back.

591
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,642
- In 10 minutes?
- Or so, okay?

592
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:00,909
How so?

593
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:05,642
I'm sorry.
Percy, have you met my wife, Diane?

594
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:08,784
I certainly have heard
a lot about you, Percy Jones.

595
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:10,384
Nice to meet you.

596
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:13,396
- Does Marilyn know you're going AWOL?
- Of course.

597
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:16,432
She does not.

598
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,145
So you missed your train, huh?

599
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:38,751
- There's another one at 6:00.
- You gonna be on it?

600
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:41,555
I should have been on that one.

601
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:47,299
What are you doing here?

602
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,795
I know why you quit your job.

603
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:53,068
You told your boss you was coming here
to meet me and he said:

604
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:55,368
"Don't marry that black girl."

605
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:00,646
Those weren't exactly the words.

606
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:06,482
How did you know we were getting married?

607
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:09,886
I told you, son.
Don't nothing get past Percy Jones.

608
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,286
- Theresa told you.
- That, too.

609
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,128
Come on, man. Let's get real.

610
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:20,658
What you did with your boss
was honorable, impressive...

611
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:22,935
and stupid.

612
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:26,773
You can't quit your job every time
somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you.

613
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:28,972
You'll never make any money.

614
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:40,112
- How do you do 25 years?
- Painfully.

615
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,651
No, seriously.

616
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:48,627
If you're gonna marry one of these women,
sometimes it's gonna hurt like hell.

617
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:53,295
All you can do is admit that you're wrong
and know that she's always right.

618
00:40:53,873 --> 00:40:55,431
- She's right?
- That's right.

619
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:56,805
- Always?
- Right.

620
00:40:56,876 --> 00:40:58,138
- Right.
- That's right.

621
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,542
All right.

622
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:02,547
Okay, what about all the talk
about my dignity?

623
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:05,245
Do you love her? Do you want her?

624
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,088
Then she's always right.

625
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:18,065
Look, I know I didn't give you a fair shake.

626
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:20,226
And I was wrong.

627
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,005
And my daughter,
she'd be lucky to have you.

628
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:35,212
I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones.

629
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:38,416
I think I know that about you.

630
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,681
Theresa doesn't.

631
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:45,183
You just have to show her
what you're made of.

632
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:48,694
You know she's hot-headed.
She's just like her mama.

633
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:55,539
Every man gets to choose his destiny, son.

634
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:59,472
No matter what his father did.

635
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,465
And, Percy, you are not perfect.

636
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:23,101
But that works for me because
two perfect people in one relationship...

637
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,833
might be too much.

638
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,876
And sometimes you bark
and bluff and bluster...

639
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:32,073
but I always see the boy I married
25 years ago.

640
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:36,313
And I only wish I loved him
as much as I did back then, but I don't.

641
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,316
I love him more.

642
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,654
Thank you, Marilyn. That was lovely.

643
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:47,920
Percy? Your vows?

644
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,063
Marilyn Jones.

645
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,400
Everyone knows I didn't write my vows.

646
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,172
Everyone knows because you kept
beating me up about it for weeks...

647
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,242
crying to all your friends. You know?

648
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:09,319
Now, look here, woman. I love you.

649
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,457
But you didn't have to do me like that
about my vows.

650
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:16,516
You know I don't like writing.
She knows that.

651
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:19,928
I'm not a wordsmith.

652
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:23,695
I do numbers. That's me. I don't do words.

653
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,235
Damn it, I do money.

654
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:31,141
And after 25 years, all I've asked you...

655
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:34,778
is to let me be me.

656
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:41,684
You'll never find

657
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:45,452
As long as you shall live

658
00:43:45,895 --> 00:43:47,226
Oh, Lord.

659
00:43:47,462 --> 00:43:49,292
Someone to love you

660
00:43:49,364 --> 00:43:51,162
Love you, love you

661
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:53,394
Tender like I do

662
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:54,903
Tender like I do

663
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,702
You know that about me, woman.

664
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,139
You'll never find

665
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,938
No matter where you search

666
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:04,344
I'm not looking.

667
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:06,449
Someone to care about you

668
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,077
Care about you, care about you

669
00:44:08,154 --> 00:44:11,815
The way I do

670
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:16,892
Oh, I'm not bragging on myself, baby

671
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:21,929
But I'm the only one that loves you

672
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:27,967
I think I forgot what love is
until you and Simon showed up.

673
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,737
Give that man another chance, daughter.

674
00:44:31,311 --> 00:44:33,644
You'll never find

675
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:37,312
Simon!

676
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:38,978
Yes, Simon.

677
00:44:39,654 --> 00:44:42,647
It'll take the end of all time

678
00:44:43,456 --> 00:44:46,450
Someone who understands you

679
00:44:47,762 --> 00:44:50,492
Like I do

680
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,127
That's not Jamal.

681
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:04,971
I could probably find a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together.

682
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:08,043
But you know what? I don't care.

683
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:11,919
I don't care, either.

684
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:13,988
I love you.

685
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,691
And I'm sorry that I lied to you.

686
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,124
I'm sorry, too.

687
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,099
You're sorry?

688
00:45:23,735 --> 00:45:26,466
- Can you say that again?
- I'm sorry, Simon.

689
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,235
You're sorry? She said she was sorry.
I believe she's...

690
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:30,970
I'm sorry, Simon.

691
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:35,575
- Get your man, girl!
- Go ahead, sweetie!

692
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,351
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

693
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:47,587
to introduce to you all
my future son-in-law, Simon Green.

694
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:51,427
He's broke, unemployed, and he's white.

695
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,203
But he loves my Theresa
and that's all right with us.

696
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:56,259
That's right.

697
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:59,902
Welcome to the family, son.
Welcome to the family.

698
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,774
And cue the magic.

699
00:46:13,324 --> 00:46:14,414
Look at this.

700
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:16,584
Will you look at that shit?

701
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,624
Drink up! Enjoy!

702
00:46:22,097 --> 00:46:23,565
Welcome, man.

703
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:43,348
- Let's watch the tango.
- No, let's watch the party.

704
00:46:45,323 --> 00:46:48,690
- All right. Get your feet off the table.
- Sorry, sir.

705
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:57,271
- I look pretty good out there.
- You do, Mom.

706
00:46:57,338 --> 00:47:01,206
Baby, you look so good
because you're twirling around me.

707
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,676
Oh, yeah, there you go, there you go.

708
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:06,907
All right, you blew that part.

709
00:47:06,981 --> 00:47:09,347
- That was perfect.
- There was hesitation there.

710
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:11,887
- You did it better the night before.
- The night before?

711
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,855
- What happened?
- We had a little dry run the night before.

712
00:47:14,924 --> 00:47:16,824
- Really?
- You didn't tell me that, Percy!

713
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:20,293
You're hallucinating, Simon.
I ain't never danced with no man in my life.

714
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:21,624
Taught him everything he knows.

715
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:23,961
Percy Jones was born
knowing how to tango.

716
00:47:24,032 --> 00:47:26,400
And let me tell you something
about the tango.

717
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,339
- It's a structured dance.
- I told you that.

718
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,775
What was that, Mom?

719
00:47:35,846 --> 00:47:39,215
You know what that is, Theresa.
You're a grown-ass woman.

720
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:42,514
- Damn, Mama, you still got it.
- I know it, Keisha.

721
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:45,079
All right now, watch this.
This is when I got funky.

722
00:47:45,157 --> 00:47:49,525
- Go, Percy! It's your birthday!
- Go, Percy.

723
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:52,691
- Let's watch the vows.
- No!

724
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:55,824
- Watch the party.
- Okay, fine, whatever.

725
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:01,000
- There you are.
- I got her, that girl is mine!

726
00:48:01,075 --> 00:48:03,873
I was just shocked you didn't fall down.

727
00:48:03,944 --> 00:48:05,104
That is cold.

728
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,647
Look. Check me out. I am doing the hustle.

729
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:09,945
I'm doing the hustle in your honor,
Percy Jones.

730
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,678
That ain't no damn hustle.
That's the white man overbite.

731
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:15,880
- You ain't even doing that right.
- Why's it gotta be a white thing?

732
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:17,254
Blacks have overbites, too.

733
00:48:17,325 --> 00:48:20,419
- He's doing a great hustle!
- He's turning it up.

734
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:26,397
- Why is my man looking at your ass?
- No, he's not.

735
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:28,334
Why is your man Samoan?

736
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:32,342
- Where is Manu these days?
- We broke up last week.

737
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,809
- Thank you, Jesus.
- What happened?

738
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,472
I only started going out with him
to mess with Daddy.

739
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:41,109
And, girl, please. He is too big.
He is a bone crusher.

740
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,946
- Watch your mouth!
- What?

741
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,718
Do not use the word "bone" in my house.

742
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:59,595
- Where were you all going?
- Let's see that again.

743
00:48:59,672 --> 00:49:02,506
Your mother and I
got a sudden thirst for punch.

744
00:49:02,675 --> 00:49:04,200
No. You're old enough to know.

745
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:06,906
We going to shake some sheets.
Is that all right with you?

746
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:09,710
I thought you said no bone in the house!

747
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,208
No!

748
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:14,344
If everyone wants to see the lift,
we do the lift.

749
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:15,912
We're doing the lift!

750
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:17,751
This is good.

751
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:20,794
No. I was so sure
you were going to drop me there.

752
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,455
I love you!

753
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,500
This is Dirty Dancing.
I've been doing this since high school.

754
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:26,659
Look at that.

755
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:29,329
- Who's the man?
- You did it with other girls?

756
00:49:29,404 --> 00:49:32,808
No, I only do that with you.

757
00:49:36,246 --> 00:49:37,770
I know that hurt.

758
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:41,178
See that move right there.
That's why you're not getting any grandkids.

759
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:45,209
Let me call your mama right now
and thank her for those dance lessons.

760
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:47,654
- That's a low blow.
- It's just a joke.

761
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:50,755
- Simon!
- Come on. I'll catch your big ass.

762
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:56,464
We're down!

763
00:49:57,836 --> 00:50:00,099
Good thing is, she didn't break that dress.

764
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:03,040
No, she didn't,
but she felt bad about it all week.

765
00:50:03,408 --> 00:50:05,137
