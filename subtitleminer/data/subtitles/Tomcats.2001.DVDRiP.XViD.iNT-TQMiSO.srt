1
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Is this such a good idea?

2
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,040
Is marriage a good idea?
Because marriage is huge.

3
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,160
I am having trouble breathing.

4
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,280
I am having trouble catching my breath.

5
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,280
-Wood you regia?
-How cloud I possibly regia!?

6
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,920
Because it's my wedding.

7
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,080
That's Max. Only 19 years old...

8
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,760
...and is getting married to
the only girl he's ever had sex with.

9
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,560
That day I promised myself,
I'd stay single forever.

10
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,000
Gimshins.

11
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,040
Granted, Kimberly was gorgeous.

12
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,080
-What's the holdup?
-Your groom isn't quite out yet.

13
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,320
We ll, fix it, Daddy!

14
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,560
I guess Max didn't see her
quite the way I did.

15
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Make him behave!

16
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,840
It will be perfect. I promise.

17
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,560
Kimberly's father helped invent
a very special pill.

18
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,960
Now, Viagra beat him to the market,
but his pill was just as good.

19
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,800
it could turn this...

20
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,600
...into this.

21
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,720
There's enough to give
an elephant a boner.

22
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,240
You are so bad.
Your own sister's wedding?

23
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,000
Please. She's gonna love it.

24
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,520
I'll   put it on the gift table.
They'll take it on the honeymoon.

25
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,920
He'll have a three-day boner.

26
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,040
I Love the smell of bridesmaids
in the morning.

27
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,840
My best friend, Kyle.
If  this is your average brain...

28
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,840
...this is Kyle's brain.

29
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,160
Anyway, the wedding was about to get
especially hard.

30
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
I propose a toast. Ah, yes. To Max!

31
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,040
First tomcat to take the plunge.

32
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,480
Thanks, guys.

33
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,800
May it never happen to us!

34
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
There you go, buddy.

35
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,840
Dude.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,160
Dude.

37
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,920
Dude.

38
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,160
This is the best wine ever.

39
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,640
What the hell is going on?
Everybody's waiting out there.

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,480
What is up with you?

41
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Holy Mary...

42
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,440
...Mother of God.

43
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,160
You boys must really like weddings.

44
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,840
Get out there. Everybody's waiting.

45
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,440
Don't move.

46
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,840
Here we go, here we go.

47
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,840
You may all be seated.

48
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
-Turn around.
-We can't.

49
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Here we go.

50
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,200
Don't they look handsome
in their tuxedos?

51
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,600
I cannot believe that Max actually
went through with it.

52
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
It's a goddamn shame.

53
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,160
I am hereby dedicating myself to
a life as a professional tomcat.

54
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,560
Professional tomcat, right on.

55
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,640
Yeah, man. Forget marriage.

56
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll  nail every woman
on the planet.

57
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
Every one?

58
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,120
Except my mother and grandmother.

59
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
First of all, your mom is hot.

60
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,160
Secondly, you realize there are...

61
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,320
...two and a half billion females
on Earth.

62
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,720
-Are you saying it can't be done?
-No. But we got to divide them up.

63
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,560
Deal.

64
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,920
I'll never get married. Ever.

65
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,920
You're almost married as it is.
Kelly runs your life.

66
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,440
She does not!

67
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,080
You've got five minutes.

68
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
Thank you.

69
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
You'll be the next to go.

70
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,360
Please. We all know who'll be next.

71
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,120
Steve dog!

72
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,520
I don't even have a girlfriend.

73
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,160
You're going down, buddy.

74
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,640
What? Why?

75
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,000
Because, like Max, the first girl that
Lets you get with her, you'll marry.

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,160
You want to bet?

77
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,440
Actually bet? Really bet for money?

78
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,840
Yeah. Let's say the last single man
gets a thousand bucks...

79
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,840
...from the rest of you who end up
getting married.

80
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,920
Six grand's a lot of money.

81
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,440
No, no.  if  we're going to do this,
we do it right. Okay?

82
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,720
Each of us puts two hundred dollars
a year away in savings.

83
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,840
No, no, no. High-yield mutual fund.

84
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,400
All right, the last man standing at
the end, gets the whole pot.

85
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm talking 1 0, 20 grand!

86
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
That's a lot of money.

87
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,440
Yeah. And you're out if you go gay,
Gary.

88
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,680
Hey, blow me.

89
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,480
All right, Gary's out.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,920
I'm in. Tomcats' bet.
Let's get in here.

91
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,600
Come on, get in here!

92
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm going to invest some money, okay?

93
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,200
Tomcats! Tomcats!

94
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,680
You guys are going to pay me so bad!

95
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,800
I don't ever want to get married.
I don't!

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,160
I do.

97
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,840
By the power vested in me...

98
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,000
...by Allah and the state of
Nevada...

99
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,400
....I  now pronounce you...

100
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,920
...husband and...

101
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,120
...wife, my friends.

102
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
Okay, love her tender.

103
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
Love her tenders. Please.

104
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600
Rock the jailhouse.

105
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,360
Every single woman, come to the center
of the aisle...

106
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,800
...so you can catch the flower
bouquets....

107
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,000
-All the single ladies.
-Where are you going?

108
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,440
-Let's go, please.
-Sit down.

109
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,520
Thank you very much.

110
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,920
You went down, my man!
Down like a 2-dollar hooker!

111
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,800
Boom! You're out! You suck!

112
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,400
Tricia's great, though.

113
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,720
No, I'll tell you who's great.
Jan here is great.

114
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
What's our bachelor pool up to now?

115
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,280
As of Friday, about 475.

116
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,640
Man, that's half a million bucks!

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,240
Can our man Jan pick IPOs or what?
I'm wet. I'm, like, wet.

118
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,160
Don't you sometimes wish you
could fuck money?

119
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,520
Weddings bring out
the romantic in you, Kyle.

120
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,880
Kyle, don't you have enough money
already?

121
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,920
You can never have enough money.
And you're a fag for saying that.

122
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,480
-No offense, Gary.
-Hey, blow me.

123
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,920
Looks like it's just you and me now,
buddy.

124
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
And I'm not the one bringing chicks
who catch bouquets.

125
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,920
I can't believe we're
doing this again.

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,600
How many times can we do it?

127
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,240
-You're going down.
-You're unquenchable. I'll pass out.

128
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,080
Here it comes. Here it comes.

129
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,880
You lose.

130
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,760
-Take off your pants.
-Oh, no. I lose again!

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,640
Oh, God, I hate losing.

132
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,800
Hurry, before he says it again.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,480
No, no, no. No more drinking.
No more drinking. You win.

134
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,080
You win.

135
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,720
I win? Oh, yeah?

136
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,160
Well, good. Then I'm collecting.

137
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,480
Come on. I want to be dangerous.

138
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,880
Where we going?

139
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,320
Where are we going?

140
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,680
Say it, Michael.

141
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,800
Say it?

142
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,280
I won't do it unless you say it.

143
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry. I'm having a little bit of
trouble concentrating here.

144
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
What is it exactly you want me to say?

145
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,800
You know.

146
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,880
Those three...

147
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,480
...little...

148
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
...words.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Those three little words.

150
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,200
Those three little words.

151
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,480
Hold on a minute.

152
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,120
What? What's wrong?

153
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,880
I'm sorry. I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

154
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,920
Why are you acting like this?

155
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,360
-You are the one who's rushing things.
-Rushing what?

156
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,760
Shelby, I like you. I like you a lot.

157
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,800
But things are just moving
a little too fast.

158
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,160
I'm just not ready to say,
''.I  love you.''

159
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,200
What makes you think .I 
want you to say, ''.I  love you''?

160
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, come on. Back there.

161
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,440
You wouldn't do it because I wouldn't
say those three little words.

162
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,840
You colossal moron.

163
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,680
''Suck...my...cock.''

164
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,600
Suck my cock. Suck my cock!

165
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,880
Oh, suck my cock! Suck my cock!
Suck my cock! Suck my cock.

166
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,680
That was great. You put your shoes
out on the pillow like this. Great.

167
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,040
-Sorry.
-Jerk.

168
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,760
I'll catch you later.

169
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,080
What's going on? Who you looking for?

170
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,920
Shelby. She's probably halfway back
to L.A. by now.

171
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,800
Oh, boy. What'd you do now?

172
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,360
It's weird.

173
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,200
I thought she wanted me to say, ''.I 
love you.'' I wouldn't lie to get sex.

174
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
-You know another way?
-.I  know. I'm an idiot.

175
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,480
Don't worry, buddy.
You're at the Hard Rock.

176
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,400
I mean, this place rocks hard.

177
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,160
There's like a million women here.

178
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,440
I cannot believe you and Trish got
married, Steve.

179
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,840
Aren't you terrified?

180
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,280
Let me ask you a question:

181
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,680
If you could sleep with any woman,
who would it be?

182
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,200
Is this hypothetical?
Because my birthday's soon.

183
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,800
Any woman. Hypothetical.

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
Fictional?

185
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,600
-Not Judy Jetson.
-Well, then, I'm out.

186
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
Who's yours?

187
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,480
Truth?

188
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,160
Tricia.

189
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,200
If I could fuck any woman in the whole
world, it'd be her.

190
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,920
That's why I married her.

191
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,240
I'm glad you didn't write
your own vows.

192
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,440
Trish and I have this deep connection,
you know?

193
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,880
She understands what I'm feeling
without my having to tell her.

194
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,160
It's like I found this huge spiritual
side to myself that...

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,920
....I  didn't even know existed.

196
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,320
Last week I had sex with twins.

197
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,680
Okay, you win.

198
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh, can I get a Heineken?

199
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,000
Thanks.

200
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,320
Forget it, pal.
She's only interested in high rollers.

201
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,480
Hard six! Let's go! We need
a hard six! We got a shooter!

202
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,480
-Long and hard six. Let's go.
-No more bets.

203
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,160
Two trades, go a long way.
Here we go, we got a shooter.

204
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
-We got a roller! Hard six!
-Seven!

205
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,440
That hurt.

206
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,920
That hurt.

207
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,120
I'm in! We got a shooter! Let's go!
I'm in. I'm letting it ride!

208
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
No more bets.

209
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,400
Eleven! Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

210
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,520
Craps.

211
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,800
Oh, God, no. No touching!
No touching.

212
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,440
That really hurt.

213
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,400
Yes, I'm on a roll!

214
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,440
I need you to come over.

215
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,600
Michael's gone crazy trying
to impress some girl.

216
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,720
Come on, baby. I'm on fire.

217
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,720
All right, I'll come down.
Color me up, pops.

218
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,600
Your $1 1 .00, sir?

219
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,040
Who's your daddy?

220
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,320
Who's your daddy?

221
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,240
Craps.

222
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,080
No, please, Jesus, kill me now!

223
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,520
Kill me now! Kill me.

224
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,000
Or don't? Let it ride,
my credit's good! Credit!

225
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,760
Let's go! Give me these dice!

226
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,840
-What are you doing, buddy?
-Rolling the bones.

227
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Steve, Amber. Amber, Steve.

228
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,120
-How far are you down?
-I'm not so bad.

229
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,880
Twenty-five five.

230
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,160
-Social security.
-Twenty-five thousand?

231
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,400
Listen, buddy. You can't do this.
Okay, listen. You can't afford this.

232
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,760
-You have to stop now!
-Give me my dice!

233
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
Put the dice down.

234
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,080
Stop. Now.

235
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,840
That was close, buddy. I'll quit
while I still can. That was close.

236
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,920
-Seven out.
-Time out!

237
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,680
Do over! I didn't roll that.
I didn't roll that. She rolled.

238
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Come with us, please.

239
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,480
-Let's go.
-That's it. No more redheads. Ever.

240
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,360
Fellas, we're closed.

241
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,240
This is the guy, Carlos.

242
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,560
Hi.

243
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,240
I don't think I owe this money.

244
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Really? And why do you say that,
Mr. Delaney?

245
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,560
I didn't roll the dice. A lady threw
the dice. I don't even know her name.

246
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,880
So this is all just like a big
misunderstanding.

247
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
Well, luckily, we have tape.

248
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,960
Ah, see?

249
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,920
That's us. Losers. More losers.

250
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,880
For about $9.95 in the room,
you can watch that.

251
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,160
Shame we had to leave that.

252
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
A reason to bring back instant replay.
I've said that for years.

253
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,960
That has got to hurt you.

254
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,520
Was that Tricia?

255
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,200
The woman you were with at the bar
was handling the dice for luck.

256
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,640
You gave them to her, she threw
them on the table.

257
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,640
That, Mr. Delaney, is a roll
in any casino in town.

258
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,560
Now, I'm sorry. But you owe us
51 ,000 dollars.

259
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,680
-51 ,000 dollars?
-Plus the mini bar.

260
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,880
-Can we see that tape?
-.I  don't have 51 ,000 dollars.

261
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,920
I'm a cartoonist.

262
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,760
I do background color for
Sunday's ''Garfield.''

263
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
I love your work,
but here's what we do:

264
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,720
We're dangerous, quasi-criminal,
take-no-shit Vegas types.

265
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,720
So, what does that mean?
What are you going to do? Hurt me?

266
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,440
I got into this business
to make easy money and...

267
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,120
...the damn thing is, they
hook you in and...

268
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,720
...then you find yourself doing things
you don't really want to be doing...

269
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,880
...like killing people like you.

270
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,960
And then you start to enjoy it,
which is a problem.

271
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,480
I'm kidding. Making a light
remark, though probably not to you.

272
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,040
Point is, I will hang you...

273
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
...cut your balls off
and put them in your pocket.

274
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,600
But not without a lot
of Jewish guilt.

275
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,440
You owe me, in one month,
51 ,000 dollars.

276
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,880
And starting now, I will need
a daily security deposit.

277
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,400
I think it's important if we go back
to that tape with the ladies.

278
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,080
But cheer up.

279
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,720
I am going to comp the mini bar.

280
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,840
What happened?

281
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,240
-I'm screwed, that's what happened.
-All right, where are you?

282
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,000
I just lost 51 ,000 dollars.

283
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
If I don't get it in a month,
I'm buzzard feed.

284
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,120
They'll kill me.

285
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,040
Jesus. I wish we could give you
the money...

286
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
...but we put our cash into the house.

287
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,600
And we've borrowed against it
to set up Steve's practice...

288
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,440
...which explains why the wedding of
my dreams cost $280.

289
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,000
What are you doing?

290
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,080
Have you seen my flip-flops?

291
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,560
You know anybody who'll loan you
the money?

292
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,760
No, baby, listen.

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,560
If you want us to stop seeing other
people, what the hell? Let's try it.

294
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,080
It might help us reach a deeper level
of togetherness...

295
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
...and you know, bring us
closer together.

296
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,920
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

297
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,680
Yeah, me too. All right,
kiss-kiss. Okay, bye.

298
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
Your sister is driving me nuts.

299
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,320
Okay, we're here.

300
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,240
What you're going to go for is a nice,
smooth stroke. Okay?

301
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,920
Swing back.

302
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
-There you go.
-How's that?

303
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,400
Okay. Well, we'll keep trying, okay?

304
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,440
Let's work on your form.
You'll get it. No problem.

305
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,280
All right, Yoshi.
Keep your head down.

306
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
Keep your head down. Remember?

307
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Grip and rip, dude. Grip and rip.

308
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,920
-Kyle, what's going on?
-Mike?

309
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,320
What are you doing here?

310
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm just hitting the links with
some of the fellas.

311
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,320
You want a ride?

312
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,800
Sure. Fellas, I'll meet you at
the 1 9th hole for a Heineken.

313
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,720
So you're serious about
this girl, huh?

314
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,120
Remember what we said about screwing
every woman in the world?

315
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,880
I'm halfway there.
One or two chicks at a time.

316
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
That's okay. Keep it.
I've got more in the bag.

317
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
She's nothing to me, dude.

318
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,800
Two things I hate:
Chicks who want commitment...

319
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
...and assholes who want
to borrow money.

320
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,760
-I'm okay.
-We just ran over your girlfriend.

321
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,640
Man, do not say that word.

322
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,880
What did you want to talk to me about?

323
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
-.I  just missed you.
-Don't go all faggy on me.

324
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,600
You should see the look on your face.
I'm totally kidding, man.

325
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,280
So you've never even come close
to falling in love.

326
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,880
No, no, never.

327
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,880
Well, maybe once.

328
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,560
Natalie. She was a bridesmaid
at Max's wedding.

329
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,600
She was amazing. I took her to
a bluff out in Malibu.

330
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,120
We talked all night.

331
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,480
We made love in the morning
at sunrise.

332
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,600
She feel asleep in my arms.
It was incredible.

333
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,880
That's quite a story.
What happened to her?

334
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know. She could've been
the love of my life.

335
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,120
Nice couch, Mikey.  Is  it leather?

336
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
Oh, no way. lt's pleather.

337
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,360
Gross.

338
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
It'd be easier if you
had a front-door key for us.

339
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,080
I'll get right on that.
Night, fellas.

340
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Hey, what's up, buddy?

341
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,400
Is Tricia here?
I'd like to ask her something.

342
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
Yeah, she's upstairs.

343
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,720
Watch that.

344
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,760
I'll take you up there.

345
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,360
-Turn it off!
-Shitballs!

346
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,560
-Turn it off! Turn it off!
-Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

347
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
She's upstairs with Consuela.

348
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,400
Damn hose.

349
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,840
Must have had a kink in it.

350
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,600
Any luck with the money?

351
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,720
Oh, no. I tried everything.
I don't know what to do.

352
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,400
Oh, boy.

353
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,360
Is your blood sugar low again?

354
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,840
I was wondering about
a friend of yours, Natalie.

355
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,800
A bridesmaid at your
sister's wedding.

356
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
Natalie? Steve, offer Michael a beer.

357
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
-You want a beer?
-Yeah.

358
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,680
What do you want with Natalie?

359
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,800
Nothing. I was thinking about her
and I thought maybe l'd look her up.

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,360
We don't have one clean glass.

361
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,080
We have a full-time maid
for chrissakes.

362
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
What is it that you do around here?

363
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,360
It's Saturday night, right?

364
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,400
I know exactly where she is.

365
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,880
You looking for a date?

366
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,960
-You're not my type.
-Whatever. You wouldn't be anyway.

367
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,880
What's it gonna be?

368
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,680
I have a proposal for you and it's
gonna sound a little strange.

369
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,560
Does it involve sex?

370
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,760
I'd say there'd be a fair
amount of sex involved.

371
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,120
There will definitely be a house and
a ring involved. Maybe even children.

372
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,880
Children?

373
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,080
That'll depend on how far you and
this other guy will want to take it.

374
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,840
But, yeah. l'd say kids would be
involved. At least a dog.

375
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,760
Children, a dog and another guy.

376
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
You're allergic to dogs.
How about cats? Maybe a hamster?

377
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
Maybe a hamster.

378
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,160
Baby, I got exactly what you need.

379
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,160
Let's go. Over here. Let's go.

380
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,040
You're under arrest, you sick fuck.

381
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,480
I wasn't soliciting prostitution.
I swear to God, I wasn't.

382
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,920
You know what they do to pedophiles
in the joint?

383
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,440
Not to mention hamster fuckers.

384
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,320
I wasn't looking for a hooker
or a hamster! I was looking for you.

385
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
I was looking for Natalie Parker.

386
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,120
How do you know her name?

387
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,320
We were at a wedding once,
a long time ago.

388
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,800
And you hooked up with a friend
of mine, Kyle Brenner.

389
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
Doesn't ring any bells.

390
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,440
What do you want with her?

391
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
It's stupid. lt was a bad idea.
Can I please just apologize and go?

392
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,280
I want to hear it.

393
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,840
I go to Vegas. There's this redhead.

394
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,320
I play craps. I lose all my money.

395
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,000
Get to the point, Delaney.

396
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,320
I'm in a lot of trouble.

397
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,960
Some buddies of mine and I have a bet.

398
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,000
Last bachelor standing wins.

399
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,680
The pot is huge. Half a million.

400
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
And I need this money.
I mean, I really need this money.

401
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
I just thought....
It's stupid, but--

402
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
What? You thought what?

403
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,400
I just thought that....

404
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,680
Kyle talks about you like you
were the one that got away.

405
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,160
Like you were his last chance
at true love.

406
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,200
I just thought that getting
the two of you together...

407
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,720
...something would rekindle.

408
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,280
You guys would get married and l'd win
the money. Everybody wins.

409
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,560
That was the most pathetic fucking
shit I have ever heard.

410
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
That hamster story was better
than that crap.

411
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,680
What made you think l'd agree to it?
I don't even remember this guy Karl.

412
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,760
-Kyle.
-Whatever.

413
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,440
Kyle Brenner.

414
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,360
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was stupid.

415
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,600
I'm sorry.

416
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,080
It's your call, detective.

417
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
Cut him loose.

418
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,080
Hi, yes. I'm here. Hi.

419
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,160
I was wondering if I could
increase my limit to...

420
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,680
....I  don't know, 51 ,000 dollars.

421
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,160
Yes, yes, I know.

422
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,440
Carlos did?

423
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,160
No. I have no intentions
of cutting up my card.

424
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,800
No, do not send someone over
to do it for me!

425
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,400
This Carlos runs a very tight ship.

426
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,560
Coming. Let me just throw
something on.

427
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,880
Okay. One more sec. Who is it?

428
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,560
I've done some checking.

429
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,840
Kyle's rich.
Why don't you ask him for a loan?

430
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,480
I tried. He doesn't lend
people money.

431
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,400
How did you find me?

432
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
Michael. Cop. Remember?

433
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,200
Some place you got here.

434
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,280
Got anything to drink?

435
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,200
I bet I'm the only guy you know who's
had all of his beverages repossessed.

436
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,040
Here. Pour this.

437
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,640
Patrón. Classy.

438
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,320
What are you wearing?

439
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,600
I was on hold for a very long....

440
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,400
Anyway, I don't really feel the need
to dress up for these repo guys.

441
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,520
I've thought about your idea.

442
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,240
I want to do it.

443
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
But we split the bet money 50-50.

444
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,240
Sure. Yeah.

445
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,800
This is great. This is terrific.
Actually...

446
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,600
...there is one little problem.

447
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,680
You kind of have to marry Kyle...

448
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,040
...within 30 days.

449
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
No problem.

450
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,320
I want to do to Kyle
what he did to me.

451
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,560
What do you mean?
You do remember Kyle?

452
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,600
Of course I do.

453
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,120
We hooked up at Max's wedding.

454
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,760
That little shit told me everything
I wanted to hear...

455
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
...and then abandoned me on the PCH...

456
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,920
...with nothing more than a roll of
quarters to call a cab.

457
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,800
Nice memory for a girl's first time?

458
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,520
I was kind of hoping for ''love will
prevail,'' but you know what?

459
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,760
Hate will do just fine.

460
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,000
Sorry! Sorry about that.

461
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
The first thing we have to do is
get to know our prey.

462
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,680
Precisely what kind of girls
he likes.

463
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,080
-Be careful. This is expensive.
-I'm sorry. lt's heavy.

464
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,600
Hand me the night-spectrum
spotting scope.

465
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,600
I think we left that in the car.

466
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,560
Then just hand me a pair
of binoculars.

467
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,600
Long time no see, Kyle.

468
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,520
The guy has pleather furniture.

469
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,480
What kind of loser has pleather
furniture?

470
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,800
Beats me.

471
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,440
A stewardess. How cliche.

472
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,040
Subject likes brunettes.

473
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,880
Prefers subservient women in uniform.

474
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,680
Let me see. Quit hogging them.
It's my turn. Give me.

475
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,920
This is so cool.

476
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,000
This is better than cable.

477
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Quiet!

478
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,680
God, I never had a stewardess.

479
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,160
I think they're leaving.
It'd be cool to get some audio.

480
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,720
We will. Give me five minutes.

481
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,120
My God, this girl is Wonder Woman.

482
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,920
I'm terrified, yet strangely aroused.

483
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,880
Take that robe off. Aren't you hot?

484
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,000
No, no. I'm good, I'm good.

485
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,440
-You guys want to come over tonight?
-.I  can't. I got a date.

486
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,880
With who? That stewardess?

487
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,840
Did I tell you about the stewardess?

488
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,840
Yeah, great tits. I believe you
had sex with her.

489
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,240
Yeah. All night long.
But this one's better.

490
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,360
-Why is that?
-Shoot some sticks.

491
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
She's a cosmetics counter girl.

492
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,960
If I ever get married, it'll be
to a cosmetics counter girl.

493
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,720
-Why a cosmetics counter girl?
-Grill some steaks and....

494
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,000
They're the perfect woman. They'll
always smell good and wear makeup.

495
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,840
They're not too ambitious.

496
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,560
And they won't be a damn
feminist bitch...

497
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,920
...keeps her own name when you marry.

498
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,800
-Like my mother?
-Yeah, exactly.

499
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,680
Let's get out of here.

500
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,520
-Mike, you coming along?
-No, I'm good. I'm good.

501
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,440
I'll stay and get a good sweat going.

502
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,720
-Take care of yourself.
-Yeah.

503
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,720
I'll catch up with you guys.

504
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,000
Gotcha.

505
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,480
This is my favorite group.

506
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,960
You hear that?! Yeah!

507
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,280
It came in stereo.

508
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
This is a system. Oh, yeah!

509
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,720
You hear that bass?! Good, right?!
You want more?!

510
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,480
Stakeout.

511
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,320
Right. Sorry.

512
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,640
Is that me?

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,800
Yeah, but I draw all my friends.

514
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,720
-lt is me. Let me see.
-No, really.

515
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,840
It's very rough. lt's very rough.

516
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,120
Let go.

517
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,720
Thank you.

518
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,960
Nice ass.

519
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
These are really good.

520
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,000
Have you ever tried to sell these?

521
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,520
It's pretty hard to start your
own comic strip.

522
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,400
There's our boy.

523
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,240
Where is he? Tell me.

524
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,440
Come on back here. I see you.

525
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,760
Jackass. I'll sic
the National Guard on you.

526
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,320
Oh, man. I learned my lesson.
No more two-story houses.

527
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,320
Subject hates two-story houses.

528
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,920
Here. Got you something.

529
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,080
These will go with
my horny devil socks.

530
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,240
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

531
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,240
So, what's our man up to?

532
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,680
Trying on underwear.

533
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
So you hungry?

534
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,600
I think I just lost my appetite.

535
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,360
Have some sushi.

536
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,160
Oh, no, no. I don't do sushi.

537
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,440
What?

538
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,840
-I've  always hated sushi.
-Everybody likes sushi.

539
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,880
Not me.

540
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,640
All right, you're going to try sushi.
Yeah. Try sushi.

541
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,400
-lt disgusts me. Really.
-Open your mouth.

542
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,520
Toot-toot! Open your mouth.

543
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,040
Good boy.

544
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,960
There you go.

545
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,920
There you go, sport.

546
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,400
You're a fun date, aren't you?

547
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
I told you I hate sushi.

548
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
I guess so.

549
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,640
This was a good idea.

550
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Yeah, I agree.

551
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,240
You're looking cute.

552
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,680
You vixen.

553
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,080
Subject likes brunettes.

554
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Prefers subservient women in uniform.

555
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,360
My God, this girl is Wonder Woman.

556
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,920
I'm terrified, yet strangely aroused.

557
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,520
You hear guys talking about
having blue balls.

558
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,480
I'll tell you, the last couple of
weeks...

559
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,920
....I  fuck and I fuck and I can't
get any relief.

560
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,320
Hold on. I gotta take a break.

561
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,880
I ate some raw fish.
Please, give me one second.

562
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,520
Do you like it better...

563
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,720
...when a girl makes the first move on
you or when you do?

564
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,200
Dude. Honestly?
I don't give a rat's ass.

565
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,640
I guess I like to be surprised.

566
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,840
What exactly do you mean by surprise?

567
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,760
Oh, dude. Oh, my God.

568
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,440
Last week, I'm doing this girl
in the back seat of her daddy's car.

569
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,280
Catholic schoolgirl's uniform.
The whole nine yards, man.

570
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,240
She drinks too much. She's sick, so
she hangs her head out the window...

571
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,920
...and just commences to puking.

572
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,680
It's too bad you had to stop.

573
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,520
No, see, I was gonna.

574
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,240
That would have been the right thing.

575
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,560
But the way she was having
these contractions.

576
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,360
They were just wrenching down
on the old crank.

577
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,200
Oh, God, it felt so great.

578
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,320
Now, that's a surprise.

579
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,760
Hey, my car, my car, my car!

580
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,080
Yeah, I know. lt sucks.

581
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,000
Oh, you get that extra key made
for the house?

582
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,000
Thanks.

583
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,120
I got to take the phone. Sorry.

584
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,520
I need that phone.
That phone is my life.

585
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,440
Michael. Carlos.
Give him the phone.

586
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,520
You've got three weeks.

587
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,560
Thanks, buddy.

588
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,920
I'm so glad to see you.

589
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,080
Great, great. All the kids are here.

590
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,120
Hey, how you doing, pal? Come here.

591
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,520
Ling, take your penis out of
the tartar sauce. You look great.

592
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,840
Michael, a surprise for you.

593
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,880
Natalie, this is Michael.
Michael, this is Natalie.

594
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,280
You probably don't remember,
but you two have met.

595
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,960
Michael was an usher at our wedding.

596
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,200
Right, right. I think I remember you.

597
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,000
Doesn't ring a bell.

598
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,440
So, Natalie, you're still single and
in law enforcement. How interesting.

599
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
Do you have any exciting stories?

600
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,040
Well, last year I got shot.
I shattered my pelvis and I was in--

601
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, speaking of pelvises,
how was the birth, Kelly?

602
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,360
I had to have a C-section.

603
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,320
She only dilated this much.

604
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
That happened with Freedom.

605
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,120
Then he came out feet first.
Talk about getting ripped.

606
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,920
Ripped.

607
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,160
Nuyen's birth mother birthed in water.
Tony and I were in the tub.

608
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,920
Oh, guys.

609
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,840
I was in labor for 26 hours.

610
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,560
Don't you people ever watch TV?!

611
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,440
I know I said no more matchmaking--

612
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,120
Yes, but Tricia can't help herself.

613
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,960
It's just that you two
are perfect for each other.

614
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,440
Kill me, Michael.

615
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,920
Kill me now.

616
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,400
Dill kung pao.
Pass the dill kung pao.

617
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,640
What a beautiful baby!

618
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,080
Oh, my God. You won't believe this.

619
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,880
-My water just broke.
-Her water....

620
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,160
What does that mean, her water broke?

621
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,160
What is that, her water?

622
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,080
Oh, God. Oh, God. People, we're
going to need a mop in here!

623
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,640
That scene back there freaked you
out, huh? Don't you like kids?

624
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,560
I am not talking to you about kids.
Last time, I wound up in handcuffs.

625
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,960
You know the one thing I regret more
than losing my money in Las Vegas?

626
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,560
What's that?

627
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,240
I should've asked you out
back at Max's wedding.

628
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,480
With that mullet hair you had?

629
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,920
Keep dreaming, buddy.

630
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,240
Nice. Nice.

631
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,040
Why didn't you?

632
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,400
I don't really like ugly chicks.

633
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
Ever play mercy?

634
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,960
Yes. I'll have you know
I'm very good at the game.

635
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,200
-Bring it on.
-Okay.

636
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,000
-One, two....
-Three.

637
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,280
Oh, yeah. You are going down!

638
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,480
I lose.

639
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,960
I'm sorry.

640
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,120
I'm sorry.

641
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,040
-.I  don't know what came over me.
-Freeze, motherfucker!

642
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,800
I am really sorry! I was out of line!

643
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,080
Please don't shoot me!

644
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,160
Bring Kyle to me tomorrow.

645
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,320
Drop cans!

646
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,800
Hands on your head!

647
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,240
You are not falling in love with her.

648
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,960
You're a lady-killer.
You're a tomcat.

649
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,960
Take it easy, Mike.

650
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,920
Good night, fellas.
Have a safe drive.

651
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,640
I'm confused because .I 
really like Michael.

652
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,800
And I think he likes me.

653
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,760
What, you can't tell?

654
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,600
Police! Nobody move, goddamn it!

655
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,600
There was this one moment.
It was amazing.

656
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,160
What the fuck does that mean?

657
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,600
So you really like this guy, huh?

658
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,120
I think I'm in love with him.

659
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,880
This is serious.

660
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,160
I know. He has a slick
exterior, but...

661
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,840
....I  see a real sweetheart underneath.

662
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,360
Clear.

663
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Clear.

664
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,480
Shit.

665
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,800
Remember the first time we
met him at the station?!

666
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,480
He found me because he felt I was
Kyle's last chance for true love.

667
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,880
Can't say that if you don't
believe it.

668
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,280
So how do I find out how he feels?

669
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,800
Say you're falling for Kyle.

670
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,480
Don't move or I'll blow
your brains out!

671
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,680
He won't believe I'm falling for Kyle.

672
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Oh, he'll believe it. Trust me.

673
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
Your partner's right.

674
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,280
Want to get a guy to make a move?
Get him competition.

675
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,720
Shut up.

676
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,680
Let me look at cologne.

677
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,200
Look at this place. There's hot babes
everywhere. lt smells great.

678
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,480
I ought to move in here.

679
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,200
-Would you watch it?
-Sorry.

680
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,680
Excuse us.

681
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,680
Man, this again?

682
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,080
I hate this shade of lipstick.
Stays on your dick for a week.

683
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,280
Then you should try
our hypoallergenic cleanser.

684
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,040
I think you should try some Visine.

685
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,880
Why do I need Visine?

686
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,160
So you can get a clear vision
of our future together.

687
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,640
Do I know you from somewhere?

688
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,920
I don't know. My name is Natalie.

689
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,720
I'm from Van Nuys.

690
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,320
Oh, my God, you're Natalie.

691
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,160
That's what I just said.

692
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Hey, I'm Kyle.

693
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,960
Remember? Max and Kim's wedding.

694
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,400
Malibu? I popped your cherry.

695
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,200
Oh, my God. You look great.

696
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,080
I'll let you two get reacquainted.

697
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,960
So you're working here.
Cosmetics counter girl.

698
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,080
I know it's not very ambitious, but...

699
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,600
...I'm saving my money
for a one-story house.

700
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,880
That's fantastic.

701
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,280
Put your shoes back on.
Get out of there.

702
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,600
Here you go. Would you like to dance?

703
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,520
Oh, yes. Come dance with me.

704
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,920
I love to lambada.
I love to fall feet and turns.

705
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,560
Nice dip, dork.

706
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,080
All right, Natalie. Enough's enough.
Tell him you can't stand him.

707
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,720
Tell him it's a scam.
You're in love with me.

708
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,040
Where you guys going?
Natalie, don't go.

709
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,120
No, no. Get out now.

710
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,480
Night vision.

711
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,320
No, no, Natalie. Get out of there.

712
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,360
There you go. Thattagirl.

713
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,680
No, not the microphone.
Not the microphone.

714
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,240
Natalie, get out of there.

715
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,120
Get out.

716
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,720
I'm blind.

717
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,040
You like it with the lights on?
Baby, come on. Ride the pony.

718
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,040
You know you want it.

719
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,320
Natalie, get out of there! Save
yourself! lt's the dick of death.

720
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,640
Come on, get some of this.

721
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,840
Come on, you little rodeo gal.

722
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,280
Here's how it's gonna go.

723
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,240
We're not having sex...

724
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,240
...tonight.

725
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,960
In fact, I don't know when
we're going to have sex.

726
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,040
I'm not like all the other girls.

727
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,800
But I promise you, Kyle,
you've never had a girl like me.

728
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,960
All right.

729
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Ready.

730
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,680
Better take care of that.

731
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,200
This is kind of about me, right?
Who'll take care of me better than me?

732
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,200
And you knew that!

733
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,120
We got a future together, baby.

734
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,080
All right. Here we go.

735
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,920
Ooh, I am going to hurt you tonight.

736
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,480
Michael. Yeah, it's me.

737
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,280
-.I  need you to meet me right away.
-Name a place.

738
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,280
Somewhere Kyle would never stumble
across us in a million years.

739
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,360
Thanks for meeting me.

740
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,080
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

741
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,760
I'm falling for Kyle.

742
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,600
He's actually pretty sweet.

743
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,760
Sweet? The guy screws women while
they're barfing!

744
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,120
You just don't know him like I do.

745
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,600
There's another side to him that he
doesn't show to everyone.

746
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,000
I've known the guy my whole life.
There's no other side. He's a dick.

747
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,880
-He's afraid to show his sensitivity.
-He must be very afraid.

748
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,040
Michael. All my life,
I waited to fall in love.

749
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,760
And now this guy really loves me.

750
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,920
Do you know what that's like?

751
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,520
Do you love anyone?

752
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,120
I guess not.

753
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,240
I better get back.

754
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,400
You won't let this defeat you.
You won't let this defeat you.

755
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,560
You know why? You know why?

756
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,720
Because you're the man. Who the man?
You the man. You the man.

757
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,000
Now, here's what you'll do.

758
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,440
You'll go out there and you'll
fuck the first woman you see.

759
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,600
The first woman you see.
You are going to be ruthless.

760
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,160
You'll use every little dirty trick.
Every little manipulation.

761
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,520
Every lie you know! You know why?
Because you the man! Now get her.

762
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,040
The first woman you see.
The first woman you see.

763
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,280
The second woman you see.
The second woman you see.

764
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,560
This is almost too easy.

765
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,600
Where would I bring an overdue book?

766
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,640
I'll take that.

767
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,680
I have always loved books.

768
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,960
And so I started studying library
science at Luther College and....

769
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,720
Oh, I'm sorry. I've  been going on
and on and on about myself all night.

770
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,280
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

771
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,000
It's such a treat when you meet
a woman who's so honest and direct.

772
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,360
-You're making me blush.
-You're sweet.

773
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,960
Golly, stop it.

774
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,720
This is me.

775
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,760
It was nice to meet you, Jill.

776
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,680
Oh, thank you.

777
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,920
It was really sweet of you to let me
pick the restaurant out tonight.

778
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,720
Oh, please, I love sushi.

779
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,240
Good night.

780
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,000
Good night.

781
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,680
I was wondering....

782
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,680
I mean, this isn't how .I --
Gosh.

783
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,280
Golly, I'm tongue-tied tonight.

784
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,560
It's okay. You can say it.

785
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,040
Would you like to come in?

786
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh, no, it's way too late.

787
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,800
Okay.

788
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,320
-Nice place.
-Thank you.

789
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,080
Four-H ribbons, cool.
That's a big cock.

790
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,880
Grammy.

791
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,400
Grammy, hello.

792
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,960
Grammy, l'd like you to meet
my friend Michael.

793
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,120
This is Grammy.
She was a librarian too.

794
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,120
Hello, young man.

795
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,320
Would you two kids like a nightcap?

796
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,440
Sure.

797
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,920
I hope you like hot butterscotch
toddies. They're Jill's favorite.

798
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,040
Mine too.

799
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,520
This is amazing.

800
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,000
It's like your granddaughter
and I are on the same wavelength!

801
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,120
It's spooky!

802
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,480
You want to go upstairs?

803
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,800
Sweet dreams, Grammy.

804
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,760
Night, peanut.

805
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,840
I think I could really care for you.

806
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,800
-Really?
-Yeah.

807
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,760
Hold on, one second.

808
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,480
I see the tables have turned.

809
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,280
What are you doing?

810
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,080
Trust me.

811
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,680
Ow! Jesus!

812
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,080
You can take it.

813
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,400
I don't know if I want to take it.

814
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,600
You've been a bad, bad boy.

815
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,600
No, no. I haven't.

816
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,080
I've been a very good boy.

817
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,840
You had an overdue library book.

818
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,840
This is a little unexpected.

819
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,720
Call me mistress,
you disgusting little worm.

820
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,600
You said it.
We're on the same wavelength.

821
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,800
All that wavelength stuff,
to be honest with you...

822
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
....I  said that to get you into bed.

823
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,560
That is not very nice.

824
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,680
In fact, that is downright naughty.

825
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,720
I've been a bad boy. Very bad.

826
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,240
I'm sorry. I think I should go home
and think about what I've  done.

827
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,240
That's right. You should think long
and hard about what you did.

828
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
You naughty boy.

829
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,920
What is that?

830
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,840
You piece of slime.

831
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,920
What is this?

832
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,040
Okay! Look at the time.

833
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,360
It's getting late.

834
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,000
I should be heading home.

835
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,480
It's really way past my bedtime.

836
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,240
I know you'd probably love to have me
hang around so you can...

837
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,320
...beat the ever-living shit
out of me!

838
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,560
I really should go home
Please let me go home.

839
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,840
Please, can I go home?

840
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,120
I know about boys like you.

841
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,520
You don't take books seriously.

842
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,920
Yes, I do.

843
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,640
I take books very seriously.

844
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,680
Meow.

845
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,600
So you don't respect books.

846
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,640
I love books.

847
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,280
You break their bindings.
You doodle in their margins.

848
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,840
That's right. You are a doodle bug.

849
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,400
I'm not a doodle bug.

850
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,000
That's what you are.
Just a little, dirty bug.

851
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,160
The Scarlet Letter.

852
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,000
Great inspiration in those pages.
It's an excellent choice.

853
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,720
One whack for every day overdue.

854
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,240
I don't know.

855
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,360
I'm just not feeling it.

856
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,440
Something's missing.

857
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,720
Here's Grammy!

858
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,880
That's it. No more redheads.
No more redheads, ever.

859
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,800
God!

860
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,280
-You really like this girl?
-Natalie?

861
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,520
Man, I'm telling you.
She's the best.

862
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,120
-Isn't  it time you moved on?
-No way, dude.

863
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,440
This girl really knows
how to turn me on.

864
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,840
You find anything down there?

865
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,320
Feel my left nut.

866
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,720
Are you out of your mind?

867
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,160
No, no, man. lt's like
the size of a baseball.

868
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,680
Good for you. I'm not touching it.

869
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,200
This other one's fine.

870
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,040
But this one feels like
a cantaloupe or something.

871
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,600
Must be those blue balls
you mentioned.

872
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,600
Feel it. Tell me what you think.

873
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,480
I think I'm about to kick your ass!

874
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,440
Come on. Dude. Mike.

875
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,600
Mike, come on!

876
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,800
A real pal'd feel my balls.

877
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,080
We were showering.
And I looked down...

878
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,160
...and my left nut is the size
of an Easter egg.

879
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,240
What do you want me to do about it?

880
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,440
I want your professional opinion.

881
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,240
You want me to grope your balls?

882
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,320
Just the left one.
Mike wouldn't do it.

883
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,280
Come on, you're a doctor.
Feel his balls.

884
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,200
I'm a proctologist, not a urologist.

885
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,200
You'll jam your fingers up his ass
but won't touch his balls?

886
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,040
-They're two different things!
-You went to medical school.

887
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,520
All right! Slow down!
Slow down!

888
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,280
I'll do it.

889
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,920
Thanks.

890
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,400
I need my nurse present.

891
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,320
Shirley, have my nurse
come in here, please?

892
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,000
She's in room 12 with your wife.

893
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,520
They've been back there for about
a half an hour, at least.

894
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,560
Ah, shitballs!

895
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,440
Harder. Do it harder.

896
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,360
I finally caught you, you dirty--

897
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,880
Steve, you finish that sentence,
and I swear to God I'll call a lawyer.

898
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,880
We better go with two on this one.

899
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,840
Jesus.

900
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,040
This is huge.

901
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,560
Like a kumquat.

902
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,800
What does it mean?

903
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,000
Beats me.

904
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,520
I won't beat around
the dance floor, Mr. Brenner.

905
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,240
It's cancer.

906
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,120
Oh, Jesus.

907
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,240
It's only in the one testicle.

908
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,040
We'll run more tests
after we remove it.

909
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,320
-You mean, remove the cancer?
-No, Mr. Brenner.

910
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,880
I mean, remove the testicle.

911
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,880
If I don't remove it, you could die.

912
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,480
How painful a death
are we talking about?

913
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,560
Let me give it to you straight.

914
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,280
The affected region is too close to
the spine to give you any anesthesia.

915
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,040
So we plan to make
a gash in the abdomen.

916
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,880
Reach down, yank the scrotum up
into the abdominal cavity...

917
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,520
...and saw off the testicle.

918
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,760
There's a 40 percent chance...

919
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,840
...we're going to have to
amputate the penis.

920
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,040
Oh, God!

921
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,080
Had you going.

922
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,320
That is why I love this job.

923
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,280
It's painless. The procedure
takes about an hour.

924
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,280
Okay. So will I still be able to...?

925
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,800
-You know?
-Play the trombone?

926
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,400
No, I mean, with girls. Will .I --?
Can I still...?

927
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,440
Oh, ride the one-eyed hoagie.
Of course you can, son.

928
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,960
However, I recommend to most of my
patients before this procedure...

929
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,920
...that they make a deposit
in the sperm bank...

930
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,400
...before the operation, just in case.

931
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,000
Just go on over, you know...

932
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,640
...give her a whack.

933
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,280
I don't want to do this.

934
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,640
I'm not asking you to go
in the room with me.

935
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,000
If you do it too,
I'll be more comfortable.

936
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,040
I mean, look at this place.
It's completely professional, right?

937
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,440
We're here to make a deposit.

938
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,160
I really don't want to do this.

939
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,520
Sign these forms.

940
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,520
And fill these bottles.

941
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,160
So if I run into trouble back there...

942
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,240
...you'll give me a hand?

943
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,840
Never heard that one before.

944
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,600
You're in room seven,
and you're in room nine.

945
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,840
Come on.

946
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,920
Oh, Michael, you're the greatest.

947
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,040
Here you go.

948
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,200
Dude.

949
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,520
Dude!

950
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,280
I brought you a plant.

951
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,520
Oh, dude. Don't make me laugh.

952
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,160
Has Natalie been here all night?

953
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,640
She never left my side.

954
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,520
She says this happened because I've 
got too much karma in my genitals.

955
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,800
-How was it?
-lt was all right.

956
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,680
Doc says the other rocket launcher's
good, so....

957
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,320
Come here. Come here.

958
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
Come here.

959
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,640
I want my ball.

960
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,120
Kyle, I understand that,
but look on the bright side.

961
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,960
-You still have one healthy one.
-You don't understand.

962
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,120
I want to take it home with me,
and the nurses said I can't do that.

963
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,200
It's not a tooth, Kyle.

964
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,520
It belongs to me. I miss it.

965
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,520
Please. Get my nut.

966
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,200
It fell right on the floor.

967
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,680
-What? The kidney?
-Slipped from my hand, how embarrassing.

968
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
Mertle kicks it, it rolls
under the O.R. table...

969
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,040
...slides across the room.

970
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,640
I can't believe I'm doing this.

971
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,560
Okay, come on. Come to papa.

972
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,120
Slippery little guy. Got you.

973
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,520
I got to put this in something.
Got to find something to put this in.

974
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,920
Where'd it go? Where'd you go?

975
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,040
Where'd you...

976
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,920
...go?

977
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,160
You can't be in here.

978
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,440
Hold the sticky buns. Give me these.

979
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,880
-Stand in line.
-Give them to me.

980
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,040
You have to...

981
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,480
...stand...

982
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,040
...in...

983
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,760
...line!

984
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,600
Doctor!

985
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,400
Do not eat that!

986
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,360
Did you get it?

987
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,400
Yep. I got it.

988
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,080
Wow. So that's what a nut looks like?

989
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,680
That's a nut.

990
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,560
Thanks, Mike. You're a lifesaver.

991
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,720
I appreciate it.

992
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,560
Remember our deal, banging every girl
in the world? That's on you now, pal.

993
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,040
I'll get right on that.

994
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,920
Call me.

995
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,800
Don't get too comfortable.

996
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,800
You have got to wait your turn.

997
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,760
Hurry up, Michael, I'm next.

998
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,320
-Give me a couple of minutes of rest.
-Kyle doesn't take this long.

999
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,400
Two, three minutes
and he's always done.

1000
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,120
Hurry if you want to get every
woman in the world.

1001
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,880
Please, let me shut my eyes, for like,
literally 30 seconds...

1002
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,320
...and then just a little sandwich.

1003
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,160
Michael. lt's Carlos.

1004
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,000
I know you got three days
and 14 hours to go...

1005
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,880
...but since you've run out of shit
for me to take...

1006
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,920
....I  remind you,
if you don't pay, you die.

1007
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,520
No problem. I'll have it.

1008
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,320
You're as bad a liar as you are a
gambler, Mr. Delaney. See you Friday.

1009
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,400
How's it going, man?

1010
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,880
I'm just kidding, man.

1011
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,280
I'm all better.

1012
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,840
I'm fine.
I bring this everywhere I go.

1013
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,280
Thanks to you.

1014
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,200
Thanks for showing up today.
I really wanted you to be here.

1015
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,640
Here for what?

1016
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,400
You're busted, Mike.
Natalie told me what you did.

1017
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,560
She what?

1018
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,760
How you found her.
I can't believe it.

1019
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,680
Kyle, I am so sorry.

1020
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,320
You tracked her down after hearing
my story to see if we'd fit.

1021
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,720
Who does that?

1022
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,000
Thank you. You're the best, pal.

1023
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,960
She tell you she's a cop?

1024
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,600
That whole cosmetics counter thing?
That was an undercover gig.

1025
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,160
Very clever.

1026
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,240
Thank you.

1027
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,840
You know what?

1028
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,800
When death has literally
got you by the balls...

1029
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,040
...everything you've been afraid of
suddenly seems unimportant.

1030
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,280
There are things that I can do now...

1031
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,280
...that I never could do before.

1032
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,200
For instance:

1033
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,480
Officer Natalie Parker...

1034
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,360
....I  have been arrested
by your beauty.

1035
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,840
And l'd love to serve
a life sentence...

1036
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,640
...in the jail of your heart.

1037
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,600
Oh, my God.

1038
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,080
Yes.

1039
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,680
Of course I'll marry you, Kyle.

1040
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,920
I can't believe it. I've  delivered
Natalie right into the devil's lair.

1041
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,480
I finally feel I can have
something real with someone.

1042
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:45,200
You know, something solid. Built on
trust. Like what you and Tricia have.

1043
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,800
Now she's going to go off
and marry him.

1044
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,520
Step up, man. Tell her how you feel.

1045
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,360
Tell her you love her, you puss.

1046
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,680
Have you been listening?
She loves Kyle.

1047
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,800
Steve, it's so weird.

1048
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,600
For the first time in my life...

1049
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,000
...someone else matters
more to me than...

1050
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,600
....I  matter to myself.

1051
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,160
Well, you changed after all that shit
you went through.

1052
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,400
I'm exercising. People change.

1053
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,520
You know what?
Maybe Kyle has changed too.

1054
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,960
All he went through.
Maybe he's a changed man now.

1055
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,000
Oh, yeah, baby!

1056
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:29,000
All right! Ooh, give it to me.

1057
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,440
I'll be right back, baby.

1058
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,520
What's up, having fun?

1059
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,720
Calm down!

1060
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,280
How rocking is this?

1061
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,200
What's the matter? You're not having a
good time, buddy?

1062
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,200
Get a load of some of these women.
They're amazing.

1063
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,520
You see that one there?  In  the blue?

1064
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,080
You wouldn't believe what she can do
with Ping-Pong balls.

1065
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,520
It is showtime!

1066
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,360
Come on, come on!

1067
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,200
Mike, did you see this?

1068
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,160
Yo, Cherry, come here! Come here,
Cherry.

1069
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,600
Hey, sit down. This is Michael. And
she's a student.

1070
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,320
Right now I'm concentrating on my
actressing.

1071
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,760
Come over here, Cherry.

1072
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,440
You sexy little actress thing, you.

1073
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,480
-How about we go in the bedroom?
-Can I bring a friend?

1074
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,720
It's my bachelor party.
The more, the merrier.

1075
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,040
Oh, hello there!

1076
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,040
You're cool with this?

1077
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,680
Everybody's entitled
to a last hurrah.

1078
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,520
You want to go in the bedroom
and start warming up without me?

1079
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,240
I'll be there in a minute.

1080
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,280
Thank you.

1081
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,800
What do you mean, ''last hurrah''?

1082
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:00,200
I just figure you're getting married
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

1083
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,160
You know, you're entitled one
last dip in the bachelor pool.

1084
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,480
You're funny. You're hysterical, man.

1085
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,480
You're joking, right?

1086
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,240
-.I  thought you loved her.
-Love's got nothing to do with it.

1087
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,400
Natalie will be a great baby-maker.

1088
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,560
I could still sleep around.

1089
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,840
She'll be at home with the kids.
She'll never know.

1090
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,600
Hey, girls! What's up?

1091
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,680
I thought you were going to go
warm up in bed without me.

1092
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,360
You did it, man.

1093
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,320
You won the bet, man!

1094
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,560
You'll be rich.

1095
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,000
Tomorrow morning at 9,
you're gonna be rich.

1096
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,320
Rich!

1097
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,360
No, Steve. No, I'm not.

1098
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,680
I have got a wedding to stop!

1099
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,520
I cannot believe you let Kyle
plan this wedding.

1100
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,760
It doesn't matter.

1101
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,760
You're going through with this?

1102
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,240
Hey. Look at me.
Do I look amazing or what?

1103
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,640
We're in luck. My uncle Murray's
performing the ceremonies.

1104
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,760
He's my hero.

1105
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,360
And the witnesses sign in triplicate.

1106
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,440
That's three, tres, trois...

1107
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,840
...and then...

1108
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,840
....I  stamp a little, I notarize,
I file it.

1109
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,680
Voilà.

1110
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,920
Can't you just feel the romance?

1111
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,800
Oh, no. Oh, no!

1112
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,400
No!

1113
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,960
Where are my clothes?
Where are my clothes?!

1114
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,680
Clothes. Where are my clothes?

1115
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,560
Excuse me, ma'am? Ma'am?
Excuse me, ma'am. Please get up.

1116
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,280
Have you seen a pair of pants?

1117
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,760
I'm gonna borrow your jacket, okay?
There we go.

1118
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,320
Please. Okay. There we go. Okay.
Here we go.

1119
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,320
I promise I'll return this, okay?

1120
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,320
Slow down!

1121
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,600
That was close.

1122
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,320
I can't believe this. lt's terrible.

1123
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,600
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1124
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,040
Fur coat!

1125
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,880
What are you--? Stop it!

1126
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,160
Marriage is a state...

1127
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,200
...that is not entered into easily.

1128
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,960
It is damn hard, kids.

1129
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:48,600
It requires dedication
and a lot of sacrifices.

1130
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,080
Like for instance, if you have
a mother-in-law...

1131
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,560
...who figures she can stay over with
you whenever she damn pleases!

1132
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,840
She comes in and stays in the toilet
for an hour and a half!

1133
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,240
Who reads War and Peace
in the toilet?!

1134
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,080
Mommy!

1135
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,560
I'm a good stranger. lt's okay.

1136
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,840
Hey, you! Stop!

1137
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,880
I'm not weird. We were just talking.

1138
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,600
Kyle, do you promise to make love
to Natalie...

1139
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,240
...and only Natalie...

1140
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,360
...until one of you is dead?

1141
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,560
I wasn't looking at you.

1142
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,280
Don't do that.

1143
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,800
Be advised, we're looking
for a peeping Tom.

1144
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,800
This guy is really twisted.

1145
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,680
And do you, my handsome nephew...

1146
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,600
...take Natalie to be your
lawful wedded wife...

1147
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,920
...through the good times
and the bad times...

1148
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,600
...and the times she won't talk
to you for months...

1149
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,480
...and even worse, when she will...

1150
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:11,400
...so you pretend you're asleep
so she'll leave you alone...

1151
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,160
...but you lie there listening to her
grind her teeth...

1152
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,920
...hour after hour...

1153
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,560
...like a fucking hacksaw?

1154
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,240
I made it.

1155
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,480
Nice dress, bonehead!

1156
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,480
Sorry. My mistake.

1157
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,240
Stop the wedding!

1158
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,440
I love you!

1159
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,520
I thought you said you were
done with all that.

1160
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,080
It's not Peter.
I don't even know who this guy is.

1161
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,760
I'm curious, Mr. Delaney.
How did you get the money?

1162
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,520
I guess you could say I sold my soul.

1163
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,840
Yeah, I see a lot of that.

1164
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,200
Way to go. Marry the best woman in
the world and it's not enough for you.

1165
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,920
What?

1166
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,400
You're married?!

1167
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,040
Thanks, asshole.
You got something on your nose.

1168
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,560
You were in on it together.
Take me for a ride.

1169
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,440
What do you mean? You got it all!
Why'd you tap me on the nose?

1170
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,200
You really don't know, do you?

1171
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,960
On our wedding night.
I thought everything was fine.

1172
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,040
I was ready to give her a hose down.

1173
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,880
Well, hello, Mrs. Brenner.

1174
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,520
Actually, I'm gonna keep
my own name.

1175
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,160
Yeah, whatever.

1176
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,880
Yeah. A little of the old bubbly.

1177
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,800
Remember our first time?

1178
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,920
When you left me out in Malibu with
nothing but a roll of quarters?

1179
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,480
Yeah. That was so hot.

1180
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,320
Here's to that.

1181
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,280
Let's swap bodily fluids, baby.

1182
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,320
When I woke up, she was gone.

1183
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,920
The next day, marriage was annulled,
she was nowhere to be found.

1184
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,320
Never saw her again. Figured you two
had a scam to get the bachelor cash.

1185
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,080
That's cool, though. I'm getting
more pussy now than ever.

1186
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:31,160
Chicks really dig a guy
with a broken heart.

1187
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,920
Kyle, I am so sorry.

1188
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,520
I'm kidding. I just play that.
You know me.

1189
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,320
I'll be a one-balled babe hound
when I'm 80.

1190
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,000
I got a date with a new girl.
She's fantastic.

1191
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,440
What, another cosmetics counter girl?

1192
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,560
No, man, no. A librarian. She's
so hot. A little redheaded girl.

1193
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,440
She gave me this book to read.

1194
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,480
This book will change your life.

1195
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
I gotta go.

1196
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,080
I like to be spanked
with a day-old carrot.

1197
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,080
How much you got?

1198
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,200
Twenty bucks.

1199
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,880
And my own carrot.

1200
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,360
Excuse me.

1201
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,160
I've got a proposal, but it might
sound a little strange.

1202
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,640
The Chinese Theater is this way?

1203
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,600
Thank you very much, ma'am.

1204
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,960
-Where's the carrot?
-.I  got it.

1205
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,880
It's okay. I got it.

1206
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,400
I just wanted to give you this.

1207
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,280
You were there?

1208
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,480
I tried to stop the wedding,
but I was late.

1209
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,280
So, this proposal...

1210
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,560
...does it involve sex?

1211
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,400
Yeah, l'd say there'd be a fair
amount of sex involved.

1212
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,680
Definitely a house and a ring.

1213
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,400
-Maybe even some children.
-Children?

1214
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,720
At least a dog.
Definitely not a hamster.

1215
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,240
I like dogs.

1216
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,280
So, what's up, Delaney?

1217
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,320
You love me or something?

1218
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,520
I do.

1219
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,200
I now happily ratify...

1220
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,880
...your union as husband and wife.

1221
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,920
You may kiss your bride.

1222
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,560
Wait.

1223
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,080
Not until you say those
three little words.

1224
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,040
I'm not falling for that one again.

1225
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,360
Suck my cock.

1226
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,200
Hold it. Hold it.

1227
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,120
How big of an idiot
do you think I am?

1228
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I love you.

1229
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,240
This is fantastic. You're like a big,
bad dominatrix.

1230
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:53,480
I can't wait to get to this.
Show me what you got.

1231
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,080
I don't know.

1232
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,560
I think something's missing.

1233
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,320
Yeah, something's missing, get your
butt out of that little thing.

1234
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:07,440
You got to do something to me.
Let's see what you got.

1235
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,520
Tricia?

1236
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,440
What the hell am I thinking?

1237
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,120
Oh, God, I knew it!

1238
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,920
Oh, how could you?

1239
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:49,240
Consuela. Kelly. Tricia!

1240
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,600
You're all dirty birdies!

1241
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,960
You want to join us?

1242
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,120
Thank God Almighty!

1243
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,160
Come on, Johnny.

1244
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,520
Oh, yeah, Johnny. Oh, come on.

1245
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,440
If you don't cut, I'm gonna come.

1246
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,720
What is it exactly you
want me to say?

1247
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,160
You know...

1248
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,160
...those three...

1249
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,880
...little...

1250
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,720
...words.

1251
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,160
Okay. I love you.

1252
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,200
I love you, I love you.

1253
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,440
I love you.

1254
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,920
Yeah, baby!

1255
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,360
Hold it, Bob.

1256
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,880
- In  unison, turn. Okay?
-Two, three.

1257
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,840
I'm sorry.

1258
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,840
I'm sorry. I tried, I tried.

1259
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,360
C mark.

1260
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,680
Action!

1261
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,800
You're under arrest, you sick fuck.

1262
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,640
You should try some Visine.

1263
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,200
Why do I need Visine?

1264
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,640
So you can get a clear future of our
vision together.

1265
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,760
Wash my car.

1266
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,040
I mean, I might've fallen in love with
her that night.

1267
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,040
What happened to her?

1268
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,480
She might've been
the love of my life.

1269
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,200
Energy and pace.

1270
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,600
What the fuck are you doing?

1271
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:08,320
I'm experimenting. He said try some
stuff. I'm blowing bubbles.

1272
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,680
You're welcome.

1273
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,720
Michael. Oh, call me.

1274
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,640
Okay. I will.

1275
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,920
Don't get too comfortable.

1276
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,080
-You have got to wait your turn.
-Hurry up, I'm next.

1277
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,840
Jesus Christ! What the hell is this?

1278
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,080
Oh, my God.

1279
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,080
Cut.

1280
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,000
That's a wrap.
