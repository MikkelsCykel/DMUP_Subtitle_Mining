00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:18,891
Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary

2
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,789
since Velez Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,088
shortly after takeoff
from JFK Airport.

4
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:26,287
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:29,085
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School,

6
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:33,183
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:35,715
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:38,914
that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

9
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:42,712
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed

10
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:44,911
died soon thereafter
in a series

11
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,410
of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,808
Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,

13
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:53,007
but to others,
they're an indication

14
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,606
that there are more
sinister events taking place.

15
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,605
That's the contention
of tonight's guest.

16
00:00:57,804 --> 00:00:59,604
Thank you for joining us
this evening.

17
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,203
Thank you for having me.

18
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:03,402
And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.

19
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:06,000
Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,399
about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.

21
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,997
Here's your chance
to set the record straight.

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,496
Great. Okay.

23
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:18,194
I believe that there's
a sort of force,

24
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:22,192
an unseen malevolent
presence...

25
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:24,291
that's all around us
every day.

26
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:27,689
And it determines
when we live and die.

27
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,187
And some people call
this force the devil,

28
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,886
but I think that
whole religious thing is...

29
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:38,284
so I prefer to call it
Death itself.

30
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:40,916
So I'm surrounded by Death?

31
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,115
Absolutely. Absolutely.

32
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:46,613
Every day, everywhere,
all the time.

33
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:49,312
And that's what I want people
to understand...

34
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:51,311
that Death
has this grand design

35
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,510
that we all fit into.

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,209
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

37
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,507
and took the other
survivors with him,

38
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:01,006
he basically screwed up
Death's plan.

39
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:03,905
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

40
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:07,103
And the fact that all
of the survivors have died

41
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,302
is your evidence of this?

42
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,900
Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,099
but it's the way
that they died.

44
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:19,597
I mean, there were
so many weird,

45
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:22,395
seemingly random things
about the way they died.

46
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:26,094
It just didn't
make sense.

47
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:29,192
And that's the proof
there's something out there...

48
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:32,890
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,089
of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

50
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,288
Kimberly.

51
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,586
You should be more
open-minded...

52
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,485
What happened after that
was just coincidence.

53
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,584
May I finish?

54
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:48,616
Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

55
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:50,915
But not all of them
including their teachers.

56
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:53,413
Yes, but people die
all the time,

57
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,912
so why should this be
any different?

58
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,411
It forced people
to question

59
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,009
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

60
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,008
What if they
were something more?

61
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,207
What if you could do
something about it?

62
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:08,006
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

63
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:11,404
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

64
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:14,203
That's exactly what
I'm saying.

65
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:16,502
Exactly it.

66
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:18,401
And in order
to survive...

67
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,900
the only way to survive

68
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,198
is to look beneath
the visible world.

69
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:27,196
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

70
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:29,895
And today may be
your day to die.

71
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,288
Okay, I'll call you.

72
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:46,387
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

73
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,586
Credit card,
cell phone, Triple-A card?

74
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:51,084
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

75
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:54,916
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares,
sunblock, mace?

76
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,415
Condoms,
whips, chains.

77
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,213
Just kidding,
Mr Corman.

78
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,012
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

79
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:04,711
That makes me feel
a lot better, thanks.

80
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,209
- Okay.
- Alrighty.

81
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,408
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.

82
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:15,606
Go on.

83
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:17,804
Okay, I'll call you.

84
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:22,702
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

85
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:25,101
Whatever,
your dad's cool.

86
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:30,198
Buckle up!

87
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:00,217
Watch it!

88
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,515
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.

89
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:10,811
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.

90
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,109
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

91
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:17,108
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

92
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:20,806
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

93
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,006
Whatever.

94
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,404
What are we going to do
in Daytona?

95
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,703
We're going to see lots
of honeys there.

96
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:29,602
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke
this big 'El Gagerero,'

97
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:31,501
We're gonna have this
awesome party...

98
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:34,200
Pileup! Pileup!

99
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:47,293
A candlelight vigil to mark
the one year anniversary

100
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:50,491
of the crash of Flight 180
will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

101
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,690
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

102
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,089
.' Highway to hell... .'

103
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,914
Oh my God.

104
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:18,011
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.

105
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,309
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.

106
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,908
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.

107
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,607
I'll do that.

108
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:27,606
I mean it. Take care of it.

109
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,204
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.

110
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,503
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:35,402
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.

112
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:39,100
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!

113
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,699
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!

114
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:47,096
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

115
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,195
Oh, shit!

116
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:53,193
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!

117
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:54,793
Shit.

118
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:04,988
Seriously, put it out.

119
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,086
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.

120
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,786
Wait, wait, wait!

121
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,585
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.

122
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,616
Hey, it's Kat.

123
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,615
Listen...
what the hell?!

124
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,514
Just wait. Not you.

125
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:38,304
I think we better pull over
and check the car, because...

126
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,903
Kimberly, the car
is going to be fine.

127
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:44,201
Your dad's going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

128
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:46,100
Okay?

129
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,485
Look at that guy.

130
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:20,716
He's drinking a beer.

131
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:25,214
Oh, yeah,
that's real responsible.

132
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:01,796
You ever hear
of the ozone layer, arsehole?!

133
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:32,514
.' When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play.'

134
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,812
.' Don't come around if
you ain't got no cocaine to bring... '

135
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:47,007
What? I'm wearing
my seatbelt.

136
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,705
You're gonna bust me,
bitch?!

137
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:06,597
Aaah!

138
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:08,096
Son of a...

139
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,595
bitch.

140
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,287
Fuck!

141
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:01,003
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!

142
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,002
- Stop!
- Oh my God!

143
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:04,901
Watch out!
Aaah!

144
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:50,711
Shaina?

145
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:57,608
I can't get out of here!

146
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:01,006
Help me!

147
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:14,799
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?

148
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:31,091
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

149
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,290
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

150
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,589
Pileup! Pileup!

151
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,387
- Oh my God.
- What?

152
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:41,386
There's going to be
a huge accident.

153
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,285
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.

154
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,884
That's it.
My turn to drive.

155
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:47,416
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?

156
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:52,414
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

157
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:55,412
...of Flight 180 will be held
at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,811
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

159
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,409
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '

160
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:03,009
'Highway to hell'?

161
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,507
.' I'm on a highway to hell... '

162
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,206
Okay, Kimberly,
you're scaring me.

163
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,704
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:21,000
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?

165
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,599
What the fuck, Kimberly?

166
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,697
What's this?

167
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,693
Kimberly, you just got
to breathe.

168
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:37,591
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.

169
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,490
- What?
- Oh my God.

170
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,389
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me? Huh?

171
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,888
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.

172
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:54,416
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

173
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,708
What's going on here?

174
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:12,107
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

175
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:14,206
I saw it.

176
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:16,205
There were bodies
everywhere.

177
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:18,204
There were logs...
I saw it.

178
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:19,903
It just happened.

179
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:23,202
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please
step out of the vehicle.

180
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:36,195
Just pull over!

181
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,794
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.

182
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:44,491
Come on.

183
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,790
Come on!

184
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,889
Oh, fuck this.

185
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,187
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

186
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:05,914
Fuck.

187
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,213
What the hell
is going on up there?

188
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,812
Excuse me!

189
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,510
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

190
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,509
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.

191
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,408
- Just move it...
- Now!

192
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,404
That's it!

193
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:27,903
That's the truck
that's going to kill everybody.

194
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,802
You need to stop
that truck!

195
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,701
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

196
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,399
Why won't you listen to me?!

197
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:39,197
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

198
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,792
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

199
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:51,591
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

200
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,890
Kimberly, what's going on?

201
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,110
No!

202
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,009
No!

203
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,299
Listen, sir,
this girl is really freaked out.

204
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:43,698
In fact, all of them are...

205
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,897
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!

206
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:49,195
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

207
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:50,695
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis...

208
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,494
yesterday the kid
wins the lotto.

209
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:54,593
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

210
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:56,592
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

211
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,291
I should be
so damn 'unlucky.'

212
00:16:58,491 --> 00:16:59,890
Go babysit the rest of them.

213
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,689
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

214
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,788
Hey, excuse me...

215
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:06,687
We're trying to do
the best we can.

216
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:09,385
We're going to get you
out of here as soon as possible.

217
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:12,084
I just think it's a bunch
of bullshit.

218
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,813
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

219
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,812
with Detective Suby...

220
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:26,210
but would you mind
telling me what happened?

221
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,908
It was like I was there.

222
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:36,005
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

223
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,603
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?

224
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,899
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

225
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,298
you guys all heard
about Flight 180, right?

226
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:53,497
The kid who got off
the plane?

227
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:55,696
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

228
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,893
My premonition
was just like his.

229
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:07,690
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

230
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,589
You must have read
about the kid

231
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,488
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

232
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:13,587
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

233
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:16,285
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

234
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:18,884
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

235
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,316
So a month goes by, right?

236
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:24,414
Everything seems cool.

237
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:28,412
But then all the survivors
start to die one by one.

238
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,111
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

239
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,008
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them,

240
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:40,406
hunting each one down

241
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:44,005
until they were all...
dead.

242
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,702
Please.

243
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,500
There was one survivor.

244
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,298
Clear Rivers is
in a padded room

245
00:18:57,498 --> 00:19:00,097
at the Stonybrook Institution.

246
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:01,796
Well, that's encouraging.

247
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:07,293
Okay, you want me
to believe that this is true,

248
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,092
that this is happening
all over again?

249
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,291
I don't know why
we're even here.

250
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,489
What do you want from me?

251
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,188
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

252
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:20,786
we all should have died
in that pileup.

253
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:22,785
Which means Death
could be coming for us.

254
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:24,784
Yeah, like, what if

255
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:28,416
we're all getting that 'Different Strokes'
curse or something?

256
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:31,314
I think you're all
are certifiable.

257
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,513
I can't believe I've been listening
to this crap.

258
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:36,312
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.

259
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:39,210
Mrs Carpenter, please.

260
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:45,807
Kimberly!

261
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,105
Oh baby!

262
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,804
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

263
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,503
Shh, shh.

264
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:56,902
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

265
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,390
Could I ask you something?

266
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,789
Anything.

267
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,588
Did Mum ever have any...

268
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:28,286
I don't know,
weird feelings about anything?

269
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,184
What do you mean?

270
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,315
Like visions or premonitions.

271
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,813
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

272
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:43,612
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

273
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:46,010
but I'm really scared
for the others.

274
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,808
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.

275
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,707
What?

276
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:56,405
It's not over yet.

277
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:21,493
Jesus Christ!

278
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,492
Shit!

279
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:56,812
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.

280
00:22:57,012 --> 00:22:58,811
Sorry I haven't called.

281
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,609
Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.

282
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,308
Let's hook up.
Call me.

283
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,807
Yeah.

284
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:08,606
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.

285
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:10,905
We met at Tucker's party
last year?

286
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,503
I know it's been awhile,
but I've been thinking about you.

287
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:16,302
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

288
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:18,401
So give me a call.

289
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:20,700
555-0123. Bye.

290
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,198
You little bastard.

291
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:25,897
Shit.

292
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:33,693
Come on.
Come on.

293
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,088
Fuck. Fuck.

294
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,216
Come on!

295
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,915
Come on.

296
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:04,811
Fuck!

297
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,310
Jesus!

298
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:15,406
Oh!

299
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:24,201
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.

300
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:26,800
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,

301
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,599
and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.

302
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:33,597
Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!

303
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:04,315
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

304
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:06,114
Aah!

305
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:38,098
Jesus!

306
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:44,395
Come on.

307
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,090
Aah!

308
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,687
Shit, I'm lucky.

309
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:02,885
Aah!

310
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,016
Jesus Christ!

311
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,905
No, Mother,

312
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:38,604
just turn on any station.

313
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:41,902
Well, I don't know how you missed it,
it's been on all day.

314
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:44,601
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.

315
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:47,799
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?

316
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,798
I got to go!

317
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:52,597
To recap our top story,

318
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:56,195
Route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

319
00:27:56,495 --> 00:27:59,494
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

320
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,492
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

321
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:05,691
hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.

322
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,789
So far police are refusing
to release the names of the victims

323
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,588
until the families
are notified.

324
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:12,587
The camera
of a highway patrol car

325
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:14,486
managed to catch
this shocking footage.

326
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:16,585
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.

327
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:18,584
And smashes
into a red SUV.

328
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:22,216
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...

329
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:23,815
leave it.

330
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,314
...may have
saved her life.

331
00:28:25,514 --> 00:28:27,213
He pulled her back
at the last second

332
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:29,312
just as the semi ploughed
into the vehicle.

333
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:31,111
The passengers inside
the SUV...

334
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:34,110
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

335
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,108
In other news, a freak accident took
the life of a lotto winner.

336
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,107
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.

337
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:43,905
Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.

338
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:46,603
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today

339
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:49,302
while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.

340
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:51,101
He managed to make it out
of the building,

341
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:53,400
but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape

342
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,399
slipped and impaled him.

343
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,998
Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.

344
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:08,193
Come in.

345
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:11,591
Hey, buddy.

346
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,889
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

347
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:20,986
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist,
which I know you love.

348
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:24,584
Now, get some rest.

349
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,714
- Mum.
- Yeah?

350
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:33,913
You think those guys
were BSing us today?

351
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,712
Yeah.

352
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:38,111
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

353
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,109
Lights out.

354
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:41,616
At the request
of the patient,

355
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,715
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

356
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:46,114
such as: 'nail files,
pencils, pens,

357
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:49,112
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

358
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:51,811
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

359
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,909
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

360
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:58,008
paper clips, watches, money clip,
pocket knives,

361
00:31:58,308 --> 00:32:00,806
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone... '

362
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,105
You have a cell phone
on you?

363
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:06,104
'... poisons, pills,
medications.'

364
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,702
Great. And let me see
your nails.

365
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:11,401
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

366
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,400
Wait.

367
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,399
Is she dangerous
or something?

368
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,498
No, honey,
she expects you are.

369
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:23,195
No, no, no.

370
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:26,493
Get him off me.
Get him off me!

371
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,588
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

372
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,187
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

373
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:09,905
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

374
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:21,599
They told me you had something to do
with the crash on Route 23.

375
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,698
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

376
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:27,996
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

377
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:31,694
And I saved some people.

378
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:34,093
And now you think Death
is after you.

379
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:37,991
Nice work.

380
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:41,289
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

381
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:44,588
Anything else?

382
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:46,987
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

383
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:49,185
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

384
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:51,684
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

385
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:54,116
List? What list?

386
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:56,315
Death's list.

387
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:01,013
The survivors of Flight 180

388
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,412
died in the exact order

389
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:06,210
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

390
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,509
That was Death's original design.

391
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,507
The list.

392
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:15,006
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

393
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,805
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

394
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:18,904
You said someone else died
last night.

395
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:21,103
That means someone must
have intervened.

396
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:25,301
Officer Burke pulled me away
from the crash that killed my friends.

397
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,400
Congratulations.

398
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,098
You'll be the last to go.

399
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,697
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

400
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:34,496
it'll come back for you.

401
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:37,794
It always does.

402
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:40,893
This doesn't make sense.

403
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:45,191
You said that you die in
the order you're originally meant to.

404
00:34:45,491 --> 00:34:49,089
But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.

405
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,188
Wait.

406
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,586
Died last?

407
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:58,584
Backwards.

408
00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:00,716
Are you sure?

409
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:04,415
In my premonition

410
00:35:04,514 --> 00:35:06,414
that Nora woman
and her kid died.

411
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,512
Then Evan,
then me and my friends.

412
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,709
Why is this even
happening to me?

413
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:21,606
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

414
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:25,604
So, what am I
supposed to do?

415
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:27,603
Clear.

416
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:31,101
Watch out for the signs.

417
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,900
What?

418
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,298
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

419
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:41,096
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

420
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:45,894
The songs on the radio.

421
00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:48,892
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

422
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:51,191
Well, don't ignore it.

423
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,889
Recognising those signs usually means
the difference between life and death.

424
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:57,588
You got to help me.

425
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,287
I don't have
to do anything.

426
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:00,986
But you beat it.

427
00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:02,885
Take a look around.

428
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:04,884
What did I beat, Kimberly?

429
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,515
If you were smart, you'd save yourself
and just forget about the others.

430
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:13,113
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

431
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:15,412
My friends are dead.

432
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:17,411
That's how I can say that.

433
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,609
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

434
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,707
Get out.

435
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:28,206
Before you hurt me or yourself.

436
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:34,903
- Alright, you know what?
- What?

437
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:36,402
I think you're a coward.

438
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:38,201
You hide out in here
because you're

439
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:41,299
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

440
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,398
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

441
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:23,512
I tried calling you
last night,

442
00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:25,511
but your father said
you were sleeping.

443
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,410
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

444
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,708
I've been getting calls all morning from
everyone who was on the on-ramp.

445
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:32,907
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

446
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:36,205
Wait, so...
you believe all this Death stuff?

447
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:40,103
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

448
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,202
Until last year
when I was dispatched

449
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:44,601
to clean up one
of the Flight 180 survivors.

450
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:46,500
Clean up, I don't...

451
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:53,397
- Did you see that?
- See what?

452
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:55,995
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

453
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:57,994
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

454
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,893
If Clear's right
about the order,

455
00:38:00,093 --> 00:38:03,092
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

456
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:04,791
I'm not following you.

457
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,490
They're next
on Death's list.

458
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,089
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

459
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:58,697
The doctor's ready
for you, now.

460
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:00,696
If he gives me the gas

461
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:02,895
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

462
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:06,394
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.

463
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,788
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?

464
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:18,787
We missed you in here.

465
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:21,286
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.

466
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,985
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

467
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,916
Your mum says you've been
having some pain lately.

468
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,215
Not really.

469
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:57,401
I'm disappointed, Tim.

470
00:39:57,601 --> 00:39:58,901
Does your mum know
you've been smoking?

471
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:02,099
Uh-huh.
Ow.

472
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,298
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

473
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:07,496
Damn those pigeons.

474
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,895
How many times am I going to have to
replace those goddamn windows?

475
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:16,292
We can't do it, boss,
we can't do it!

476
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:18,991
This will only sting for a moment.

477
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,289
Open big.

478
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:22,989
Little bit wider.

479
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:24,988
Wider.

480
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,386
Okay.

481
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:30,785
Oh God.

482
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:32,684
How do they
expect me to...

483
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:35,316
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

484
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:37,715
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:39,714
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

486
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:44,411
You'll have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

487
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,409
What?!
I can't hear you!

488
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:51,608
Excuse me, what?!

489
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:55,706
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

490
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:58,504
Jean! Let me
get this started.

491
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:02,402
Tim, you'll be awake,
a little groggy,

492
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:04,601
but you're not going
to be able to move much.

493
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:32,187
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.

494
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:35,486
The cleaning lady said they're at
the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

495
00:41:39,284 --> 00:41:42,216
God damn it anyway.

496
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,711
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

497
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,609
Not again. Careful.

498
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,487
There we go.

499
00:42:48,016 --> 00:42:49,915
Jean,
how's Tim doing in there?

500
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:56,812
What did he say
about your tooth?

501
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:59,011
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.

502
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,810
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

503
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,108
What? Pigeons?

504
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,007
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

505
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:10,805
- No-oo!
- Tim!

506
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:12,104
Look out!

507
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:16,202
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

508
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:36,792
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

509
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:40,790
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.

510
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:02,112
This is really
happening again, isn't it?

511
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:06,410
I hoped we'd get there

512
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,409
and they'd be fine,

513
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:10,808
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

514
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:14,606
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

515
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:18,804
But we're all going to die,
aren't we?

516
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:25,201
I'm so scared.

517
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,099
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

518
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:32,897
but I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

519
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:43,092
A second one just died.

520
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,991
A 15-year-old kid.

521
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,189
I hope you're ready for this.

522
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,316
It's this way.

523
00:45:04,814 --> 00:45:07,113
How is this guy going
to help us anyway?

524
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:09,612
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

525
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:11,711
about Death
than he ever told us.

526
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:17,808
Shouldn't we knock first?

527
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:20,207
He probably already knows
we're coming.

528
00:46:07,616 --> 00:46:09,515
Hello, Clear.

529
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:17,311
I've been expecting you.

530
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:19,310
Oh my God.

531
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,608
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

532
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:26,807
Just a simple question and we'll leave you
alone with your new friend.

533
00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:30,505
Dead...

534
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:33,303
yet still fresh.

535
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:36,802
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

536
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,001
so if you happen to know
how to stop Death,

537
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
it would be really great
if you told us.

538
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,498
You can't cheat Death.

539
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:46,297
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

540
00:46:46,497 --> 00:46:49,295
You told me Death
has a distinct design.

541
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:52,594
But Alex and I cheated Death,
not once but dozens of times.

542
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:55,192
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

543
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:57,991
Such fire in you now.

544
00:46:58,091 --> 00:47:00,590
People are always
most alive

545
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,389
just before they die.

546
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:04,288
Don't you think?

547
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:22,512
Look, please...

548
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:32,107
if you know of anything
that could help us,

549
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,206
what harm could it do?

550
00:47:35,406 --> 00:47:38,704
Only new life
can defeat Death.

551
00:47:38,904 --> 00:47:41,003
What the hell
does that mean?

552
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:45,401
Some people say there's a balance
to everything.

553
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,299
For every life
there's a death,

554
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:50,698
and for every death
there is a life.

555
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:53,497
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

556
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:55,995
that can
invalidate the list,

557
00:47:56,095 --> 00:47:59,294
force Death
to start anew.

558
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,788
You have to follow
the signs...

559
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:11,688
Kimberly.

560
00:48:13,986 --> 00:48:15,885
How do you know my name?

561
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:32,211
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.

562
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:35,309
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?

563
00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:37,308
Where did you
find that guy?

564
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:39,107
I thought he was supposed
to help us,

565
00:48:39,307 --> 00:48:40,706
not freak us out.

566
00:48:45,904 --> 00:48:47,503
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

567
00:48:49,602 --> 00:48:52,800
I'm thinking suck on my junk,
bee-atch.

568
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,699
Little punk.

569
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:08,592
What is it?

570
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:11,091
What did you see?

571
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:26,683
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

572
00:49:26,817 --> 00:49:28,916
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

573
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:31,115
What did you see?!

574
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:36,112
I was driving a white van.

575
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:38,511
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

576
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:40,410
because I crashed
into a lake.

577
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,709
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

578
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:45,707
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

579
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:50,605
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

580
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:53,403
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

581
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:56,702
He said only new life
can defeat death.

582
00:49:58,401 --> 00:49:59,900
If she gives birth
to a baby

583
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,899
that would've died
in that car crash...

584
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,598
a brand new soul that was never part
of Death's design...

585
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:06,297
It throws the whole list
out of whack

586
00:50:06,397 --> 00:50:08,496
and we start over
with a clean slate.

587
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:11,594
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?

588
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:13,793
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

589
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:15,392
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

590
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:19,390
We have to warn her about the lake
so she can stay alive to have the baby.

591
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,689
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

592
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,388
There could be thousands
of white vans in the state.

593
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,787
Hey!

594
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:28,686
I'm a cop, remember?

595
00:50:32,184 --> 00:50:33,717
Wait, that's it.

596
00:50:36,815 --> 00:50:38,514
Got it.

597
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,112
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.

598
00:50:43,212 --> 00:50:45,211
Here we go.

599
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:47,110
The vehicle
is a delivery van

600
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,609
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

601
00:50:51,008 --> 00:50:53,107
We should pick them up
pretty quickly.

602
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:55,006
Come on, let's get
to the meeting.

603
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:11,498
Hey, hold the door!

604
00:51:12,997 --> 00:51:14,896
Hey, let go of my shoe!

605
00:51:15,096 --> 00:51:16,795
Give me my shoe!

606
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:25,691
I wrote to management two weeks ago
about these friggin' bumpers.

607
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,888
Is that dogshit, dude?

608
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:34,786
Eww.

609
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:42,216
Oh, you got something
on your...

610
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:48,512
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

611
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:51,611
No, it's alright.

612
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,709
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

613
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:01,006
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.

614
00:52:03,105 --> 00:52:04,804
What?

615
00:52:06,204 --> 00:52:08,003
Hey, man,
how you doing?

616
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:10,202
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

617
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:13,900
Okay, keep checking.

618
00:52:24,095 --> 00:52:25,894
Does anybody have a Valium?

619
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:27,893
Oh, yeah.

620
00:52:27,993 --> 00:52:29,592
Here.

621
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,091
You're just going to want to take
half of that.

622
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:33,790
Keep 'em coming.

623
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:38,188
If what you're saying is true,

624
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,887
that means I'm next.

625
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:42,386
This is crazy, people, come on.

626
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:44,584
First Death
is stalking us,

627
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:47,117
and now premonitions?
What?

628
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:48,916
You're not next, Nora.

629
00:52:49,116 --> 00:52:52,214
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

630
00:52:52,414 --> 00:52:55,412
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

631
00:52:55,712 --> 00:52:57,211
This cannot be happening.

632
00:52:57,311 --> 00:52:59,011
See, because my career
is at a peak

633
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,110
and I finally met
a quality guy.

634
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:02,809
I just bought a house.

635
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:05,008
Maybe if you shut the fuck up,
you'll live.

636
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:08,306
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

637
00:53:08,506 --> 00:53:11,105
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

638
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:12,804
you have a fighting chance.

639
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:16,302
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...

640
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:18,701
Get to a high-rise fast.

641
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,798
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

642
00:53:23,998 --> 00:53:25,897
Get it?

643
00:53:28,796 --> 00:53:31,294
Okay, you guys, listen...

644
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:33,493
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

645
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:35,292
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

646
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:37,191
of seeing signs
to some extent.

647
00:53:37,391 --> 00:53:38,991
Okay, okay, look.

648
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,590
I gotta call bullshit.

649
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,289
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

650
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:44,388
to all your theories
and all your stories,

651
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,487
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

652
00:53:46,687 --> 00:53:48,286
Call it what you want!

653
00:53:48,386 --> 00:53:51,085
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!

654
00:53:51,384 --> 00:53:53,183
Has been all day.

655
00:53:54,516 --> 00:53:56,715
There is nobody after us
but you,

656
00:53:56,915 --> 00:53:59,014
trying to make us all crazy.

657
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:15,006
I should have seen that coming.

658
00:54:15,006 --> 00:54:16,505
Yeah.

659
00:54:16,705 --> 00:54:18,804
If Death is out to get you,

660
00:54:19,004 --> 00:54:21,003
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

661
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,202
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

662
00:54:23,402 --> 00:54:25,401
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

663
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,000
Sleep in shifts.

664
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,399
We need to safe-proof
this death-trap.

665
00:54:38,994 --> 00:54:40,993
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

666
00:54:41,193 --> 00:54:43,092
Are you kidding me?

667
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:46,290
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.

668
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:50,488
Ohh!

669
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,787
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

670
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:55,486
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

671
00:54:55,686 --> 00:54:58,184
So, Nora's got
to bite it before me anyhow, huh?

672
00:54:58,384 --> 00:55:01,216
Oh, you people have
no sense of humour.

673
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:10,312
Nora, you okay?

674
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:14,609
Four years ago
my husband died.

675
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:17,808
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

676
00:55:18,008 --> 00:55:19,807
Don't say that, okay?

677
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:22,406
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

678
00:55:22,605 --> 00:55:25,104
with my family,
I can accept that.

679
00:55:25,304 --> 00:55:28,902
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

680
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:31,001
If we just stick
together long enough

681
00:55:31,101 --> 00:55:32,600
for her
to have her baby...

682
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,199
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

683
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:38,098
Nora.

684
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:42,695
What do you think
you're doing?

685
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:45,294
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

686
00:55:45,494 --> 00:55:47,293
Look, look.

687
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:49,392
I control my life, alright?

688
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:52,391
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.

689
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,889
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

690
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:58,487
Whatever. You may be able
to scare these people,

691
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:00,986
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.

692
00:56:01,186 --> 00:56:02,685
- Hey.
- What?

693
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:05,684
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

694
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:18,711
I'm just going
to put this in the...

695
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,509
closet.

696
00:56:50,995 --> 00:56:52,794
Sorry.

697
00:57:09,285 --> 00:57:11,085
Whoa.

698
00:57:21,213 --> 00:57:23,112
Man with hooks?

699
00:57:24,411 --> 00:57:26,110
Man with hooks.

700
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,609
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

701
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:31,907
Is that...

702
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:35,406
- a sign?
- Oh my God.

703
00:57:35,506 --> 00:57:37,005
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

704
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:38,604
- The phone.
- Shit.

705
00:57:59,794 --> 00:58:01,593
What the fuck?

706
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:13,687
- Hello?
- Nora!

707
00:58:13,886 --> 00:58:16,685
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

708
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,384
Officer Burke,
I can't...

709
00:58:19,584 --> 00:58:21,216
I can't hear you!
What?!

710
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:22,515
What does he...
What?!

711
00:58:22,715 --> 00:58:24,714
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

712
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:26,314
- What, what?
- Oh...

713
00:58:26,414 --> 00:58:28,013
What is it, Nora?

714
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:32,111
No!

715
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:34,509
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

716
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:36,409
Wait, wait, Nora!

717
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:38,408
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

718
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:39,907
Let me help!

719
00:58:40,107 --> 00:58:41,406
Let me go!

720
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:50,901
Let go of me!

721
00:58:57,898 --> 00:58:59,697
Kat!

722
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:12,890
Help me!

723
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,389
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

724
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,315
Aah!
Let me out of here.

725
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:34,413
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

726
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,411
Isabella's being held at
the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.

727
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:39,710
I'm in control of my life!

728
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,009
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?

729
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:44,108
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

730
00:59:44,308 --> 00:59:46,907
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.

731
00:59:47,107 --> 00:59:49,305
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

732
00:59:49,505 --> 00:59:52,204
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

733
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:54,903
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

734
00:59:55,103 --> 00:59:57,002
Alright, give me
the gun, Eugene.

735
00:59:57,102 --> 00:59:59,200
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

736
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,399
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

737
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,598
You just got
to calm down, man.

738
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:06,497
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

739
01:00:06,597 --> 01:00:09,395
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

740
01:00:09,695 --> 01:00:11,694
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

741
01:00:11,794 --> 01:00:14,393
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

742
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:16,392
You hear me!

743
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:19,290
God!

744
01:00:28,286 --> 01:00:30,185
Oh!

745
01:00:30,385 --> 01:00:31,684
You don't keep it loaded?

746
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:35,815
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

747
01:00:37,315 --> 01:00:39,214
Never.
That's impossible.

748
01:00:39,314 --> 01:00:41,513
It wasn't his turn to die.

749
01:00:43,112 --> 01:00:45,611
Can we find
the pregnant woman, now, please?

750
01:00:52,907 --> 01:00:54,906
Is this safe, guys?

751
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:57,405
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

752
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:00,003
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

753
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:01,902
Or her?

754
01:01:03,402 --> 01:01:05,001
Hopefully her.

755
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,099
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

756
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:10,798
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

757
01:01:12,097 --> 01:01:14,196
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

758
01:01:14,396 --> 01:01:17,095
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

759
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,390
Look at me.

760
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:28,489
Come on.

761
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:30,588
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

762
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:33,087
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

763
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:35,086
Look, hopefully
the district judge

764
01:01:35,286 --> 01:01:38,084
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

765
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:46,713
Marcus.

766
01:01:46,813 --> 01:01:49,212
Marcus, Marcus.

767
01:01:49,412 --> 01:01:51,611
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...

768
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,508
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

769
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,607
My water just broke.

770
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,606
- What?
- My water, it just broke.

771
01:02:00,806 --> 01:02:03,405
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

772
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:06,404
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

773
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:09,502
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

774
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:12,900
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

775
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,699
Get me to the hospital!

776
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:16,698
Okay, okay!

777
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:19,797
Sheriff Perry,
this is Deputy Adams, come back.

778
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,595
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

779
01:02:23,895 --> 01:02:25,994
My van! My van!
Take my van!

780
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:29,892
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:30,092 --> 01:02:32,091
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

782
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:34,190
Yeah, we'll go.

783
01:02:37,888 --> 01:02:39,587
Come on,
come on!

784
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,783
Y'all want to hear
something crazy?

785
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:49,016
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.

786
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:54,513
A kid came to school
with a knife...

787
01:02:54,613 --> 01:02:56,412
killed his teacher.

788
01:02:58,311 --> 01:03:00,410
Teacher would have
been me,

789
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,108
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

790
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:06,307
That's fucking weird, man.

791
01:03:06,507 --> 01:03:07,706
You want weird?

792
01:03:07,906 --> 01:03:09,905
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

793
01:03:10,005 --> 01:03:12,004
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

794
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:14,303
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

795
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:18,601
He died that night
in a shootout.

796
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,799
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

797
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,798
I'd be dead, too.

798
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:26,997
Oh my God.

799
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:28,896
I'm sorry.

800
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,595
It's just I got one, too.

801
01:03:30,795 --> 01:03:32,894
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay

802
01:03:32,994 --> 01:03:35,592
at this cheesy little
bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

803
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:38,591
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak
that no one knows about,

804
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,090
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

805
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:42,489
So what happened?

806
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:44,188
I don't know.
I never made it.

807
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:46,987
The bus I was on splattered
some girl all over the road.

808
01:03:47,186 --> 01:03:48,486
Was that in Mt Abraham?

809
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:51,884
Yes. How did you know?

810
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:54,716
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.

811
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:58,314
She was supposed to die
on Flight 180.

812
01:04:01,513 --> 01:04:04,311
Hey, do you guys remember
that theatre in Paris

813
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:07,110
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

814
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:11,308
Well, I had tickets to go.

815
01:04:11,508 --> 01:04:13,807
But one night I'm in Paris

816
01:04:14,006 --> 01:04:17,105
and I'm just
tripping on acid

817
01:04:17,305 --> 01:04:19,404
and sipping lattes and such.

818
01:04:19,604 --> 01:04:21,403
And then all of a sudden

819
01:04:21,603 --> 01:04:24,601
this dude out of nowhere

820
01:04:24,801 --> 01:04:27,100
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

821
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,898
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

822
01:04:30,098 --> 01:04:32,597
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

823
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:35,596
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

824
01:04:35,796 --> 01:04:38,594
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

825
01:04:38,794 --> 01:04:40,293
that saved my life...

826
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:42,692
that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

827
01:04:42,992 --> 01:04:45,391
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

828
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:48,789
The people who got off
of Flight 180.

829
01:04:50,588 --> 01:04:52,687
They were my friends.

830
01:04:56,185 --> 01:04:58,384
Kimberly,
tell us what happened.

831
01:05:01,716 --> 01:05:04,714
About a year ago my mum and I
were at the mall.

832
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:06,813
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

833
01:05:06,913 --> 01:05:09,312
but I got caught up watching
this news report

834
01:05:09,512 --> 01:05:11,311
about some kid
that committed suicide.

835
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,609
I kept thinking,

836
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:17,108
'How can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

837
01:05:17,308 --> 01:05:19,007
That's stupid.'

838
01:05:21,706 --> 01:05:23,605
It felt wrong.

839
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:25,504
And yet...

840
01:05:28,502 --> 01:05:31,701
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

841
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,399
Some kids were trying
to steal my mum's car.

842
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:39,097
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

843
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:41,296
and they killed her.

844
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:46,394
After the funeral I kept thinking that
it should have been me.

845
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:49,992
I guess everyone must
think that.

846
01:05:51,691 --> 01:05:53,690
But I guess I was right.

847
01:06:02,885 --> 01:06:05,784
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!

848
01:06:06,084 --> 01:06:07,816
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

849
01:06:10,015 --> 01:06:12,014
When we got off
Flight 180,

850
01:06:12,214 --> 01:06:15,013
it didn't just change
our lives.

851
01:06:15,212 --> 01:06:17,511
It affected everyone
and everything

852
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,810
we've come
into contact with since.

853
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,909
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

854
01:06:22,109 --> 01:06:24,408
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

855
01:06:24,608 --> 01:06:26,507
it caused an outward ripple.

856
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:28,506
A rift in Death's design.

857
01:06:28,706 --> 01:06:31,604
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

858
01:06:33,203 --> 01:06:35,302
we wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

859
01:06:35,502 --> 01:06:37,901
Yes, that's why Death
is working backwards!

860
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:40,100
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

861
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,499
Sealing the rift once
and for all.

862
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:05,887
Oh, shit!

863
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:09,585
Jesus Christ!

864
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:14,216
Hang on! Hang on!

865
01:07:34,406 --> 01:07:36,605
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.

866
01:07:39,104 --> 01:07:40,703
God, Eugene!

867
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:43,802
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

868
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,499
No, please.

869
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:51,298
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

870
01:07:51,498 --> 01:07:53,597
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

871
01:07:55,296 --> 01:07:57,994
Those people can help.
Let's go.

872
01:07:59,694 --> 01:08:01,992
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

873
01:08:02,192 --> 01:08:04,191
off 9-A
at the 180 mile-marker.

874
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:06,090
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

875
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:09,189
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

876
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:11,987
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

877
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:16,685
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

878
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:18,984
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

879
01:08:19,084 --> 01:08:21,616
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

880
01:08:26,813 --> 01:08:29,012
Stay with us.

881
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:30,511
Hey, hey you!

882
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:34,509
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

883
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:38,108
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

884
01:08:39,108 --> 01:08:49,108
