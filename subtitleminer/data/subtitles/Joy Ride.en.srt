00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:13,808
Hello?

2
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:25,483
Feeling's right, because for the first time,
I see myself through somebody else's eyes.

3
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,842
It was completely claustrophobic.

4
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,404
Big surprise.

5
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,242
Aren't we due for a hell of a downpour?

6
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:43,563
Hear they had a speed trap set up.

7
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:50,532
No one ever said
freshman year would go by so fast.

8
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:54,765
At least Colorado has seasons.
Berkeley is like summer all year.

9
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,051
Am I keeping you on the phone?

10
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:02,923
No, not at all.
So, what's David doing this summer?

11
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:05,131
-I don't know. Who cares?
-What?

12
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:11,245
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
I just felt a little strange.

13
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,963
What? I don't understand.

14
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:15,567
We broke up.

15
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,242
He's been acting serious and weird.

16
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:23,082
How? He was getting serious and weird?

17
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,964
I told you what he was like.

18
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,651
Lewis, it's 3:00 a.m.
I've got a final tomorrow.

19
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:33,804
I'm sorry. I'll be quieter.

20
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:40,641
Lewis?

21
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,607
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:46,285
So what happened?

23
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,969
He kept looking at me as if, you know...

24
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:54,446
...he totally thought he knew me,
which he so obviously didn't.

25
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:57,882
Then he started crying, which...

26
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,406
...sealed the deal.

27
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,406
You made him cry.

28
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,929
I broke up with him. Wouldn't you cry?

29
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,683
Listen, you're cute,
but you're not that cute.

30
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,844
I was kidding.

31
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,163
Well, I'm not in the mood to go home.

32
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:19,165
I wish I had a car,
then I could just get there gradually...

33
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,323
...and decompress a little bit, you know?

34
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:25,011
If you had a car,
you could stop by Colorado...

35
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,606
...and pick me up.

36
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,366
We'd have an adventure.
The two of us and a windshield.

37
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,208
I have a car.

38
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:33,408
No, you don't.

39
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,245
Yeah. Didn't I tell you?

40
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:36,767
No.

41
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:38,286
Well, I got one.

42
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,365
-Sexy choice.
-Yeah?

43
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:56,527
Yeah. Vintage 1971, Chrysler Newport.

44
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:16,045
I changed plans. I'm no longer flying back.
I bought a car so I'm driving.

45
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,726
By yourself?.

46
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:21,169
No. Actually,
I was thinking about picking up Venna.

47
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:24,688
Mom?

48
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,928
Sorry. Sorry. That's great, Lewis.

49
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:30,892
What's the matter?

50
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,970
Your brother just called.

51
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,687
He was arrested again.
Drunk and disorderly.

52
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:37,645
Where? ln San Diego?

53
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,247
Salt Lake City.

54
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:44,212
Don't worry. It's not your problem.

55
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,607
What did Dad say?

56
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:49,651
You know your dad.
He didn't even want to talk to Fuller.

57
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:52,805
He said if he hasn't grown up yet,
it's never going to happen.

58
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,767
Fuller.

59
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,446
I know.

60
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:58,884
I miss him, too.

61
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:27,487
-Listen, before you start writing anything--
-License, please. Registration.

62
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:31,327
My brother's in jail.
I haven't seen him in almost five years.

63
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:35,008
I'm driving 200 miles out of my way
to help him out.

64
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:38,608
So that U-turn was based
on a whole good-deed scenario.

65
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:42,049
I'm also writing you up
for a broken taillight.

66
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:44,125
I have one of those?

67
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:51,087
I'm aware of how frustrating
the prison system in this country is.

68
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,483
Repeat offenders, the un-rehabilitated.

69
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:58,522
I watch American Justice with Bill Kurtis.
But I'm different.

70
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:01,173
I'm reformed. You know, I'm strong.

71
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,530
Officer Wilkins, this is my pledge to you.

72
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:10,607
You will not be seeing me again.
Two strikes are enough for Fuller Thomas.

73
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:22,768
You look...

74
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:25,404
...tall. Taller than me.

75
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,086
How's it going?

76
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:31,245
A lot better now.

77
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:38,643
Kid. Goddamn.

78
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,892
You came all the way to Salt Lake
just for me?

79
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:44,248
Technically, you are still my brother.

80
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,525
Hey, this is my brother.

81
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:52,727
-Look at you, man.
-Mr. Thomas?

82
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:55,083
-Thank you for coming.
-You're welcome.

83
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,084
-Thank you.
-Sign out, please.

84
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,401
You're welcome.

85
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,243
Listen, I'm supposed to pick up a friend...

86
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,764
...and I'm running kind of late.

87
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:12,292
I just wanted to see how you were doing...

88
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:16,048
...and take you where you need to go
because I need to hit the road.

89
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:17,852
Where are you going?

90
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:21,170
Boulder, Colorado. Then I'm going home.

91
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:25,442
-Perfect. That's great.
-What?

92
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:31,484
You know, with the exception
of the seat spring piercing my ass...

93
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:33,768
...this ride is excellent.

94
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,051
So, who are you picking up?

95
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,246
-Venna. She's a friend from back home.
-Wait, the blinker?

96
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,403
That girl from the Heights?
The one who...

97
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,248
...all day long?

98
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:50,362
-No, you haven't seen her in years.
-You're fucking her?

99
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,849
What question is more legit than that?

100
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,322
Look, we're just friends, okay?

101
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:03,372
Okay, you're not fucking her.
But you want to.

102
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,685
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-I don't?

103
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:09,531
All right, here's how it is.

104
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:14,048
She's always dated guys
from the right side of the burbs.

105
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,292
You get your scholarship to Berkeley.
She's off to the University of Colorado.

106
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,806
You don't understand.

107
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:22,202
You guys have been talking
on the phone a lot.

108
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,330
She realizes you have
the warm fuzzies for each other.

109
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:29,805
You're not letting on, even though
you scrambled and bought this car...

110
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:34,604
...just to pick her up. You're still playing
the neutered boyfriend...

111
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,571
...who's always there for her
because you're nice.

112
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:49,332
So, you're still good?
Do you need me to drive?

113
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:55,771
No more bullshit small talk about me,
my relationships, or my car.

114
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,648
Okay.

115
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:16,051
I swear,
I'm barely slowing the car in Denver.

116
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:19,330
I'll give him a seven-mile-an-hour
chance to jump and roll.

117
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:23,088
You did your mom a big favor
and she's happy now.

118
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,688
This time tomorrow,
you'll be here with me...

119
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,923
...and you'll have a new level of stress.

120
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:32,449
Well, I'm going to get going.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

121
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,125
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

122
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:36,082
'Bye.

123
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,127
Downsizing?

124
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,685
The gas company just...

125
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,689
...lets a talented man like you go?
Just like that?

126
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,371
That sucks, man. But this job kicks ass.

127
00:09:56,693 --> 00:10:01,323
You got your trailer. You're working kind
of outside. You got a view.

128
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:10,206
-What is this?
-CB radio. Olive branch.

129
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:13,490
-Check it out.
-You put a hole in my car.

130
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,202
I talked him down to $40.

131
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:22,366
Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9.
We need a westbound, come on.

132
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:26,287
You got Black Sheep here
riding front door with...

133
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:28,652
...Mama's Boy.

134
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:32,368
We're on l-80, east.
Just wondering if you could see...

135
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,523
...any bears from your rocking chair.

136
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,491
You got a 40-mile clear shot,
except for James Town.

137
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:40,691
You got yourself a Kojak
with a Kodak at 185.

138
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:42,765
No cops till James Town.

139
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:47,644
You're free to speed like a motherfucker
for the next 40 miles or so.

140
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:56,843
Aren't we due for a hell of a downpour?
We got a 200-mile slipper-slide. Come on.

141
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:00,688
Doesn't matter.
Not from this rocking chair.

142
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:03,243
Some people like it when it rains.

143
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:07,691
It's going to rain hard tonight.
Keeps everybody inside.

144
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,252
What's with this guy?

145
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:15,644
Howdy! You got Black Sheep here
with Mama's Boy. Who we got? Over.

146
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,201
Can I please get a better handle
than Mama's Boy?

147
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,408
No.

148
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,763
Yo, Rainman, what's your 20?

149
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:26,327
Can you do a woman's voice?

150
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:29,281
-What?
-Do a girl? Say...

151
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,613
..."Black Sheep, this is Miss...."

152
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,208
No.

153
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:38,287
Come on, man.
You did a girl when we pranked....

154
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:39,966
Mr. Schramm.

155
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:44,851
-That was good.
-I was nine. That's what I sounded like.

156
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:47,812
This is like a prehistoric lnternet.

157
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:51,728
You fuck with someone in a chat room.
It's the same thing.

158
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:53,327
Forget it.

159
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:54,927
Come on, man.

160
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:00,846
Say, "Hey, Black Sheep,
this is Candy Cane."

161
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:04,524
Just say it. You'll be amazing.

162
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,289
Black Sheep, this is Candy Cane.
I've been looking for you all day.

163
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:14,285
That was horrible.

164
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:19,408
Candy Cane, this is Black Sheep.
I'm right on schedule.

165
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:23,248
Say, "I'll see you later on tonight, honey."
Go, go.

166
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,570
I guess I'll be seeing you later on tonight.
Is that right?

167
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:30,688
You got it.

168
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:34,686
I'm pulling over right now.
I'll see your beautiful ass in the p.m.

169
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,683
-What was that about?
-Just wait.

170
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,565
Candy Cane, come on.

171
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:49,048
I knew it. These guys are so fucking horny.
Get him going. Get him all worked up.

172
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:53,331
Then in the middle of it,
say, "Guess what? I'm a dude."

173
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:58,242
-No way! I can't do that.
-Come on, man! Come on!

174
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:01,684
It'll be fun.
Come on. Just do it.

175
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:09,604
Hey, there. Who's this?

176
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,449
-Rusty Nail.
-Nice, nice.

177
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:21,730
Well, Rusty Nail,
I hope you're doing better than I am.

178
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,281
This drive seems like it's taking forever.

179
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:27,405
Roger that, Candy Cane.

180
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,963
You got him. You got him.

181
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:35,723
It's easier sometimes if I pretend
the person I'm talking to is next to me.

182
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:42,607
Pretend I'm sitting there with you.
Just the two of us and the windshield.

183
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:44,848
All right.

184
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:48,051
Go, go. Tell him what you look like.

185
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:52,847
So, I'm 5'10". I got dirty blonde hair
down to my shoulders.

186
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:57,644
-I got blue eyes and really soft skin.
-This is turning me on.

187
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:01,012
If I were there, Rusty Nail,
you know what I'd do?

188
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:03,727
Tell me.

189
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:07,283
-Awesome!
-I'd make you feel good.

190
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:09,602
You would?

191
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:13,126
If I asked you,
would you unbutton my blouse?

192
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,041
Sure.

193
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:20,046
Then I'd take it off. So, now what?
What do you want to do to me?

194
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:25,729
-I've never really done this before.
-This is so classic.

195
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:28,683
I'd take off your bra.

196
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:31,732
Okay. You take that off.

197
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:39,250
No, no, no. We can't lose this guy. Go.

198
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:41,643
I couldn't hear that, Rusty Nail.

199
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:45,645
Rusty Nail? Sweetheart?

200
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,892
That was almost so good! Damn.

201
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,771
-Did we lose him?
-Yeah.

202
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:54,127
Shit.

203
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:58,371
You're a gifted CB prank caller,
when you commit to it.

204
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,651
"I'd take off your bra."

205
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,652
Don't park in a handicapped space.

206
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:28,203
There are spaces all over the place.

207
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,125
Yeah, I know. That's my point.

208
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:33,410
Dude, I'm going to gimp it.
I'm not just going to run in there.

209
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:36,203
Sit here. I'll work us a deal, okay?

210
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:49,442
If one more goddamn maid
knocks on my door, asking about towels....

211
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,650
-I'm sorry, Mr. Ellinghouse.
-Sorry, my ass!

212
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:56,328
Where's your boss?
I want the real manager. The white one!

213
00:15:56,533 --> 00:16:00,526
The one whose first language
is fucking English! Understand?

214
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:03,969
Could I get a room for the night?
You can disturb me. I love towels.

215
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,522
-I'm not done here, friend!
-I know that, amigo.

216
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:09,446
I haven't slept in two days.
You best not mess with me.

217
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,093
-Just take care of your own shit.
-Peace.

218
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:14,892
Tomorrow morning,
mark my words, asshole...

219
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,242
...long talk with your manager.

220
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,884
And your brown ass is going.

221
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,927
Fucking punk.

222
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,607
Dick.

223
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:42,242
Candy Cane.

224
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:46,926
Candy Cane.

225
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,166
Hello? Candy Cane?

226
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:58,445
-God! Did you see that fat fucking guy?
-Listen.

227
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,005
Hello, Candy Cane, are you there?

228
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,530
-You are kidding me.
-Can you believe that?

229
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:08,725
-Have you talked to him yet?
-No. I haven't said anything.

230
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:13,971
Anybody out there know Candy Cane?
Come on.

231
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:21,086
-What?
-Tell him you want to meet, get together.

232
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,485
You want to see him later
at the Lone Star Motel in Table Rock.

233
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:27,405
Room 17.

234
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:31,646
-Do you love prison so much?
-We're in Room 18. You saw that prick.

235
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,486
-The giant?
-The prick is in Room 17!

236
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:36,972
I can't do that.

237
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:41,168
Come on. That guy sucks!
He body-checked me on the way out.

238
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,925
I know. I saw that.

239
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:44,766
What? You saw that?

240
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:49,881
And you're not jumping at this opportunity
to exact some much deserved revenge?

241
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,522
Are you crazy? Come on!

242
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:53,968
-Do it!
-Calm down.

243
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,327
This is amazing!

244
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,449
Rusty Nail? Hey, there.

245
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:12,846
Candy Cane? I thought I'd lost you.

246
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:17,566
Well, I guess fate wouldn't allow that.
I'm glad to know you're thinking about me.

247
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,363
Listen, I'm pulling over for the night.

248
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:23,687
Would you be interested
in getting together later?

249
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,849
Aren't you meeting Black Sheep?

250
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,404
That was the plan but...

251
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,611
...how about I blow him off
and take a chance with you?

252
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:38,290
I love you, man. That is so great.

253
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:39,887
Relax.

254
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:43,206
But, I'm not sure I'd be what you'd expect.

255
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:51,883
You are a man, aren't you? With a soul
and a heart? That's all I'd expect.

256
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:53,648
Great.

257
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:02,763
Listen, I'll be at the Lone Star Motel
in Table Rock, if you're interested.

258
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:07,566
Pink champagne.
Tell him that you like pink champagne.

259
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:13,569
If you could bring some pink champagne,
it's my favorite.

260
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:16,767
That was good.

261
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,248
What room?

262
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:21,487
Sweet.

263
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,486
Room 17. Midnight. You got that, baby?

264
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,246
I got it.

265
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:29,485
I can't wait.

266
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,646
That was mean.

267
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,565
I know, I know.

268
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,566
This is awesome!

269
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:41,646
That guy sucks. He totally
body-checked me on the way out.

270
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,922
-Do you ever miss home?
-Yeah.

271
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:50,090
I miss Mom's chocolate chip cookies.

272
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:54,492
Playing football with Dad on Sundays.

273
00:19:56,493 --> 00:20:00,406
Going to....
Wait, that's somebody else's childhood.

274
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,723
What I meant was, "No."

275
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:09,767
You should call sometimes,
when you don't need bail money.

276
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:11,845
How often is that?

277
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,722
-I'm serious.
-I call.

278
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:18,651
I know what he says every time
he hangs up.

279
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,531
That I'm the world's biggest loser.

280
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,922
And that's coming from a plumber.

281
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:30,127
That's coming from a guy who wears
a lime-green jumpsuit to work every day.

282
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,613
They don't need me. I don't need them.

283
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:36,571
It works like a charm
if you repeat it enough.

284
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,087
Listen.

285
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,163
Hit the TV.

286
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:00,212
It's Rusty Nail.

287
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:08,645
Who the hell is it?

288
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:11,851
I brought the drink.

289
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:17,931
This is so amazing.

290
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,892
I brought the pink champagne.

291
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:26,403
Is this a goddamn joke?

292
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:30,083
I swear to fucking God.

293
00:21:55,693 --> 00:22:00,164
-What, are you fucking with me?
-This prick is such an asshole.

294
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:26,887
That was weird.

295
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:32,646
You know what I think?
I think someone might have gotten hurt.

296
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,332
No. We would have heard that.

297
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:41,448
We did. There was a gasp.
What if that Rusty Nail guy got hurt?

298
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:45,891
That wasn't a gasp. That was a laugh.

299
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:55,604
Where are you going?
Are you calling Mom?

300
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,805
Hi. We just...

301
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:02,602
...heard some disturbance
in the room next door, Room 17.

302
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:07,007
-This is the drama queen from Room 18.
-That's hard to say, like a thud.

303
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:10,723
We think someone might have been hurt.

304
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:13,931
We thought you'd want
to check that out, maybe.

305
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:16,406
All right. Thank you.

306
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:23,444
You know what's going to happen, now?
The prick's going to kill the night manager.

307
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:52,922
Hello?

308
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:58,566
All right. Thank you.

309
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:20,006
-The guy said everything's fine.
-What did I tell you?

310
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,802
-How are you today?
-Pretty good.

311
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:05,045
-Where are you boys from?
-Originally, New Jersey.

312
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,488
Why are you here?

313
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:10,566
We're driving cross-country.
My brother, Lewis.

314
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:13,612
-Where is he?
-In the room. I don't know.

315
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:18,085
We had a little incident here last night.
You hear any sounds? Anything odd?

316
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:20,324
Yeah, actually...

317
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,330
...next door, I heard some sounds.

318
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,007
-Next door?
-Yeah.

319
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:30,402
-Could you describe those sounds?
-Yeah, sure. They were like....

320
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:37,008
No, wait.

321
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:40,968
Like that.

322
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,442
-What's going on?
-This is Lewis.

323
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,603
There was a situation last night.

324
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:49,686
After these sounds, did you look
out your window? Open your door?

325
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,286
-No, sir.
-What happened?

326
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:56,527
After you shut your door around 10:15 pm,
you saw no one until I came this morning?

327
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:57,489
Right.

328
00:25:57,853 --> 00:26:02,608
But we did call the night manager
because we were concerned. Right?

329
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,645
Yeah, he mentioned that.

330
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:08,648
He also said one of you had an altercation
with the victim.

331
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:12,649
-Which of you was that?
-Wait. The night manager said what?

332
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:16,567
Apparently, one of you had words
with the victim when you checked in.

333
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:18,405
No. We never met.

334
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:22,887
-What?
-Ellinghouse.

335
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:25,487
He was staying in Room 17.

336
00:26:26,093 --> 00:26:28,971
The huge guy? Yeah, I met him.
But he's not--

337
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,691
What happened to him?

338
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:33,045
It wasn't comely.

339
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,484
I don't know what that means.

340
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:41,802
He was found early this morning
lying face down on the highway median.

341
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:47,290
So you're saying that the...

342
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:50,564
...the huge guy is the victim.

343
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:56,643
So you have no idea who might have
visited Mr. Ellinghouse's room last night?

344
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,172
No, sir.

345
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,690
I wish we could be more helpful, but....

346
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:06,241
-Is he dead?
-Coma.

347
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,332
Know what I'm thinking?

348
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,888
I think taking a little look-see
might refreshify your memory.

349
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:18,965
Taking a look-see at what?

350
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,245
Ripped his jaw...

351
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:40,647
...clean off.

352
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:51,931
That is the pain in my ass.

353
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:56,291
My own personal file of ongoing shit
I got to deal with.

354
00:27:56,493 --> 00:28:00,725
And now guess what?
Now, I got me another one.

355
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:04,886
Mr. Ronald Ellinghouse,
lying two inches from dead...

356
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:08,010
...in my jurisdiction. Why?

357
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:12,167
Because you sorry-ass punks thought
you'd have some fun.

358
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,325
Fuck!

359
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:18,008
I'd keep you retards in custody
if I thought it would help...

360
00:28:18,093 --> 00:28:22,166
...answer one of the hundreds
of new questions I got! But, no.

361
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:25,211
All you know is his damn CB handle...

362
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:27,682
...and maybe he drives a truck.

363
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:32,567
Do you understand the kinds of shit
I've got to grapple with now...

364
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:36,566
...because of what you assholes did? You!

365
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:39,850
You got out of jail when? Yesterday?

366
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,771
I want you out of here.

367
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:45,807
This is like an old-fashioned Western.

368
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:49,928
I want you out of Wyoming
before the sun goes down.

369
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:06,726
I can't believe you told him
we invited Rusty Nail back.

370
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:08,805
I could have been put back in jail.

371
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:12,806
-A man's half-dead because of what we did.
-Bullshit.

372
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:19,204
You order 10 pizzas for your neighbor.
A delivery guy gets there.

373
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:21,966
The neighbor opens up with an AK-47.
Is that your fault?

374
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:23,486
Yeah, maybe it is.

375
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:27,409
-Fine. Be the martyr all you want.
-That's not what I'm doing.

376
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:31,726
I'm trying to figure out how I can drive
away from here after what we've done.

377
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:33,726
Do what I do.

378
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:37,132
Just remind yourself that
in 100 years you'll be dead.

379
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:42,244
-That's as close to a philosophy as I have.
-I'm taking you to Denver and that's it.

380
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:43,848
Great.

381
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:21,283
Eastbound looking for a westbound
for a bear report.

382
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:26,682
Not a soul.
Never any smokeys on that stretch.

383
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,407
Candy Cane.

384
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:38,245
Candy Cane.

385
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:42,087
Hello?

386
00:30:44,013 --> 00:30:45,890
Candy Cane?

387
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:47,848
I'm asleep.

388
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,003
Hey, Candy Cane.

389
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:53,765
Candy Cane.

390
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,407
Jesus.

391
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:02,890
Anybody out there know Candy Cane?

392
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:05,127
Or Mama's Boy?

393
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,964
Black Sheep?

394
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:13,204
-What will you say?
-Hey, Russell.

395
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:16,171
This is Black Sheep. Go to 23.

396
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:20,485
Hey, Black Sheep.

397
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:26,482
Do you know where I can find Candy Cane?

398
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,325
What is your deal?

399
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,045
I mean, seriously.

400
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:39,212
I'm looking for Candy Cane.

401
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:46,568
So you've been driving around all day...

402
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,804
...looking for a voice.

403
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:55,049
I think that you can tell me
where to find her.

404
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:58,248
-Tell him it was a joke.
-I talked to her...

405
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,770
...about last night
and she said she's not interested.

406
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:06,010
-She's not interested in you--
-No, don't.

407
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:08,483
Or your pink champagne.

408
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:13,605
I need to find Candy Cane.

409
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:20,531
You need to find
a highly qualified psychiatrist.

410
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:23,810
Not a psychologist.
You're going to need some drugs.

411
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:27,926
And you need to find a lawyer,
because the cops are all over your ass.

412
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:30,083
-Goddamn.
-Give it to me.

413
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,683
Hey, there, Rusty Nail.

414
00:32:33,773 --> 00:32:37,607
That was me. All right? I'm a guy.
It was just a joke.

415
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,485
It was just a joke.

416
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:46,405
Apologize.

417
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:49,603
-Right.
-No, just do it.

418
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:53,764
-Apologize to him?
-Yeah, I'll do it.

419
00:32:58,093 --> 00:32:59,606
Listen, you sick fuck.

420
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:04,084
You pathetic, lonely,
walkie-talkie, freak show motherfucker!

421
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:06,084
You get nothing from me!
You know why?

422
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:10,325
I have something more powerful
than your psychosis: a volume knob.

423
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:14,884
All I need to do to make you go away
is to turn it counter-clockwise.

424
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,565
You got that? You copy that?

425
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:22,083
You know, Black Sheep,
you really ought to get that fixed.

426
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,925
Get what fixed?

427
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,290
Your taillight.

428
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:37,286
-See anything?
-Cars and trucks. Just drive. Just be cool.

429
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:38,567
Oh, my God.

430
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:44,092
-Did he follow us from the motel?
-I don't know.

431
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:46,403
-If we keep driving, we're safe.
-God.

432
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,608
Look.

433
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:52,329
-Come on!
-It's okay. I saw a sign.

434
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:56,646
Gas at Laramie. There'll be a phone there.
I'm going to call Sheriff Ritter.

435
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,201
Good. We'll turn off at Laramie.

436
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:04,410
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, just stay cool.

437
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:06,643
-Oh, shit.
-Be cool.

438
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:09,372
Stop telling me to be cool!
You're making me crazy.

439
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:10,568
Get the map.

440
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:15,210
-Fuck! We won't make it.
-There's a town at the next exit.

441
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:19,445
-How far is it?
-From my cuticle to my knuckle!

442
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:22,167
-Twelve miles!
-That may be too far.

443
00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:23,971
Take this exit here!

444
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,881
Yes! You're a genius.

445
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:47,691
-I'll pay, you pump. Or you want to pay?
-I'll pump.

446
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:21,606
Table Rock, please.

447
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:24,083
Rawlins County Sheriff Department.

448
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:19,447
Oh, my God.

449
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:31,651
Sheriff Ritter, please.

450
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:46,243
SheriffRitter is not available.

451
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:50,292
At the tone, record your message.
When you are finished recording...

452
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:53,690
...you may hang up
or press "1 " for more options.

453
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:55,765
Please wait for the tone.

454
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:13,205
You just got the gas?

455
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:35,731
Come on. Get in the car. Get in the car.
Come on.

456
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:37,882
Go, go!

457
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:40,486
-He's in there.
-That's him?

458
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:42,928
Keep driving! Keep driving!

459
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:46,647
Gas!

460
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:53,368
Oh, my God!

461
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,930
-Can you see the on-ramp?
-No.

462
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:00,888
Okay.

463
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:03,044
Damn it! The guy's coming after us.

464
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:05,647
-Don't panic! We've got a full tank of gas!
-Shit!

465
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:07,525
We must have missed the on-ramp!

466
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,410
Mailbox!

467
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,605
No, no!

468
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,488
Shit!

469
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:49,690
Lewis! Lewis!

470
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:53,927
-He said, "Lewis! "
-Stay the fuck back! We got a gun!

471
00:38:56,493 --> 00:38:58,484
And I got a MasterCard.

472
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,689
-Thanks, man. We thought--
-You really scared us, you know that?

473
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:17,607
It wasn't the moustache, was it?
My old lady wants me to shave the thing.

474
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:20,083
No, it wasn't the moustache, man.

475
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:25,362
-What is that thing? Your club.
-My tire thumper?

476
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:27,763
Shit. Just checking pressure.

477
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:31,646
Yeah, the pressure. The pressure thing.

478
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:36,447
-You boys okay to find the main road?
-We're fine, now that we're not murdered.

479
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,803
Thanks a lot, man. That was nice of you.

480
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,852
-You all have a good night.
-Sorry about that.

481
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,367
Fucking Fu Manchu.

482
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:52,363
I've never felt like more of a pussy
in my whole life.

483
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:56,727
Oh, my God.

484
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,843
What kind of range is there on a CB?

485
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:34,490
I don't know. Maybe five miles.

486
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:41,371
You know,
I think we should get to a phone...

487
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:45,481
...leave a message with Table Rock cops
that Rusty Nail's in the area.

488
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:49,205
What the hell is that?

489
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:08,569
Go!

490
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:13,445
Go! Go!

491
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:21,366
He's right on us!

492
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,691
Man, he's right on our ass!

493
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:42,645
-Don't use that!
-91 1 !

494
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:45,282
We need some help, please!
ls anyone out there?

495
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:51,162
Goddamn it!

496
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:01,288
Come on!

497
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:19,963
Tree!

498
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:30,647
-You okay?
-Yeah.

499
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:33,843
I'm okay. Let's go.

500
00:42:36,573 --> 00:42:38,803
Come on, come on. Let's go.

501
00:42:41,613 --> 00:42:42,728
Shit.

502
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:45,526
We're not moving!

503
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:50,329
Come on! Shit! Come on!

504
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:58,163
Come on, come on! Go, go!

505
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,688
Go, go! Come on!

506
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:08,166
Go!

507
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:17,608
Oh, shit!

508
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:38,888
Come on! Don't kill us, man!
We apologize!

509
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:41,043
Please don't kill us, man!

510
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,889
We were just playing with you!

511
00:43:48,413 --> 00:43:49,687
Why?

512
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:52,248
Just...

513
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:54,530
...just for a laugh.

514
00:43:57,693 --> 00:43:58,762
A laugh?

515
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:03,206
Just for fun.

516
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:10,127
Well, I was just playing with you, man.

517
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:16,012
Where are you now?

518
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:21,203
Ten miles outside of Laramie. We had
some car trouble, so we'll be a little late.

519
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:22,886
That's all right.

520
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:27,764
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. It's just been a long drive.

521
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,888
They fixed the taillight.

522
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:58,008
So...

523
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:00,929
...why don't you just come home with me?

524
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:03,445
Blow off Denver.

525
00:46:03,773 --> 00:46:05,684
No, I'm okay.

526
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,567
Listen, I don't want
to tell Venna what happened.

527
00:46:12,173 --> 00:46:14,767
I don't want to ruin things.
Freak her out, you know.

528
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,162
Hey.

529
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,331
The color's not that great,
but it's a big car.

530
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:51,642
I love it.

531
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:54,772
When did you get it?

532
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:58,249
-I've had it for a while.
-Doesn't look too beat up.

533
00:46:58,493 --> 00:47:01,371
Actually,
I think the dents add some character.

534
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,002
Actually, I was talking about Fuller.

535
00:47:04,813 --> 00:47:06,565
-Hey.
-Hey.

536
00:47:06,653 --> 00:47:08,723
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

537
00:47:10,173 --> 00:47:12,004
Well, have you named it yet?

538
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:16,125
We were thinking either Tad...

539
00:47:16,973 --> 00:47:19,248
...or Lewis' Shitty Newport.

540
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:25,482
She's hot.

541
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:31,252
Have a good summer, Vee.

542
00:47:32,253 --> 00:47:35,290
This is my friend Charlotte.
She'll be my roommate next year.

543
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:37,683
These are the infamous Thomas boys.

544
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,570
-Lewis, right?
-Yeah, hi.

545
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:41,846
Nice to finally meet you.

546
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:45,482
Look, I'm Fuller,
Lewis' older, somewhat troubled brother.

547
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:49,572
-You're definitely going with us, right?
-I have to go back to San Antonio.

548
00:47:50,253 --> 00:47:52,687
Isn't San Antonio on the way
to New Jersey?

549
00:47:53,613 --> 00:47:54,966
It was nice to meet you.

550
00:47:55,613 --> 00:47:58,002
You're breaking my heart leaving like this.

551
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,602
-I'll miss you.
-I'll miss you, too.

552
00:48:01,693 --> 00:48:03,923
-I love you. Be safe.
-Love you, too.

553
00:48:05,053 --> 00:48:08,841
That's so Charlotte.
Waving and driving off like that.

554
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:13,688
-You guys ready for an adventure?
-Completely.

555
00:48:14,813 --> 00:48:16,883
Yeah, yeah, sure.

556
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:20,367
-Shotgun. You want it, call it.
-Shotgun.

557
00:48:45,413 --> 00:48:48,246
Hey. Welcome to Nebraska.

558
00:48:49,453 --> 00:48:50,727
See the hat I got you?

559
00:49:00,653 --> 00:49:01,642
So.

560
00:49:03,453 --> 00:49:07,446
I wanted to tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

561
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:10,572
Picking me up.

562
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:14,732
It's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

563
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,445
This is the part where you kiss the girl.

564
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:31,443
Well, historically.

565
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,284
Lewis, you're blushing.

566
00:49:57,053 --> 00:49:59,772
-The room's this way.
-But the bar's this way.

567
00:50:00,653 --> 00:50:01,847
Here's to....

568
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:03,447
Nebraska.

569
00:50:04,093 --> 00:50:05,970
States? All right.

570
00:50:10,013 --> 00:50:11,685
Look what Uncle Fuller found.

571
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:18,172
Three tequilas. All right.

572
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:26,486
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
with my tongue.

573
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:27,847
Shut up.

574
00:50:28,973 --> 00:50:32,363
Choose your weapon.
Let's see what you're made of.

575
00:50:33,853 --> 00:50:34,808
And...

576
00:50:35,453 --> 00:50:36,488
...go.

577
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:45,208
Done!

578
00:50:47,773 --> 00:50:49,604
You still medalled. Bronze.

579
00:50:49,693 --> 00:50:52,730
-Not even close.
-It's straight. It's not even bent.

580
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:17,483
May I have three more shots of tequila
and some matches, please?

581
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,484
What's your name, sweet thing?

582
00:51:25,053 --> 00:51:26,771
Come on, what's your name?

583
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:30,008
What is it?

584
00:51:30,093 --> 00:51:32,653
I'm buying drinks.
You can call me whatever you want.

585
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:35,201
How about I call you Peaches?
You like Peaches?

586
00:51:35,933 --> 00:51:38,242
-No. Not really.
-You don't like Peaches?

587
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:39,607
What's going on?

588
00:51:39,853 --> 00:51:41,844
What? ls this your bitch?

589
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,889
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?

590
00:51:45,053 --> 00:51:46,122
I said...

591
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:51,325
...is this your bitch? Because if it is,
you better shut your bitch up.

592
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:53,365
Look at me, campus boy.

593
00:51:55,293 --> 00:51:57,887
Did you hear what I said?
Look me in the face.

594
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,564
You better shut your bitch up.

595
00:52:00,893 --> 00:52:04,408
Bitch, shut up!
Are you mouthing off again?

596
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:06,008
Damn!

597
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:09,928
You can't turn your back for one minute.
I owe you one.

598
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:14,165
Now come on!
It's back in the truck with you, Daisy!

599
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:17,644
Drunk in a bar! Come on! Goddamn!

600
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:21,367
Gentlemen.

601
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:29,524
Careful. Those are expensive.

602
00:52:39,813 --> 00:52:40,802
What?

603
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,484
-Hey.
-Hey.

604
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:48,442
Hey.

605
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:53,050
-I got a plan.
-What's your plan?

606
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:57,685
-Let's never go back there again.
-I can't wait to never go back there.

607
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:03,283
I'll be in my Presidential Suite.

608
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,482
Excellent. We're going to head
to our spinning motel room.

609
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:12,927
See you later.

610
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,331
I get the orange one.

611
00:53:24,893 --> 00:53:25,882
This one.

612
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:36,329
See, I told you this was a good place.
Adult channels.

613
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:43,206
Are you in the mood for a story,
or like a collection of scenes?

614
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:46,125
She isn't a Navy SEAL.

615
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:49,926
Takes me right out.

616
00:53:52,573 --> 00:53:54,529
Hey, Venna's great, man. She is....

617
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:56,009
God.

618
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:02,767
I mean, you guys are just friends, right?

619
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:06,165
I mean, that's what you said.

620
00:54:07,293 --> 00:54:10,012
Right? I mean, you're just hanging out.

621
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:17,723
Because if you're anything more than that,
tell me right now and I'll just...

622
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:23,172
...off, you know?

623
00:54:25,853 --> 00:54:26,842
Great.

624
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:38,090
We never got those last drinks.

625
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:40,202
Yeah.

626
00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:45,762
You know, if we want to get an early start,
we should just crash, go to bed.

627
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:47,162
Yeah.

628
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,848
I am a licensed bartender.

629
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:55,770
I'd show you my license,
but my hands are full, so....

630
00:54:57,653 --> 00:54:59,132
Where's your better half?.

631
00:54:59,693 --> 00:55:01,843
He's busy. Snoring.

632
00:55:03,973 --> 00:55:06,851
I really don't think
that I can drink any more.

633
00:55:07,253 --> 00:55:10,325
Oh, I disagree. And I'm a professional.

634
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:17,092
You know what's amazing?

635
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:20,609
Nobody knows where we are right now.

636
00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:24,567
We're just kind of...

637
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:28,248
...out there...

638
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,082
...floating.

639
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:37,729
If anyone wanted to find us
for some strange reason, they couldn't.

640
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:42,212
What am I talking about?

641
00:55:42,813 --> 00:55:45,043
I have no idea. Here, try this.

642
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,121
That's good.

643
00:55:56,613 --> 00:55:57,602
Yeah.

644
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:01,682
Is Lewis okay?
He doesn't normally drink so much.

645
00:56:03,813 --> 00:56:04,962
He's totally fine.

646
00:56:15,813 --> 00:56:17,246
Fuller, get the phone.

647
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,162
Hello.

648
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:38,483
Now I thought you said there was no girl.

649
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:40,362
What?

650
00:56:40,973 --> 00:56:42,804
You said there was no girl.

651
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:44,328
Fuller.

652
00:56:50,733 --> 00:56:53,088
Listen, there isn't any girl.

653
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:58,645
Then what is she doing in the other room
with your brother?

654
00:57:13,653 --> 00:57:15,405
He's out there! He's watching us!

655
00:57:15,493 --> 00:57:17,051
-Rusty Nail?
-He just called!

656
00:57:17,213 --> 00:57:18,965
-Who?
-He called you on the phone?

657
00:57:19,053 --> 00:57:21,408
He knew you were in here!
He's watching us!

658
00:57:21,573 --> 00:57:23,006
Somebody's watching us?

659
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:24,248
What did he say?

660
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:26,324
He said, "I thought there was no girl."

661
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:29,769
Then he asked why you were in here,
which is an excellent question!

662
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:32,162
-We're leaving!
-I already paid for this room!

663
00:57:32,293 --> 00:57:33,123
Just do it!

664
00:57:33,213 --> 00:57:34,805
How scared am I supposed to be?

665
00:57:44,453 --> 00:57:45,772
Much more than usual.

666
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,289
Can someone please talk to me?

667
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:25,284
How can he know we're brothers?

668
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:28,889
We'll go to the police,
get off the highway and go home.

669
00:58:29,293 --> 00:58:30,408
Lewis! Goddamn it!

670
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:33,006
Something weird happened in Wyoming.

671
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,765
I didn't want to tell you.

672
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:37,651
-Tell me what?
-The short version?

673
00:58:38,533 --> 00:58:39,204
Talk to me.

674
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:42,251
There's a sick guy out there.
He put a guy in a coma.

675
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:44,526
This Rusty Nail guy did something?

676
00:58:44,613 --> 00:58:47,173
-Because of something that we did.
-What did you do?

677
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:54,932
What are you doing?

678
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:58,449
He wants us to look in the trunk.

679
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:03,123
There were signs spray-painted back there:
Look in the trunk.

680
00:59:05,213 --> 00:59:07,169
Signs. Why do you think they're for us?

681
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:10,168
Look.

682
00:59:14,293 --> 00:59:15,646
What's going on here?

683
00:59:20,053 --> 00:59:22,408
Painting signs
is a pretty elaborate thing to do.

684
00:59:23,213 --> 00:59:24,202
No, no!

685
00:59:24,453 --> 00:59:26,523
-What?
-Don't open it!

686
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,611
-Why?
-What if there's a head or a body in there?

687
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,683
-Could be a bomb.
-Then don't open it.

688
00:59:32,773 --> 00:59:35,333
-Or him!
-I say, don't open the trunk!

689
00:59:35,413 --> 00:59:37,165
I want to know what's in the trunk.

690
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:40,482
What are you doing?

691
00:59:49,813 --> 00:59:51,041
Oh, shit.

692
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:56,924
Okay, we plug it in and we don't talk on it.

693
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:58,682
We just listen.

694
00:59:59,613 --> 01:00:02,332
Whatever he says,
we just go straight to the police.

695
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:07,643
I'm not moving until you tell me
why I should be afraid of a radio.

696
01:00:28,093 --> 01:00:30,129
Candy Cane, are you there?

697
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:33,887
Oh, that's right.

698
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:38,491
I don't mean my Candy Cane.

699
01:00:39,773 --> 01:00:41,172
I mean yours.

700
01:00:43,613 --> 01:00:44,682
Venna?

701
01:00:45,253 --> 01:00:46,402
He knows my name?

702
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:49,770
Let him talk all he wants.
Just tell me where we're going!

703
01:00:49,973 --> 01:00:52,771
You know when a corpse
can't be identified?

704
01:00:53,853 --> 01:00:57,402
No next of kin. No one to claim the body.

705
01:00:58,493 --> 01:01:02,168
What they do is, they cut off all the fingers.

706
01:01:03,133 --> 01:01:04,248
All ten of them.

707
01:01:05,213 --> 01:01:07,090
Then they cut off the jaw.

708
01:01:07,653 --> 01:01:10,008
They cut off the person's jaw.

709
01:01:11,253 --> 01:01:13,926
And they put it all in a jar.

710
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:18,970
They put it in a jar
with some number on it.

711
01:01:28,093 --> 01:01:29,082
Venna!

712
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:31,363
-Oh my God, that's Charlotte.
-What?

713
01:01:31,853 --> 01:01:34,413
-That's Charlotte.
-Who? Your roommate?

714
01:01:37,453 --> 01:01:38,886
What the hell do you want?

715
01:01:39,253 --> 01:01:43,212
I want you to go
to the State Line Truck Stop parking lot.

716
01:01:43,693 --> 01:01:44,921
I'll find you there.

717
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:46,532
Venna, please help me.

718
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:48,570
If you go to the police...

719
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:52,809
...l will take her apart, piece by piece.

720
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:18,921
Good morning.

721
01:02:19,453 --> 01:02:20,647
He's back.

722
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:24,168
We're here.

723
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:25,891
Okay, here's what I want:

724
01:02:26,813 --> 01:02:28,087
Fuller...

725
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:29,932
...Lewis...

726
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,129
...l want you two to head inside.

727
01:02:34,173 --> 01:02:35,925
Take a seat at the counter.

728
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,450
Order six cheeseburgers each.

729
01:02:42,453 --> 01:02:43,681
What about Venna?

730
01:02:44,653 --> 01:02:45,927
She stays put.

731
01:02:47,253 --> 01:02:50,051
But you two are going in naked.

732
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:52,488
Naked?

733
01:02:57,293 --> 01:02:59,761
If we go in there, dicks hanging...

734
01:03:01,853 --> 01:03:03,730
...they'll just call the police.

735
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:07,406
Oh, come on. It's just for fun.

736
01:03:08,253 --> 01:03:10,164
Bullshit, I'm staying here alone.

737
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:16,245
Stay up front. Keep the car running.
If you see anything, honk the horn. Drive.

738
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:23,288
I can't fucking believe we're doing this.

739
01:03:34,013 --> 01:03:36,527
Billy, get in the car. Suzy.

740
01:03:46,893 --> 01:03:48,963
Now they know what it feels like...

741
01:03:50,533 --> 01:03:52,330
...to be the brunt of the joke.

742
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:55,047
Your heart pounding...

743
01:03:57,053 --> 01:03:58,406
...face burning hot.

744
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:02,288
Now they know what it feels like...

745
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,209
...to be the fucking punch line.

746
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:09,610
They told me what they did to you.
I'm very sorry.

747
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:12,689
It's a little late for that, isn't it?

748
01:04:13,493 --> 01:04:18,248
I bet your friends had a really good laugh,
seeing me in the rain, holding my bottle.

749
01:04:21,253 --> 01:04:23,687
Sometimes people don't know
what they're doing.

750
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:27,530
They don't think what
they do can really affect anyone.

751
01:04:30,253 --> 01:04:34,212
Well, that's a lesson your friends
will have to learn the hard way.

752
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:38,922
You want to see Charlotte alive again?
Here's what you do.

753
01:04:43,853 --> 01:04:46,606
Twelve cheeseburgers, please.

754
01:04:50,093 --> 01:04:51,572
You want fries with that?

755
01:04:58,053 --> 01:05:00,487
Is this a fraternity stunt? Because if this--

756
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:03,292
A man's going to kill our friend
if we don't do this.

757
01:05:03,453 --> 01:05:05,125
If this wasn't my restaurant--

758
01:05:05,213 --> 01:05:07,124
Listen, we're not joking, man.

759
01:05:08,013 --> 01:05:09,048
Oh, shit.

760
01:05:15,613 --> 01:05:17,205
We should go to the cops.

761
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:19,568
Not until we find out what he wants.

762
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,850
Right here. This is where we turn.

763
01:05:26,013 --> 01:05:28,322
That's what he said.

764
01:05:57,533 --> 01:05:58,852
You out there?

765
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:02,648
We're here.

766
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:07,969
Something special's waiting for you.
I'd say it's about 100 feet up the road.

767
01:06:09,453 --> 01:06:11,011
So get out of the car.

768
01:06:11,813 --> 01:06:13,644
I'm not walking one foot--

769
01:06:13,813 --> 01:06:17,931
We don't have a choice. Do what he says.
He has Charlotte. Get out of the car.

770
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,322
Get out of the car!

771
01:06:20,093 --> 01:06:21,287
Goddamn it.

772
01:06:28,013 --> 01:06:29,366
What the hell is this?

773
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:33,731
-How many feet did he say?
-One hundred.

774
01:06:43,053 --> 01:06:44,805
Do you hear or see anything?

775
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:46,407
This is it.

776
01:07:02,973 --> 01:07:03,883
Hi.

777
01:07:05,053 --> 01:07:06,168
He's not slowing.

778
01:07:06,373 --> 01:07:07,806
He's not going to stop.

779
01:07:10,453 --> 01:07:12,045
-He isn't slowing!
-Run! Go!

780
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:18,566
Run! Run!

781
01:07:26,853 --> 01:07:28,571
What the hell is he doing?

782
01:07:54,413 --> 01:07:55,926
Let's go. Let's go!

783
01:07:57,693 --> 01:07:59,126
Let's go! Come on!

784
01:08:00,373 --> 01:08:01,806
Run! Run!

785
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:11,768
Go left!

786
01:08:15,213 --> 01:08:16,123
Keep going!

787
01:08:21,613 --> 01:08:22,568
Come on, run!

788
01:08:23,773 --> 01:08:24,842
Get down!

789
01:08:33,373 --> 01:08:35,603
-Let's go!
-Go, go, go!

790
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:40,202
Come on! Go!

791
01:08:58,173 --> 01:08:59,128
Run!

792
01:08:59,933 --> 01:09:02,367
Go! Come on! Go! Run!

793
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:04,851
Go! Run!

794
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:07,248
Turn, quick!

795
01:09:18,093 --> 01:09:18,969
Venna?

796
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:54,682
Lewis.

797
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:12,888
Venna?

798
01:11:03,213 --> 01:11:04,123
Fuller!

799
01:11:31,493 --> 01:11:33,085
-You guys okay?
-I'm fine.

800
01:11:34,173 --> 01:11:35,128
Hey, Venna.

801
01:11:35,253 --> 01:11:37,528
Did you see that? I was back there...

802
01:11:37,933 --> 01:11:39,332
...he tried to back up.

803
01:11:39,413 --> 01:11:41,005
Venna, come out. He's leaving.

804
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,925
You let her out of your sight?

805
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:48,048
Goddamn it! You let her out of your sight.

806
01:11:48,253 --> 01:11:51,529
-Where the hell were you?
-I was over there, man! Back there!

807
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:54,202
Lewis!

808
01:11:56,253 --> 01:11:57,925
Lewis, help me, please!

809
01:12:02,173 --> 01:12:03,128
Lewis!

810
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:08,568
Goddamn it! Leave her alone!
Please, we'll do whatever you want!

811
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:12,924
You don't feel like meeting me
at a motel later, do you?

812
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:14,846
We'll do whatever you want!

813
01:12:15,053 --> 01:12:19,968
Meet me at the next town. Medford.
Room 17. Midnight.

814
01:12:20,893 --> 01:12:22,611
Do not be one minute late.

815
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,692
Lewis! Gas leak! Come on!

816
01:12:24,853 --> 01:12:28,766
If you could bring me
a bottle ofpink champagne...

817
01:12:29,253 --> 01:12:30,481
...it's my favorite.

818
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:48,089
Venna.

819
01:12:57,853 --> 01:12:58,968
Seven miles!

820
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:04,928
Come on!

821
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:08,291
Wait! He said not to call the cops!

822
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:15,053
Keep a lookout.
Don't worry, I've done this before.

823
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:30,972
We're running out of time.

824
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,971
Goddamn.

825
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,687
Thing won't start.

826
01:13:41,853 --> 01:13:42,729
Hello.

827
01:13:51,213 --> 01:13:52,282
Need some help?

828
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:55,972
We're fine. The damn Ford won't start.

829
01:13:56,373 --> 01:13:59,092
-He wonders why I drive a Chevy.
-No shit.

830
01:14:03,093 --> 01:14:05,288
I have some jumper cables.
I'll hook you up.

831
01:14:06,773 --> 01:14:08,206
No, we're fine.

832
01:14:08,453 --> 01:14:09,806
It just flooded, right?

833
01:14:10,973 --> 01:14:14,966
Take it and turn it all the way off. Then on.

834
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:16,728
Should I show you?

835
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,725
Hesitate it for two seconds.

836
01:14:21,293 --> 01:14:22,806
-There it is.
-Perfect.

837
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:25,452
You're the man. Thanks.

838
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:35,087
Where the hell are you going?
That's my truck!

839
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,892
Everything will be fine.

840
01:14:40,613 --> 01:14:41,966
We'll get Venna...

841
01:14:44,133 --> 01:14:45,885
...and then we'll find Charlotte.

842
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:50,408
Everything's going to be okay.

843
01:14:53,013 --> 01:14:54,287
Don't you think?

844
01:15:13,573 --> 01:15:15,006
Okay. Motel.

845
01:15:15,653 --> 01:15:16,563
Motel.

846
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,289
-Which one?
-He didn't say! Shit!

847
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:41,043
Venna?

848
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,565
I said, hold on!

849
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:49,805
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

850
01:16:16,733 --> 01:16:17,768
Can I help you?

851
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:20,205
-Is this your room?
-Yeah. So?

852
01:16:40,613 --> 01:16:41,762
What's the problem?

853
01:16:42,013 --> 01:16:43,765
Shit! What did we miss?

854
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:06,207
Hello, police?

855
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:10,763
I'd like to report some dead bodies.

856
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,208
Your name, sir?

857
01:17:34,373 --> 01:17:35,408
Hello.

858
01:17:39,373 --> 01:17:40,362
Come on.

859
01:17:49,453 --> 01:17:50,488
It's unlocked.

860
01:17:51,573 --> 01:17:52,642
We're coming in.

861
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,282
We're coming in.

862
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:04,448
Venna?

863
01:18:05,093 --> 01:18:05,843
Hello?

864
01:18:25,573 --> 01:18:26,688
Hit the switch.

865
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:44,488
Nice, isn't it? Being on the receiving end?

866
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:47,648
Where's Venna?

867
01:18:48,013 --> 01:18:48,729
Who?

868
01:18:49,053 --> 01:18:50,725
I'm not kidding! Where's Venna?

869
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,891
You see, you might not be kidding,
but I am.

870
01:18:55,173 --> 01:18:57,607
That's the point. Get it?

871
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,801
Believe me, you made your point.
All right?

872
01:19:02,373 --> 01:19:03,931
We're sorry. We told you.

873
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:07,092
Lewis, you know what I think
is a real kick?

874
01:19:07,853 --> 01:19:11,528
Pretending the person I'm talking to
is right next to me.

875
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:14,971
Right next to me.

876
01:19:21,093 --> 01:19:23,163
Not what you expected, is it?

877
01:19:24,013 --> 01:19:27,562
It's not what I expected
when I came to Room 17, neither.

878
01:19:28,893 --> 01:19:30,326
You guys sitting next door.

879
01:19:32,613 --> 01:19:34,683
Listening through the wall.

880
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:39,170
That's what you did, right?
You listened through the wall.

881
01:19:42,853 --> 01:19:44,081
What do you want?

882
01:19:44,933 --> 01:19:47,242
I just want to enjoy this for a second.

883
01:19:50,053 --> 01:19:53,602
-We have to call the cops.
-No. If we call the cops, he'll kill her.

884
01:19:54,293 --> 01:19:55,772
Well, what the fuck, man?

885
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,611
You go outside.

886
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:01,004
-Peek in his room.
-Are you crazy?

887
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:03,766
Do it! I'll keep him on the phone.
Go out there now.

888
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:04,963
Go!

889
01:20:21,893 --> 01:20:22,723
Shit!

890
01:20:24,213 --> 01:20:25,248
You still there?

891
01:20:25,893 --> 01:20:26,803
Yeah, I'm here.

892
01:20:27,653 --> 01:20:30,531
Why don't you come on over?
Your Candy Cane's waiting.

893
01:20:44,933 --> 01:20:45,809
Listen...

894
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:47,606
...we learned our lesson.

895
01:20:47,693 --> 01:20:49,490
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah.

896
01:20:49,733 --> 01:20:54,090
Yeah, that's right. So this is what we'll do.
You give us back Venna...

897
01:20:54,853 --> 01:20:59,085
...and Charlotte,
and we'll walk away and not tell anybody.

898
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:01,730
We sure as hell won't tell the cops.

899
01:21:25,173 --> 01:21:27,641
Watch this. It's going to be hilarious.

900
01:21:51,213 --> 01:21:52,532
Don't open the door!

901
01:21:52,733 --> 01:21:53,927
Don't open the door!

902
01:22:15,813 --> 01:22:16,689
Lewis!

903
01:22:37,293 --> 01:22:38,612
Fuller, where are you?

904
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:05,568
Fuller?

905
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:09,924
Come on. Let's get you off this.

906
01:23:11,093 --> 01:23:11,969
Don't!

907
01:23:12,093 --> 01:23:13,606
-What?
-Pipe!

908
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,364
There's a pipe in my leg, man!

909
01:23:35,173 --> 01:23:36,572
We've got a body in here!

910
01:23:37,093 --> 01:23:38,924
-Possible 839.
-Search every room.

911
01:23:42,213 --> 01:23:43,407
Oh, jeez!

912
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:46,127
What's he doing?

913
01:23:50,453 --> 01:23:51,522
Come on, come on.

914
01:23:58,453 --> 01:23:59,442
Clear the door!

915
01:24:02,613 --> 01:24:03,762
Twenty four, clear!

916
01:24:10,453 --> 01:24:11,647
On the ground, now!

917
01:24:13,773 --> 01:24:14,967
Twenty three, clear!

918
01:24:15,613 --> 01:24:16,443
Let's go!

919
01:24:20,853 --> 01:24:21,649
Police!

920
01:24:23,373 --> 01:24:24,601
Come on!

921
01:24:26,253 --> 01:24:27,971
Come on. Get on it.

922
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:29,808
Twenty one, clear!

923
01:24:36,013 --> 01:24:36,923
Oh, jeez!

924
01:24:38,293 --> 01:24:39,248
Twenty, clear!

925
01:24:43,573 --> 01:24:45,211
Sheriff's Department! Open up!

926
01:24:46,133 --> 01:24:47,282
Sheriff! Open up!

927
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:53,607
Nineteen, clear!

928
01:24:53,733 --> 01:24:54,848
-Venna.
-What?

929
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:56,805
Don't let them open the door!

930
01:24:58,053 --> 01:24:58,690
Go!

931
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:01,525
Sheriff's Department! Open up!

932
01:25:20,613 --> 01:25:21,762
Show me your hands!

933
01:25:33,453 --> 01:25:34,602
Don't move!

934
01:25:42,253 --> 01:25:43,572
Lewis!

935
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:45,327
Freeze right there!

936
01:25:45,813 --> 01:25:46,484
Lewis!

937
01:25:46,653 --> 01:25:48,848
Wait. That's my brother in back.

938
01:25:49,453 --> 01:25:50,806
Get back on the ground!

939
01:25:51,173 --> 01:25:52,083
Don't shoot!

940
01:26:07,773 --> 01:26:08,569
Freeze!

941
01:26:09,133 --> 01:26:10,009
Freeze!

942
01:26:10,573 --> 01:26:12,529
-Shoot the truck!
-Shoot it!

943
01:26:12,653 --> 01:26:13,688
It won't stop!

944
01:27:05,293 --> 01:27:06,203
Oh, God.

945
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:08,167
I'll be okay.

946
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:23,883
Excuse me.

947
01:28:25,093 --> 01:28:28,529
-Did you figure out who the guy was?
-Just some trucker, named Jones.

948
01:28:29,213 --> 01:28:31,681
He drove for some ice company
in Wyoming.

949
01:28:35,733 --> 01:28:36,722
Ice company?

950
01:28:40,253 --> 01:28:40,969
What?

951
01:28:43,533 --> 01:28:45,046
Breaker 1-9, come on.

952
01:28:47,013 --> 01:28:47,809
Breaker.

953
01:28:47,893 --> 01:28:50,612
Looking for a break, westbound, l-80.

954
01:28:52,133 --> 01:28:53,486
How's that storm looking?

955
01:28:56,013 --> 01:28:57,332
You raining out there?

956
01:29:02,693 --> 01:29:04,285
Looking forward to the storm.

957
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:07,892
Keeps everyone inside.

958
