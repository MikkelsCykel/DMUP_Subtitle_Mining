1
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,087
Um, pick a color.

2
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:40,424
- Blue.
- B-L-U-E. Pick a number.

3
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:45,112
- Eight.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

4
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,812
Pick one more number.

5
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,299
- Fifteen.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...

6
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:54,574
...5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15.

7
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:56,749
Pick another number.

8
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,524
- Six.
- Okay.

9
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:06,486
"Dream is destiny. "

10
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,554
Rock out.

11
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:54,067
Rock 'n' roll.

12
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,692
Low strings. Begin!

13
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:34,614
Sara, try that thing you asked
me about.

14
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,789
Will you try it more subdued?

15
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:41,602
- Try it, see what you think.
- That one?

16
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:46,139
But I want it to sound rich
and almost a little wavy...

17
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,714
...due to being a bit out of tune.

18
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:51,251
- You want it...
- Slightly detached.

19
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:53,475
That's what I was wondering.

20
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:54,976
We're going:

21
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,463
- Yeah. You got it.
- Okay.

22
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:01,888
Snazzy, people!

23
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,112
Okay, pickup to 20, please.

24
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:07,362
This is the pickup to 20.

25
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:09,187
One, two, three.

26
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,996
Hey, it's me.
I just got back into town.

27
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:13,284
I thought I'd bum a ride,
but that's cool.

28
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:17,159
I can just take a cab,
something like that.

29
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:23,396
I guess I'll hang out with you later
or something.

30
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:38,169
Ahoy there, matey!
You in for the long haul?

31
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:41,620
Do you need a lift on down the line?

32
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:46,157
I was waiting for a cab, but...

33
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:49,381
All right. Don't miss the boat.

34
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:53,394
- Hey, thanks.
- Not a problem.

35
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:56,068
Anchors aweigh!

36
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,231
What do you think of my vessel?

37
00:06:02,443 --> 00:06:06,168
She's "see-worthy. " S-E-E.
See with your eyes.

38
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:10,743
My transport should be an extension
of my personality. VoilÃ !

39
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:15,855
And this is my window to the world.
Every minute's a different show.

40
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:19,180
I may not understand it
or agree with it...

41
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:23,054
...but I accept it
and just sort of glide along.

42
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:25,817
Keep things on an even keel, I say.

43
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,516
Go with the flow.
The sea refuses no river.

44
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,854
The idea is to remain in a state
of departure, while always arriving.

45
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,842
It saves on introductions
and goodbyes.

46
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,266
The ride requires no explanation,
just occupants.

47
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,403
That's where you come in.

48
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:47,778
It's like you come onto this planet
with a crayon box.

49
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:51,853
You may get the eight-pack
or the 16-pack...

50
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:57,115
...but it's all in what you do with
the crayons, the colors you're given.

51
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:00,415
Don't worry about coloring
within the lines.

52
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:04,827
Color outside the lines
and off the page! Don't box me in!

53
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,552
We're in motion to the ocean.
We are not landlocked!

54
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,927
So where do you want out?

55
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:16,739
Who, me? Am I first? I don't know.
Really, anywhere is fine.

56
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:20,801
Just give me an address
or something, okay?

57
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:24,114
Tell you what.
Go up three more streets.

58
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:29,550
Take a right. Go two more blocks.
Drop him off on the next corner.

59
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,713
Where's that?

60
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:35,626
I don't know, but it's somewhere.

61
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:40,126
And it'll determine the course
of the rest of your life.

62
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,450
All ashore that's going ashore!

63
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:16,919
I refuse to take existentialism
as just another fashion...

64
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,107
...or historical curiosity...

65
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:24,194
...because it has something important
to offer for the new century.

66
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:29,094
I'm afraid we're losing the real
virtues of living life passionately...

67
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,331
...taking responsibility
for who you are...

68
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:36,531
...making something of yourself
and feeling good about life.

69
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:41,381
Existentialism is often discussed
as a philosophy of despair...

70
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,843
...but I think it's the opposite.

71
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:48,918
Sartre once said he never really
felt a day of despair in his life.

72
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:52,217
One thing that comes
from these guys...

73
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,854
...is not a sense of anguish
so much as...

74
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,542
...an exuberance of feeling
on top of it.

75
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:02,430
It's like your life
is yours to create.

76
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:07,191
I've read the postmodernists with
interest, even admiration.

77
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:11,941
But I always have this awful,
nagging feeling...

78
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,904
...that something essential
is left out.

79
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:18,541
The more you talk about a person...

80
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:23,115
...as a social construction
or a confluence of forces...

81
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:26,441
...or as fragmented or marginalized...

82
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:30,315
...then you open up
a whole new world of excuses.

83
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:35,065
When Sartre talks about
responsibility, it's not abstract.

84
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:39,527
It's not the kind of self or soul
that theologians argue about.

85
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:43,064
It's something concrete.
It's us talking...

86
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:46,964
...making decisions
and taking the consequences.

87
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,877
There are six billion
people in the world.

88
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:54,339
Nevertheless, what you do
makes a difference.

89
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:59,289
It makes a difference
in material terms and to other people.

90
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:01,426
It sets an example.

91
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:05,488
The message is, we should
never write ourselves off...

92
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:09,650
...and see ourselves as victims
of various forces.

93
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:13,288
It's always our decision who we are.

94
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:25,574
Creation comes out of imperfection.

95
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:31,212
It seems to come out of a striving
and a frustration.

96
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,474
This is where, I think,
language came from.

97
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:40,049
I mean, it came from our desire
to transcend our isolation...

98
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:44,061
...and have some connection
with one another.

99
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,236
It had to be easy when
it was just simple survival.

100
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,460
"Water. " We came up
with a sound for that.

101
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,760
"Tiger behind you!"
We made a sound for that.

102
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:58,872
But when it gets really
interesting, I think...

103
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:03,885
...is when we use
that same system of symbols...

104
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:09,484
...to communicate all the abstract and
intangible things we're experiencing.

105
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:14,647
What is "frustration"?
Or what is "anger" or "love"?

106
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,334
When I say "love"...

107
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,959
...the sound comes out of my mouth
and hits the other person's ear...

108
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:26,596
...travels through this byzantine
conduit in their brain...

109
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:30,796
...through their memories of love
or lack of love.

110
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:36,945
They say they understand, but how
do I know? Because words are inert.

111
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:40,482
They're just symbols. They're dead.
You know?

112
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:45,182
And so much of our experience
is intangible.

113
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:50,382
So much of what we perceive cannot
be expressed. It's unspeakable.

114
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:55,257
And yet, you know, when we
communicate with one another...

115
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:01,994
...and we feel we have connected
and think we're understood...

116
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:06,931
...I think we have a feeling
of almost spiritual communion.

117
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:11,194
That feeling may be transient,
but it's what we live for.

118
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:26,580
To look at human development,
look at the organism's evolution...

119
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:29,579
...and his environmental interaction.

120
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:34,954
Evolution of the organism begins
with evolution through the hominid...

121
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:39,329
...coming to the evolution of man.
Neanderthal, Cro-Magnon.

122
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,329
Now, what you're looking at here
are three strings:

123
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,341
Biological, anthropological,
development of cultures...

124
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,104
...and cultural,
which is human expression.

125
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:55,915
What you've seen is the evolution
of populations, not individuals.

126
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,853
Then look at the time scale involved.

127
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,778
Two billion years for life,
six million for the hominid...

128
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,152
...100,000 years for mankind
as we know it.

129
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:10,427
You see how the evolutionary
paradigm telescopes.

130
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:16,539
Then when you get to agriculture,
scientific and industrial revolution...

131
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,426
...you're looking at 10,000 years,
400 years, 150 years.

132
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,102
You see a further telescoping
of evolutionary time.

133
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:26,977
As we go through the new evolution...

134
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:33,176
...it will telescope to the point
where we see it within our lifetime.

135
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:37,626
The new evolution stems
from two types of information:

136
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:41,225
Digital and analog.
Digital is artificial intelligence.

137
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:44,887
Analog results from molecular biology
and cloning.

138
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,575
You knit the two with neurobiology.

139
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:52,475
Under the old paradigm, one would
die, the other would dominate.

140
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,699
Under the new paradigm, they exist
as a supportive...

141
00:14:56,912 --> 00:15:01,012
...non-competitive grouping,
independent from the external.

142
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:05,449
So evolution now becomes an
individually centered process...

143
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:08,674
...emanating from the individual...

144
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:14,161
...not a passive process with the
individual at the collective's whim.

145
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,061
So you produce a neo-human...

146
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:20,460
...with a new individuality,
a new consciousness.

147
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:23,786
That's only the beginning
of the cycle.

148
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:27,735
As it proceeds,
the input is this new intelligence.

149
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:31,872
As intelligence piles on intelligence,
ability on ability...

150
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:35,235
...the speed changes until you reach
a crescendo.

151
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:41,509
Imagine it as an instant fulfillment
of human and neo-human potential.

152
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:45,321
It could be the amplification
of the individual...

153
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,359
...the multiplication of individual,
parallel existences...

154
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,821
...with the individual no longer
restricted by time and space.

155
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:58,059
And the manifestations of this
neo-human evolution...

156
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:01,396
...could be dramatically
counterintuitive.

157
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:06,033
The old evolution is cold,
it's sterile. It's efficient.

158
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:09,271
Its manifestations are
those of social adaption.

159
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,145
You're talking about parasitism,
dominance, morality...

160
00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:15,944
...war, predation.

161
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:20,557
These will be subject to de-emphasis
and de-evolution.

162
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:24,320
The new paradigm would give us
the traits...

163
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,557
...of truth, loyalty,
justice and freedom.

164
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:34,219
These would be manifestations of
this evolution. That's what we hope.

165
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:29,337
Self-destructive man feels completely
alienated. Utterly alone.

166
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,012
He's an outsider to the community.

167
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,512
He thinks to himself,
"I must be insane. "

168
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:39,812
What he fails to realize
is that society has, as he does...

169
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:44,074
...an interest in considerable
losses, in catastrophes.

170
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:48,524
Wars, famines, floods and quakes
meet well-defined needs.

171
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,061
Man wants chaos.
In fact, he's gotta have it.

172
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,710
Depression, strife, riots, murder.
All this dread.

173
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:07,635
We're drawn to that almost orgiastic
state created out of destruction.

174
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:11,072
It's in all of us. We revel in it.

175
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,359
The media puts a sad face on things,
painting them as human tragedies.

176
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,784
But the media's function is not
to eliminate the evils of the world.

177
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,984
They persuade us to accept those evils
and get used to living with them.

178
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,934
The powers that be
want us to be passive observers.

179
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,759
Have you got a match?

180
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:41,770
They haven't given us any other
options, outside the occasional...

181
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:46,045
...purely symbolic,
participatory act of "voting. "

182
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:51,008
Do you want the puppet on the right
or the puppet on the left?

183
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,707
The time has come to project my
inadequacies and dissatisfactions...

184
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,882
...into the sociopolitical
and scientific schemes.

185
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:03,657
Let my own lack of a voice be heard.

186
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,953
I keep thinking about
something you said.

187
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,390
- Something I said?
- Yeah.

188
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:16,840
About feeling like you
observe your life...

189
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:22,002
...from the perspective of
an old woman about to die. Remember?

190
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,802
I still feel that way sometimes.

191
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,401
Like I'm looking back on my life.

192
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:30,201
Like my waking life is her memories.

193
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,401
Exactly.

194
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:37,151
I heard that Tim Leary said
as he was dying...

195
00:21:37,351 --> 00:21:41,851
...he looked forward to when his
body was dead but his brain was alive.

196
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:47,488
Those six to 12 minutes of brain
activity after everything shuts down.

197
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,563
And a second of dream consciousness is
infinitely longer than a waking one.

198
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:55,325
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

199
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:59,225
Like, I wake up at 10:12.
Then I go back to sleep...

200
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:05,099
...and have long, intricate dreams that
seem hours long. Then I wake up and...

201
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:06,262
...it's 10:13.

202
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:11,674
Exactly. So in that six to 12 minutes
of brain activity...

203
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:13,712
...that could be your life.

204
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:18,386
You are that woman,
looking back over everything.

205
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:21,423
If I am? What would you be in that?

206
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:23,098
Whatever I am now.

207
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:26,661
I mean, maybe I only exist
in your mind.

208
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:30,498
I'm still just as real
as anything else.

209
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:37,335
I've been thinking about
something you said.

210
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:42,535
About reincarnation, and where
all the new souls come from over time.

211
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:44,473
Everybody always...

212
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:50,209
...says they're the reincarnation
of Cleopatra or Alexander the Great.

213
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:53,510
You know they were a dumb fuck
like everyone else.

214
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,722
I mean, it's impossible.

215
00:22:55,934 --> 00:23:00,422
The world population has doubled
in the past 40 years.

216
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:05,533
So if you believe in that ego thing
of one eternal soul...

217
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:09,495
...you have a 50% chance of your soul
being over 40.

218
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:15,271
For it to be over 150 years old,
it's only one out of six.

219
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:20,607
Are you saying reincarnation doesn't
exist? Or we're all young souls?

220
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,508
Half of us are first-round humans?
What are you...?

221
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:27,219
- What I'm saying...
- What's your point?

222
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:31,919
I believe reincarnation
is a poetic expression...

223
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:34,494
...of what collective memory is.

224
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:38,831
I read an article by a biochemist
not long ago.

225
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:42,444
He said when a member of a species
is born...

226
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:46,394
...it has a billion years
of memory to draw on.

227
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:50,231
This is where we inherit
our instincts.

228
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:52,806
I like that. Like there's...

229
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:56,968
...this telepathic thing going on
that we're a part of...

230
00:23:57,193 --> 00:24:01,780
...whether we're conscious of it
or not. That would explain these...

231
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:07,617
...seemingly spontaneous, worldwide,
innovative leaps in science and art.

232
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:13,055
Like the same results popping up
everywhere, independent of each other.

233
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:17,229
A guy on a computer figures something
out and simultaneously...

234
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:20,741
...a bunch of people
figure out the same thing.

235
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:25,041
They did this study.
They isolated a group over time...

236
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:29,442
...and they monitored their abilities
at crossword puzzles...

237
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:32,141
...in relation
to the general population.

238
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:38,329
Then they secretly gave them a day-old
crossword. One already done by people.

239
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:41,453
Their scores went up dramatically.
Like 20%.

240
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:47,028
It's like once the answers are out
there, people can pick up on them.

241
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,465
It's like we're all telepathically
sharing our experiences.

242
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:17,351
I'll get you fuckers
if it's the last thing I do.

243
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:20,863
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

244
00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:26,163
For every second I spend
in this hellhole...

245
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:30,237
...I'll see you spend a year
in living hell!

246
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,137
You fucks will beg me to let you die.
But no, not yet.

247
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,837
I want you cocksuckers to suffer.

248
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:43,837
I'll fix your asses.
Maybe a long needle in your eardrum.

249
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:47,336
Or a hot cigar in your eye.

250
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:49,149
Nothing fancy.

251
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:53,349
Some molten lead up the ass?

252
00:25:55,336 --> 00:26:00,161
Or, better still,
some of that old Apache shit.

253
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:03,135
Cut your eyelids off.

254
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:07,698
I'll just listen to you fucks
screaming.

255
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:10,473
What sweet music that'll be.

256
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,435
We'll do it in the hospital...

257
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:18,123
...with doctors and nurses,
so you pricks don't die too quick.

258
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,285
You know the best part?

259
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:24,785
The best part is you faggots
will have your eyelids cut off...

260
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:29,322
...so you'll have to watch me
do it to you.

261
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:36,758
You'll see me bring that cigar closer
and closer to your wide-open eye...

262
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:43,233
...till you're almost
out of your mind. But not quite.

263
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:48,708
I want it to last a long, long time.

264
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,183
I want you to know it's me.
I'm the one doing it to you. Me!

265
00:26:55,845 --> 00:27:01,157
That sissy psychiatrist,
what unmitigated ignorance!

266
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:05,844
And that old drunken fart of a judge.
What a pompous ass!

267
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:09,357
Judge not, lest ye be judged!

268
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:14,969
All of you pukes are gonna die
the day I get out of this shithole!

269
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:24,344
I guarantee you'll regret
the day you met me!

270
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:29,218
In today's world-view, science
has taken the place of God...

271
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,018
...but some philosophical
problems are still troubling.

272
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,743
Take free will.

273
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,917
This problem has been around
since Aristotle, in 350 B.C.

274
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:43,630
St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas
worried how we can be free...

275
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,355
...if God already knows
what we're gonna do.

276
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:51,467
Nowadays, we know the world works
by fundamental physical laws.

277
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,329
These laws govern the behavior
of every object in the world.

278
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:02,104
Since these laws are trustworthy, they
enable technological achievements.

279
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,515
We're physical systems too. Complex
arrangements of carbon, mostly water.

280
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:10,853
Our behavior isn't an
exception to these laws.

281
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:16,016
So whether it's God setting things up
in advance and knowing everything...

282
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:20,790
...or physical laws governing us,
there's not much room for freedom.

283
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,765
You might want to ignore
the mystery of free will.

284
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:28,602
To say, "It's a historical
anecdote, it's sophomoric.

285
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:32,139
It's a question with no answer.
Forget about it. "

286
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:37,477
But the question remains. If you think
about individuality, who you are...

287
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:42,552
...is based on the free choices
you make. Or take responsibility.

288
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:46,526
You're only held responsible
or admired or respected...

289
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:49,489
...for things you do
of your own free will.

290
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:53,188
The question keeps coming
and we have no solution.

291
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:55,563
Decisions can seem like charades.

292
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:59,900
Imagine it. There's electrical
activity in the brain. Neurons fire...

293
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:05,600
...sending a signal through the nerves
into the muscle fibers. They twitch.

294
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:09,612
You reach out your arm.
It looks like a free action...

295
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:12,837
...but every part of that process...

296
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,949
...is governed by physical laws.
Chemical, electrical, and so on.

297
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:21,574
It looks like the big bang
set the initial conditions...

298
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,774
...and the whole
rest of human history...

299
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:29,948
...is the reaction of subatomic
particles to basic physical laws.

300
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:33,586
We think we're special,
we have dignity.

301
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,736
That now is threatened.
It's challenged by this picture.

302
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:42,922
You might say, "What about quantum
mechanics? I know enough...

303
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,872
...to know it's a
probabilistic theory.

304
00:29:46,047 --> 00:29:50,172
It's loose, not deterministic.
It lets us understand free will. "

305
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:53,522
But if you look at details
it won't really help...

306
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:58,322
...because you have quantum particles,
and their behavior is random.

307
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:02,047
They sort of swerve.
Their behavior is absurd...

308
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:07,222
...and unpredictable. We can't
study it based on what came before.

309
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,372
It has a probabilistic framework.

310
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,996
Is freedom just
a matter of probabilities?

311
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,433
Randomness in a chaotic system?

312
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:20,333
I'd rather be a gear in
a deterministic, physical machine...

313
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,571
...than some random swerving.

314
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:28,720
We can't ignore the problem. We must
find room in our world-view for persons.

315
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:33,045
Not just bodies, but persons.
There's the freedom problem...

316
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,882
...find room for choice and responsibility
and understanding individuality.

317
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:41,319
"You can't fight city hall. "

318
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:45,519
"Death and taxes. " "Don't talk about
politics or religion. "

319
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:49,668
This is all the equivalent
of enemy propaganda.

320
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:52,068
Lay down, G.I.!
Lay down, G.I.!

321
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:57,443
We saw it in the 20th century. Now, in
the 21 st century, we must realize...

322
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:00,606
...that we cannot be crammed
into this rat maze.

323
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,218
We should not submit
to dehumanization!

324
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,656
I'm concerned with what's
happening in this world.

325
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:10,718
I'm concerned with structure,
the systems of control.

326
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:15,568
Those who control my life and those
who seek to control it more!

327
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,092
I want freedom!
And that's what you should want!

328
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:24,367
It's up to each of us to turn loose
the greed, hatred, envy...

329
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:29,941
...and insecurities, their mode of
control. We feel pathetic, small...

330
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:35,016
...so we'll willingly give up our
sovereignty, liberty and destiny.

331
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:39,116
We must realize we're being
conditioned on a mass scale.

332
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:41,878
Challenge the corporate slave state!

333
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:46,891
The 21 st century is a new century.
Not the century of slavery...

334
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:49,416
...lies and issues of
no significance...

335
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:53,528
...and classism, statism
and other modes of control.

336
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:58,502
It'll be an age of humankind standing
up for something pure and right.

337
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:03,364
What a bunch of garbage. Liberal
Democrat, conservative Republican.

338
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,664
Two sides of the same coin!

339
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:08,114
Two management teams...

340
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:11,614
...bidding for the CEO job
of Slavery, Inc.!

341
00:32:11,777 --> 00:32:15,914
The truth is out there,
but they lay out a buffet of lies!

342
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:19,489
I'm sick of it! And I'm not
gonna take a bite out of it!

343
00:32:19,726 --> 00:32:23,063
Resistance is not futile!
We will win this!

344
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:26,301
Humankind is too good!
We're not underachievers!

345
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:32,463
We'll stand up and be human beings!
We'll get fired up about real things!

346
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:37,225
Creativity and the dynamic human
spirit that refuses to submit!

347
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:41,700
Well, that's all I got to say.
It's in your court.

348
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,712
The quest is to be liberated
from the negative...

349
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:52,149
...which is really our
own will to nothingness.

350
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:57,286
Once having said yes to the instant,
the affirmation is contagious.

351
00:32:57,461 --> 00:33:02,324
It bursts into a chain of affirmations
that knows no limit.

352
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:06,223
To say yes to one instant...

353
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:10,023
...is to say yes to all of existence.

354
00:33:10,736 --> 00:33:13,936
The main character is
what I call "the mind. "

355
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:17,410
Its mastery, its capacity
to represent.

356
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:20,110
In history, attempts have been made...

357
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:25,209
...to contain experiences which
happen at the edge of the limit...

358
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:28,422
...where the mind is vulnerable.

359
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:33,084
But I think we are in a very
significant moment in history.

360
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:37,959
Those moments, those what we
might call liminal, limit, frontier...

361
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:41,421
...X- zone experiences are
now becoming the norm.

362
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:46,008
These multiplicities and distinctions
send differences, giving...

363
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:50,308
...great difficulty to the old mind.

364
00:33:50,646 --> 00:33:53,733
And through entering into their
very essence...

365
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:56,708
...tasting and feeling their
uniqueness...

366
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:59,958
...one makes a breakthrough
to that common...

367
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:03,645
...something that holds
them together.

368
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,258
And so the main character
is to this new mind...

369
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:12,257
...greater, greater mind.

370
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:14,757
A mind that yet is to be.

371
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:18,507
And when we enter into that mode...

372
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:21,969
...you can see a radical subjectivity.

373
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:26,369
Radical attunement to individuality,
uniqueness, to the mind.

374
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,806
It opens itself to a vast objectivity.

375
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:31,669
So the story is of the cosmos now.

376
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:36,805
The moment is not just
a passing empty, nothing, yet...

377
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:41,105
...this is the way in which
these secret passages happen.

378
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:44,818
Yes, it's empty with such fullness...

379
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:49,792
...that the great moment,
the great life...

380
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,205
...of the universe is pulsating in it.

381
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:57,867
And each one, each object,
each place...

382
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:01,241
...each act, leaves mark.

383
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:07,304
And that story is singular.
But, in fact, it's story after story.

384
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:16,553
It dissolves into quick-moving
particles that swirl.

385
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:21,028
Either I'm moving fast, or time is.
Never both simultaneously.

386
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,815
It's such a strange paradox.

387
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm closer to the end of my life
than I've ever been...

388
00:35:28,102 --> 00:35:31,728
...but I feel more than ever that
I have all the time in the world.

389
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:34,564
When I was younger,
there was a need for...

390
00:35:34,777 --> 00:35:37,965
...certainty. I had to get to
the end of the path.

391
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:42,777
I know what you mean.
I remember thinking:

392
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:46,714
Someday, in my mid-30s maybe...

393
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:50,914
...everything's going to somehow
gel and settle. Just end.

394
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,451
It was like there was a plateau...

395
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,651
...waiting for me. I was climbing up.
When I got to the top...

396
00:35:57,763 --> 00:36:02,163
...all growth and change would stop.
Even exhilaration.

397
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:05,138
But it hasn't happened,
thank goodness.

398
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,363
In our youth, we don't take into
account our curiosity.

399
00:36:09,538 --> 00:36:12,100
That's what's great about being human.

400
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,575
You know what Benedict Anderson
says about identity?

401
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:18,687
He talks about, say, a baby picture.

402
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:22,900
You pick up this two-dimensional image
and say, "That's me. "

403
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:27,849
To connect this baby in this weird
image with yourself in the present...

404
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:29,999
...you have to make up a story.

405
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:34,148
"This is me when I was a year old.
Later, I had long hair...

406
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,699
...and then we moved to Riverdale,
and here I am. "

407
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:41,323
So it takes a story
that's actually a fiction...

408
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:44,336
...to make you and the baby identical.

409
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:47,497
- To create your identity.
- The funny thing is...

410
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,298
...our cells completely
regenerate every seven years.

411
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:54,310
We've been several different people.

412
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:58,747
And yet, we always remain
quintessentially ourselves.

413
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:23,433
Our critique began as all critiques
begin, with doubt.

414
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,783
Doubt became our narrative.

415
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:29,408
Ours was a quest for
a new story, our own.

416
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,883
We grasped for this new history,
driven by suspicion...

417
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,845
...that ordinary language
couldn't tell it.

418
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,994
Our past appeared frozen in the
distance, and our every gesture...

419
00:37:41,157 --> 00:37:45,494
...signified negation of the old
world and the reach for a new one.

420
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:50,119
How we lived created a new situation
of exuberance and friendship.

421
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:54,669
A subversive micro-society in
the heart of an ignoring society.

422
00:37:55,044 --> 00:38:00,169
Art was not the goal, but the occasion
and method for locating our rhythm...

423
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,744
...and buried possibilities
of our time.

424
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:08,381
It was about the true discovery of
communication. Or the quest for such.

425
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:10,605
Finding and losing it.

426
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:13,618
We, the unappeased,
continued looking...

427
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:16,917
...filling silences with
wishes, fears, fantasies.

428
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,717
Driven on by the fact that no matter
how empty the world seemed...

429
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:25,055
...no matter how
degraded and used-up...

430
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:28,930
...anything was possible.
Given the right circumstances...

431
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:32,579
...a new world was just
as likely as an old one.

432
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:50,816
There are two kinds of sufferers:

433
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:53,616
Those who suffer
from a lack of life...

434
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:57,528
...and those who suffer from
an overabundance of life.

435
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,490
I've always found myself
in the second category.

436
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:06,190
When you think of it, almost all
human behavior and activity...

437
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,877
...is essentially no different
from animal behavior.

438
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:14,576
The most advanced technologies and
craftsmanship bring us at best...

439
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:17,302
...up to the super-chimpanzee level.

440
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:23,451
Actually, the gap between, say, Plato
or Nietzsche and the average human...

441
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:27,926
...is greater than between that
chimpanzee and the average human.

442
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:30,288
The realm of the real spirit...

443
00:39:30,488 --> 00:39:35,863
...the true artist, the saint, the
philosopher, is rarely achieved.

444
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:37,863
Why so few?

445
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:43,637
Why is world history and evolution
not stories of progress...

446
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:47,100
...but an endless and futile
addition of zeros?

447
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:50,675
No greater values have developed.

448
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,374
Hell, the Greeks 3000 years
ago were just as advanced as we are.

449
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,650
What are the barriers
that keep people...

450
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:01,887
...from reaching anywhere near
their real potential?

451
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:06,824
The answer to that can be found in
another question, and that's this:

452
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:10,561
Which is the most universal
human characteristic?

453
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,536
Fear...

454
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:14,973
...or laziness?

455
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,210
What are you writing?

456
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,947
A novel.

457
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:36,884
What's the story?

458
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,222
There's no story. It's just...

459
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:43,359
...people, gestures, moments.

460
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:47,497
Bits of rapture. Fleeting emotions.

461
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:49,796
In short...

462
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:53,596
...the greatest stories ever told.

463
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:58,271
Are you in the story?

464
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:03,182
I don't think so.

465
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:08,445
But then I'm kind of reading it
and then writing it.

466
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:17,532
It was in the desert, the middle of
nowhere, on the way to Vegas.

467
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:21,894
So you know, every once
in a while a car would stop for gas.

468
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:25,295
It was the last gas stop before Vegas.

469
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:30,769
There was a chair and a cash register.
That was all the room there was.

470
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:34,931
I was asleep and I heard a noise.

471
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:41,318
You know, just like in my mind.
So I got up...

472
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:45,718
...and I walked out
and stood on the curb...

473
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,381
...where the gas station ends.
You know, the driveway.

474
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:53,280
I'm rubbing my eyes,
trying to see what's going on.

475
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:59,530
And way down, at the very end of the
gas station, they had tire racks...

476
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:01,604
...with chains around them.

477
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:05,105
And I see there's
an Econoline van down there.

478
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:07,929
And a guy with his T-shirt off.

479
00:42:08,116 --> 00:42:12,441
And he's packing this Econoline van...

480
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:15,104
...with all these tires.

481
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:19,016
He's got the last two tires
in his hands.

482
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:25,978
Pushes them into the thing.
And I, of course, I go, "Hey, you!"

483
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:31,391
This guy turns around.
He's got no shirt on. He's sweating.

484
00:42:31,603 --> 00:42:36,977
Built like a brick shithouse.
Pulls out a knife, 12 inches long...

485
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,089
...and starts running at me
as fast as he can, going:

486
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,177
I'm still:

487
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:50,777
"This is wrong. "

488
00:42:52,126 --> 00:42:53,677
I walked in...

489
00:42:54,826 --> 00:43:00,589
...stuck my hand behind the register
where the owner kept a. 41 revolver.

490
00:43:00,764 --> 00:43:02,064
I pull it out...

491
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:03,688
...cock the trigger...

492
00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:09,363
...and as I turn around, he's coming
through the door. I saw his eyes.

493
00:43:09,526 --> 00:43:12,475
I'll never forget this guy's eyes.

494
00:43:12,638 --> 00:43:17,938
He just had bad thoughts
about me in his eyes.

495
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:22,050
I fired a round and it hit him,
boom, right in the chest.

496
00:43:22,212 --> 00:43:27,212
Bang! As fast as he came in the door,
he went out the door.

497
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:32,124
He went right up between
the two pumps, ethyl and regular.

498
00:43:32,286 --> 00:43:38,662
He must have been on drugs, on speed
or something, because he stood up.

499
00:43:38,898 --> 00:43:43,923
He still had the knife, and blood
was just all over his chest.

500
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:49,198
He stood up and went like that,
just moved a little. I'm in shock.

501
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:55,035
So I held the trigger back and fanned the
hammer, it was one of those old-time:

502
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:59,973
I blew him out of the gas station.

503
00:44:00,173 --> 00:44:03,622
Ever since then, I always carry this.

504
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:10,784
A well-armed populace
is the best defense against tyranny.

505
00:44:10,997 --> 00:44:12,897
I'll drink to that.

506
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:23,796
You know, I haven't fired this in
a long time, I don't know if it works.

507
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:26,834
Pull the trigger and find out.

508
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:27,468
Hey, man, I guess you already
took off or something.

509
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:34,268
Remind me to tell you about this dream
I had. There was some funny stuff.

510
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:38,505
All right, man.
I guess I'll catch you later. Okay.

511
00:45:45,979 --> 00:45:50,353
- In the bareback riding.
Copenhagen William from Mike Sankey...

512
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:54,478
Then, for a hatband,
sew it into the inside...

513
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:57,053
I do not await the future...

514
00:45:57,228 --> 00:46:01,165
...anticipating salvation, absolution
or even enlightenment.

515
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:06,703
I believe that this flawed perfection
is sufficient and complete...

516
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:10,802
...in every single, ineffable moment.

517
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:13,440
- The Blond Bee, Firefly, Snake...

518
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,615
- lunatic macaroni munchkin
with my goo-gat...

519
00:46:21,652 --> 00:46:25,876
- venerable tradition of sorcerers,
shamans and visionaries...

520
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:29,677
...who have perfected
the art of dream travel...

521
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:35,451
...the so-called lucid dream state,
where, by controlling your dreams...

522
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:41,588
...you can discover things beyond your
apprehension in your awake state.

523
00:46:46,813 --> 00:46:48,263
- Winning back-to...

524
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:51,113
She tells him what Felix is doing.

525
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,412
A single ego
is an absurdly narrow vantage...

526
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,012
...from which to view this experience.

527
00:46:57,187 --> 00:47:00,950
Where most consider their
relationship to the universe...

528
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:05,961
...I contemplate relationships
of my various selves to one another.

529
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:10,624
While most people with mobility
problems can barely get around...

530
00:47:10,824 --> 00:47:14,224
...at age 92, Joy Cullison's
out seeing the world.

531
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,010
Hey, how's it going?

532
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:46,184
They say dreams are real
only as long as they last.

533
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,359
Can't we say that about life?

534
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:53,109
A lot of us are mapping the
mind-body relationship of dreams.

535
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:57,234
We're called oneironauts,
explorers of the dream world.

536
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:01,558
There are two opposing states
of consciousness...

537
00:48:01,808 --> 00:48:03,908
...that don't oppose at all.

538
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:09,046
In the waking world, the neuro system
inhibits the vividness of memories.

539
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,008
It makes evolutionary sense.

540
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:13,783
It'd be maladapted if a predator...

541
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,982
...could be mistaken
for the memory of one...

542
00:48:17,157 --> 00:48:20,095
...and vice versa.
If the memory of a predator...

543
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:22,195
...conjured up a perceptual image...

544
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,495
...we'd run whenever we
had a scary thought.

545
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:28,894
Your serotonic neurons
inhibit hallucinations.

546
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:32,594
They themselves are inhibited
during REM sleep.

547
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:36,969
This allows dreams to appear real
but prevents competition...

548
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:38,807
...from other perceptions.

549
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:42,106
This is why dreams
are mistaken for reality.

550
00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:47,081
To the functional system of neural
activity that creates our world...

551
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:52,755
...there is no difference between
dreaming a perception and an action...

552
00:48:52,918 --> 00:48:58,593
...and actually the waking
perception and action.

553
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:15,267
A friend once told me the worst
mistake you can make...

554
00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:19,379
...is to think that you are alive...

555
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:24,854
...when really you're asleep
in life's waiting room.

556
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:39,940
The trick is to combine your waking
rational abilities...

557
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,802
...with the infinite possibilities
of your dreams.

558
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:47,378
Because if you can do that,
you can do anything.

559
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:52,015
Ever have a job you hated
and worked real hard at?

560
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:57,352
A long, hard day of work, finally you
go home, get in bed, close your eyes.

561
00:49:57,689 --> 00:50:04,026
Then you wake up and realize the whole
day at work had been a dream.

562
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:13,864
It's bad enough you sell
your waking life for...

563
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:18,738
...minimum wage, but now
they get your dreams for free.

564
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:23,176
Hey, man, what are you doing here?

565
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,975
I fancy myself a social lubricator
of the dream world...

566
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,700
...helping people get lucid easier.

567
00:50:29,888 --> 00:50:33,750
Cut out the fear and anxiety
and just rock 'n' roll.

568
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:37,187
Becoming lucid, you mean knowing
you're dreaming?

569
00:50:37,399 --> 00:50:43,199
Then you can control it. They're more
realistic than non-lucid dreams.

570
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:45,349
I just woke from a dream.

571
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:49,724
It wasn't typical, more like
I was in an alternate universe.

572
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:54,361
Yep, it's real. Technically,
it's a phenomenon of sleep...

573
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:57,160
...but you can have so much
fun in dreams.

574
00:50:57,348 --> 00:51:01,673
- And everyone knows, fun rules.
- Yeah.

575
00:51:01,848 --> 00:51:05,947
- What was going on in your dream?
- A lot of people talking.

576
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,410
Some was absurdist,
like from a strange movie.

577
00:51:09,585 --> 00:51:13,497
Mostly people went off about
whatever, really intensely.

578
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:15,122
I woke up wondering...

579
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:18,885
...where did this stuff come from?
- You can control that.

580
00:51:19,097 --> 00:51:23,260
- You have these dreams a lot?
- I always make the best of it.

581
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:27,397
You have to realize you're
dreaming in the first place.

582
00:51:27,572 --> 00:51:28,996
To recognize it.

583
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:33,271
You have to be able to ask yourself,
"Is this a dream?"

584
00:51:33,446 --> 00:51:37,571
Most people never ask themselves that,
awake or asleep.

585
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:42,671
People sleepwalk in the waking
state and wakewalk through dreams.

586
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:44,608
They don't get much out of it.

587
00:51:44,796 --> 00:51:49,696
What snapped me into realizing
I was dreaming was my clock.

588
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:54,445
I couldn't read it,
like the circuitry was screwed up.

589
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:59,732
That's common. Small printed material
is pretty tough too. Very unstable.

590
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:04,332
Another tip-off is trying
to adjust light levels. You can't.

591
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:08,456
If you see a light switch nearby,
see if it works.

592
00:52:08,644 --> 00:52:11,169
You can't do that in a lucid dream.

593
00:52:11,382 --> 00:52:16,843
What the hell? I can fly around, have
a conversation with Albert Schweitzer.

594
00:52:17,018 --> 00:52:19,881
I can explore new
dimensions of reality.

595
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:25,081
Not to mention, I can have any kind
of sex I want. Which is way cool.

596
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:27,056
So I can't adjust lights!

597
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:31,030
So that's what you do to test
if you're dreaming?

598
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:34,168
You can train yourself to recognize it.

599
00:52:34,343 --> 00:52:36,193
Hit a switch now and then.

600
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:40,968
If the lights are on and you can't
turn them off, you're dreaming.

601
00:52:41,143 --> 00:52:45,480
Then you can get down to business.
And it's unlimited.

602
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:48,379
- Know what I've been working on?
- What?

603
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:52,042
It's way ambitious.
But I'm getting better at it.

604
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:53,479
You'll dig this.

605
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:57,741
Three-sixty vision, man. I can see
in all directions. Cool, huh?

606
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:02,516
Yeah! Man...
Well, I gotta go, man.

607
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:06,053
Later. Super perfundo
on the early eve of your day.

608
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:07,391
What's that mean?

609
00:53:07,566 --> 00:53:10,390
I've never figured it out.
Maybe you can.

610
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:13,228
This guy always whispers it in my ear.

611
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:16,303
Louis.
He's a recurring dream character.

612
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:46,447
Cinema, in its essence...

613
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:53,147
...is about reproduction of reality,
which is, reality is reproduced.

614
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,884
For him,
it's not a storytelling medium.

615
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:57,584
He feels like...

616
00:54:57,734 --> 00:55:02,672
...like film... Like literature
is better for telling a story.

617
00:55:02,872 --> 00:55:07,071
Like if you tell a joke.
"A guy walks into a bar...

618
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,434
...and sees a dwarf. "

619
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:15,483
That works. You imagine a guy and a
dwarf in a bar, and it's imaginative.

620
00:55:15,683 --> 00:55:18,746
But in film,
you film a specific guy...

621
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:23,920
...in a specific bar with a specific
dwarf who looks a certain way.

622
00:55:24,132 --> 00:55:29,783
Like, for Bazin, what
the ontology of film has to do with...

623
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:31,983
...is what photography has...

624
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:36,295
...except it adds time
and greater realism.

625
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:42,994
So it's about that guy,
at that moment, in that space.

626
00:55:43,244 --> 00:55:46,769
And Bazin is, like, a Christian,
so he believes...

627
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:50,743
...in God, obviously,
and that everything...

628
00:55:50,943 --> 00:55:53,343
For him, reality and God are the same.

629
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:58,456
So what film is actually capturing is,
like, God incarnate, creating...

630
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:03,331
...and, like this very moment,
God is manifesting as this.

631
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,130
What film would capture
here right now...

632
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:11,130
...would be God as this table, as you,
as me. God looking how we look...

633
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:16,105
...saying and thinking what we think,
because we're all God manifest.

634
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:21,541
So film is a record of God,
or the ever-changing face of God.

635
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:24,016
You have a mosquito. Want me to...?

636
00:56:24,216 --> 00:56:26,942
- You got it.
- I got it?

637
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:32,591
Hollywood has taken film and made it
a storytelling medium. You take...

638
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:37,991
...books or stories, get a script
and find someone who fits it.

639
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:41,490
It's ridiculous.
It shouldn't be based on the script.

640
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:45,391
It should be based on the person
or the thing.

641
00:56:45,927 --> 00:56:50,965
They're right to have the star system.
Then it's about that person...

642
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:52,927
...instead of the story.

643
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,802
Truffaut said the best films
aren't made...

644
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,477
The best scripts
don't make the best films.

645
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:03,377
They have a narrative
you're a slave to.

646
00:57:03,576 --> 00:57:09,114
The best films are the ones
that aren't tied to that, slavishly.

647
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:12,052
So the narrative thing seems to me...

648
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:16,126
There's narrativity to film
because it's in time, like music.

649
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:21,826
But you don't think of the story of
the song. It comes out of the moment.

650
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:25,800
That's what film has.
It's that moment, which is holy.

651
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:29,125
This moment is holy.
We walk around like it's not.

652
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:33,112
Like there are some holy moments
and others are not.

653
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:39,512
Like, this moment is holy. Film lets us
see that, can frame it so we see it.

654
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:45,225
"Holy, holy, holy" moment by moment.
But who can live that way?

655
00:57:45,425 --> 00:57:51,224
Because if I were to look at you and
let you be holy, I would stop talking.

656
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:55,599
You'd be in the moment.
The moment is holy, right?

657
00:57:55,836 --> 00:57:58,736
Yeah, I'd be open.
I'd look in your eyes...

658
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:03,411
...I'd cry and I'd feel this stuff,
and that's not polite.

659
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,511
It'd make you uncomfortable.

660
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,548
You could laugh too.
Why would you cry?

661
00:58:09,748 --> 00:58:14,622
Well, I don't know.
For me, I just tend to cry.

662
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:16,922
Well, is the...?

663
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:20,985
Let's do it right now.
Let's have a holy moment.

664
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:49,083
Everything is layers.
There's the holy moment, then...

665
00:58:49,283 --> 00:58:54,957
...the awareness of it. Like in film,
the actual moment happens...

666
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:01,520
...then the character pretends to be
in a different reality. It's layers.

667
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:06,519
I was in and out of the holy moment,
looking at you.

668
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:09,807
You can't...
You're unique that way, Caveh.

669
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:15,607
That's one of the reasons I enjoy you.
You can bring me into that.

670
00:59:34,968 --> 00:59:41,168
If the world is false and nothing
is true, then everything is possible.

671
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:46,167
On the way to finding what we love, we
find what blocks us from our desire.

672
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:48,905
Comfort will never be comfortable.

673
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:51,905
A systematic questioning of happiness.

674
00:59:52,117 --> 00:59:58,017
Cut the vocal cords of every empowered
speaker and devalue currency.

675
00:59:58,217 --> 01:00:02,241
To confront the familiar.
Society is a fraud so complete...

676
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:07,079
...and venal, it demands
to be destroyed beyond memory.

677
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,516
If there's fire, we'll carry gas.

678
01:00:09,766 --> 01:00:14,203
Interrupt everyday experience
and the expectations that go with it.

679
01:00:14,429 --> 01:00:16,915
Live as if things depend
on your actions.

680
01:00:17,165 --> 01:00:20,728
Rupture the spell
of the consumer society...

681
01:00:20,941 --> 01:00:24,140
...so our repressed desires
can come forward.

682
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,740
Demonstrate what life is
and what it could be.

683
01:00:27,953 --> 01:00:31,240
To immerse ourselves
in the oblivion of actions.

684
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:35,677
There'll be an intensity never known.
To exchange love and hate...

685
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:38,252
...terror and redemption.

686
01:00:38,464 --> 01:00:44,789
Affirmation of freedom so reckless
it amounts to a denial of limitation.

687
01:00:55,963 --> 01:00:59,064
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm not sure.

688
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:02,413
You need any help getting down, sir?

689
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:06,075
No, I don't think so.

690
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:09,037
Stupid bastard.

691
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:12,313
No worse than us.
He's all action, no theory.

692
01:01:13,012 --> 01:01:15,712
We're all theory and no action.

693
01:01:25,062 --> 01:01:27,124
Why so glum, Mr. Deborg?

694
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:31,899
What was missing
was felt irretrievable.

695
01:01:32,437 --> 01:01:38,348
The extreme uncertainties
of subsisting without working...

696
01:01:38,548 --> 01:01:41,560
...made excesses necessary...

697
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:43,873
...and breaks definitive.

698
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,947
To quote Stevenson:

699
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,910
"Suicide carried off many.

700
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,560
Drink and the devil...

701
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,360
...took care of the rest. "

702
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:08,096
Hey!

703
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:11,159
Are you a dreamer?

704
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:14,059
Yeah.

705
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:19,746
I haven't seen too many around lately.

706
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:22,746
Things have been tough for dreamers.

707
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,020
They say dreaming's dead.
No one does it anymore.

708
01:02:27,658 --> 01:02:30,420
It's not dead.
It's just been forgotten.

709
01:02:30,895 --> 01:02:32,657
Removed from our language.

710
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:36,358
Nobody teaches it,
so no one knows it exists.

711
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,657
The dreamer's banished to obscurity.

712
01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:45,670
I'm trying to change that.
I hope you are too...

713
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:49,432
...by dreaming every day.

714
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:53,269
Dreaming with our hands and minds.

715
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:58,544
Our planet is facing the greatest
problems it's ever faced. Ever.

716
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:00,556
So don't be bored.

717
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:05,118
This is the most exciting time
we could have hoped to be alive.

718
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:07,756
And things are just starting.

719
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:27,780
A thousand years is an instant.
There's nothing new.

720
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:33,754
The same pattern over and over.
The same insights felt long ago.

721
01:03:33,917 --> 01:03:36,754
There's nothing here for me now.

722
01:03:36,953 --> 01:03:42,253
Now I remember. This happened
to me before. This is why I left.

723
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,153
You have begun to find answers.

724
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:49,103
Though difficult,
the rewards will be great.

725
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:54,103
Exercise your mind fully,
knowing it is only an exercise.

726
01:03:54,303 --> 01:03:59,040
Build artifacts, solve problems,
explore the secrets of the universe.

727
01:03:59,277 --> 01:04:01,539
Savor input from all the senses.

728
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:07,715
Feel joy, sorrow, laughter, empathy.
Tuck the memory in your travel bag.

729
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:11,414
I remember where I'm from
and how I became human.

730
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:14,914
Why I hung around.
Now my departure is scheduled.

731
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:20,689
This way out. Escaping velocity.
Not just eternity, but infinity.

732
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:50,387
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

733
01:04:56,299 --> 01:04:59,524
Could we do that again?
I know we haven't met...

734
01:04:59,736 --> 01:05:02,324
...but I don't want to be an ant.

735
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:06,836
We go through life
bouncing off one another...

736
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:09,799
...continuously on ant autopilot...

737
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:13,986
...with nothing really human
required of us.

738
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:17,348
Stop. Go. Walk here. Drive there.

739
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:20,023
All action basically for survival.

740
01:05:20,223 --> 01:05:24,185
All communication to keep
the ant colony buzzing along...

741
01:05:24,397 --> 01:05:26,860
...in an efficient, polite manner.

742
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:31,822
"Here's your change. "
"Paper or plastic?" "Credit or debit?"

743
01:05:32,035 --> 01:05:33,997
"Want ketchup with that?"

744
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:38,334
I don't want a straw,
I want real human moments.

745
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:41,771
I want to see you.
I want you to see me.

746
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:46,446
I don't want to give that up.
I don't want to be an ant, you know?

747
01:05:47,484 --> 01:05:49,809
Yeah, no...

748
01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:52,783
...I don't want to be an ant, either.

749
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:56,709
Thanks for kind of jostling me there.
I've been...

750
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:02,545
...on zombie autopilot. I don't feel
like an ant, but I look like one.

751
01:06:03,558 --> 01:06:07,395
D.H. Lawrence had this idea
of two people meeting...

752
01:06:07,595 --> 01:06:09,933
...and instead of just passing...

753
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:14,232
...they accept "the confrontation
between their souls. "

754
01:06:14,944 --> 01:06:19,032
It's like freeing the brave,
reckless gods within us all.

755
01:06:19,281 --> 01:06:21,869
Then it's like we have met.

756
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:27,244
I'm doing a project, maybe you'll be
interested. It's a soap opera...

757
01:06:27,444 --> 01:06:33,718
...and the characters are the fantasy
lives of the performers in it.

758
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:39,418
So figure out something you've always
wanted to do, or a life you want...

759
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:42,555
...something like that.
We write that in...

760
01:06:42,768 --> 01:06:49,255
...then you intersect with others
in some typical soap-opera fashion.

761
01:06:49,543 --> 01:06:54,343
Then I also want to show it live,
with the actors present.

762
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,404
So once the episode's screened...

763
01:06:57,542 --> 01:07:03,605
...the audience can direct the actors
for subsequent episodes with menus.

764
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:05,517
It has to do with choices...

765
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:10,591
...and honoring people's ability
to say what it is they want to see...

766
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:14,454
...and consumerism and art
and commodity...

767
01:07:14,654 --> 01:07:19,991
...and if you don't like it, send it
back, and you get what you pay for...

768
01:07:20,241 --> 01:07:23,965
...or just participating, you know,
making choices.

769
01:07:24,203 --> 01:07:26,290
So do you want to do it?

770
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:31,703
Yeah, that sounds really cool.
I'd love to be in it, but...

771
01:07:32,877 --> 01:07:38,177
...I gotta ask you a question first.
I don't know how to say it, but...

772
01:07:39,115 --> 01:07:42,990
What's it like to be a character
in a dream? Because...

773
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:47,789
...I'm not awake right now. I haven't
worn a watch since 4th grade.

774
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:51,226
I think this is the same watch too.

775
01:07:52,738 --> 01:07:56,189
I don't know if you're able
to answer that question.

776
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:01,488
I'm just trying to get a sense
of where I am and what's going on.

777
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,338
What about you? What's your name?

778
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:08,338
What's your address?
What are you doing?

779
01:08:10,338 --> 01:08:15,087
I can't really remember right now.
I can't really recall.

780
01:08:15,287 --> 01:08:20,787
But that's beside the point, whether
I can dredge up information about...

781
01:08:20,987 --> 01:08:26,324
...my address, or my mom's
maiden name or whatnot.

782
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:30,999
I've got the benefit in this reality,
if you call it that...

783
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:33,536
...of a consistent perspective.

784
01:08:33,736 --> 01:08:36,336
What is your consistent perspective?

785
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:40,299
It's mostly just me
dealing with a lot of people...

786
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:46,736
...who are exposing me
to information and ideas...

787
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:49,686
...that seem vaguely familiar.

788
01:08:49,886 --> 01:08:54,185
But at the same time,
it's all very alien to me.

789
01:08:54,386 --> 01:08:58,948
I'm not in an objective,
rational world.

790
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,622
Like, I've been flying around...

791
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:07,135
It's weird,
because it's not a fixed state.

792
01:09:07,335 --> 01:09:10,771
It's more like a whole spectrum
of awareness.

793
01:09:10,997 --> 01:09:14,372
The lucidity wavers.
Right now I know I'm dreaming.

794
01:09:14,572 --> 01:09:17,409
We're even talking about it. This is...

795
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:21,833
...the most in myself
and in my thoughts I've been so far.

796
01:09:22,046 --> 01:09:25,534
I'm talking about being in a dream.

797
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,846
But I'm beginning to think...

798
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:32,546
...it's something I don't have
any precedent for.

799
01:09:32,758 --> 01:09:35,458
It's totally unique.

800
01:09:35,695 --> 01:09:39,221
The quality of the environment...

801
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:44,557
...and the information I'm receiving.
Like your soap opera, for example.

802
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,395
That's a really cool idea!

803
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:50,969
I didn't come up with that.
It's outside myself...

804
01:09:51,182 --> 01:09:54,981
...like something transmitted
to me externally.

805
01:09:55,181 --> 01:09:57,206
I don't know what this is.

806
01:09:57,419 --> 01:10:02,044
We think we're so limited
by the world and the confines...

807
01:10:02,256 --> 01:10:04,744
...but we're really
just creating them.

808
01:10:04,956 --> 01:10:10,855
You keep trying to figure it out,
but now you know you're dreaming...

809
01:10:11,056 --> 01:10:15,518
...you can do anything.
You're dreaming, but you're awake.

810
01:10:15,768 --> 01:10:17,693
You have...

811
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:22,167
...so many options,
and that's what life is about.

812
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,892
I understand what you're saying.
It's up to me, I'm the dreamer.

813
01:10:27,105 --> 01:10:28,404
It's weird.

814
01:10:28,617 --> 01:10:30,629
So much of the information...

815
01:10:30,842 --> 01:10:33,542
...these people have been imparting...

816
01:10:33,742 --> 01:10:37,479
...has got this
really heavy connotation to it.

817
01:10:38,054 --> 01:10:40,379
Well, how do you feel?

818
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:43,878
Sometimes I feel kind of isolated.

819
01:10:44,128 --> 01:10:49,066
Most of the time, I feel connected,
engaged in this active process.

820
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:55,028
Which is weird. Most of the time
I've been passive, not responding...

821
01:10:55,228 --> 01:10:56,703
...except for now.

822
01:10:56,903 --> 01:10:59,465
I've let information wash over me.

823
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:03,877
It's not necessarily passive
to not respond verbally.

824
01:11:04,077 --> 01:11:09,315
We're communicating
on so many levels simultaneously.

825
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,877
Perhaps you're perceiving directly.

826
01:11:13,577 --> 01:11:18,990
Most of the people I've encountered
and the things I want to say...

827
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:23,064
...it's like they say it for me,
almost at my cue.

828
01:11:23,264 --> 01:11:27,364
It's complete unto itself.

829
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:31,188
It's not a bad dream.
It's a great dream.

830
01:11:31,401 --> 01:11:32,988
But...

831
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:37,826
...it's so unlike any other dream
I've ever had before.

832
01:11:38,038 --> 01:11:41,076
It's like "the" dream.

833
01:11:42,275 --> 01:11:44,538
It's like I'm being prepared
for something.

834
01:12:13,974 --> 01:12:17,536
"On this bridge," Lorca warns...

835
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:19,810
..."life is not a dream.

836
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:21,873
Beware and...

837
01:12:22,123 --> 01:12:26,110
...beware and beware. "

838
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:31,623
So many think because "then"
happened, "now" isn't.

839
01:12:31,823 --> 01:12:37,272
But didn't I mention? The ongoing
"wow" is happening right now.

840
01:12:37,472 --> 01:12:40,797
We are all coauthors
of this dancing exuberance...

841
01:12:40,972 --> 01:12:43,996
...where even our inabilities
are having a roast.

842
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:48,834
We are the authors of ourselves,
coauthoring a Dostoyevsky novel...

843
01:12:49,046 --> 01:12:50,771
...starring clowns.

844
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:53,609
This thing we're involved with,
the world...

845
01:12:53,846 --> 01:12:58,371
...is an opportunity to exhibit
how exciting alienation can be.

846
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:01,321
Life is a matter of a miracle...

847
01:13:01,521 --> 01:13:06,583
...collected by moments flabbergasted
to be in each other's presence.

848
01:13:06,795 --> 01:13:08,345
The world is an exam...

849
01:13:08,558 --> 01:13:12,295
...to see if we can rise
into the direct experiences.

850
01:13:12,496 --> 01:13:16,095
Eyesight is a test
to see if we can see beyond it.

851
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:19,208
Matter is a test for our curiosity.

852
01:13:19,407 --> 01:13:22,494
Doubt is an exam for our vitality.

853
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:28,606
Thomas Mann wrote that he would rather
participate in life than write.

854
01:13:28,944 --> 01:13:33,044
Giacometti was once run down by a car.

855
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:36,519
He recalled falling
into a lucid faint...

856
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,519
...a sudden exhilaration...

857
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,381
...as he realized
something was happening to him.

858
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:47,418
One assumes you can't understand
life and live simultaneously.

859
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:52,168
I don't agree entirely. Which is
to say, I don't exactly disagree.

860
01:13:52,506 --> 01:13:57,305
I would say that life understood
is life lived.

861
01:13:57,505 --> 01:13:59,667
But the paradoxes bug me.

862
01:13:59,867 --> 01:14:04,567
I can learn to love, and make love,
to the paradoxes that bug me.

863
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:07,279
And on romantic evenings of self...

864
01:14:07,517 --> 01:14:10,541
...I go salsa dancing
with my confusion.

865
01:14:10,816 --> 01:14:13,979
Before you drift off, don't forget...

866
01:14:14,192 --> 01:14:15,979
...which is to say, remember.

867
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:21,316
Because remembering is so much more
a psychotic activity than forgetting.

868
01:14:21,529 --> 01:14:24,003
Lorca, in that same poem, said...

869
01:14:24,203 --> 01:14:28,503
...that the iguana will bite
those who do not dream.

870
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:32,666
And, as one realizes...

871
01:14:32,865 --> 01:14:38,315
...that one is a dream figure
in another person's dream...

872
01:14:39,015 --> 01:14:42,452
...that is self-awareness.

873
01:15:06,938 --> 01:15:09,926
You haven't met yourself yet.

874
01:15:11,576 --> 01:15:15,775
But the advantage to meeting others
in the meantime...

875
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:20,713
...is that one of them
may present you to yourself.

876
01:15:22,688 --> 01:15:27,512
Examine the nature of everything
you observe.

877
01:15:27,725 --> 01:15:30,987
For instance,
you might find yourself...

878
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:35,562
...walking through
a dream parking lot.

879
01:15:35,762 --> 01:15:39,799
And, yes, those are dream feet
inside your dream shoes.

880
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,061
Part of your dream self.

881
01:15:42,274 --> 01:15:45,899
And so, the person you appear to be
in the dream...

882
01:15:46,148 --> 01:15:48,911
...cannot be who you really are.

883
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,136
This is an image...

884
01:15:51,348 --> 01:15:54,011
...a mental model.

885
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:19,634
- Do you remember me?
- No, I don't think so.

886
01:16:20,146 --> 01:16:25,134
At the station? You were on the
pay phone and you looked at me...

887
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,309
...a few times.

888
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:31,709
I remember that,
but I don't remember that being you.

889
01:16:32,584 --> 01:16:34,609
Are you sure?

890
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:39,158
Maybe not.

891
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,682
I was sitting down...

892
01:16:41,895 --> 01:16:44,883
...and you were looking at me.

893
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:43,255
My little friend, dream no more.
It's really here.

894
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,755
It's called Efferdent Plus.

895
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:51,191
In hell, you sink. In heaven, you rise
to your fullness of love.

896
01:17:52,354 --> 01:17:56,016
Hurry up! Come on, get in the car.
Let's go.

897
01:17:56,529 --> 01:18:00,553
The story goes like this:
Billy Wilder runs into Louis Malle.

898
01:18:00,803 --> 01:18:03,141
This was the late '50s, early '60s.

899
01:18:03,341 --> 01:18:08,041
Malle had just made his most expensive
film, which cost $ 21/2 million.

900
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:10,940
Wilder asks him what the film's about.

901
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:13,978
Malle says, "It's a dream
within a dream. "

902
01:18:14,178 --> 01:18:17,352
Wilder says,
"You just lost $ 21/2 million. "

903
01:18:18,552 --> 01:18:21,077
I feel a little apprehensive.

904
01:18:28,426 --> 01:18:31,401
For years, the notion
that life is a dream...

905
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:35,726
...has been a pervasive theme
of philosophers and poets.

906
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:40,101
Doesn't it make sense that death
would be wrapped in a dream?

907
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:46,300
That, after death, your conscious life
would continue in a dream body?

908
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:50,875
It would be the same dream body
as in your everyday dream life...

909
01:18:51,088 --> 01:18:56,313
...except that in the post-mortal
state, you could never again wake up.

910
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:59,425
Never again return
to your physical body.

911
01:19:10,062 --> 01:19:15,861
As the pattern gets more intricate,
being swept along isn't enough.

912
01:19:38,623 --> 01:19:40,460
What's the word, turd?

913
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:46,135
- Hey, do you also drive a boat-car?
- A what?

914
01:19:46,497 --> 01:19:50,135
You gave me a ride in a car
that was also a boat.

915
01:19:50,347 --> 01:19:54,897
No, I don't have a "boat-car. "
I don't know what you mean.

916
01:19:55,109 --> 01:20:00,696
This must be parallel universe night.
That cat who just ran out the door?

917
01:20:00,909 --> 01:20:03,546
He comes up and I say,
"What's the word?"

918
01:20:03,747 --> 01:20:07,521
He lays down a burrito,
looks at me and says:

919
01:20:07,746 --> 01:20:10,521
"I've returned
from the valley of death.

920
01:20:10,758 --> 01:20:13,745
I rapturously breathe in
the odors of life.

921
01:20:13,996 --> 01:20:20,132
I've been to oblivion. I ferment
the desire to remember everything. "

922
01:20:22,332 --> 01:20:24,357
So, what did you say to that?

923
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,070
Well, I mean, what could I say?

924
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:31,044
I said, "If you microwave that,
poke holes in the plastic...

925
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:36,369
...because they explode,
and I'm tired of cleaning up burrito. "

926
01:20:41,494 --> 01:20:43,419
The jalapeÃ±os dry up.

927
01:20:44,293 --> 01:20:46,618
They're like little wheels.

928
01:20:50,231 --> 01:20:53,556
When it was over,
all I could think about was how...

929
01:20:53,768 --> 01:20:57,330
...this entire notion of oneself...

930
01:20:57,543 --> 01:20:58,530
...what we are...

931
01:20:58,743 --> 01:21:02,430
...is just this logical structure.

932
01:21:02,643 --> 01:21:07,668
A place to momentarily house
all the abstractions.

933
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:10,767
It was a time to become conscious...

934
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:15,279
...to give form and coherence
to the mystery.

935
01:21:15,517 --> 01:21:18,917
And I had been a part of that.
It was a gift.

936
01:21:20,129 --> 01:21:25,529
Life was raging all around me,
and every moment was magical.

937
01:21:26,092 --> 01:21:32,366
I loved all the people, dealing with
all the contradictory impulses.

938
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:37,340
That's what I loved the most,
connecting with the people.

939
01:21:37,878 --> 01:21:41,278
Looking back, that's all
that really mattered.

940
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:43,362
Kierkegaard's last words were,
"Sweep me up. "

941
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:41,364
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

942
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:53,675
Weren't you in the boat-car?
The guy with the hat gave me a ride...

943
01:25:53,876 --> 01:25:57,612
...in his car-boat thing.
You were in the back seat.

944
01:25:57,825 --> 01:26:01,413
I'm not saying you don't know
what you're talking about...

945
01:26:01,626 --> 01:26:04,112
...but I don't know
what you're talking about.

946
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:09,625
You guys let me off at this specific
spot you gave him directions to.

947
01:26:09,825 --> 01:26:12,425
I get out,
ended up getting hit by a car.

948
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,825
Then I woke up. I was dreaming.

949
01:26:15,075 --> 01:26:20,624
Later I found out I was still
dreaming, dreaming that I'd woken up.

950
01:26:20,874 --> 01:26:24,074
False awakenings,
I used to have those a lot.

951
01:26:24,273 --> 01:26:27,799
But I'm still in it now.
I can't get out of it.

952
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:33,135
It's been going on forever.
I keep waking up into another dream.

953
01:26:33,348 --> 01:26:37,349
I'm getting creeped out, like
I'm talking to dead people.

954
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,823
This woman on TV tells me how death...

955
01:26:41,023 --> 01:26:44,985
...is this dream-time
that exists out of life.

956
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:48,922
I'm starting to think I'm dead.

957
01:26:51,335 --> 01:26:53,622
Let me tell you about a dream I had.

958
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:59,110
When someone says that, usually
you're in for a very boring few minutes.

959
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:01,835
But what else are you gonna do?

960
01:27:02,046 --> 01:27:07,171
- I read this essay by Philip K. Dick.
- In your dream?

961
01:27:07,384 --> 01:27:11,246
No, I read it before the dream.
It was the preamble.

962
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:15,146
It was about that book,
Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.

963
01:27:15,358 --> 01:27:20,583
- He won an award for that one.
- That's the one he wrote really fast.

964
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:25,233
It just flowed out of him.
He felt he was channeling it.

965
01:27:25,433 --> 01:27:28,795
So four years later,
he was at this party.

966
01:27:29,007 --> 01:27:32,770
He met a woman with the same name
as the woman in the book.

967
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:36,870
Her boyfriend had the same name
as the boyfriend in the book.

968
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:40,269
She had an affair
with the chief of police.

969
01:27:40,482 --> 01:27:44,007
He had the same name
as the chief in his book.

970
01:27:44,219 --> 01:27:47,982
Everything she's saying
is right out of his book.

971
01:27:48,182 --> 01:27:51,744
That really freaks him out,
but what can he do?

972
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:55,156
Shortly after that,
he was mailing a letter...

973
01:27:55,393 --> 01:28:00,568
...and he saw this kind of
shady-looking guy standing by his car.

974
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:05,706
But instead of avoiding him,
he said, "Can I help you?"

975
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,306
The guy said, "I ran out of gas. "

976
01:28:08,506 --> 01:28:12,630
He hands him some money,
which he never would've done.

977
01:28:12,843 --> 01:28:14,568
He gets home and thinks:

978
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:18,805
"This guy can't get to a gas station.
He's out of gas. "

979
01:28:19,017 --> 01:28:24,316
So he goes back, finds the guy
and takes him to a gas station.

980
01:28:24,654 --> 01:28:28,591
As he pulls up he thinks,
"This is in my book too.

981
01:28:28,966 --> 01:28:32,479
This exact station. This exact guy.
Everything. "

982
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:36,104
So this whole episode
is kind of creepy, right?

983
01:28:36,304 --> 01:28:40,328
He's telling his priest
how he wrote this book...

984
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:43,966
...and four years later
all these things happened.

985
01:28:44,165 --> 01:28:47,941
And the priest says,
"That's the Book of Acts. "

986
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:50,703
He's like, "I've never read it. "

987
01:28:50,915 --> 01:28:54,815
So he reads the Book of Acts,
and it's uncanny.

988
01:28:55,015 --> 01:28:58,815
Even the characters' names
are the same as in the Bible.

989
01:28:59,015 --> 01:29:02,614
The Book of Acts
takes place in 50 A.D.

990
01:29:02,864 --> 01:29:06,789
So Dick had this theory
that time was an illusion...

991
01:29:07,027 --> 01:29:09,189
...and that we were all in 50 A.D.

992
01:29:09,402 --> 01:29:13,164
The reason he wrote this book
was that he somehow...

993
01:29:13,364 --> 01:29:16,501
...punctured through
this veil of time.

994
01:29:16,839 --> 01:29:20,926
He'd seen what was going on
in the Book of Acts.

995
01:29:21,139 --> 01:29:25,551
He was really into Gnosticism
and the idea that this demon...

996
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:29,513
...created this illusion of time
to make us forget...

997
01:29:29,713 --> 01:29:35,051
...that Christ was to return
and the kingdom of God would arrive.

998
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:39,887
Someone's trying to make us forget
that God is imminent.

999
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,562
That's what time and history is.

1000
01:29:42,762 --> 01:29:46,824
This kind of continuous
daydream or distraction.

1001
01:29:47,037 --> 01:29:51,799
I read it and thought, "That's weird. "
And that night I had a dream.

1002
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:55,336
There was this guy who
was supposed to be psychic.

1003
01:29:55,536 --> 01:29:58,561
But I was, like,
"He's not really a psychic. "

1004
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:03,736
Then suddenly I start floating,
levitating up to the ceiling.

1005
01:30:04,086 --> 01:30:09,210
As I almost go through the roof,
I'm like, "Okay, I believe you. "

1006
01:30:09,461 --> 01:30:13,260
And I float down,
and as my feet touch the ground...

1007
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:18,060
...the psychic turns into a woman
in a green dress, Lady Gregory.

1008
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:21,698
Lady Gregory was Yeats' patron,
this Irish person.

1009
01:30:21,898 --> 01:30:24,334
Though I'd never seen her image...

1010
01:30:24,534 --> 01:30:28,834
...I was sure that this was
the face of Lady Gregory.

1011
01:30:29,034 --> 01:30:31,509
So Lady Gregory turns to me and says:

1012
01:30:31,709 --> 01:30:34,935
"Let me explain
the nature of the universe.

1013
01:30:35,147 --> 01:30:39,209
Philip K. Dick is right about time,
but wrong that it's 50 A.D.

1014
01:30:39,409 --> 01:30:44,371
Actually, there's only one instant,
right now. And it's eternity.

1015
01:30:44,621 --> 01:30:49,758
It's an instant in which God
is posing a question, which is:

1016
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:55,121
'Do you wanna be one with eternity,
do you wanna be in heaven? '

1017
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:59,296
And we're all saying,
'No, thank you. Not just yet. "'

1018
01:30:59,508 --> 01:31:04,058
So time is just this constant
saying no to God's invitation.

1019
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:08,608
That's what time is.
It's no more 50 A.D. Than it's 2001.

1020
01:31:08,807 --> 01:31:12,970
There's just one instant,
and that's what we're always in.

1021
01:31:13,382 --> 01:31:18,206
Then she tells me that this is
the narrative of everyone's life.

1022
01:31:18,419 --> 01:31:22,444
Behind the huge difference,
there is but one story...

1023
01:31:22,694 --> 01:31:25,156
...of moving from the no
to the yes.

1024
01:31:25,394 --> 01:31:28,381
All of life is,
"No, thank you. No, thank you. "

1025
01:31:28,594 --> 01:31:31,318
Then ultimately it's, "Yes, I give in.

1026
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:35,905
Yes, I accept. Yes, I embrace. "
That's the journey.

1027
01:31:36,105 --> 01:31:39,942
Everyone gets to the yes
in the end, right?

1028
01:31:40,143 --> 01:31:41,155
Right.

1029
01:31:41,368 --> 01:31:45,143
So we continue walking,
and my dog runs over to me.

1030
01:31:45,343 --> 01:31:48,105
I'm so happy.
He's been dead for years.

1031
01:31:48,355 --> 01:31:52,155
So I'm petting him,
and there's this gross stuff...

1032
01:31:52,355 --> 01:31:54,680
...coming out of his stomach.

1033
01:31:54,892 --> 01:31:57,879
I look over at Lady Gregory,
and she coughs.

1034
01:31:58,092 --> 01:32:00,116
She's like, "Excuse me. "

1035
01:32:00,329 --> 01:32:04,754
And vomit dribbles down her chin.
It smells really bad.

1036
01:32:04,954 --> 01:32:09,804
And I think,
"That's not just the smell of vomit.

1037
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:15,129
That's the smell of dead-person vomit. "
So it's, like, doubly foul.

1038
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:20,740
I realize I'm in the land of the dead.
Everyone around me was dead.

1039
01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:24,878
My dog had been dead 10 years,
Lady Gregory a lot longer.

1040
01:32:25,078 --> 01:32:28,915
When I woke up, I was like,
"That wasn't a dream.

1041
01:32:29,115 --> 01:32:33,352
That was a visitation
to this place, the land of the dead. "

1042
01:32:33,552 --> 01:32:36,052
So how did you finally get out of it?

1043
01:32:36,252 --> 01:32:40,427
It was, like, one of those
life-altering experiences.

1044
01:32:40,627 --> 01:32:43,727
I never looked at the world
the same way again.

1045
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:47,201
But how did you finally
get out of the dream?

1046
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:50,101
That's my problem. I'm trapped.

1047
01:32:50,302 --> 01:32:55,139
I keep thinking I'm waking up,
but I'm still in a dream.

1048
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:59,439
I wanna wake up for real.
How do you really wake up?

1049
01:32:59,676 --> 01:33:03,413
I don't know.
I'm not very good at that anymore.

1050
01:33:03,613 --> 01:33:08,651
But if that's what you're thinking,
you should, if you can.

1051
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:11,912
Because someday, you won't be able to.

1052
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,088
But it's easy. You know, just wake up.
