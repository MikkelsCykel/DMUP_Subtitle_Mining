It's there before breakfast.

 And the handprints
on the wall

 They remind you
how it's endless

 How endlessly you fall

No.

00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:32,860
Just a friend.

335
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:36,314
We've met before.

336
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:38,899
You were outside
my aunt's house.

337
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:43,171
I don't mean then.

338
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,515
Look at me and think.

339
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,187
I don't know.
In a facility?

340
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:04,058
No. No.

341
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:08,496
I mean, I'm not all
Suzy Creamcheese or whatever.

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,815
Think you can find
your way home?

346
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,935
Take it.

347
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,772
You really don't
remember me?

348
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,207
No.

349
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,945
I didn't look like this.

350
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,914
Get home safe.

351
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,817
It was right before
your parents.

352
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,687
By the river.

353
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:01,949
I guess nothing ever happens
the way you think it will.

354
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,312

00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:33,598
I'm going to be gone
for a couple of days.

358
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,233
I got to look after
that Komenko kid.

359
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,304
Now this is where
you tell me

360
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,439
to keep my hat on.

361
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,029
And I tell you
I don't have one.

362
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,352
You'd laugh,
wouldn't you, baby?

363
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,292
Same old dumb joke.

364
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:07,965
Hey, can you think
of a nastier word

365
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,701
than "sneeze guard"?

366
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:14,138
I mean, it's this close to, like,
"snot window" or something.

367
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,276
Hey, what's this?

368
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,779
Um, I think it's curry.

369
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:22,996
Oh, cool!

370
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:25,733
I've never had it before.

371
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,444

372
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,721

God.

376
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:20,388
Geminis are indecisive.
About most things.

377
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:22,089
Not about
important stuff, though.

378
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:24,258
About important stuff,
once I make up my mind--

379
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:25,526
Do Leos ever do that?

380
00:32:25,593 --> 00:32:28,496
Just, like,
go after something?

381
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,467
You still have
to tell me where we met.

382
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:45,262
Picture a river.

383

"Do Your Ears Hang Low?"]

385
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:59,760
 Can you tie them
in a knot? 

386
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:03,114
 Can you tie them
in a bow? 

387
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,998
 Can you throw them
over your shoulder 

388
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,484
 Like a Continental
soldier? 

389
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,528
 Do your ears hang low? 

390
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:11,355
 Do your ears
stand high? 

391
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,990
 Do they point up
to the sky? 

392
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,208
 Do they droop
when they're wet-- 

393
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,408
- Hey.
- Hi.

394
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,843
You lost?

395
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,464
What are you doing
out here?

396
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:40,902
Just exploring around.

397
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,574
 Do your ears hang high? 

398
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:48,309
 Do they point
up to the sky? 

399
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:49,744
 Do they droop
when they're wet? 

400
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:51,646
 Do they stiffen
when they're dry? 

401
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,380
 Can you semaphore
your neighbor 

402
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,782
 With a minimum
of labor? 

403
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,486
 Do your ears
stand high? 

404
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,844
Anything?

405
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,250
You were just
exploring around.

406
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,121
You remember me?

407
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,316
Oh, my God.

408
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,816
Here you go.

409
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,087
Yeah, of course
I remember you.

410
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,790
You were the detective
on the case.

411
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,912
I was concerned when I
saw you at my door.

412
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,997
I apologize. I didn't think.

413
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,915
Why are you here?

414
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:48,252
Eric doesn't have
a parole officer, right?

415
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,555
No. No, he doesn't.

416
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,506
And I'm pretty much
retired, actually.

417
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,275
You know, actually,

418
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,209
I just had the weekend off,
so I thought I'd--

419
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:58,646
So you came down
to Lakewood?

420
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,833
I just thought
I would come down

421
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,169
and make sure his transition
was a healthy one, that's all.

422
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,537
Should I be asking

423
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,422
if your agenda
is a healthy one?

424
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,558
Yes, it is.

425
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,594
And I appreciate you
asking me that question.

426
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,530
I'm-- I'm sure it wasn't easy.

427
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,350
Can I ask you how, uh--

428
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:23,254
how you are with him here?

429
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,873
It's hard, you know.

430
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:30,311
When I was in the courtroom,

431
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,446
all I kept thinking was, uh,

432
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,415
thank God they haven't
called me to testify

433
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:37,852
because I'd have
to tell the truth...

434
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:44,291
about how our family
is damaged, so damaged.

435
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,478
We never talked
about anything,

436
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,314
and Eric just sat there
in the middle of it,

437
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:53,267
and my sister's, uh,

438
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:55,452
I don't know.

439
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,756
She was terrified
of the world.

440
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,026
This one and the next.

441
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:07,664
I'm not a believer
in medicating adolescents,

442
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,034
but my sister
had a teenage boy.

443
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:15,122
She had no clue
how to deal with him,

444
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,341
so she drugged
the feelings out of him.

445
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:24,965
Still, he killed his mom.

446
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,726
He said
he was going to Albany

447
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,195
to look at campuses.

448
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:43,000
I've been a teacher
for 14 years.

449
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:46,136
I have a pretty good sense
when a kid's lying.

450
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,877
Well, uh...

451
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,678
I might take a run up there

452
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,380
to see that he
checked in okay.

453
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,334
Thank you.

454
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:09,010
You have a very nice house.

455
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:22,273
You want to see something?

456
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,275
I got a lucky star tattoo.

457
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,528
Uh-huh.

someone else's face on my body,
like, on the internet,

460
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:33,450
I'll know,
and I can really sue them.

461
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,286
You're a freak.

It's just ball point.

463
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,078
I got bored last night
and drew it on.

No tats, no piercings.

466
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,991
Did they let you listen
to music in there?

467
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:59,126
No.

468
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,095
I can teach you.

469
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:03,197
I know all the new music.

470
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,373

There's a train station
in this next town,

00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,344

[radio shuts off]

00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:23,918
So I'll give you some cash
for the train back to Buffalo.

480
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:26,637
But I just thought I'd
take one back from Albany.

481
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,175
Look, you're cool,
Lori, really,

482
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:35,295
but I-- I need to be
alone, okay? I--

483
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,531
I need to make
a fresh start.

484
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:42,987
Well,
aren't I a fresh start?

485
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,439
It doesn't get much
fresher than old Lori.

486
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:52,863
I'm basically a virgin.

487
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,566
That has nothing
to do with it.

488
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,138
I just need to stay
focused, all right?

489
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,541
When I find a college,
I'll send you my email.

490
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,843
We can write. Okay?

491
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,545
I wouldn't tell her.

492
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,283
I mean, really,
there's nothing to tell.

493
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,468
But if there were,

494
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:16,503
it would just be
what happens, right?

495
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,272
What are you
talking about?

496

00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:21,024
I don't have a girlfriend.

498
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,693
You were saying her name.

499
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,229
I what?

500
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,163
When I was in the back,
I wasn't--

501
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,666
I wasn't eavesdropping
or anything.

502
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,863
He just
kept saying her name,

503
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:32,369
like "Maria, Maria.
Hey, Maria."

504
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,005
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

505
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,698
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

506
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:37,958
Maria, Maria, Maria--

507
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:38,892
Just stop.

508
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:48,735
I'm sorry.

509
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,132
I didn't mean
to poke fun at you.

510
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:54,884
I guess I'm just jealous.

511
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:58,678
I don't know
what you think you heard.

512
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,182
There's no girlfriend.

513
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:02,483
Really?

514
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:05,485
Yeah.

515
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:10,974
That's cool.

516
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,153

00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,139
Maria.

521
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,944
Maria.

522
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,245
Yeah.

523
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:28,668
You sure?

524
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:34,141
I was right there.

525
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,946
That's pretty weird.

526
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,646
Mmm.

[Woman]
Do you want us to pick him up?

550
00:45:36,184 --> 00:45:37,985
No, no. Don't--
Don't pick him up.

551
00:45:38,052 --> 00:45:39,119
Just, uh,

552
00:45:39,187 --> 00:45:40,587
just tell me
where he is.

553
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,788
Okay.
We're here.

554
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:43,457
Okay? If someone
spots him, let me know.

555
00:45:43,524 --> 00:45:44,724
Okay,
we'll call you.

00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:46,493
You have a nice day
now, John.

Okay, Hazel, I will.
Thank you.

Somebody
had to do number 2.

Let's go.

563
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:27,594
Those
are probably dirty.

564
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,213
You wouldn't say that
if you had one.

565
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:32,482
They're so fucking good.

Mm. Mmm.

00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,603

Wouldn't you love
to go out on a boat?

I've never been on one.

572
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:01,644

Why can't you swim?

Aren't parents supposed to
teach you stuff like that?

577
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,471
My mom can't swim,
either.

578
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,515
I lied before.

579
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:43,536
When I said
I was a virgin.

580
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:45,622
Maybe I am. I don't know.

581
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,469
Mom has always just--

582
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,306
been kind of a pervert magnet.

583
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:05,789
I guess she still is.

584
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:10,580
Gary just seems nice
because he's quiet

585
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:13,316
and he doesn't drink, and...

586
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,685
he acts pretty dad-like.

587
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,658
Mostly.

588
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,203

on this camping trip.

The bonding weekend.

591
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:51,921
He said since I got wet,
that was a sign I wanted it.

to me it's spring

on someone's door

00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,134
and ask for the bathroom.

Wow. This is so cool.

611
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,055
I wonder why they left.

612
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:50,923
We shouldn't be here.

613
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,225
Look.

614
00:51:53,394 --> 00:51:54,661
They took seven photos.

[clicking film advance]

616
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,432
We should get them developed
and see what happened to them.

00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,667
Here.

[shutter clicks]

What if these people
are, like, serial killers

620
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,362
and there are seven photos
of seven bodies in here

621
00:52:06,363 --> 00:52:06,937
and then us?

622
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:09,305
So we get them developed,
and the cops arrest us

623
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,674
and we seem totally guilty
because of your record and all.

624
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,181
That would be freaky.
Let's get one together.

No. One sec.

No, thanks.

I'm just trying
to show you a good time.

I'm fun to have around.

or you can leave.

Hey! Can we get
a couple of beers?

653
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,727
So did you have
a lot of friends?

654
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:30,897
So no one visited?

655
00:57:30,964 --> 00:57:32,498
No.

656
00:57:36,904 --> 00:57:38,537
This cop.

657
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:43,209
He was a do-gooder.

658
00:57:43,277 --> 00:57:44,777
What do you mean?

659
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,606
He was just too easy.

00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:51,069
- Easy?
- Yeah.

661
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:54,053
Easy like most people
are easy.

662
00:57:57,624 --> 00:58:01,377
Once he told me
about his sick wife.

663
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:04,294
From then on, all I had to do
was bring her up, and he'd go quiet.

664
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:09,785
This one time,
I called him a...

there's no violence,

Is she

Get away from him!
She's a liar!

Get the fuck away from him!

01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:12,035
She's lying to you!
She's a liar!

- It's a trap!
- Lori, you're crazy!

Why would you come here?
Why would you follow me here?

We can see you!

No? Come on.
Let's go.

879
01:17:49,982 --> 01:17:51,849
Stay where you are, Eric.
Stay where you are.

880
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,418
Step away from each other.
Step away!

No, you cannot
do this to me!

882
01:17:55,187 --> 01:17:56,442
Shut up!
Put your hands on your head.

883

You cannot detain me!
You can't do this--

01:17:57,861 --> 01:18:00,153
Put your hands on your head!
Kneel down now! Both of you!

885
01:18:02,527 --> 01:18:03,962
Kneel.

886
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,468
Who the fuck are you?

887
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:14,672
Lorelei Jane Cranston.

888
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,225
- How old are you?
-16.

889
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:19,260
I have my parents' permission
to be here.

890
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:27,018
Eric, with your left hand,
empty your pockets.

891
01:18:27,086 --> 01:18:28,686
Slowly.

892
01:18:35,027 --> 01:18:36,628
Both pockets.

893
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,416
You can't detain me.

894
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:45,313
No, you're right.
I can't.

895
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:47,950
But I can detain her.

896
01:18:47,985 --> 01:18:49,791
Nothing was going to happen.

897
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:50,587
Yeah?

898
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:52,113
What were you doing?

899
01:18:52,463 --> 01:18:55,364
I know what you were doing.
You were trying to entrap me!

900
01:18:55,874 --> 01:18:57,510
You were trying
to entrap me.

901
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:00,403
Stand.
Drop your hands.

902
01:19:00,919 --> 01:19:03,738
From you, I'm going to need
a phone number. Come with me.

903
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:07,442
Stand up, pal.

904
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:16,050
[Cristofuoro] Well, can you get
her mother to call me?

905
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,852
When she can.

906
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,504
You do that.

907
01:19:19,571 --> 01:19:22,457
[Officer] Get a statement from Eric
before we let him go.

908

[Officer #2]
Great. Wait up.

909
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,385
You get Gary?

910
01:19:33,452 --> 01:19:35,519
[sighs]
Yeah.

912
01:19:37,256 --> 01:19:39,157
Surprise, surprise.

913
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:44,229
Do you know
who this kid is?

914
01:19:45,931 --> 01:19:49,334
Do you have any idea
what he's done?

915
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:52,270
He is not someone you can trust.
You understand?

916
01:19:53,339 --> 01:19:55,206
Eric says you're a liar.

917
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,995
[car door closes]

918
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:03,731
I have to let you go.

919
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,835
But when I do,
if you stay with him,

920
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:10,404
there is nothing I can do
to protect you.

921
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:13,407
I can't even
have you followed.

922
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,343
So before that happens,

923
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,812
you're going
to hear me out.

924
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,741
That kid is a killer.

925
01:20:20,165 --> 01:20:21,523
I know that.

926
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,286
Everyone knows
about his parents.

927
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:26,563
I'm with him
because I want to be.

928
01:20:26,663 --> 01:20:27,864
Not just his parents.

929
01:20:28,517 --> 01:20:30,944
He only killed them, because
they'd found out what he'd done.

930
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:33,895
I could show you
photographs of a girl--

931
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,596
Alicia Vargas.

932
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,099
A girl just like you.

933
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,005
She was breathing
and laughing and watching TV

934
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,404
and thinking she might like a boyfriend,
and now she's dead--

935
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:45,438
in the ground,
cold and dead.

936
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:47,494
And there was another girl.

937
01:20:47,495 --> 01:20:49,460
She went missing
around the same time.

938
01:20:49,528 --> 01:20:51,445
Sophia Tersa.

939
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,648
My guess is when
we find her body,

940
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:56,267
we'll find she went
just the same way.

941
01:20:56,335 --> 01:20:59,403
Lorelei, Eric liked
Alicia and Sophia.

942
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,459
Just the same way
I'm sure he likes you.

943
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:08,362
He doesn't like me like me.

944
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,635
[sigh]

945
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:18,272
We're just friends.

946
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:23,094
If you're just friends, what did he tell you
he was doing with Maria?

947
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:27,782
What? Did he say he wasn't
going to hurt her?

948
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,234
Just hook up with her?

949
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:35,940
I know that bothers you.

950
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:39,243
It's my choice.

951
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:48,186
And I'm just trying
to help you make a good one.

952
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:52,774
He told me about you.

953
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:59,346
Told me all about you
and your sick wife.

954
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,755
You're just a small beans cop
with a vegetable wife.

[Officer]
Here you go, Mac.

956
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,942
[Officer #2] He's done, fellas.
He's going home.

957
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:37,618
Good work tonight.

958
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,586
When do I get to go home?

959
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,689
Just a couple more minutes,
and I'll give you a ride home.

960
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,858
What do you want
to do now, John?

961
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:47,061
I'm going home.

Lori.

966
01:23:19,377 --> 01:23:21,128
I'm sorry.

967
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:22,797
I didn't...

968
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:24,799
You don't
owe me anything.

969
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:22,340
I was wrong.

970
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,978
You do owe me something.

It's cooler out here
than I thought it would be.

Mmm. Pretty much dead.

Tell me I'm pretty,

You are pretty.

979
01:26:28,951 --> 01:26:30,384
Yeah.

[coughing]
Take it!

1002
01:28:17,517 --> 01:28:19,627
Come on.
Please, grab it!

1003
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,496
Grab it, please!

[Eric]
That's it.

1020
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,909
She just fell in.

1021
01:31:08,113 --> 01:31:09,723
And I tried to save her.

1022
01:31:11,249 --> 01:31:14,001
I didn't kill her,
Lieutenant.

1023
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:18,972
No, I know you didn't.

1024
01:31:22,444 --> 01:31:23,577
I should get off this bus

1025
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:26,681
and talk to the D.A.
on your behalf.

1026
01:31:32,771 --> 01:31:34,639
Here's the thing.

1027
01:31:36,508 --> 01:31:38,643
You do belong here, Eric.

1028
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:53,340
I say we take this
any way it comes.

My wife wanted to say hi.

01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:19,132
She wanted me to tell you
she's not paralyzed.

1032
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,836
She might be fucked,
but she ain't no vegetable.

[Cristofuoro, narrating]
My wife likes to say

1037
01:33:55,947 --> 01:33:57,881
there are two kinds
of people.

1038
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:01,552
Those chasing pleasure...

1039
01:34:03,321 --> 01:34:05,855
and those running from pain.

1040
01:34:24,192 --> 01:34:26,193
Maybe she's right.

1041
01:34:27,045 --> 01:34:29,613
I don't know.

1042
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,582
What I do know is this.

1043
01:34:35,287 --> 01:34:38,222
Pleasure helps you forget.

1044
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,960
But pain--

1045
01:34:46,497 --> 01:34:48,933
pain forces you to hope.

1046
01:34:52,304 --> 01:34:54,471
You tell yourself

1047
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:58,875
"This can't last."

1048
01:35:06,651 --> 01:35:08,735
"Today could be different."

1049
01:35:19,497 --> 01:35:21,431
"Today...

1050
01:35:21,499 --> 01:35:23,634
something just might change."
