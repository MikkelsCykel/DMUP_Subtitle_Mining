1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:03,284
uh, John, you know.

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:06,323
He was more puny-like.

3
00:00:06,357 --> 00:00:09,292
But all the time
I was workin' for him...

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,294
I was just so scared.

5
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:14,126
Inside, you know?
Just scared.

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,397
Haven, do you think we could
get Connie out to the rally?

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,907
Connie White and Barbara Jean never
appear on the same stage together.

8
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:26,239
Connie can replace Barbara Jean,
but that's it.

9
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:29,571
As for Haven Hamilton, well,

10
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,741
I'll appear wherever
Barbara Jean appears.

11
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:36,953
I got a good mind
to take you outside.

12
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,457
With my wife in the hospital,
you puttin' that shit on me?

13
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,925
- Calm down, enjoy the show.
- Barnett's angry.

14
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,427
Okay.

15
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:46,930
Walk with me, Joshua

16
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,592
- And I will say that I am lame
- I think she's, uh...

17
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,103
I think she's having an affair here.
I really do.

18
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:56,368
The child that we have made

19
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:59,376
- But I'll never let him mention
- Oh, God.

20
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:02,345
- Your name
- Are you off. You're way off.

21
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,349
You are way, way off.

22
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,647
Are you kidding?

23
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,255
Some people take

24
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:15,784
And never give

25
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,328
- I love you.
- But all men die

26
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,267
And so must live

27
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,769
For a while

28
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:33,004
And life is short

29
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:36,046
- I love you.
- A precious gift

30
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,808
This thing we have

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,017
- Please don't let it drift away
- I love you.

32
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:54,531
Honey, won't you
let me be your friend

33
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,533
I love you.

34
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,535
I love you.

35
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:03,472
Honey, won't you
let me try again

36
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:11,578
Honey, won't you
let me be your friend

37
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,685
For another day

38
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:10,233
When we've been there

39
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:15,541
Ten thousand years

40
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:18,841
Bright, shining

41
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,822
As the sun

42
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,293
We've no less days

43
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:36,163
To sing God's praise

44
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,862
Than when

45
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,928
We'd first

46
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:49,344
Begun

47
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:52,382
And on the profession
of your faith,

48
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,714
I baptize you, my sister,

49
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:58,153
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

50
00:03:58,222 --> 00:04:00,156
and of the Holy Ghost.

51
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:01,714
Amen.

52
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:04,284
I'm newborn again

53
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:07,455
Been a long time talkin'

54
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:11,229
'Bout my trials here below

55
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:14,430
Free grace
Free grace

56
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,702
Free grace, sinner

57
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,539
Free grace
Free grace

58
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm newborn again

59
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:27,007
And He walks with me

60
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:30,519
And He talks with me

61
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:36,823
And he tells me
I am His own

62
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:39,385
And the joy we share

63
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:44,424
As we tarry there

64
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:47,494
None other

65
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:50,507
Has ever

66
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:54,909
Known

67
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:00,440
He speaks
and the sound of His voice

68
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,985
Is so sweet

69
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:07,353
The birds hush their singing

70
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,417
And the melody

71
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:14,295
That He gave to me

72
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:17,493
Within my heart

73
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,502
Is ringin'

74
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,836
You know, my wife Esther is on
the same floor with Barbara Jean.

75
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:27,241
- And He walks with me
- Oh, and Esther and I had a son...

76
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,575
- And He talks with me
- in the service too.

77
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,615
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, not the army. It was the navy.

78
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:35,550
And He tells me
I am His own

79
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,555
We lost him in the South Pacific.
We don't know how.

80
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:40,557
- And thejoy we share
- I'm sorry.

81
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,559
- World War II.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:46,461
As we tarry there

83
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:49,728
None other

84
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,736
Has ever

85
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:59,972
Known

86
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:03,536
I'm wandering in a graveyard.

87
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:06,378
The dead here have no crosses,

88
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:10,750
nor tombstones, nor wreaths
to sing of their past glory,

89
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:16,055
but lie in rotting,
decaying, rusty heaps,

90
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:21,064
their innards ripped out
by greedy, vulturous hands.

91
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,533
Their vast, vacant skeletons...

92
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,901
sadly sighing to the sky.

93
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:32,738
The rust on their bodies...

94
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,745
is the color of dried blood.

95
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,781
Dried blood.

96
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,984
I'm reminded of...

97
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,947
of an elephant's
secret burial ground.

98
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,957
Yes.

99
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:53,429
Cette aire de mystère.
Cette essence de I'irréel.

100
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,661
These cars
are trying to communicate.

101
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:02,128
O cars, are you trying
to tell me something?

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,504
Are you trying to
convey to me some secret...

103
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,975
What... Excuse me?

104
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:09,535
Oh, excuse me.

105
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:12,616
I thought I was completely alone.
How embarrassing.

106
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,617
Oh, you're a musician!

107
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:25,689
The economy's depressed, not me

108
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:34,836
You may say that I ain't free

109
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:38,307
But it don't

110
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,207
Worry

111
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:44,612
Me

112
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,982
Let's have some applause
for Miss Maisie Hoy.

113
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:01,331
Miss Albuquerque?

114
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,069
Hi, Frog.

115
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:14,740
This is with gestures.

116
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:19,272
Miss Jill Brown
on the track in number 78.

117
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:32,562
The youngsters will be eligible...

118
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,396
to apply for a gas-powered mini-bike
and a helmet.

119
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:45,241
You wanna talk about yesterday?

120
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:49,913
Get up, goddamn it!

121
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,118
Fucker.

122
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:00,856
You wanna talk about yesterday?

123
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,292
Do you wanna talk about yesterday
or not? What, are you...

124
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:06,329
Shit.
Come out of there!

125
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,298
You leave me alone!

126
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,459
Come out of there!
Come on!

127
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:13,264
Look, I know what's...
Come on!

128
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:16,272
For Christ's sake, what...
Now, you...

129
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,798
What are you doing? Do you wanna
talk about yesterday or not?

130
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:23,438
Oh, that's terrific.
Hey, that's great. Hey, terrific.

131
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:26,483
Oh, thanks. My turtle.
Thanks a lot.

132
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,484
Look, just relax!

133
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,181
Look, I know what's goin' on.

134
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,192
Great.
House detective.

135
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:40,330
Bill, hi.
I'm John Triplette.

136
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,899
Am I early?
I called you this morning.

137
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:46,960
Oh, yeah. The guy from TV.
Come on in.

138
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,972
Sure.

139
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,975
Just... We're just
cleanin' up here.

140
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:53,977
You know the...

141
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:56,479
- Sunday morning blues.
- Would you hold this?

142
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:58,515
- Sure.
- Thanks.

143
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,517
Let me just move this over here.

144
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,452
- Is this your new album?
- Yeah. That's our only album.

145
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:08,491
It's a very good one, though.
I've heard it. It's terrific.

146
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:11,461
- I'm really sorry about the mess.
- Oh, that's all right.

147
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,463
You oughta see my room.

148
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:17,729
We had a little party last night.
Had a pretty good time too.

149
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:21,135
Uh, I wanted to, um,

150
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:24,140
tell you a couple things about what
we're trying to do with this show.

151
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,575
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, no, I'm fine.

152
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:30,079
I don't wanna take up
much of your time.

153
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:34,117
I just wanna tell you a little bit
about what we're trying to do.

154
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,119
I know you're astute politically,

155
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:39,122
and I'm certainly not here
to sell you a bill of goods.

156
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,455
- Don't care about politics.
- No politics? Okay, great.

157
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:47,828
Well, then, I've got a problem
that could work to your advantage.

158
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:52,665
As you know, this redneck music
is very popular right now.

159
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:56,195
I've got an awful lot of these
local yokels on the bill singing...

160
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,208
- Your basic country folk.
- Country crapola. Right.

161
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:01,710
So I think, uh...

162
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,976
What I'm going for
is a broader appeal.

163
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,016
Which is where we fit in.

164
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,518
I want to give it more
than just this Southern thing.

165
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,556
And I think that
a really hip group like yours...

166
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:14,557
could walk off with the evening.

167
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,492
Yeah. Probably the only
rock group on the...

168
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:19,495
- Absolutely.
- Sounds good.

169
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,497
- Sounds inviting.
- Yeah.

170
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:26,662
And you do get a big audience
from these country guys.

171
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,671
Is this just network, or...

172
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,673
It's better than network.
It's syndicated.

173
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:33,369
They'll be showing it
for a year and a half.

174
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:36,379
- Your glasses, sweetheart.
- Oh, thanks.

175
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,415
This is my wife Mary.
This is John Triplette.

176
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:39,915
Nice to meet you.

177
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:42,248
Go ahead.

178
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:46,255
He's, uh, he's the fella
from the television show...

179
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:49,258
that they're doing
for Hal Phillip Walker.

180
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:53,922
That political thing going on.
He's offered us a spot.

181
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:57,434
You're doing some great promotion.
All those buttons and...

182
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,436
- Oh, yeah, thank you. I'm trying.
- Bumper stickers.

183
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:04,304
Anyway, we got a great time spot
on this gala,

184
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:07,343
and we're gonna walk away
with the show, John says.

185
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:10,313
We can't vote for him.
We're registered Democrats.

186
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,780
Besides, he's a little crazy,
isn't he?

187
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,320
Well, they're all
a little crazy, Mary.

188
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:20,186
- I'll drink to that.
- That's the name of the game.

189
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:23,090
But I think the thing that you
should consider is your future.

190
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,594
It would give you a great shot.

191
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,429
But it doesn't make any difference.
We're registered Democrats.

192
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,934
Well, I'm a registered Democrat.

193
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,936
The only reason
we're registered Democrats...

194
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,336
is because your father's
a registered Democrat...

195
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,807
and his father's
a registered Democrat.

196
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:41,811
Well, Tom's a registered Democrat,
and he wouldn't do it.

197
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,109
It's not my way

198
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:47,241
To take your hand if I'm...

199
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:50,586
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi, Norman. How you doin'?

200
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:54,590
Good. I'm sure glad you called.
Is there anything I can...

201
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,592
- Sit down.
- Okay.

202
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,855
Whew.

203
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,864
- You have any speckled birds?
- What?

204
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,298
You know, L.A. Turnarounds.
Uppers.

205
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,335
Uh, no, no, I, uh...

206
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,305
But I know where
to get some grass.

207
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,308
- No, thanks. I don't need any grass.
- Okay.

208
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,641
- Uh, can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,580
Is there something...
Are you angry at Bill?

210
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,616
- No.
- Oh.

211
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:23,118
'Cause I, I, uh...
You know, I, uh...

212
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:25,621
Bill and Mary
and you and, uh...

213
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,283
Well, Bill, uh...
I mean, Bill seems to be, um...

214
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,327
Uh...

215
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,795
- I'm just confused.
- Mmm.

216
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,798
- Uh...
- Here.

217
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:38,960
- Why don't you write yourself a hit.
- Okay.

218
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:51,414
- Hello.
- Can I talk to Cherry, please?

219
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:54,918
She's in bed with R.Y.
You wanna talk to R.Y.?

220
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,920
- I'd rather talk to her, if I could.
- Who is this?

221
00:13:57,988 --> 00:13:59,785
This is Frank, one of the cooks
at the restaurant.

222
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:01,290
Are you a Jehovah's Witness?

223
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:04,725
Does it
make sense that the churches...

224
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:08,389
should remain untaxed
on their vast holdings of land...

225
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,366
and corporate investments?

226
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,369
Does it make sense that
a multimillion-dollar income...

227
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,031
should go untaxed
year after year?

228
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:20,335
No, all will not be easy,

229
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:23,346
but we will bask
in the satisfaction...

230
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:27,578
of having done
what we should have done.

231
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:30,245
And if we don't
get it done today,

232
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:33,152
we may run out of tomorrows.

233
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:35,349
The buses!

234
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,360
The buses are empty...

235
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:41,364
and look almost menacing,
threatening,

236
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:44,367
as so many yellow dragons
watching me...

237
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:47,370
with their hollow, vacant eyes.

238
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:50,373
I wonder how many little
black and white children...

239
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,375
have yellow nightmares,

240
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:56,436
their own special brand of fear
for the yellow peril...

241
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:59,676
I can't have...
I can't start...

242
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:02,650
Damn it, it's got to be more...

243
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:04,687
positive.

244
00:15:04,722 --> 00:15:07,452
No, more negative.
Start again.

245
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:10,516
Yellow is the color of caution.

246
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,528
No.

247
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:16,123
Yellow is the color of cowardice.

248
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,658
Yellow is the color of sunshine.

249
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:22,672
And yet I see
very little sunshine...

250
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,574
in the lives of all the little
black and white children.

251
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:29,077
I see their lives, rather,
as a study in grayness,

252
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:31,080
a mixture of black and...

253
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,615
Oh, Christ, no.
That's fascist.

254
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:37,085
Yellow! Yellow, yellow, yellow.
Yellow fever.

255
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:41,090
We'll be able to talk about it.
They're checkin' out now.

256
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,286
- Get with him before he leaves.
- What about the place?

257
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,795
- It's not bad at all.
- Think it'll work out?

258
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:51,528
It's got this bizarre stage
that drops out of the ceiling.

259
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:54,537
They're gettin' out this mornin'.

260
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,539
- The place is very confused.
- Bye-bye!

261
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,542
- Is the place out there okay?
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.

262
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,044
Wait a minute.
Here we go.

263
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,977
Uh, Barnett!
Phone's for you.

264
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:06,049
- Is it important, or what?
- Bye, girls.

265
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,017
- Hello.
- Hello, Barnett. John Triplette.

266
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:10,019
- Who?
- Hello! Are you going home?

267
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,022
Mr. Green, how are you?
I'm goin' home.

268
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,025
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you. How is Mrs. Green?

269
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:19,028
She's fine, and she's gonna be
thrilled to hear I saw you again.

270
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:22,031
Give her my very best.
And is she takin' her vitamin E?

271
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:25,034
- Got 'em right here.
- All right. Good for you.

272
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:27,036
You take care, darlin'.
Bye-bye.

273
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,538
All right, come on.
Let's get her on there.

274
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:33,042
- Lucky for you. Whoo!
- As long as I'm done

275
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,544
- Gonna buy me a pistol
- All right, get in.

276
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:38,046
We gotta go with those
white horseshoes, huh?

277
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:41,083
We're gonna live with those
for infamy.

278
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,087
Take that cortege
on the other elevator.

279
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:48,090
- Didn't the doctor get ahold of you?
- No more calls, Delbert.

280
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:51,093
I'm really sorry
I have to tell you this.

281
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,095
Mrs. Green expired this morning.

282
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,165
What?

283
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,667
Mrs. Green died this morning.

284
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,540
Wait right here.
Let me go get the doctor.

285
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:07,676
Mr. Green?

286
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:10,679
Mr. Green, you know,
my mama saved her life.

287
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:15,207
They used to live next door to each
other. My mama put out the flames.

288
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,651
She always loved Barbara Jean
more than anything.

289
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:20,155
She's still keepin'
a scrapbook on her.

290
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:23,660
The only thing she said to me
when I joined up was,

291
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:26,662
"When you're doin' your travels,
I want you to see Barbara Jean.

292
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,666
Don't say nothin' about me.
Just see Barbara Jean. "

293
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,668
So that's what I been doin'.

294
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,671
Now I'm gonna go over to Opryland
and hear her sing.

295
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:39,175
Give my best to your wife, now.

296
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:48,217
Wait a minute. Don't laugh.

297
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:53,222
Let me just... I have a theory
about political assassination.

298
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,056
You see, I believe
people like Madame Pearl...

299
00:17:57,127 --> 00:18:01,689
and all these people here
in this country who carry guns...

300
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:04,598
are the real assassins.

301
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,603
Because, you see,
they stimulate other people...

302
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,605
who are perhaps innocent...

303
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,608
and who eventually
are the ones who pull the trigger.

304
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,611
- Ma?
- Kenny? Where are you, Kenny?

305
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,045
- I'm in Nashville. How are you?
- I was so worried.

306
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:21,573
- There's no reason to worry.
- Well, I haven't been able to sleep.

307
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:24,815
I had to take some of that Ny Quil
so I could go to sleep.

308
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,822
- Puts you right out.
- Did it help?

309
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,825
Yes, it did.
Where are you staying in Nashville?

310
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:33,158
- I'm staying at a rooming house.
- Who you talkin' to?

311
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,165
- It's my mother.
- Who are you talking to, Kenny?

312
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:38,497
A girl that lives
in the rooming house.

313
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,503
Who owns that rooming house?

314
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:42,505
- Her uncle.
- A man owns the rooming house?

315
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:44,006
Well, it can't be very clean.

316
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:47,009
- Don't be silly.
- I bet the sheets aren't clean.

317
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,739
In the South
you can pick up this parasite...

318
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:52,247
- Joan, put that down, please!
- Kenny, listen...

319
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,284
- Just a minute.
- I wanted to look at your fiddle.

320
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:58,788
Kenny! You can get this
parasite fungus in the South.

321
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:02,222
It's very difficult to get rid of.
When are you coming home?

322
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,260
I don't know.
A couple of weeks.

323
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:06,228
You left your blue suit
hanging in the closet.

324
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,729
I don't need my suit.

325
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,325
I would really like you to
get home as soon as you can.

326
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,834
Mother, just listen to me.

327
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,531
Kenny, don't you talk to me
in that tone of voice.

328
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:19,608
I love you too, Mama.

329
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:23,779
I really do.
I'll see you soon.

330
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:28,317
Bye-bye.

331
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,314
Let's find Barnett,
hope he's not in a bad mood.

332
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,354
Hi. How are you?

333
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,823
- Hey, Barnett!
- I'm obliged to give them...

334
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,826
- Hey, Barnett.
- What do you want now?

335
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:13,829
This guy wants me to do four shows.
What do you want?

336
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:16,832
Don't let her do too much.
How you hangin'?

337
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,767
- You feelin' better now?
- Yeah, I feel swell.

338
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:22,771
We gotta talk to you.
We're gonna do a show.

339
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,773
Okay, now, John's doing this show.

340
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,776
Haven's gonna do it.
We want Barbara Jean to headline it.

341
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,869
- Unbelievable.
- Now wait a second, man.

342
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:32,380
I wish they wouldn't rush us.
Get a shot.

343
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,178
It's national TVfor this candidate
Hal Phillip Walker.

344
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:38,721
We don't want her to make
any political statement.

345
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:41,724
What do you think
her bein' there's gonna be?

346
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:45,228
- Ain't that a political statement?
- People haven't seen her.

347
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:47,729
No, fellas.
Don't take it personal.

348
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,232
No politics, no government,
no nothin'.

349
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,234
- All right? Okay?
- All right.

350
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:55,237
- I heard you all out.
- Hello, boys. How's it goin'?

351
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:57,739
I believe I met you before
in the hospital.

352
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:00,242
Look at that. Didn't Jewel
show you how to do her hair?

353
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,175
- Come on, darlin'.
- How do you do, honey?

354
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,213
- No pictures.
- I'm all excited.

355
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:06,215
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

356
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:08,513
I told the band you'd start off
with the cowboy song.

357
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:11,553
- Forget it.
- No, John, just leave it to me.

358
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,555
He can take a flying leap.

359
00:21:13,623 --> 00:21:16,285
I'm gonna stay after him
like a rodent, man.

360
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,977
He's got a tape deck
in his tractor

361
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:47,420
And he listens
to the local news

362
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,152
He finds out where
the bass are bitin'

363
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:54,357
While he's plowin'
to the country blues

364
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,229
He was a cowboy
and he knew I loved him well

365
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,791
A cowboy's secrets
you never tell

366
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,497
No, there's nothin'
like the lovin'

367
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,803
Of a hard-drivin'cowboy man

368
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,536
He's got a tape deck
in his tractor

369
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:11,775
While he's plowing up
his daddy's land

370
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:13,475
He's got more horse sense

371
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:18,316
Than I ever seen in any man

372
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:21,255
He was a cowboy
and he knew I loved him well

373
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:24,122
A cowboy's secrets
you never tell

374
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:25,786
No, there's nothin'
like the lovin'

375
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:30,265
Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man

376
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,325
On Saturday nights
we go dancin' in town

377
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:36,031
And all the boys'll
order up another round

378
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,801
In the summertime

379
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:42,038
We look forward
to the rodeo

380
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:45,309
On Saturday nights
we go to town

381
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:48,249
And all the boys'll
order up another round

382
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:49,784
When he rides saddle bronc

383
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:54,085
I wait to hear
that whistle blow

384
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:55,784
He's got a tape deck
in his tractor

385
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,319
I can hear him
when he's comin' home

386
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:02,763
Then he holds me
in the rocking chair

387
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:06,962
And sings me the love song

388
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:09,528
He was a cowboy
and he knew I loved him well

389
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:12,302
A cowboy's secrets
you never tell

390
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,865
No, there's nothin'
like the lovin'

391
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:18,438
Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man

392
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:19,982
No, there's nothin'
like the muscles

393
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,919
Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man

394
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:30,059
Thank you.
Thank you.

395
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:48,574
It's that careless

396
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:51,512
Disrespect

397
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:57,542
I can't take no more, baby

398
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,851
It's the way

399
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:03,791
That you don't love me

400
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:08,695
When you say you do, baby

401
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:11,427
It hurts so bad

402
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:14,732
It gets me down, down, down

403
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:17,364
I want to walk away

404
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,841
From this battleground

405
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:24,176
This hurtin' match

406
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:27,842
It ain't no good

407
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:30,317
I'd give a lot to love you

408
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,719
The way I used to do

409
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:35,952
Wish I could

410
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:39,393
Mm-hmm-hmmm

411
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:42,431
Well, you got

412
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:45,195
Your own private world

413
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:47,327
I wouldn't have it

414
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:51,636
No other way

415
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:55,405
But lately you been

416
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:58,174
Hidin'your blues

417
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:03,345
Pretendin' what you say

418
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:06,149
It hurts so bad

419
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:09,555
It gets me down, down, down

420
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:14,996
I wanna walk away
from this battleground

421
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:18,967
This hurtin' match

422
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:21,469
It ain't no good

423
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:24,473
I'd give a lot to love you

424
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:26,975
The way I used to do

425
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:29,739
Wish I could

426
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:31,246
Mmm-mmm-mmmm-mmm

427
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:33,441
Have you been in Vietnam?

428
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,950
- Huh?
- Writin'it down

429
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:38,419
Kind of makes me feel better

430
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,956
Yes, you have.
I can tell by your face.

431
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:44,858
It keeps me away
from them blues

432
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:48,557
I wanna be nice to you

433
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,657
Treat you right

434
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:53,726
But how long can I pay

435
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,704
These dues

436
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:59,264
It hurts so bad

437
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:02,607
It gets me down, down, down

438
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:08,548
I wanna walk away
from this battleground

439
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,895
This hurtin' match

440
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:14,796
It ain't no good, no

441
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,027
I'd give a lot to love you

442
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:19,934
The way I used to do

443
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:22,666
Wish I could

444
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,867
Mmm-mmm-mmmm-mmm

445
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:26,876
Was it awful?

446
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,572
- Ooh-oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
- It was kinda hot and wet.

447
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:33,048
Ooooh

448
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:36,917
Oooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh

449
00:26:36,988 --> 00:26:38,649
Ooooh

450
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:43,422
I

451
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:45,996
Wish I could

452
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:48,565
Mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm

453
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:55,868
Mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm

454
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,678
Thank you.

455
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:06,082
Thank you.

456
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:12,849
I wanna tell you all a little secret
which you might not know,

457
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:15,892
and that is that last night
I thanked my lucky stars...

458
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,758
that I could be here at all
to sing for ya.

459
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:20,763
I heard on the radio...

460
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:23,265
This little boy... 9 years old.

461
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,268
Sometimes a deejay'll play a tune...

462
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:28,271
and ask everybody to phone in
and say how they like it.

463
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:32,776
I was listenin', and this
little nine-year-old called in.

464
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:35,778
The song had voices
in the background,

465
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:38,246
like the way they use
backup voices these days,

466
00:27:38,316 --> 00:27:40,250
soundin' like little munchkins.

467
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:43,253
He called up, the deejay said,
"How old are you, son?"

468
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:46,256
The boy said, "I'm nine,
and I think it's gonna be a hit. "

469
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:50,283
The deejay said, "Why?" "Because
it had those chipmunks in it. "

470
00:27:50,361 --> 00:27:52,795
And I thought that was so cute,

471
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:55,798
because, well, I can sing
like a munchkin myself.

472
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm real fond
of The Wizard of Oz.

473
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:01,463
Plus, I live out, you know,
just a ways off of Interstate 24...

474
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:03,473
on the road to Chattanooga.

475
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,476
So you can see why
I kinda related to that.

476
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:09,980
I think me and the boys are gonna
strike up another tune for you now.

477
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:11,981
Let's go, boys.

478
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,282
I think there's a storm...

479
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:21,825
seems like it's a-brewin'.

480
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:27,330
That's what my grandaddy used to say
before he lost his hearin'.

481
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:29,832
Once he got deaf,

482
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,926
he never talked much no more.

483
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:37,668
'Cept sometimes he'd say "Oh, gosh"
or "Durn it" or "My word!"

484
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:41,473
My granny'd go around clickin'
her teeth to the radio all day.

485
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:45,447
Boy, was she a lot of fun,
and cooked my favorite, roast beef.

486
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,450
She was a sweetheart.

487
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,782
She raised chickens too.
She, um...

488
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:54,120
Did you ever hear a chicken sound?
You know how chickens go?

489
00:28:57,828 --> 00:29:00,558
Here, chick, chick, chick.
Here, chick, chick, chick.

490
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:04,499
Anyway, I guess we'd better strike
up this tune before it's too late.

491
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:06,536
Okay, boys.

492
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,949
The first job I ever really got...

493
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:25,284
Grandma... She's the one who clacked
her false teeth to the radio.

494
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:28,814
She taught my mama how to sing,
and my mama taught me.

495
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:32,329
One time she took me, 'cause we
was gonna get a new Frigidaire.

496
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:36,332
She took me to the Frigidaire store
where the man was advertisin'.

497
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,665
This record was goin' 'round, and
Mama told him I knew how to sing.

498
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:44,401
He said, "If she learns this tune,
I'll give y'all a quarter. "

499
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:47,410
So Mama and I went home...

500
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:50,413
And then what happened?
Let's see, I think... Uh, yeah.

501
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:55,145
We went home and I learned both
sides of the record in half an hour.

502
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:59,485
We went back and told him that
I'd learned 'em, and he said,

503
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,583
"Let me hear," so I sang both sides
of the record instead of just one.

504
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:07,630
So he gave us 50 cents, and we went
across the street and had us a soda.

505
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:10,633
Ever since then
I been workin'. I don't...

506
00:30:10,701 --> 00:30:13,966
I think ever since then
I been workin' and doin' my...

507
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:15,972
- Come on, come on.
- Supportin'myself.

508
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,565
- Anyway...
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

509
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:21,975
- Am I all right? Am I all right?
- Oh, you're fine, darlin'.

510
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:23,980
- It's the microphone.
- I ain't done.

511
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:25,982
- I know, I know.
- I ain't done.

512
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,985
Get us a glass of water.
Boys, help her off, all right?

513
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:31,988
- You'll come back. Okay, darlin'?
- Thank you!

514
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:34,650
All right. Watch the wire.

515
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,193
All right, now! Okay!

516
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:40,697
Aw, come on, now.
Have a heart.

517
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:43,859
Thank you!

518
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:47,370
Come on, now.
It's just too soon, now.

519
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:51,033
All of you must know... Aw, come on.
You didn't mean that, did you?

520
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:54,043
She just come out of the hospital...

521
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:56,136
Oh, no. Hold it down, boys.

522
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:59,671
You know that little girl
just come out of the hospital.

523
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:07,691
That little girl's in there
cryin' her eyes out...

524
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:10,318
'cause she didn't want
to disappoint you.

525
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,199
Get outta here!

526
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:21,337
Y'all show up at Centennial Park
tomorrow at the Parthenon.

527
00:31:21,405 --> 00:31:25,842
You'll see her for free
as our guests. How's that?

528
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,844
All right?

529
00:31:27,912 --> 00:31:30,847
Okay, let's hear a get-well welcome
for Barbara Jean.

530
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:34,180
Let's hear it. Come on!

531
00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:41,284
Ingrates is all they are.

532
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:43,019
A bunch of no-talent...

533
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,062
I got trapped out there,
and you guys know it.

534
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,065
- I want some ground rules right now.
- You name it.

535
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:52,569
She's gonna sing first and be off
before that man even shows.

536
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:54,570
Fine.
Whatever you want.

537
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,074
- Never shoulda brought her here.
- Any way you want it.

538
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:01,077
No paraphernalia, no literature
being circulated. You understand?

539
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:05,241
And never, at any time, is she to be
associated with Hal Phillip Walker.

540
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,213
- Hello?
- Hey.

541
00:32:07,284 --> 00:32:09,718
Guess who.

542
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:12,221
- Linnea?
- Yes, it's me.

543
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:15,258
Hi. This is Tom.

544
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:23,400
I'm playing a gig tonight downtown.
You wanna come and meet me?

545
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:29,468
It's at a place called
the, uh, No Exit, or the Exit.

546
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,804
Exit Out, or somethin'.

547
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:35,312
Anyhow, it's right across the street
from Friday's, on Church Street.

548
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:37,813
You know where that is,
don't you?

549
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:40,817
Anyhow, I'll be there at 8:00,
and, uh...

550
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:43,718
Why don't you meet me there?

551
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,948
- Okay?
- Um...

552
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:49,217
Well, it's sad but true

553
00:32:49,326 --> 00:32:53,228
The pilot light of our love

554
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:56,960
Has flickered out

555
00:32:57,034 --> 00:33:00,526
- Mary...
- Driver, may I have more champagne?

556
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,731
- That's Norman.
- Oh.

557
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,274
Norman, yes.
Norman. Of course.

558
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:08,369
He doesn't like to be known
as a driver.

559
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,379
Thank you so much, Norman.

560
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:15,612
What used to come
from the warmest heart

561
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:18,849
I have to get from a cold can

562
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:26,997
Since my baby's cookin'in

563
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:29,294
Another man's pan

564
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:31,800
Have you ever been
to the ladies' restroom here?

565
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:33,302
No.

566
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,736
I'm stuck here at the Exit Inn
with no place left to go.

567
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:41,273
Well, if makin'love

568
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:44,109
Were margarine

569
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:48,618
Then she is
the high-priced spread

570
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:50,620
- I'll have a cider.
- Apple cider?

571
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:53,122
- Yes. Thank you.
- Put it on my bill.

572
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:55,157
- Oh, no...
- Yeah.

573
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:58,683
Uh, all right. And would you
put it in a wine glass, please?

574
00:33:58,796 --> 00:34:01,731
Put it in a wine glass
and put it on my bill.

575
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,166
Traveling in cozy, close quarters,

576
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:08,705
I mean, you sort of
have to camp in one room.

577
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:12,004
- Well, Mary and I camp in one room.
- Obviously!

578
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:15,409
- Yes, I...
- Tom camps in a lot of rooms.

579
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:18,937
My name's Wade Coolidge.
What's yours?

580
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,950
Um, Linnea is my name.

581
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:24,545
Well, shall I say
that Tom and I, um...

582
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:26,555
Oh, la-dee-dee!

583
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:28,591
So you sang together.

584
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,618
No, I mean, we sort of
got to know each other, um,

585
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,665
in the biblical sense,
shall we say.

586
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:38,258
- You went to church?
- I'm sorry.

587
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:40,269
No, I'm sorry.
This is dreadful.

588
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:43,272
But he is so attractive,
I was wondering...

589
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,537
I shouldn't be asking you,
I should really be asking Mary.

590
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,044
You went to bed with him,
right?

591
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:52,549
Oh, yeah.
I thought you understood that.

592
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,550
Well, I shouldn't...

593
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:56,643
Where'd you go to bed with him?

594
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:06,255
Listen, uh, we got
a special treat tonight.

595
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:09,298
A friend of mine
is in town cuttin' an album.

596
00:35:09,366 --> 00:35:12,301
- Tom Frank is in the audience.
- That's you.

597
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:14,394
Tom? Speak of the devil.

598
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:17,201
He's agreed to come up
and do a couple of numbers.

599
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:20,209
Let's make him feel at home.
Tom Frank!

600
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:22,211
Come on!

601
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:30,044
Goddamn it!

602
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,385
I haven't seen him for
more than two minutes in three days.

603
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,458
Thank you.

604
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,722
- I used to be part of a trio.
- Used to be?

605
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:44,267
I been hidin' from 'em all week, but
it seems they found me here tonight,

606
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:47,360
so we might as well have them
up here to sing too... Bill and Mary.

607
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,372
Lovely!

608
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,374
Yes, you must!

609
00:35:57,314 --> 00:35:59,748
I've been watching it all week.

610
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:02,877
You may say I ain't free

611
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:06,422
But it don't worry me

612
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:12,024
- It don't worry me
- My favorite song.

613
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:16,032
- It don't worry me
- We don't need to sing at all.

614
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,332
- You guys can do it for us.
- You may say I ain't free

615
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:22,929
- Good choice.
- But it don't worry me

616
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:27,169
Since you've gone

617
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:29,872
My heart is broken

618
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:33,542
Another time

619
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,523
Oh, railroad train

620
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:47,028
Has taken him

621
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:50,965
From me

622
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:55,198
All my luxury

623
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:59,902
Has turned to misery

624
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:05,012
He's all I ever wanted

625
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:09,984
Why did he run from me

626
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,386
Since you've gone

627
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:15,084
My heart is broken

628
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:18,628
Another time

629
00:37:20,664 --> 00:37:23,098
Since you've gone

630
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,829
My heart is broken

631
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:29,339
Another time

632
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:33,610
I didn't know

633
00:37:33,677 --> 00:37:36,237
That you were leavin'

634
00:37:38,248 --> 00:37:41,479
- Till you were out the door
- Out the door

635
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:44,043
I didn't know

636
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:46,419
The love you gave

637
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:51,187
Was a real love

638
00:37:52,629 --> 00:37:55,029
I didn't know

639
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,396
A lot of things then

640
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:02,238
Lord, I know them now

641
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:07,369
Since you've gone
my heart is broken

642
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:11,244
- Another time
- Another time

643
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:12,976
Mmm.

644
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,245
Since you've gone

645
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,753
My heart is broken

646
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:21,188
Another time

647
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,759
Since you've gone

648
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,457
My heart is broken

649
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:34,903
Another time

650
00:38:34,972 --> 00:38:38,738
When this is all over, I'm gonna be
taking them back to someplace.

651
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:43,143
What I could do is, I could
show you a little bit of Nashville.

652
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:47,206
I can tell you things that'd
send you around the corner.

653
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:50,412
I'm not kidding. I know...
Well, I know, for instance...

654
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:52,853
- What is your name? L...
- Norman.

655
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:55,983
Norman.
Please, Norman, I...

656
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:59,028
I make a point
never to gossip with servants.

657
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:02,031
Thank you.

658
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:05,367
Okay, fellas,
I think you know...

659
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:08,461
you've got a good man
to get behind.

660
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,472
I don't wanna take
a lot of your time,

661
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,474
'cause we do have
a little entertainment for ya.

662
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:17,036
You got pledge cards on the table.
You can pledge anything you want to.

663
00:39:17,114 --> 00:39:20,550
I'll make sure... I'll make you pay,
whatever you put down there.

664
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:23,552
If you got a check,
don't be afraid to write it out.

665
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,555
I'll get that to the bank quick,
before you can stop it.

666
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:32,562
Any cash, anything at all,
don't anybody be humble or shy.

667
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:35,564
And while you're writin',
so you don't get bored or anything,

668
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:38,157
there's somethin' comin'
to keep you occupied.

669
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:41,170
Just keep your eyes up,
'cause good things come from above.

670
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,760
Hi, y'all.

671
00:40:04,828 --> 00:40:07,592
- Hi!
- Hi!

672
00:40:07,664 --> 00:40:09,632
My name's Sueleen Gay,

673
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,500
and I'm here to sing you a song
about a girl that never gets enough.

674
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:21,043
I never get enough
I never get enough

675
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:24,046
Of the love I'm hungry for

676
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:26,947
I never get enough
I never get enough

677
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:29,178
I always want more and more

678
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,982
Even if we stay together

679
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,218
Our whole lifetime through

680
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:38,021
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough

681
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,096
I'll never get enough of you

682
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:42,631
She's the worst singer
I ever heard.

683
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,634
I ain't greedy for
that mansion on the hill

684
00:40:45,702 --> 00:40:47,761
She cannot sing a lick, can she?

685
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,275
I never was that kind

686
00:40:52,342 --> 00:40:55,277
Don't need my pockets stuffed

687
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:57,370
With hundred-dollar bills

688
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,517
Hey, you forgot your jacket.

689
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:14,993
Excuse me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

690
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,334
All right, if you want more
it's gonna have to be me alone,

691
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:21,963
'cause it seems
I'vejust been deserted.

692
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:25,030
I'm gonna play somethin'that, uh,

693
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,702
I wrotejust recently...

694
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:31,179
- and came here to record.
- All right!

695
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:34,342
I'm gonna dedicate this to someone
special who might be here tonight.

696
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:39,421
This is a song called
"I'm Easy. "

697
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:50,867
It's not my way to love you
just when no one's lookin'

698
00:41:50,934 --> 00:41:52,663
It's not my way

699
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:56,900
To take your hand
if I'm not sure

700
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,601
It's not my way
to let you see

701
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:02,645
What's goin' on inside of me

702
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:05,112
When it's a love
you won't be needing

703
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,946
If you're not free

704
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:10,543
Please stop pullin'
at my sleeve

705
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,316
If you're just playin'

706
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,724
If you won't take the things
you make me wanna give

707
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:21,724
I never cared too much
for games

708
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:24,824
And this one's drivin' me insane

709
00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:28,098
You're not half as free
to wander

710
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,298
As you claim

711
00:42:31,475 --> 00:42:34,137
But I'm easy

712
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:36,805
Yeah, I'm easy

713
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,440
Give the word
I'll play your game

714
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:42,178
As though
that's how it oughta be

715
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:44,516
Because I'm easy

716
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:50,558
Don't lead me on
if there's nowhere

717
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,356
For you to take me

718
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:56,023
If lovin'you
would have to be

719
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:58,896
A sometime thing

720
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:02,234
I can't put bars
on my insides

721
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,967
My love is somethin'
I can't hide

722
00:43:05,008 --> 00:43:06,134
It still hurts

723
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,440
When I recall
the times I've tried

724
00:43:10,614 --> 00:43:13,481
But I'm easy

725
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,780
Yeah, I'm easy

726
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:19,117
Take my hand
and pull me down

727
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:21,749
I won't put up any fight

728
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:23,918
Because I'm easy

729
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,764
Don't do me favors

730
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:32,734
Let me watch you
from a distance

731
00:43:32,802 --> 00:43:34,565
'Cause when you're near

732
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:38,597
I find it hard
to keep my head

733
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:41,838
And when your eyes
throw light at mine

734
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:44,710
It's enough to change my mind

735
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:48,842
Make me leave my cautious words
and ways behind

736
00:43:49,953 --> 00:43:53,150
That's why I'm easy

737
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:55,714
Yeah, I'm easy

738
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:58,726
Say you want me
I'll come runnin'

739
00:43:58,795 --> 00:44:01,195
Without takin'time to think

740
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:04,290
Because I'm easy

741
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:07,199
Yeah, I'm easy

742
00:44:07,237 --> 00:44:10,070
Take my hand
and pull me down

743
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,574
I won't put up any fight

744
00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:15,611
Because I'm easy

745
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,477
Yeah, I'm easy

746
00:44:18,548 --> 00:44:21,039
Give the word
I'll play your game

747
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,950
As though
that's how it oughta be

748
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,454
Because I'm easy

749
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,840
Do it to it.

750
00:44:48,712 --> 00:44:51,078
- Hi.
- Hi!

751
00:44:51,214 --> 00:44:55,241
I'm gonna sing you all
a song Barbara Jean wrote.

752
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:00,656
Just wanna get comfortable.

753
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:08,730
It's called, uh,
"One, I Love You. "

754
00:45:08,798 --> 00:45:12,063
Oh, you got that right, babe!

755
00:45:15,372 --> 00:45:18,739
When I feel my life perishing

756
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:21,504
I call you on the phone

757
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:26,037
You always fix me up

758
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:28,846
When I get broken

759
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:34,417
'Cause every time
that I got hurt

760
00:45:34,491 --> 00:45:38,086
And went out of control

761
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,095
You knew the fears I felt

762
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:43,564
Before I spoke 'em

763
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,033
Boo! Come on, now!

764
00:45:46,102 --> 00:45:49,902
- What is this, some Walker rip-off?
- One, I love you

765
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:53,409
Two
I'm thinkin'of you

766
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:58,209
Three
I'll never let you go

767
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:00,715
Boo! Come on! Take it off!

768
00:46:00,784 --> 00:46:04,151
And four, I miss you

769
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:07,690
Five, I wanna kiss you

770
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,214
Six

771
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:11,759
I won't leave you no more

772
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:16,629
- Did you tell Trout what you wanted?
- Did I? It was your job.

773
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,634
- I know.
- I assumed he knew what...

774
00:46:18,702 --> 00:46:21,637
Well, I didn't think
it was gonna be any problem.

775
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:27,768
Four, I miss you

776
00:46:27,844 --> 00:46:31,405
- Five, I wanna kiss you
- Take your clothes off!

777
00:46:31,481 --> 00:46:32,778
Six

778
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:36,046
I won't leave you no more

779
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:41,989
Let's see some tit!

780
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:46,619
Come on!
What is this?

781
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,164
Come on back here, baby!

782
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:55,171
- What's the matter, hon?
- I don't understand what's goin' on.

783
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:57,672
Didn't Trout tell you
you're supposed to strip?

784
00:46:57,741 --> 00:46:59,174
I'm a singer!

785
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:03,109
Listen.
Listen, listen, listen.

786
00:47:03,213 --> 00:47:06,148
Go finish the show
like you told Trout you'd do,

787
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:09,117
and I'll set it up
so you can sing at the Parthenon.

788
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:11,983
You can sing in the Parthenon
with Barbara Jean.

789
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:15,491
- Go finish the show...
- I get to sing with Barbara Jean?

790
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:17,526
Yes, you are...
Yes, you will.

791
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:21,530
I'll take care of it. Go finish the
show like you told Trout you'd do.

792
00:47:21,598 --> 00:47:23,532
Okay?

793
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,535
These fellas really like you.

794
00:47:26,603 --> 00:47:30,039
I'm gonna be as big a star
as Barbara Jean is one day.

795
00:47:30,106 --> 00:47:33,542
- I know you are. You can't miss.
- Go on, now.

796
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,545
Come on, let's do it!
Start the show!

797
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,435
Whoo! Hey!
All right! All right!

798
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,066
You're my mama!

799
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:44,079
All right!

800
00:48:59,529 --> 00:49:02,896
Whoo! Hey, hey, hey!

801
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:28,714
But I'm easy

802
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,726
Yeah, I'm easy

803
00:49:31,828 --> 00:49:34,854
Take my hand
and pull me down

804
00:49:34,964 --> 00:49:37,330
I won't put up any fight

805
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,460
Because I'm easy

806
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:47,141
Want to learn how to say
something in sign language?

807
00:49:48,678 --> 00:49:51,203
Yeah.
How do you say "I love you"?

808
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:54,842
Well, you could say...
Shorthand for it is...

809
00:49:54,918 --> 00:49:56,852
This is shorthand.

810
00:49:59,422 --> 00:50:04,223
Or you could say, "I,"
you could say, "love you. "

811
00:50:04,327 --> 00:50:06,761
- "I love you"?
- Mm-hmm.

812
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:10,390
Or you could just say,
"I'm happy I met you. "

813
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,934
- I'm happy I met you.
- Right.

814
00:50:14,604 --> 00:50:17,698
Say you want me
I'll come runnin'

815
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:19,708
- Without takin'time to think
- Phew.

816
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:23,473
- How can you smoke those things?
- 'Cause I'm easy

817
00:50:23,546 --> 00:50:26,640
- It's easy.
- Yeah, I'm easy

818
00:50:26,716 --> 00:50:29,207
Let me have a drag.

819
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:31,219
- Do you smoke?
- No.

820
00:50:31,287 --> 00:50:34,222
Well, what do you want
to do that for?

821
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:38,994
Yeah, I'm easy

822
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:41,530
Give the word
I'll play your game

823
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:43,565
- Doesn't look good.
- No?

824
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:45,567
- Mm-mmm.
- So what?

825
00:50:45,635 --> 00:50:47,569
Because I'm easy

826
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,810
- Tom, I have to go.
- Oh.

827
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:02,749
Can't you just call him,
tell him you're hung up?

828
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,786
No, I can't.

829
00:51:06,556 --> 00:51:08,990
- Couldn't you stay another hour?
- No.

830
00:51:15,498 --> 00:51:17,864
I just can't.

831
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:44,292
This is the long-distance operator.

832
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,726
- You want this charged to your room?
- Yeah, please.

833
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:48,888
- And your room number, please?
- 112.

834
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:55,603
- Hello.
- Hey.

835
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,841
- How you doin'?
- Oh, wow.

836
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,776
Listen, I'm real sorry
I left the way I did.

837
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:04,813
Oh, wow.

838
00:52:04,847 --> 00:52:08,578
It's really nice to talk to you.
It's okay.

839
00:52:08,651 --> 00:52:10,585
It's nice to talk to you too.

840
00:52:10,653 --> 00:52:14,089
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinkin'about you.

841
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:16,387
You are? Well...

842
00:52:16,459 --> 00:52:18,427
Listen, can you come down here?

843
00:52:18,494 --> 00:52:20,428
- When?
- Tonight.

844
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:23,431
- Oh, Tom, I can't do that.
- Why not?

845
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:27,731
We have an opening at the museum
tomorrow. I can't leave my job.

846
00:52:27,804 --> 00:52:30,739
Why don't you quit?
I'm makin'bread here.

847
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:35,107
We tried that before.
It doesn't work. I need to be busy.

848
00:52:35,178 --> 00:52:37,442
I'll wait for you here.
When are you coming back?

849
00:52:37,513 --> 00:52:39,276
About a week.

850
00:52:39,348 --> 00:52:42,283
Okay, well, just...
just come on back.

851
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:44,945
Move back in.
It's fine.

852
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,955
I miss you.

853
00:52:48,191 --> 00:52:50,125
I really do.

854
00:52:50,193 --> 00:52:53,162
New York's really been nice.
It's missed you too.

855
00:52:53,229 --> 00:52:55,163
The weather's been terrific.

856
00:52:55,231 --> 00:52:57,165
I went sailing.

857
00:52:58,234 --> 00:53:00,168
- Yeah.
- What's that?

858
00:53:00,236 --> 00:53:02,033
That's just room service.

859
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:05,073
There's 50 cents on the desk there.
Just pick it up.

860
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:08,043
- Big tipper.
- Yeah, well, times are hard.

861
00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:12,411
Right, all that money. You couldn't
afford to bring me down there.

862
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:16,077
- Yeah. Well, see you in a week.
- I love you, Tom.

863
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:31,596
This it, honey?

864
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,601
Be careful gettin' out.

865
00:53:59,228 --> 00:54:01,162
Hey.

866
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:05,558
Hey! Hey, wait just a minute.
Just hold it, will ya.

867
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:10,765
Now...

868
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,776
I know you don't do that
all the time, I...

869
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:21,283
I wanna tell you
that I just... I mean...

870
00:54:22,852 --> 00:54:24,786
Me personally, boy, I...

871
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:27,789
You know, I'd just like to kiss you
all over, every place.

872
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:29,791
You know what I'm telling you?

873
00:54:29,859 --> 00:54:31,793
- I think you...
- Sueleen?

874
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,664
You okay?

875
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,001
Shit, man.

876
00:54:46,842 --> 00:54:49,777
Didn't your mama
teach you no manners?

877
00:54:49,845 --> 00:54:52,279
Who was that?

878
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,285
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you gonna talk to me?

879
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,555
Did it go all right?

880
00:55:03,993 --> 00:55:06,052
- Oh, Wade.
- What?

881
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:09,598
I had to do me a striptease tonight
in front of all those men...

882
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:12,600
in order to get to sing
at the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.

883
00:55:12,668 --> 00:55:14,602
Oh, shit, Sueleen, I...

884
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,104
That's dreadful!
That's terrible, girl!

885
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:19,107
I mean...

886
00:55:19,175 --> 00:55:22,008
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I been meanin' to...

887
00:55:22,078 --> 00:55:24,239
you can't sing.

888
00:55:24,313 --> 00:55:26,941
You may as well face the fact
you cannot sing.

889
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:30,611
You ain't never gon' be no star.
I wish you'd give it up.

890
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:34,281
They gon' kill ya. They gon' tear
your heart out if you keep on.

891
00:55:34,357 --> 00:55:37,292
They gon' walk on your soul, girl.

892
00:55:37,393 --> 00:55:40,328
- What are you talkin' about?
- You can't sing.

893
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:43,331
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah? You wanna make a bet?

894
00:55:43,399 --> 00:55:46,766
You wanna come to the Parthenon
and watch me sing with Barbara Jean?

895
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:49,771
- I am leavin' for Detroit Wednesday.
- You just come and watch, Wade.

896
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,774
I'm leavin' for Detroit, and if
you wanna go you just come on.

897
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:55,777
- They gonna kill you in this town.
- Well, you come and see.

898
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:58,780
- They gon' use you. You know that.
- Bye, Wade.

899
00:55:58,848 --> 00:56:01,339
Dumb bitch.
I don't know why I stick around.

900
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:04,511
She just makes me so goddamn mad
I could spit.

901
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:07,020
Little more than a year ago,

902
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:09,023
a man named Hal Phillip Walker...

903
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:11,025
excited a group of college students
with some questions:

904
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:14,062
Have you stood
on a high and windy hill...

905
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,065
and heard the acorns drop and roll?

906
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,397
Have you walked in the valley
beside the brook,

907
00:56:19,468 --> 00:56:21,402
walked alone and remembered?

908
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,837
Does Christmas
smell like oranges to you?

909
00:56:24,907 --> 00:56:27,842
In a commencement speech such
questions were fitting, perhaps,

910
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,676
but hardly the material with which
to launch a presidential campaign.

911
00:56:31,747 --> 00:56:34,682
Even those who pay
close attention to politics...

912
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,277
probably saw Hal Phillip Walker
and his Replacement Party...

913
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:41,289
as a bit of frost
on the hillside...

914
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:44,451
summer, if not late spring,
would surely do away with all that.

915
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,720
Well, now that summer,

916
00:56:45,828 --> 00:56:47,762
along with presidential primaries,
is heavy upon us...

917
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,764
and the frost is still there,

918
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:52,266
perhaps we should take
a closer look.

919
00:56:52,335 --> 00:56:55,270
Hal Phillip Walker is,
in a way, a mystery man.

920
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:58,637
Out of nowhere, with a handful
of students and scarcely any pros,

921
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:01,643
he's managed to win
three presidential primaries...

922
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:05,579
and is given a fighting chance
to take a fourth... Tennessee.

923
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:08,616
A win in that state would
take on added significance,

924
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:12,485
for only once in the last 50 years
has Tennessee failed to vote...

925
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:14,489
for the winning
presidential candidate.

926
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:17,492
No doubt many Americans,
especially party liners,

927
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:20,528
wish that Hal Phillip Walker
would go away,

928
00:57:20,596 --> 00:57:22,530
disappear like the natural frost...

929
00:57:22,598 --> 00:57:25,066
and come again at
some more convenient season.

930
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:27,101
But wherever he may be going,

931
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:31,003
it seems sure Hal Phillip Walker
is not going away,

932
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,007
for there is genuine appeal...

933
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:36,169
and it must be related
to the raw courage of this man...

934
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:40,113
running for president, willing
to battle vast oil companies,

935
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:42,616
eliminate subsidies to farmers,

936
00:57:42,685 --> 00:57:46,018
tax churches,
abolish the electoral college,

937
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,022
change the national anthem...

938
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,548
and remove lawyers from government,
especially from Congress.

939
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,596
At this point it'd be wise to say
most of us don't know the answer...

940
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:57,598
to Hal Phillip Walker,

941
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:00,100
but to answer
one of his questions,

942
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:04,902
as a matter of fact, Christmas has
always smelled like oranges to me.

943
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:13,948
Our country cries

944
00:58:14,016 --> 00:58:16,382
For peace today

945
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,943
There's trouble in

946
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:21,455
The U.S.A.

947
00:58:21,524 --> 00:58:23,754
Watergate

948
00:58:23,826 --> 00:58:26,727
Is the sound that rings

949
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:29,093
Wonder what

950
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:31,462
This year will bring

951
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:33,866
- You're going the wrong way!
- Wonder what

952
00:58:33,936 --> 00:58:36,302
This year will bring

953
00:58:36,372 --> 00:58:39,136
- All y'all goin' the wrong way!
- Will there be sadness

954
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,869
Tears or pain

955
00:58:40,943 --> 00:58:43,776
Or will the sun

956
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:48,806
Refuse to shine

957
00:58:48,884 --> 00:58:51,352
Wonder what

958
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,355
This year will bring

959
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:01,152
Down in Nashville

960
00:59:01,263 --> 00:59:03,493
I heard today

961
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,965
A shortage of food

962
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,435
Is on its way

963
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:10,802
While up in Denver

964
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:13,273
Gas shortage rings

965
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:16,277
Lord, I wonder what

966
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,280
- This year will bring
- You may have to sit out here.

967
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,282
That's all right, John.

968
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,285
- Give me time to work on my speech.
- Okay, thank you.

969
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:27,789
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

970
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:30,485
Or will the sun

971
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,823
Refuse to shine

972
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:35,863
- Delbert, how's it going?
- Hi, John. How are you?

973
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:38,365
- Can I say hello?
- He's working on his speech.

974
00:59:38,434 --> 00:59:40,368
- We'll do that later.
- Right.

975
00:59:40,436 --> 00:59:43,872
- He's gonna wait there?
- He'll sit out there for a minute.

976
00:59:43,939 --> 00:59:46,874
- Anybody here yet?
- Yeah, some of the people.

977
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:50,605
- Barnett?
- He oughta be here quick.

978
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:52,613
This building was originally here...

979
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:55,616
It was made out of lumber
and plaster of Paris.

980
00:59:55,684 --> 00:59:58,619
- Oh, yeah?
- This whole big building...

981
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:01,781
See, they built it for
a centennial celebration,

982
01:00:01,857 --> 01:00:04,724
and people liked this,
they didn't want it torn down.

983
01:00:04,827 --> 01:00:08,285
Nashville got to be called
the Athens of the South.

984
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,764
- They sorta took to that.
- Because of this building?

985
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:12,767
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, that's good.

986
01:00:12,835 --> 01:00:18,137
Then they had to rebuild it. This
was built right before I was born.

987
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:20,641
Whoo!
Gonna be a scorcher.

988
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:23,644
The park police control all this.

989
01:00:23,712 --> 01:00:28,149
What's all these chairs?
We don't need all these chairs.

990
01:00:28,217 --> 01:00:31,152
- This ain't no band here, right?
- What's the matter, man?

991
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,154
I don't...
I don't believe it!

992
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:35,156
What's the matter?

993
01:00:35,224 --> 01:00:39,160
Are you guys jerkin' me around?
Do you see what I see, or am I...

994
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,196
What the hell is that sign
doin' up there, Triple?

995
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,198
We had some ground rules.

996
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,826
No political signs,
no advertisements, no noth...

997
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:50,133
What the hell are you doin', huh?
Go about your business.

998
01:00:50,205 --> 01:00:54,141
I have abided by all the ground
rules you laid down, Barnett.

999
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:57,144
I have Walker sitting out
behind this place like an idiot!

1000
01:00:57,212 --> 01:01:00,147
Well, he can sit out in the sun
and parch for all I care!

1001
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:03,582
My wife ain't well! I brought her
out of a hospital bed to be here!

1002
01:01:03,686 --> 01:01:07,622
You gave me some truth! You're
full of it, just like your man!

1003
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:11,092
- I have abided by every ground rule.
- Except what?

1004
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,618
She ain't gonna appear here
with that sign up there!

1005
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:17,757
- I have busted my ass for you!
- I'm gonna bust your ass too!

1006
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:20,801
I am through with it!
Take your wife and take a walk!

1007
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:24,464
I'll tell these people
she's not going to appear again!

1008
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,135
- Well, go on and do it!
- Okay, take a walk, and I'll do it.

1009
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,646
You'd do that, huh? You'd put
a knife in my wife's back like that?

1010
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:35,650
You're putting the knife in
her back, buster. You're doing it.

1011
01:01:35,718 --> 01:01:39,313
I have not got time to take the sign
down and put it back up again!

1012
01:01:39,388 --> 01:01:42,824
What are you hollerin' about?
You tryin' to embarrass me?

1013
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:44,825
I'm tryin' to be heard.

1014
01:01:44,893 --> 01:01:46,827
Well, get these chairs off
and we'll talk about it.

1015
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:49,693
- I'll take care of it.
- Delbert... Where is that rat?

1016
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:52,733
What are you hiding for,
you little rat?

1017
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:56,771
And grant us so
to serve thee by day...

1018
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:59,774
that we may find
eternal fellowship with them...

1019
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:03,039
through Him who died
and rose again for us all,

1020
01:02:03,145 --> 01:02:05,079
Jesus Christ, our Lord.

1021
01:02:05,114 --> 01:02:07,048
Amen.

1022
01:02:09,485 --> 01:02:11,419
Mr. Green, it's not over.

1023
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:13,921
- I'm going to find Martha.
- What for?

1024
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:16,150
She owes some respect to Esther.

1025
01:02:16,225 --> 01:02:20,594
Ladies and gentlemen,
Barbara Jean and Haven Hamilton.

1026
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:31,568
When I feel my life perishing

1027
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,041
I call you on the phone

1028
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,271
I always fix you up

1029
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:39,780
When you get broken

1030
01:02:41,617 --> 01:02:44,381
'Cause every time
that I got hurt

1031
01:02:44,453 --> 01:02:47,718
And went out of control

1032
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:50,020
I knew the fears you felt

1033
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:53,220
Before you spoke them

1034
01:02:53,328 --> 01:02:54,659
You tell me

1035
01:02:54,763 --> 01:02:57,391
One, I love you

1036
01:02:57,499 --> 01:03:00,332
Two
I'm thinkin' of you

1037
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:05,135
Three
I'll never let you go

1038
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,971
And four, I miss you

1039
01:03:09,011 --> 01:03:11,571
Five, I wanna kiss you

1040
01:03:11,647 --> 01:03:17,984
Six
I won't leave you no more

1041
01:03:18,053 --> 01:03:20,180
When I feel my life vanishin'

1042
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,815
Like waves upon the sand

1043
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:25,621
With nothin'to replace it

1044
01:03:25,694 --> 01:03:29,152
But invention

1045
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,630
So I make
my rhymes and I sing my songs

1046
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,362
Still they don't understand

1047
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,870
You can't find her here.

1048
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,339
I'll find her.

1049
01:03:39,408 --> 01:03:43,242
- I'd sing ya
- One, I love you

1050
01:03:43,312 --> 01:03:46,247
Two
I'm thinkin'of you

1051
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:51,548
Three
I'll never let you go

1052
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,714
And four, I miss you

1053
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,657
Five, I wanna kiss you

1054
01:03:57,726 --> 01:04:03,995
Six, I won't
leave you no more

1055
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,069
One, I love you

1056
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:11,834
Two
I'm thinkin'of you

1057
01:04:11,907 --> 01:04:17,311
Three
I'll never let you go

1058
01:04:17,379 --> 01:04:20,439
And four, I miss you

1059
01:04:20,516 --> 01:04:23,314
Five, I wanna kiss you

1060
01:04:23,385 --> 01:04:28,254
Six
I won't leave you no more

1061
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:31,520
Six
I won't leave you

1062
01:04:31,593 --> 01:04:33,993
No more

1063
01:04:34,096 --> 01:04:37,088
Six
I won't leave you

1064
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:42,933
No mo-o-ore

1065
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:48,098
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1066
01:04:54,149 --> 01:04:56,310
Mama and Daddy

1067
01:04:56,385 --> 01:04:58,478
Raised me with lovin' care

1068
01:04:58,554 --> 01:05:00,419
They sacrificed

1069
01:05:00,489 --> 01:05:02,354
So I could have
a better share

1070
01:05:02,457 --> 01:05:04,516
They fed me and nursed me

1071
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,357
And sent me to school

1072
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:08,395
Mama taught me how to sing

1073
01:05:08,463 --> 01:05:11,591
Daddy lived the Golden Rule

1074
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,137
When I think of the children
alone and afraid

1075
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:19,800
Abandoned and wild
like a fatherless child

1076
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:22,366
I think of my mama

1077
01:05:22,444 --> 01:05:24,036
And how she could sing

1078
01:05:24,112 --> 01:05:26,410
Harmony with my daddy

1079
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:28,142
Our laughter would ring

1080
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:30,378
Down the highways

1081
01:05:30,452 --> 01:05:32,352
On the beaches

1082
01:05:32,421 --> 01:05:36,653
Just as far
as memory reaches

1083
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:40,855
I still hear Daddy
singin'his old army songs

1084
01:05:40,963 --> 01:05:42,897
We'd laugh and count horses

1085
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:44,830
As we drove along

1086
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,267
We were young then
We were together

1087
01:05:48,337 --> 01:05:50,897
We could bear floods and fire

1088
01:05:50,973 --> 01:05:52,804
And bad weather

1089
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:55,275
And now that I'm older

1090
01:05:55,344 --> 01:05:57,209
Grown up, on my own

1091
01:05:57,279 --> 01:05:59,372
I still love
Mama and Daddy best

1092
01:05:59,448 --> 01:06:02,315
And my Idaho home

1093
01:06:04,486 --> 01:06:06,351
Mama grew up

1094
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:09,322
On the prairies of Kansas

1095
01:06:09,391 --> 01:06:12,792
She was tender and sweet

1096
01:06:12,861 --> 01:06:16,729
The dust and tornadoes
blew 'round her

1097
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,791
But they left her
straight up on her feet

1098
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:25,033
My daddy grew up on his own
more or less

1099
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:28,873
His mama died
when he was just 11

1100
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:32,846
He had seven sisters
to raise him

1101
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:36,976
But he dreamed
of his mama in heaven

1102
01:06:37,052 --> 01:06:41,421
His daddy drank whiskey
and had a sharp eye

1103
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:45,517
He sold chicken medicine
farmers would buy

1104
01:06:45,594 --> 01:06:49,325
Together they hunted
the fields and the farms

1105
01:06:49,431 --> 01:06:54,368
When his daddy died
my daddy rest in my mama's arms

1106
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,494
Down the highways

1107
01:06:56,571 --> 01:06:58,505
On the beaches

1108
01:06:58,573 --> 01:07:02,703
Just as far
as memory reaches

1109
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:06,713
I still hear Daddy
singin' his old army songs

1110
01:07:06,748 --> 01:07:08,841
We'd laugh and count horses

1111
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:10,680
As we drove along

1112
01:07:10,752 --> 01:07:12,879
We were young then

1113
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:14,786
We were together

1114
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,881
We could bear
floods and fire

1115
01:07:16,959 --> 01:07:18,824
And bad weather

1116
01:07:18,894 --> 01:07:21,158
And now that I'm older

1117
01:07:21,263 --> 01:07:23,163
Grown up, on my own

1118
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:25,199
I still love
Mama and Daddy best

1119
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:27,235
And my Idaho home

1120
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:29,167
And now that I'm older

1121
01:07:29,237 --> 01:07:31,205
Grown up, on my own

1122
01:07:31,273 --> 01:07:33,104
I still love
my Mama and Daddy best

1123
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:37,805
And my Idaho home

1124
01:07:37,879 --> 01:07:39,813
For Mama and Daddy.

1125
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,372
Thank you.

1126
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:51,252
Thank you so much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1127
01:07:51,426 --> 01:07:53,223
- Thank you.
- Wonderful! Wonderful!

1128
01:07:53,328 --> 01:07:56,229
Let's hear it for Barbara Jean!
Wonderful!

1129
01:08:00,302 --> 01:08:03,237
Get that gun!

1130
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,641
I'm all right.
You get her. You get her.

1131
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:10,644
- Dad?
- Bud, help her off. I'm all right.

1132
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:13,647
- Get Walker out of here!
- Get Walker outta here!

1133
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,649
Get off your asses!

1134
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,241
Watch her head!

1135
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:20,254
Y'all take it easy now.
This isn't Dallas, it's Nashville.

1136
01:08:20,322 --> 01:08:23,257
This is Nashville.
You show 'em what we're made of.

1137
01:08:23,325 --> 01:08:26,419
They can't do this to us
here in Nashville.

1138
01:08:26,528 --> 01:08:28,325
Okay, everybody, sing!

1139
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,364
Come on, somebody, sing!

1140
01:08:30,432 --> 01:08:33,196
No, I'm fine. You sing.
You stay here and play.

1141
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:38,403
- Somebody sing. Somebody sing.
- You've been hurt.

1142
01:08:38,473 --> 01:08:40,907
- I'm gonna get somebody to help you.
- Somebody sing.

1143
01:08:40,976 --> 01:08:42,841
Sing!

1144
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:44,845
I think you've been hurt.

1145
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:48,349
Watch your step there.
Watch your step there.

1146
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:52,720
Come on, easy, easy.

1147
01:08:52,788 --> 01:08:57,054
- I can't stop that blood, man!
- You got a car or somethin'?

1148
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,593
They say this train

1149
01:08:59,694 --> 01:09:02,424
Don't give out rides

1150
01:09:02,531 --> 01:09:04,328
It don't worry me

1151
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,957
Martha! Martha!

1152
01:09:06,068 --> 01:09:10,437
And all the world
is takin' sides

1153
01:09:10,505 --> 01:09:13,030
- It don't worry me
- What happened?

1154
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:15,042
Can you please tell me
what happened?

1155
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:19,240
'Cause in my empire
life is sweet

1156
01:09:19,314 --> 01:09:23,148
Just ask any bum you meet

1157
01:09:23,218 --> 01:09:27,154
- Life may be a one-way street
- Is there anybody who can help us?

1158
01:09:27,222 --> 01:09:29,247
But it don't worry me

1159
01:09:30,358 --> 01:09:31,689
Come on, everybody sing.

1160
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,560
It don't worry me

1161
01:09:35,664 --> 01:09:39,225
It don't worry me

1162
01:09:39,334 --> 01:09:43,703
You may say I ain't free

1163
01:09:43,772 --> 01:09:46,172
It don't worry me

1164
01:09:47,776 --> 01:09:50,745
Come on!
It don't worry me

1165
01:09:52,247 --> 01:09:55,842
It don't worry me

1166
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:59,444
You may say I ain't free

1167
01:09:59,521 --> 01:10:02,979
- But it don't worry me
- It's not gon' worry me

1168
01:10:04,226 --> 01:10:08,560
The price of bread
may worry some

1169
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:11,291
It don't worry me

1170
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:16,694
Tax relief may never come

1171
01:10:16,771 --> 01:10:20,036
It don't worry me

1172
01:10:20,108 --> 01:10:24,044
- Economy's depressed, not me
- I need you. Come on.

1173
01:10:24,112 --> 01:10:28,640
- My spirit's high as it can be
- Come on down here.

1174
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:32,813
You may say I ain't free

1175
01:10:32,888 --> 01:10:34,981
It don't worry me

1176
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:40,653
No, it don't worry me

1177

You may say I ain't free

1179
01:10:49,171 --> 01:10:51,298

You may say I ain't free

1188
01:11:21,336 --> 01:11:24,999
- But it don't worry me

1189
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:29,169
It don't worry me, no

It don't worry me

- But it don't worry me
- It's not gonna worry me

1193
01:11:41,022 --> 01:11:44,822
- It don't worry me
- Now, if we don't live peaceful,

1194

- It don't worry me
- there's gonna be nothin'left...

1195
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:52,256
except Clorox bottles
and plastic fly swatters...

1196
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:55,336
But it don't worry me

1197
01:11:56,871 --> 01:12:00,568
- It don't worry me
- Why not?

01:12:00,642 --> 01:12:03,941
It don't worry me

1215
01:12:59,534 --> 01:13:03,061
except fly swatters
with red dots on 'em.

1216
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:05,105
- That's right!
- You may say

It don't worry me

1221
01:13:18,987 --> 01:13:22,354
You may say that I ain't free

1222
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:25,154

You may say that I ain't...

01:13:36,404 --> 01:13:36,733
You may say that I ain't...

1227
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,941
The price of bread

1228
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:44,843
May worry some

1229
01:13:44,913 --> 01:13:49,247
But it don't worry me

1230
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:53,614
And tax relief

1231
01:13:53,688 --> 01:13:57,180
May never come

1232
01:13:57,258 --> 01:14:02,218
But it don't worry me

Spirit's high

1235
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:13,636
As it can be

1236
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:16,438
And you may say

1237
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:19,446
That I ain't free

1238
01:14:19,514 --> 01:14:24,008
But it don't worry me

1239
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:28,654
They say this train

Don't give out rides

1241

But it don't worry me

1242
01:14:36,664 --> 01:14:39,155
And all the world

1243
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:42,600
Is takin'sides

1244
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:47,539
But it don't worry me

1245
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:51,238
'Cause in my empire

1246

Life is sweet

1247

Just ask any 'bo
that you might meet

1248
01:14:59,354 --> 01:15:01,845
Life may be

1249
01:15:01,923 --> 01:15:04,619
A one-way street
