1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,940
Yeah! You got asbestos, all right!

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,860
I'll bet it's up
in the ceiling, mostly!

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,410
Shouldn't take me more
than a day or two to remove it.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,460
(Silence)

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,210
OK, then.
Um, uh, so, we're gonna go upstairs!

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,380
All right, well,
we'll all go upstairs!

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,880
Yeah.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,260
OK, then. Yeah.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,190
What are you doing?

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,520
- He's not listening any more.
- Oh.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,650
Good. Well, you're the expert.

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,110
I hope you can take care
of this, whatever it takes.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,370
We've been trying
to catch this menace all week.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,330
Here's your problem.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,660
Normal people are not...

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,210
psychologically equipped
to catch mice.

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,750
You have to get inside their mind.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,960
You have to know what
they want... need.

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,840
You have to think like a mouse.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,470
If you can do that...
if you can think like a mouse...

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,430
you can anticipate their moves.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,690
Then, boom! Sayonara, mouse.

23
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,310
Well, you got some great stuff...

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,780
Whoa! Never touch that!

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,440
(Screaming)

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,450
- All right!
- What is it?

27
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,620
The big one.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,410
It's a flea bomb!

29
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,790
Works on mice too.

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,460
It better. Because we
can't handle any more intrusions.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,300
Sure. That's how you perceive it.

32
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,220
But to that mouse,

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,140
you are the intruder.

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,180
(Shouting)

35
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,860
We can make
enough string to meet our orders.

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,860
Just so we can keep the LaRue.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,610
- Good luck.
- Wait! Where are you going?

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,570
I have to run a little errand.

39
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,240
All you have to do
is make $1200 worth.

40
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,160
Light a match,
they're frightened by fire!

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,250
(Shouting)

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,540
(Straining)

43
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,100
(Screams)

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
Unsanitary creature.

45
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,300
Defecating... in the dining room.

46
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,300
0915. Evidence found.

47
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,060
Mus communis. Ugh. Male.

48
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,360
Ten to, uh, twelve
centimetres long,

49
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,580
with a... hmm...

50
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,290
What's this?
A slight calcium deficiency.

51
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,420
That's interesting.

52
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,640
Hi. This is Ernest Smuntz
of Smuntz String.

53
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,220
Is this Zeppco International?

54
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,060
Vinny? Hi, Vinny.
Oh, I'm glad I can call you Vinny.

55
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,860
My brother and I have decided
to reconsider your offer.

56
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,150
I'd love to discuss
selling our factory to you.

57
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,030
Oh, no, not at the office.

58
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,700
How about Ellman Square
under the big clock at noon?

59
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,270
(Horn honking)

60
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,230
(Brakes screeching)

61
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,310
(Chiming)

62
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,370
(Knocks)

63
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,540
Uh, you, you must be
Mrs Lars Smuntz?

64
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,750
I'm afraid that status
is in transition.

65
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,590
Oh, well, is Lars in? I'd like to
discuss preparations for the auction.

66
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,550
The auction?

67
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,680
(Panting)

68
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,690
Careful, Lars.
You might catch a cold.

69
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,570
April!

70
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,950
You look like you could use
some warming up.

71
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,130
(Caesar) 1300 hours. I've activated
the Squeak Seeker 2000.

72
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,590
I'm about to join with the prey.

73
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,900
I'm experiencing malfunction
with the screen. Stand by.

74
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,250
Junk.

75
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,880
Nothing works.

76
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Ah, nuts!

77
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,220
(Yelling)

78
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,350
(Yelling)

79
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,350
EKG, a C-spine, a chest x-ray
and pelvis. Now move!

80
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,100
$1200...

81
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,390
Mr Smuntz, you've been hit by a bus.

82
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,190
I feel fine. What time is it?

83
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,810
You may have had a concussion.

84
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,230
Doc, I have to get out of here.
I still have a chance.

85
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
We saved your hat.

86
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,820
- I'm sorry. Are you family?
- Yes, we are sisters.

87
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,990
There's some paperwork
I need you to fill out.

88
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,790
I don't even know them!

89
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,500
Oh, I'm Hilde, and this is Ingrid.

90
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,840
- We are hair models from Belgium.
- Belgium. How exotic.

91
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,670
Doc. I need to find a phone before
I miss out on the deal of my life.

92
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,760
- He's delirious.
- I am not their brother!

93
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,810
- I don't have any sisters!
- Are you OK? I came when I heard.

94
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,310
Why are you wearing a pink overcoat?

95
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,360
Because April gave us the $1200!

96
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,240
She gave you the money?
She didn't hear about the auction?

97
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,280
I didn't even tell her about the
auction until after she took me back.

98
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,410
She just showed up at the factory
and begged me to take her.

99
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,960
(Sighs) We made love in a way
I've only ever seen in nature films.

100
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,210
Wow. I almost can't believe it.

101
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,300
I can open up another restaurant,
you're back with April,

102
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,640
you can even keep
that worthless factory.

103
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,890
It's funny
you call the factory worthless,

104
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,480
because there's something I probably
should have mentioned...

105
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,480
Yeah? Well, I guess
I have something to confess too.

106
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,190
Hey, isn't that Caesar's truck?

107
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,290
- Oh, my God!
- Caesar! What happened?

108
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,750
- Please, he's not well.
- Did you kill the mouse?

109
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,340
What's that? Horse?

110
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,340
Fiendish! I won't eat it. (Yells)

111
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,270
(Clicking teeth and squeaking)

112
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,350
How'd you find him?

113
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,690
911 call. No voice, but we heard
screaming in the background.

114
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,320
He was locked in a trunk
in the attic.

115
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,780
We'll call you if we get any leads.

116
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,880
(Rewinding)

117
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,010
What's that?

118
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,810
(Footsteps, door creaking)

119
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,100
(Caesar) 'Put that down.
What is that? ' (Yelling)

120
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,900
(Muffled groaning, crashing)
'That tickles! '

121
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,530
(Screaming, banging)

122
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,320
I don't think we're dealing
with an ordinary mouse.

123
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,450
(Crashing)

124
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,840
My kitchen!

125
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,390
Looks like Caesar decided
to make himself a sandwich.

126
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,350
(Ernie) Pickles, arugula and capers.

127
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,570
He toasted the side
with the cheese...

128
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,730
but not the other side,

129
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,700
so the arugula doesn't wilt.

130
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,740
How did he know that?

131
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,090
Ow!

133
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,760
Ow!

134
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,820
(Yells)

135
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,360
Aha!

136
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,960
- Do you see him?
- Yeah, I see him.

137
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,850
Lars, I'm stuck!
Get me out of here! I can't breathe!

138
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,430
- I-I'll get a flashlight.
- Hurry!

139
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,440
(Hissing)

140
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,530
- Here, Ernie, I got it.
- I can see that.

141
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,030
Wh... Oh!

142
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,120
Hang on, Ernie.
The flashlight's broken.

143
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,590
- OK, Ernie. I got a light.
- Great.

144
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,340
(Sniffing)

145
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,720
(Ernie) Lars,
do you smell something?

146
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,100
Smells like gas.

147
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,600
(Screaming)

148
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,760
(Lars groaning)

149
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,310
(Strangled groans)

150
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,730
(Whimpering)

151
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,800
(Both whimpering and muttering)

152
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,980
(Lars) What are you gonna do?

153
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,650
Kill that unspeakable thing.

154
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,980
- Come on, Ernie...
- Stand back!

155
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,110
I'm a man on a mission!

156
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,530
- This is how accidents happen!
- (Laughing)

157
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:32,200
- Come on, put the gun down.
- I'll blow his furry head off.

158
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,000
And splatter his devious mouse brain
from here to kingdom come!

159
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,630
No, no! You'll blow
a hole in the wall.

160
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,590
It'll be worth it!

161
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,090
Think of the auction! For God's sake!

162
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,800
Think of the money! They'll cut our
price if there's bullet holes.

163
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,100
- The money?
- Yeah, the money, the moola.

164
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,230
- (Ernie) There he goes.
- Shoot! Shoot!

165
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,650
Yes... You hit the piano!
You hit the piano...

166
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,360
- Look...
- Shh!

167
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,670
What are you, crazy? The only thing
you haven't hit so far is the mouse!

168
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,760
Give somebody else a chance
with that gun.

169
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,260
- You're doing a wonderful job.
- (Tin rolling)

170
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,060
Whoa! You got him!

171
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,570
(Laughing)

172
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,230
(Lars) G-g-get him!

173
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,070
- See you in hell, mouse!
- (Laughing)

174
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,290
Fire!

175
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,860
God, I hate that mouse!

176
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,070
(Phone ringing)

177
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,540
(Ernie) 'After the beep,
start talking.'

178
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,830
(Vinny) 'Mr Smuntz,
this is Vinny from Zeppco calling.

179
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,880
'We waited in the square for an hour,
but you never showed.

180
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,170
'We do not appreciate
being treated this way,

181
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,590
'especially after your brother
already turned down our offer.

182
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,350
'Consider our proposal withdrawn.'

183
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
(Dialling tone)

184
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,690
- Betrayed by my own brother!
- Betrayal?

185
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,990
Don't talk to me about betrayal. You
should have told me about that offer!

186
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,200
- Half that factory is mine.
- And half is mi...

187
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,450
And half is mine, including the half
that you tried to sell.

188
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,580
And would have,
if it hadn't been for that bus!

189
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,290
Bus? You can't leave well enough
alone, can you? You ruin everything!

190
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,170
Me? You... you blame me for this?

191
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,630
Look! You blew a hole in the floor!

192
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,640
I distinctly remember
somebody yelling, "Shoot!"

193
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,560
You've never listened to me before!

194
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
- And you know why?
- Why?

195
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,940
Because I have no respect for you!

196
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,190
Spending your whole life
in that stupid factory!

197
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,280
It's tragic.

198
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,280
You think I didn't have
ambitions of my own in my life?

199
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,870
- Come on. You loved string.
- I didn't love string!

200
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,370
You and Pop were always running
something through your fingers.

201
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,500
It didn't matter what I did!

202
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,250
I made a special rack
of lamb for his 70th birthday...

203
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,090
- Oh, no!
- Yes! You remember.

204
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:19,220
I slaved over that meal,
making sure everything was perfect.

205
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,850
Did he say, "Thanks, Ernie,
it was delicious"? No.

206
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,060
He only noticed the string
I had tied it with.

207
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,770
He was crazy!

208
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,190
But I still wanted his approval.

209
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,530
I didn't leave, Lars. I was cast out.

210
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,120
There you go again!
Blaming everything else but yourself.

211
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,710
You think you're a success! Huh?

212
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,290
Well, you... can't... cook!

213
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,760
- I hate you!
- And I hate you!

214
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,260
- Not as much as I hate you!
- Yeah?

215
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,050
Yeah. Double. Double!

216
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,890
Oh, give me something!
I'm gonna brain you!

217
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,890
Here it is!

218
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,310
Oh, yeah, give it to me! Go ahead!

219
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,360
(Ernie, laughing) You killed him!

220
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,910
I-I didn't even know he was there!

221
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,870
All the trouble we'd have saved
if we'd just thrown fruit at him!

222
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,500
(Lars) Look! H-He's still breathing!

223
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,420
Kill him! Kill him!
Find a blunt object!

224
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,040
There. Let him have it.

225
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,670
- I-I...
- What are you waiting for?

226
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,180
- I can't just hit him.
- Why not?

227
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,430
Well, look at him. He's pathetic.

228
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,930
Pathetic? He's Hitler with a tail.

229
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,310
This is The Omen with whiskers.
Nostradamus didn't see this.

230
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,350
- W-well, he's a living thing.
- Not for long. Gimme that!

231
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,610
I can't!

232
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,030
(Sobs) God!

233
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,780
Look at him just lying there.

234
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,830
It just doesn't feel
very sportsmanlike.

235
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,160
Do something! He's coming to.

236
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,670
(Scratching)

237
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,300
Ah, I forgot to put holes in the box.

238
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,220
(Laughing wickedly)

239
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,620
Hasta la vista,
you little rat bastard!

240
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,620
- Come on. We got work to do.
- Two days till pay-day, my friend.

241
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:47,890
It's the architectural find
of the decade. Oh, let's go...

242
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,600
- Shall we?
- Yes.

243
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,490
- It wasn't easy, but we made it.
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,330
Ernie, I want you
to have something.

245
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,920
Pop's lucky piece of string.

246
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,220
- I'm glad you kept it.
- He, uh, he wanted us to share it.

247
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,180
I don't know why, but...

248
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,640
I think if he were here right now,

249
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
he'd be proud of you.

250
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,020
I think he'd be proud of us.

251
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,400
Hello, ladies.
How magnificent! Welcome!

252
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,700
Lars, you remember Ingrid and Hilde.

253
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,410
(Both) Hello.

254
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,250
(Ernie) Ladies, your hair
is positively biblical!

255
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,410
(Together) Oh, thank you.

256
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,920
Well, if you will excuse me,
I have to check on my crepes.

257
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,180
Keep the champagne coming. The
more they drink, the higher they bid.

258
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,680
You boys put on quite a shindig here.

259
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,180
Thank you so much, Mr Falko.

260
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,240
You know, it would be
very, very sad...

261
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,740
if you boys put on this auction
and nobody bid.

262
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,370
That would put a real crimp
in our evening, but...

263
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,500
there's no danger of that.

264
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,800
I don't know. There's a lot of
Eurotrash scarfin' the shrimps.

265
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,760
I tell you what.

266
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,800
You call off the auction... now...

267
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,760
and I will write you a cheque...

268
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,720
for ten millions.

269
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,980
As insanely generous as that is,
I have to decline,

270
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,110
but I appreciate
your thoughtful concern.

271
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,530
Enjoy the party.

272
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,450
Are you interested in spooling?

273
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,740
Oh, sure. My father...

274
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,620
I mean, my brother and I
own a string factory.

275
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,750
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,500
I would love to see
your factory sometime.

277
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,960
Really?

278
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,890
April. What a surprise.
Dropping by for no reason, I suppose?

279
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,010
Does a wife need a reason?
Oh, are you entertaining?

280
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,890
- You mean "ex-wife"?
- Not quite yet.

281
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,270
- Ah, hakuna matata.
- This crepe... c'est magnifique.

282
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,070
- The raisins are a nice touch.
- Good, aren't they?

283
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,030
Raisins?

284
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,180
(Screams)

285
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

286
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,520
We are about to start the auction.

287
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,900
I don't know whether to
congratulate you or wish you luck.

288
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,150
- Wish us luck!
- Hello, April.

289
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,110
- Oh, hello.
- Nice to see you again.

290
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,910
- I didn't know you knew our lawyer.
- It's just an expression.

291
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,790
Thank you, for joining us
for this momentous occasion

292
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,790
the auction of our one item,

293
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:54,510
- the missing LaRue.
- (Applause)

294
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:59,220
I would like to introduce the owner
of this architectural wonder,

295
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,350
- Mr Ernest Smuntz.
- (Applause)

296
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,950
Thank you, all, for coming.

297
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,240
When my father left this
extraordinary house

298
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,950
to my brother Lars...

299
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,750
and myself, uh, we...

300
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,050
had no idea what surprises
were in store for us or...

301
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,590
what was going to happen next.

302
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,320
(Ernie)
Uh, when Quincy Thorpe of the, uh...

303
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,150
Historical Society
told us of its value,

304
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,870
you, uh... you could have KNOCKED...

305
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,500
us over with a feather. We...

306
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,500
didn't know what... HIT US!
(Bangs gavel)

307
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,760
The renovation was exhausting
but ultimately rewarding.

308
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,970
- The house was in terrible disrepair
- (Murmuring)

309
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,300
But nothing that a few nails...

310
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,810
(Banging)

311
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,320
And old-fashioned
elbow grease couldn't fix.

312
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,370
- People are eager to start bidding.
- What? The bidding?

313
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,660
- The bidding!
- All right. Thank you.

314
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,080
- Thank you, Mr Smuntz.
- (Scattered applause)

315
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,590
No matter what happens, keep going.

316
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,180
Built in 1876, the last LaRue
in existence has five bedrooms...

317
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,440
- Did you see him? I thought so.
- Yes!

318
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,310
- He ate the string.
- What?

319
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,230
The string. Pop's lucky string!

320
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,230
The son of a bitch ate it!

321
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,570
- Why didn't you tell me you saw him?
- I didn't, but I found this.

322
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,700
- You should have weighed him.
- I'm sorry.

323
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,250
- Did you see where it went?
- It can't go far.

324
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,790
Well, shall we start
the bidding at $1 million?

325
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,340
Now, we all know we're here
to bid on the missing LaRue.

326
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,630
Shall we start at $500,000?

327
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,180
$500,000
from the gentleman from Japan.

328
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,310
- Now, can I hear a million?
- A million!

329
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,900
- I'll give you one and a half.
- I have $1.5 million. Two?

330
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,780
(Gasping) There he is!

331
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,160
(Auctioneer) Ladies and gentleman,
all the carpets and tapestries...

332
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,200
- are from Northern Turkey.
- Oh!

333
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,000
Now, can I have an advance on 1.5?
May I have two?

334
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,750
Can I have two,
ladies and gentlemen?

335
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,000
- Two million!
- I have $2 million.

336
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,640
I have $2 million, ladies and
gentlemen. Can I have an advance?

337
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,350
Can I have an advance on $2 million?

338
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,640
I'd like to draw your attention
to the Lincrusia details...

339
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,440
of the gold and silver-leafed
copper and pewter.

340
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,610
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
an advance? An advance on $2 million.

341
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,910
May I hear $3 million? I have three
from the lady from New York City.

342
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,500
- What are you doing?
- Uh, uh, uh... nothing!

343
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,290
Get your hand
out of there immediately!

344
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,710
Wait! Wait just a minute!

345
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,380
- Wait!
- Now, may I hear $4 million?

346
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,220
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

347
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,010
(Man) Four million.

348
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,600
- Ooh!
- $4 million from the gentleman.

349
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,600
I got it!

350
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,230
Uh, the sheikh bids $5 million.
Thank you, sir. I have $5 million.

351
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,820
- $5 million.
- (Hysterical laughing)

352
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:30,200
Any advance on $5 million?
Ladies and gentlemen, $5 million.

353
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,750
An advance? Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the missing LaRue.

354
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,210
The bidding stands at $5 million.

355
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,130
(Lars) I've got you now!

356
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,800
- Hold on tight, I'll get it out.
- (Unzips)

357
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,630
Uh, $5 million for the missing LaRue.

358
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,720
- Have you got it yet?
- I'm not sure.

359
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
will someone give me $6 million?

360
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,140
- Six million.
- Thank you, sir.

361
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,560
Hilde, the spool is smoking!

362
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:05,530
May I have an advance?
An advance, ladies and gentlemen.

363
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,820
Can I have an advance on six?

364
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,620
The bidding stands at $6 million.

365
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,450
- $7 million.
- $7 million. Thank you.

366
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,790
- Any advance on seven?
- (Laughs)

367
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,590
(Screaming)

368
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,930
Keep her away from the walls!
The house is priceless!

369
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,350
C-c-can I have 7.5?

370
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,100
(Confused shouts)

371
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,390
I have $8 million over there.

372
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,810
$8 million going once,
$8 million going twice...

373
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,320
$8 million?!
You should have taken the cheque!

374
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,150
You shut up! You...

375
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,570
- Ten millions!
- $10 million. Can I have 11?

376
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,830
$11 million
from the gentleman from Japan.

377
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,200
- (All shrieking)
- 12. 13. 14. 15.

378
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,830
Aha!

379
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,130
- $16 million from Ernie Smuntz.
- No!

380
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,460
- 17 million!
- $17 million. Thank you, sir.

381
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,420
Any advance on 17?

382
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,520
Good idea.

383
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,820
When I say, turn it on full blast.
We'll flush him out.

384
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,030
Now!

385
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,080
- $18 million.
- $18 million from the lady.

386
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,710
You don't have that kind of money.

387
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,220
- Ernie?
- Not now.

388
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,850
- 20 millions.
- 20 million. Can I hear 21?

389
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,170
$21 million from the gentleman.

390
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,470
- Any advance?
- 22 million. That's my last offer.

391
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
22 million going once...

392
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,940
- 25 millions.
- $25 million dollars.

393
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,450
Thank you, sir. $25 million.

394
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,830
The bidding stands at $25 million.
Do I have an advance?

395
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,410
$25 million going once,

396
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,790
$25 million going twice...

397
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,760
(All screaming)

398
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,320
Going... going...

399
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,820
(Indistinct grumbling)

400
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,410
Hey! Don't go!

401
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,040
The water was just a...

402
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,000
a demonstration of...
of how durable...

403
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,090
a LaRue really is.

404
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,430
How about that?

405
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,100
Now you know this house
will last forever.

406
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,530
(Laughing)

407
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,880
- Pop's lucky string.
- I guess we got him.

408
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,920
Yeah, I guess we did.

409
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,770
(Snoring)

410
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,080
(Machinery starting)

411
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,390
What was that?

412
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,240
Lars! Look!

413
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,440
It's string.

414
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,570
It's cheese.

415
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:19,690
The factory has been retrofitted
to manufacture cheese-based products.

416
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:24,030
- I see.
- This is our new lactose-free line.

417
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,990
- What is that?
- That's quality control.

418
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,200
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

419
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:35,290
Oh. No good, huh? Otis, more curry.

420
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,290
OK. Try this one.

421
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:44,090
Huh? It's mozzarella and herring.
You can taste the herring, right?

422
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,970
I've got an idea
for a caviar-brie swirl

423
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,680
and peanut butter and jelly for kids.

424
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,760
But I really want
to talk about marketing.

425
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,020
You should be our spokesperson.

426
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,060
I know some people who've used
a mouse as a spokesperson.

427
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,730
You see, I want to turn this into the
string cheese factory of tomorrow...
