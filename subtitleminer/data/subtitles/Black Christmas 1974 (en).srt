Black Christmas

00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:22,366
* Silent Night music playing *

4
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:39,170
Hey, who leave the god damn
front door open?

5
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:16,040
Oh, by the way how come I was the only
one there working today?

6
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:18,000
We were there the whole
afternoon, Barb.

7
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,961
A likely story.

8
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:21,045
How does it look?

9
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:23,547
***

10
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:24,800
You got your Santa costume ready?

11
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:28,094
Yeah ...
What time the little bastard
arrive?

12
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:30,846
- At one o'clock.
- Terrific.

13
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:34,683
Hello?

14
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,270
Pardon?

15
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:38,688
Who?

16
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:43,567
Barb, it's to you.
Long distance.

17
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,861
Oh, great.
I'll take it in the other room.

18
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:21,397
Could you guys shut up in there?
I can't hear a damn thing!

19
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,190
Hello!

20
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,652
Mom, hang on, I can't hear you.

21
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:32,043
Operator, I can't hear ...
what's coming from the other end. Can you ...

22
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:52,928
No, we just having a little party.

23
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,349
No, I had a couple.

24
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,768
Oh come on,
I'm not drunk.

25
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:05,107
No, no ...
I had some stuff I had to do
in the afternoon ...

26
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:09,108
And then I was just gonna get 
the 720 train to the city.

27
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,539
Oh come on, you got 
to be kidding ...

28
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,255
Why can't I come too?

29
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,426
Who the hell is he?

30
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:33,886
Good night.

31
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:39,725
See you next week.

32
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:43,646
Hey call before you come,
I have to get my parents ...

33
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,523
I'll just get a couple of 
my friends and we'll go.

34
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,190
All right.

35
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:51,612
Yea sure I'll be fine ...
I'll see you around.

36
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:54,740
Hey, Chris, wait up,
I need a ride.

37
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,539
Put the christmas music back on.

38
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:12,883
Who wants to go skiing
for two days?

39
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:18,681
Yeah, sure, Barb.

40
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:22,476
My mom has a house in Mount Valley.
Who else wants to come?

41
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:25,187
- Yea, sounds like fun.
- Great.

42
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,859
- What about you Clare?
- No thanks Barb, I made some
other plans.

43
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:34,322
I'll get it.

44
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:45,625
Hello?

45
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,002
Hello?

46
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,546
Hello!

47
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:56,510
Hey, quiet!
It's him again! The monnah.

48
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:24,872
Powikszy some options among
listed repertoire.

49
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:26,916
This is a person?

50
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:31,337
No, Clare. That's the Mormon doing their 
annual obscene phone call.

51
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,546
Shh ...

52
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:04,620
/ You big cunt ... you big cunt ....

53
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:11,168
/ Let me lick it ... Lick it ... 
/ Lick it ...

54
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,681
/ You big cunt,
/ pretty big cunt.

55
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:30,185
- Not bad.
/ Fuck my juicy cock /

56
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:36,066
/ I'll come over to you and you can ...
/ suck it ... suck it ...

57
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:40,990
Listen you pervent! Why don't you go over to Lambda-Ko?
They could use a little of this.

58
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:45,369
/ You big cunt, you want my fat cock ...

59
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:49,415
Why don't you go find a wall socket and stick your tongue in it,
that will give you a charge.

60
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,626
I'll stick my tongue up 
your pretty pussy ...

61
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,128
You fucking creep!

62
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,796
I am going to kill you.

63
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,893
Well, super-tongue strikes again.

64
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:10,978
Fastest tongue in the west.

65
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,521
It's sick byo ...

66
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:15,733
I really don't think you should provoke 
somebody like that, Barb.

67
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,945
Oh listen, this guy is minor league.
In the city I get two of those a day.

68
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,946
Maybe.

69
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:23,115
But do you know a town girl was raped
a couple of weeks ago.

70
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:27,787
Darling ...
You can't rape a townie.

71
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:30,081
You really are too much,
Barb.

72
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:34,043
Come on, this is a sorority house,
not a convent.

73
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,212
I'll see you later.
I'm gonna go pack.

74
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,844
Come on, Clare, she
didn't mean anything.

75
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:48,307
No, really Jess, it's okay.
I have to finish packing anyway.

76
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:53,982
Doesn't she had enough trouble sitting in here 
without you getting at her all the time.

77
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:56,440
Come on.
I know professional virgin when I see one.

78
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:59,110
Hey, I can't get my hands out here.

79
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:01,362
Speaking of professional
virgins ...

80
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:04,156
Here we have, the queen of bozes.

81
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,159
Where have you been?

82
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:12,081
I have been shopping. You know how the 
store is most spectacular at this time of year.

83
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:17,086
Mrs. Mac, come on to the other room, we got a
surprise for you.

84
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,722
Where have you been?

85
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:30,433
Me and Maxine has been looking
all over for you.

86
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,602
Oh, little puss ...

87
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:37,732
Okay, let's see ...

88
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,236
Claud?

89
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:25,696
Is that you, puss?

90
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:28,739
Kitty ...

91
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,161
Who is that?

92
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,289
Who is it?

93
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,251
Claud?

94
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:47,176
Who is it?

95
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:53,015
Who is it?

96
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:03,025
Dear, girls ...
This is really beautiful.

97
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:09,073
It's really lovely.

98
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:15,329
Come on Mrs. Mac, put it on.

99
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:18,874
Put it on? Oh come on I'm
not going to bed.

100
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,794
Come on, please.

101
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:25,464
Put it on.

102
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:27,668
Anything for you girls because
it's Christmas.

103
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:52,867
Okay, girls, party is over.
Let's get this junk clean up.

104
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:57,082
Oh yea, come on, everybody takes a little 
something and it won't take long.

105
00:12:57,007 --> 00:13:02,463
Come on, that's it girls.
Just a little cooporation.

106
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:09,203
- Let's just get you out.
- I'm tired.

107
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:11,636
Good night.

108
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,608
Booze.

109
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,992
There you are ...

110
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:51,050
Good night, good night ...
Merry Christmas!

111
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:02,520
Jess, you girls are just
too good to me.

112
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:05,022
Oh nonsense, Mrs. Mac.

113
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:21,914
Hello?

114
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:24,834
- Hello, is Jess there please?
- Yes, wait a second, Peter.

115
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,919
Jess, it's for you.
It's him.

116
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:31,090
Hello?

117
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:32,633
Hi, how's the party?

118
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,844
It was good.
Too bad you couldn't make it.

119
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:38,973
I had been practicing for four days straight.
I am really wiped out.

120
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:43,060
Jess, dear ...
You won't forget to put off the lights.

121
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:46,314
You've got to find some time.
I've got to talk to you.

122
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,234
You sounds funny.
What's the matter?

123
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:52,737
Nothing is matter.
I just want to talk to you.

124
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,489
Why don't you tell me now?

125
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:59,035
Because I want to talk
to you face to face.

126
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:04,332
Jess, I haven't been to bed in three nights.
And it's not the mood to be playing games.

127
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:07,251
Look, Peter, we'll talk
about it tomorrow, okay?

128
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:13,758
- Okay, I'll be in room 30 all day.
- Alright, I'll see you around 14:00.

129
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,929
I'm just terribly exhausted.

130
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,558
- It's okay ... I love you.
- I know.

131
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:27,563
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, goodnight.

132
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,630
Clare?

133
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:37,675
Clare?

134
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:07,098
- Oh, thank you.
- It's okay.

135
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:09,058
Sorry, I should have been keeping a better
watching at them.

136
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,561
- I think so.
- I said I was sorry.

137
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,690
Excuse me...

138
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:19,193
I hate to bother you, I can
see that you are busy.

139
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:21,279
But I wonder if you can help me?

140
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,615
You see, I'm suppose to meet my
daughter here at 1 o'clock.

141
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:27,785
It's half past now, and
she's still not here ...

142
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,288
Here name is Clare Harrison,
do you know here?

143
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,164
Clare Harrison?

144
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,208
Yeah ... I think so ...

145
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,212
I know she lives in a sorority house.
It's called the ...

146
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:41,507
... Pi-Kappa-Sigma.

147
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,635
Oh, of course.
Kappa is a sister sorority.

148
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:48,514
Some other girls were over here today,
but I haven't seen Clare.

149
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:50,725
The place isn't far, I will tell you
how to get there.

150
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:54,061
Ho, ho, ho ... shit.

151
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:57,773
Santa, please.

152
00:18:57,815 --> 00:19:01,027
Look she's suppose to me going with me
for this weekend, dammit.

153
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:04,363
Well we decided that we'll go skiing
for a few days.

154
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:08,451
Yeah, I've been looking forward to this
for three weeks. Bitch.

155
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,411
Isn't Santa naughty?

156
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,413
Ho, ho, ho ... fuck.

157
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:18,210
I just don't know, Mr. Harrison.
Her clothes are all packed and ready to go.

158
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:24,091
I'll take you to the common room.
They are having a party today for underprivileged children.

159
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:36,729
Yes, I know.

160
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:43,527
I am very disappointed in
this atmosphere.

161
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,197
I intend to do something about it.

162
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:50,493
Who is this?

163
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:59,627
Oh, that's a friend of Clare.
Very nice young man from the town,
Chris Hayden.

164
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,013
I didn't sent my daughter here to be drinking and ...
... picking up boys.

165
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:13,293
Clare is a good girl, Mr.
Harrison.

166
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:17,645
I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea about that.
She is a good girl.

167
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,231
I am sure you will find her
in the fraternity house.

168
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:24,652
In fact I could show you the way.
I have to go to a store near there.

169
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:27,321
If you wouldn't mind
giving me a lift.

170
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:29,031
I know where it is.

171
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,910
I will be glad to
give you a ride.

172
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:44,588
This is very kind of you, Mr.
Harrison.

173
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:47,091
I'll just get my bag.

174
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:03,774
"I didn't sent my daughter here 
to be drinking and picking up boys."

175
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:06,485
Tough shit ...

176
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:10,239
I was supposed to be responsible ...

177
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,202
... for the moral of every girl
in this god damn house.

178
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:23,002
The leaning tower of Pisa 
if they can get up there.

179
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:25,421
I'll do my best ...

180
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,717
I don't know what the bastard
expect of me.

181
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,677
For Christ sake ...

182
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,431
Claud?

183
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:39,060
Is that you, Claud?

184
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,062
Claud?

185
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:44,815
Here kitty, kitty, kitty ...

186
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,153
Come on Claud. Come say
goodbye to mommy.

187
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:51,489
Is that you, Claud?

188
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,661
Jesus, Claud.
Look what you made me do!

189
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,996
And let's ...

190
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:06,921
Come on Claud, here kitty, kitty, kitty ...
Come on Claud, I got to go!

191
00:22:07,713 --> 00:22:09,799
Here, kitty!

192
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,177
Damn it Claud,
you little prick!

193
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:22,895
This is very kind of you ,
Mr. Harrison.

194
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:25,690
I think I will get out of here ...

195
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,725
What?

196
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:03,853
I am pregnant.

197
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:06,564
Jessica, that's fantastic.

198
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:08,608
I don't want it.

199
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:12,320
You don't want it?

200
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,948
No. I want to have an abortion.

201
00:23:18,034 --> 00:23:20,953
You can't made a decision like that.
You haven't even ask me.

202
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:23,748
I wasn't even going to tell you.

203
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:25,958
Jess ...

204
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:29,795
I want us to have a baby.

205
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:32,006
Peter, I can't ...

206
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:34,425
Oh Christ, Jess.

207
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:50,524
Don't you ever consider anyone but yourself?

208
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:55,154
I've thought this out very carefully and
I know what I'm gonna do.

209
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:59,533
Do you know how important this
afternoon is to me?

210
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:01,827
Yes I do.

211
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:07,375
Why don't you just get out of here.

212
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:21,681
Jess!

213
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:25,643
I want to talk to you tonight.

214
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:27,687
There is nothing to discuss Peter.

215
00:24:27,728 --> 00:24:30,523
- I think there is.
- I'm not going to change my mind.

216
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:33,734
We'll see. Will you be there at 9 o'clock?

217
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:36,904
- Yes.
- Okay, I will see you tonight.

218
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:45,246
Yes, dear.
I am sure there is nothing wrong.

219
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:48,582
Yes, I just been talking to 
a friend of hers.

220
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:51,502
She's going to call her out for me.

221
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:56,215
Yes, if we don't have any luck
I'll go to the police.

222
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,140
Well I don't think I'll be able to go home tonight.
It's a bit late to head out now.

223
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:10,479
Good-bye, dear.

224
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,784
Hello?

225
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:27,496
Hello!

226
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,832
Oh hell, not again!

227
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:30,875
/ Billy.

228
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,835
Billy?

229
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:35,713
I'm sorry, you have the
wrong number.

230
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:38,758
/ Do you know what a
mother should do?

231
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,552
/ Where did you put the baby?

232
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:43,387
You got the wrong number ...

233
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:47,141
/ Where did you put the agnes, Billy?

234
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:50,061
Look I'm telling you, you have
the wrong number!

235
00:26:15,962 --> 00:26:19,090
Hold it, hold it ...
Jesus ...

236
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:21,175
Could you just give it to
me one at a time?

237
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:24,053
Well what the hell are you
planning to do about it?

238
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:28,015
You ... Shut up.

239
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:34,272
You know, for a public servant
I think your attitude really sucks.

240
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:38,067
Shut up.

241
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:42,839
Now, Mr. Harrison, if you convinced that
your daughter is missing ...

242
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,324
... you can fill up one of these forms.

243
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:51,163
I don't know if there's any consolation, but
90% of the time girls who reported missing from the college ...

244
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:54,333
... they're out of campus somewhere 
with their boyfriend.

245
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,878
Thanks, but that's not much of a consolation.

246
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:03,509
- Oh ... - Let me help you.
- Thank you dear.

247
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:09,807
You know we got to get Mr. to fix this door.
I must had called that son of a bitch a hundred times.

248
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:17,231
Mrs. Mac, there was another one
of those calls just now

249
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:19,775
What about it, dear?

250
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,820
It was weird.
Some woman screaming ...

251
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:24,280
... then a man wailing.

252
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:27,199
Clare Harrison father was here today.

253
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:31,037
Really? I'm sorry I didn't
get to say goodbye to her.

254
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:35,291
Well, you still might. Clare didn't
meet him where she was suppose to.

255
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,252
I thought she was over to
the fraternity.

256
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,384
Here, you have ...

257
00:27:46,636 --> 00:27:49,263
And let it lean Mojesz.

258
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,226
Excuse me.

259
00:27:55,811 --> 00:28:00,607
Could you give me the number of
the sorority house? Please.

260
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,779
Yeah, sure.

261
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:06,864
It's a ...

262
00:28:08,324 --> 00:28:12,286
Fellecio ... 2 0 8 8 0

263
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:15,623
What?

264
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:20,836
Fellecio. It's a new exchange.
FE.

265
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:26,217
So now I know what it mean ...
How do you spell it?

266
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:35,224
Capital 'F', 'e', little 'l', 'l'
'a', 't', 'i' 'o'.

267
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,646
Thanks.

268
00:28:39,188 --> 00:28:41,148
Don't mention it.

269
00:28:58,374 --> 00:28:59,792
Chris!

270
00:29:02,962 --> 00:29:04,380
Break!

271
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,801
Hi, what's up?

272
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:11,679
- Do you seen Clare today?
- No, she went home.

273
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:14,432
No she didn't.
No one knows where she is.

274
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:16,726
Are you serious?

275
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:20,605
I thought maybe she was with you or
at least you might have heard from her.

276
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:23,399
No, not since last night.

277
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:27,987
Her father came to pick her up at 1 o'clock
today and she didn't show.

278
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:31,490
So he went down to the police
station with Barb.

279
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:33,367
What happened?

280
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:37,121
- They didn't take it seriously.
- Why?

281
00:29:37,163 --> 00:30:42,877
I don't know.
Probably confused that with
someone where you leap.

282
00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:58,665
Well um.. She is out for Christmas holiday,
but ...

283
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:03,666
... there was a bad practice over at the
highschool this afternoon.

284
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:10,131
when not wrcia home, her call
the best przyjaciki, Melody,

285
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:14,343
but there is no one knew.

286
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:21,934
She is only 13 years
old, Lieutenant ...

287
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:26,022
My husband is a trucker and
he is out on the road,

288
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:27,648
So I came over here.

289
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,819
Is it really so unusual for
her to be just a few hours late?

290
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:35,948
Oh yes, she should have been home at noon.
We are going to buy a present for her father.

291
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:42,079
Nash, you stupid son of a bitch, you got
a big goddamn mouth!

292
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,873
What the hell are you talking about?

293
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:47,668
- Hi Chris, how is your brother?
- Can I talk to you?

294
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,628
What's up?

295
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:51,673
I want to know why nothing is being done about
Clare Harrison being missing and ...

296
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:56,886
... And why does... this idiot getting away
with saying the things he does?

297
00:31:57,303 --> 00:31:58,930
You are a friend of Clare Harrison?

298
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:00,848
Yeah I have been taking her out.

299
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:05,853
This is Jessica, she live
in the same sorority house as Clare.

300
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:10,608
Alright, come on in. Sergeant,
put me the file on the Harrison girl.

301
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,527
And take care of this.

302
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:23,955
Try to eat something, Mr.
Harrison.

303
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,874
You know, starving yourself isn't
going to help the situation at all.

304
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:31,087
No, thank you very much Mrs. Mac, but
I just have no appetite.

305
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:35,216
I feel I should be doing something,
but I don't know what.

306
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:37,593
Why don't you just try to
stop worrying.

307
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:39,595
The best thing you can
do is stay right here.

308
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:43,516
If only I knew what
he was doing.

309
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:47,645
Did you know ...
It's very little known fact, but ...

310
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:53,276
... did you know that there is a certain
species of turtle ...

311
00:32:55,987 --> 00:32:59,448
There is a certain species of turtle.

312
00:32:59,865 --> 00:33:05,121
That can screw for
three days without stopping.

313
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:08,040
You don't believe me, do you?

314
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:11,752
Well, I mean how can I
make something like that?

315
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:16,382
Barb, dear, I, I, I ...

316
00:33:16,424 --> 00:33:21,345
No, really ...
They just three days ...
24 hours a day, for okrtk,
up, up, up ...

317
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:25,474
Can you believe that?
Three days?

318
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:28,394
I'm happy if I
get three minutes.

319
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:30,438
Do you know how I know this?

320
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:35,943
Because I went down to
the zoo and I watch them.

321
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:38,613
It was very boring.

322
00:33:38,654 --> 00:33:44,660
Actually I didn't stay for the
whole three days.

323
00:33:44,702 --> 00:33:50,916
I went over and I watch the zebras, because
they only takes a few seconds.

324
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:14,732
You think it's my fault
don't you?

325
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:16,943
Barb, stop it.

326
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:22,198
Don't shit me. That's all what you all thinking.
Why not just come on out and say it?

327
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,328
You think that I drove her away, and if
she is dead you're gonna blame me.

328
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:30,998
Barb, for God sake ...

329
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:36,504
If that's all what we all thinking why isn't
someone just come right out and say it?

330
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:38,714
Barb, you have too much drinking.
... Mr. Harrison

331
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:40,841
I don't give a shit out of Mr. Harrison!

332
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:45,554
I'm sick and tired of everyone in this house 
enunciating stuffs and not coming out with what they mean.

333
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,848
Barb, why don't you go upstairs and
lie down for a while.

334
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,894
Shut up.
And you leave me alone. Damn you.

335
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:54,563
You think it's my fault that you
have been employed all this afternoon.

336
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:59,568
Barb, you are drunk.
Go to bed.

337
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,290
Yea, sure ... ... fine.

338
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,418
- Any news?
- Yes, where Mr. Harrison?

339
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,003
He's in the dining room.

340
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:33,371
- We won't be long, Mrs. Mac.
- Alright, dear.

341
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:35,247
- Phyl, Phyl ...
- Yes?

342
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:37,541
- I'm sure Clare will be alright.
- I hope so.

343
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:41,128
I just want to tell you that I'm going to
go to my sister's for the holiday so I,

344
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,172
I might not be here
when you get back.

345
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:46,133
Well, that's okay. Just check out on Barb
before you leave, could you do that?

346
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:47,969
- Of course, I will.
- And you take care.

347
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,262
We'll give you advice, Mrs. Mac.

348
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:55,684
Mrs. Quaife and Mr Harrison have
asked me to extend their thanks to you ...

349
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,770
... for coming out this cold night to help.

350
00:36:57,812 --> 00:37:04,860
Mrs. Quaife has told us that Janice
most likely came through this park,

351
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:07,363
... on her way home from school today.

352
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:11,284
So the first thing we will do search the park.

353
00:37:11,993 --> 00:37:17,164
When I tell you, I want you all to assemble
at the south edge of the park,

354
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:19,417
with your assigned officer.

355
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,628
Then we'll just walk through the park.
Spread out evenly.

356
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,173
/ Are not distracted.
There will be two sets of dogs leading the way.

357
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:31,178
Just spread out
and follow them.

358
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:34,890
George, stay out from the franks.

359
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:46,569
Now if any of you find anything, I want you to send
someone out immediately to report it to me.

360
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,904
Is that clear?

361
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,198
Are there any questions?

362
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:55,995
Okay, lets go.

363
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:40,623
* Mrs. Mac singing *

364
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:52,718
Alright ... I hear you!

365
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:57,723
Claud?

366
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:01,269
Claud?

367
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,963
Where are you?

368
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,582
How did you get up on 
the attic, Claud?

369
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:07,209
Shit ...

370
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,925
Oh right, God damn it,
You can wait.

371
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:23,058
Claud, are you up here?

372
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:27,729
Jesus Christ, I don't see how it
could be up here ...

373
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,273
Claud.

374
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:36,822
Jesus, Claud ...
Now look at what you make me do.

375
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:45,873
Jesus ...
I've got to clean this place up one of these days.

376
00:40:45,998 --> 00:40:47,458
Claud?

377
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,689
I can't see a damn thing.

378
00:40:56,425 --> 00:41:00,596
Claud... God damn it, Claud,
I'm going to have you fixed.

379
00:41:31,877 --> 00:41:33,545
Hey!

380
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:39,384
Anybody there?

381
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:46,725
Anybody there?

382
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:42,406
I'm gonna have to split. Peter is coming 
around and I'm late already.

383
00:42:42,448 --> 00:42:45,075
- It's cold.
- We'll coming home soon too.

384
00:42:45,117 --> 00:42:46,577
I am freezing.

385
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:49,830
- We'll let you know if there is anything happen.
- Bye.

386
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:27,451
Jess? Is that my baby?

387
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:28,368
Please wait ...

388
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,370
Jeeeess!

389
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:14,748
Hello?

390
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:18,544
Hello?

391
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:22,256
Who is this?

392
00:44:32,724 --> 00:44:36,186
What do you want?
Why are you doing this?

393
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:49,992
Who are you?
For God's sake, what are you doing?

394
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:53,704
I know what you did, Billy!
Stupid Billy!

395
00:44:53,745 --> 00:44:56,665
Billy! Billy! Billy!

396
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:58,751
Stop this!

397
00:45:03,505 --> 00:45:06,008
Jesus Christ, Mrs. Mac?

398
00:45:07,968 --> 00:45:10,012
Mrs. Mac! Are you home?

399
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:13,182
Mrs. Mac, are you up there?

400
00:45:44,004 --> 00:45:57,017
Yes, hello?

401
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,105
I had been getting obscene phone calls, and
I want to know what can be done about it?

402
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,233
Yes alright, I'll hold.
But only for a moment.

403
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,950
Peter, Jesus,
you scared the hell out of me!

404
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,368
Why don't you say something?

405
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,703
Yea? Well, . ..

406
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:20,999
You scare the hell out of me too.

407
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,960
What's all the yelling about?

408
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:25,462
I have been upstairs 
having a little sleep.

409
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:28,632
Hope you don't mind, but
I'm got a little cold up there waiting for you.

410
00:46:28,674 --> 00:46:32,219
- Sorry, I was late, Peter.
- Yeah ...

411
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:36,932
Clare Harrison is missing. I was out
with the search party looking for her.

412
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:41,728
Yes, hello ...
I want to report something.

413
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,648
No, I don't want to hold!

414
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:50,988
- How does the recital going?
- How do you think it went?

415
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:54,491
Peter, what kind of a
game are you playing?

416
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,743
I thought you wanted to talk.

417
00:46:56,785 --> 00:47:01,331
So why don't you quit attacking me and
we try to have a rational adult conversation?

418
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:04,501
Yes, now stay on the line.

419
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:09,298
Calm down, lady.
Let's have the story.

420
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:13,260
Oh yea? What's the address?

421
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,433
Number 6, Belmont Street ...
How many calls?

422
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:22,853
Ringing your operator?

423
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,732
Oh yea ...?
Well, miss, we're very busy here.

424
00:47:26,774 --> 00:47:28,901
There has been a child
murdered in the park.

425
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:33,447
I do not know when we will be
able to are the classes.

426
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:37,034
Probably just one of your
boyfriend playing a little joke.

427
00:47:37,075 --> 00:47:41,205
Yea, I'll report it and
tell them as soon as possible.

428
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:43,082
I'm sorry, miss.

429
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:55,594
Jess, what's wrong?

430
00:47:57,054 --> 00:48:00,140
A little girl was found murdered
in the park.

431
00:48:00,182 --> 00:48:01,850
What?

432
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:06,396
The search party that was looking for Clare
found the little girl murdered.

433
00:48:06,438 --> 00:48:09,525
And Clare is still missing.

434
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:12,861
Clare is alright.

435
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:15,405
Is she?

436
00:48:18,242 --> 00:48:20,619
Listen Jess, I know
that you are upset.

437
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:23,288
But I've got something to tell you.

438
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,001
I'm leaving the conservatory.

439
00:48:28,043 --> 00:48:30,838
- Peter ...
- Well just hear me out.

440
00:48:30,879 --> 00:48:32,923
Will you hear me out, please?

441
00:48:34,591 --> 00:48:38,804
I live in one room for 8 years
and I'm tired of it.

442
00:48:39,555 --> 00:48:44,893
I'm tired of having to line up behind six people
everytime I want to take a bath. I'd had it.

443
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:50,441
I am quiting the conservatory and
we are getting married.

444
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:58,490
Well, say something.

445
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:06,749
Do you remember when we first met?

446
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:10,961
You told me about you wanting to
be a concert pianist.

447
00:49:11,003 --> 00:49:13,839
How it was your greatest dream.

448
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:18,844
And I told you about some of the
things that I wanted to do.

449
00:49:18,886 --> 00:49:21,388
I still want to do those things.

450
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:26,268
You can't ask me to drop everything
I've been working for ...

451
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,605
and give up all my ambitions,
because your plans have changed.

452
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:32,775
Be realistic, I can't
marry.

453
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:36,487
Sure you can.
What is it change?

454
00:49:36,528 --> 00:49:40,491
We could be married and you can still
do anything that you wanted to do.

455
00:49:43,827 --> 00:49:46,747
Peter, I don't
want to marry you.

456
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:58,383
Alright ... What about the baby?

457
00:49:58,634 --> 00:50:03,639
- I didn't want to bother it with you sir.
- Oh you didn't.

458
00:50:04,056 --> 00:50:06,934
No .6 Belmont Street,
that's where you daughter is?

459
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,644
Yes it is.

460
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:14,441
A high school girl has been murdered.
Mr. Harrison's daughter is missing.

461
00:50:14,483 --> 00:50:19,988
And now that the house where she lives
keep getting out obscene phone calls.

462
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:24,034
Don't you think we have
to look into it?

463
00:50:24,076 --> 00:50:26,870
Well, lieutenant, I guess ...
Sure.

464
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:29,832
Thank you, lieutenant.

465
00:50:30,582 --> 00:50:32,251
Yea thanks, lieutenant.

466
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,253
Sergeant Nash.

467
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,422
Could I speak with you
for a minute?

468
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:20,466
Yea, sure, Lieutenant.

469
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:25,804
What's this?

470
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:29,892
That's the number of
the sorority house.

471
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:34,646
- "Fellecio"?
- Yea, a password wywoawcze.

472
00:51:36,023 --> 00:51:37,900
You don't understand?

473
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:43,947
Yea. "Fellecio." One of the girls that was
in here afternoon gave it to me.

474
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:47,075
- She gave it to you?
- Yes.

475
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:53,040
Nash, I don't think you could pick your nose
without written instructions.

476
00:52:08,764 --> 00:52:11,683
I know. Something dirty in it.

477
00:52:21,693 --> 00:52:24,321
You selfish bitch.

478
00:52:24,363 --> 00:52:28,158
You're talking about killing a baby 
as though you are having a  ...

479
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,828
Now can you see why I
didn't want to tell you.

480
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:34,289
- What the hell are you trying to do to me?
- What are you doing to yourself?

481
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:47,136
Jess ...
Let's get one thing straight.

482
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:50,639
You are not going to
abort that baby.

483
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:53,934
Peter, you're not going to tell me
what I can and cannot do.

484
00:52:53,976 --> 00:52:56,478
- If you are going to get an abortion ...
- I think you better leave ...

485
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,231
- If you are trying to get an abortion ...
- I said get out.

486
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:06,530
You are going to be very sorry.

487
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,958
Hi, Peter.

488
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,878
I'll get Jess.

489
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:28,844
- Jess, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

490
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:30,596
Any more news?

491
00:53:30,637 --> 00:53:34,266
No, but there are some people here to
see about the phone calls.

492
00:53:40,481 --> 00:53:43,400
Jess, this is Lieutenant Fuller.
.. I'm sorry ...

493
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:44,443
Graham, Bill Graham.

494
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:47,488
- Do you today will be present in the house?
- Yes.

495
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:51,825
I would like to put a tap on your phone, but
I need your written permission to do that.

496
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:52,993
Okay.

497
00:53:53,118 --> 00:53:56,121
Okay, Bill, go ahead.
I would like to see Clare Harrison room.

498
00:53:56,163 --> 00:53:59,249
- Where is the telephone.
- There's one in the living room on the hall.

499
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:00,918
Clare's room is up here.

500
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,675
- How many girls live in this house?
- Okoo ten.

501
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:28,070
Hey, this is Bill Graham, 6 Belmont Street,
working on the line 5596114th

502
00:54:28,695 --> 00:54:29,530
Great.

503
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,454
This afternoon I got a call from a woman
and I thought it was a wrong number.

504
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:39,623
But then she start to
screaming at me.

505
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:44,086
Who was the last one here to
see Miss Harrison?

506
00:54:44,128 --> 00:54:47,506
- I think I was.
- When?

507
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:49,675
Last night, about 22.30.

508
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:54,346
- Is this the way she left her room as far as you know?
- Yes.

509
00:54:56,849 --> 00:54:59,893
- What is this?
- We are having a party last night.

510
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:04,189
- She drink a lot?
- No, hardly at all.

511
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:08,652
Does she have any emotional problems?

512
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:11,655
No, not Clare.

513
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,995
Who is she seeing besides
Chris Hayden?

514
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,248
- With no one.
- You sure of that?

515
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:26,211
So you seen a lady the last
time this morning?

516
00:55:26,253 --> 00:55:28,922
- Last night.
- Right, last night.

517
00:55:28,964 --> 00:55:34,887
- Has anyone seen her this morning? - No I didn't.
- All the others girls are gone for the holidays.

518
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:39,933
- Can I get a list of their phone numbers where I can reach them?
- Sure. There is one on Mrs. Mac's room.

519
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:42,936
- Who is Mrs. Mac?
- She's our house mother.

520
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:54,364
- Is there anyone in the house right now?
- Yes, another girl, Barbara Collard.

521
00:55:54,406 --> 00:55:57,868
She is upstairs asleep.
She is not feeling too well.

522
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:01,622
- Is she the one that was at the station today?
- Yea.

523
00:56:01,663 --> 00:56:05,042
Yea well... Let her sleep.

524
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:10,506
Were there any deliveries yesterday, or was 
anyone working in the house, anything like that?

525
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,883
No, I don't think so.
Mrs. Mac would know.

526
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:14,927
- Is all the sisters number on this list?
- Yes.

527
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:17,638
Graham, how is it going?
You about finish?

528
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:21,934
Yes, what I've done is I've
tapped this phone so that when it rings

529
00:56:21,975 --> 00:56:23,685
It will rings at the station too.

530
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:27,940
At the same time I'll be at the phone company
checking out on the location of the source of the call.

531
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:29,733
Are there any other phones
in the house?

532
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:33,862
- Yes, the house mother has another one.
- But it's on another number,
and nobody is calling.

533
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:36,740
You're gonna have to keep this guy on 
the line as long as possible. 

534
00:56:36,782 --> 00:56:39,326
We got a mechanical system here and
it takes a while.

535
00:56:39,368 --> 00:56:41,203
I know it's not very pleasant.

536
00:56:41,245 --> 00:56:43,372
Girls, can I show you something?

537
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,168
- See the car outside?
- Yea.

538
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:51,922
We got one of our men in it, so you
got nothing to worry about.

539
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:53,632
Yeah ... sure.

540
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:29,835
About Boe ...
I just know Clare is dead.
I can just feel it ...

541
00:57:29,877 --> 00:57:32,546
Come on now Phil,
we don't know that.

542
00:57:32,588 --> 00:57:37,384
Poor Mr. Harrison, I feel
so sorry for him.

543
00:57:37,426 --> 00:57:39,553
Hey, hey ...

544
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:48,020
- How's Chris?
- He's okay, you know Chris.

545
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:56,028
I'm sorry, Jess.

546
00:57:59,782 --> 00:58:01,992
I guess I'm just exhausted.

547
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:06,371
I've been taking these pills from my cold 
and they knock me out.

548
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:09,083
Will you be okay if
I go up to bed?

549
00:58:09,124 --> 00:58:11,168
Yes, of course.

550
00:58:11,376 --> 00:58:15,672
- Are you sure?
- Yes, go up and get some rest.

551
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:30,687
- Call me if there is any news.
- I will.

552
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:33,482
Thanks.

553
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:58,715
So, are you all okay?

554
00:58:58,924 --> 00:59:01,969
Okay, sure ... yes.

555
00:59:02,052 --> 00:59:05,931
Yeah, look, I'm gonna need 
about 10 more minutes.

556
00:59:06,014 --> 00:59:10,602
Now be sure you tell those people again that 
they got to keep this guy on the line.

557
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:12,533
Right.

558
00:59:12,568 --> 00:59:16,650
We will certainly look into that.
Thank you very much.

559
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:22,614
Graham already at the 
switching station.

560
00:59:22,656 --> 00:59:25,409
When a phone rings at the house there,
this phone ring too.

561
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:30,456
Great, thanks.

562
00:59:30,581 --> 00:59:34,001
- Lieutenant, someone from Scarborough.
- Okay.

563
01:01:10,973 --> 01:01:13,058
Barb, what's the matter?

564
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:24,486
Easy, relax, 
you'll be okay.

565
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:44,757
I guess ...
I guess... I had a nightmare.

566
01:01:47,634 --> 01:01:53,098
I dream this stranger was 
coming into my room.

567
01:01:55,601 --> 01:01:57,978
I guess this is why they 
give me asthma huh?

568
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:01,023
Don't take it too serious, it's alright, Barb.
Just relax.

569
01:04:10,777 --> 01:04:14,447
Hey, it's just me, Billy.

570
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:20,328
It's alright, all right ...
Shh ...

571
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,872
Pretty Agnes ...

572
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:31,423
Don't you tell what we did,
Agnes ...

573
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,169
Jean!

574
01:05:10,629 --> 01:05:14,090
- What?
- Jean, get the children
in the car.

575
01:05:14,174 --> 01:05:19,346
- What's going on?
- Please, just get them
into the car.

576
01:05:19,387 --> 01:05:24,184
- Okay kids, let's go.
- Come along children, hurry.

577
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:29,189
Miss, miss ...

578
01:05:29,356 --> 01:05:32,108
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

579
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:37,155
There was a little girl murdered over
in the park tonight

580
01:05:37,197 --> 01:05:38,573
Yes, I heard.

581
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:44,204
Your phone's ringing.

582
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:50,669
- Oh yes, excuse me. Good night.
- Certainly. Good night.

583
01:05:51,503 --> 01:05:52,337
Testing.

584
01:05:52,379 --> 01:05:55,882
 Bill Graham.
 Trace call coming in on ...

585
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:03,181
Hello?

586
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,689
Hello? 
Who's there?

587
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:20,699
No Billy, no!

588
01:06:22,826 --> 01:06:26,955
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

589
01:06:46,975 --> 01:06:49,269
Oh my God ...

590
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:09,080
Hello?

591
01:07:09,456 --> 01:07:12,167
Jess, we didn't get him.

592
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:16,796
There wasn't enough time.
You'll have to keep him on the line longer.

593
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:19,257
Oh I see.

594
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:25,138
When you said: "Oh my God",
did you recognize something?

595
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:29,935
No, I just feel like 
it's getting to me.

596
01:07:34,105 --> 01:07:38,693
When he called before, did he used
more than one voice like this?

597
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,447
Yes, yes, he did. 
He used several different voices.

598
01:07:43,907 --> 01:07:48,703
Jess I'm gonna ask you, who was the guy that
 was just leaving when I arrived in your house?

599
01:07:50,372 --> 01:07:53,917
- My boyfriend, Peter.
- Everything fine?

600
01:08:02,926 --> 01:08:07,305
Jess, I'll have to call you back in a little while.
Are you alright?

601
01:08:07,389 --> 01:08:11,268
I'll call you back in a little while and
we'll go get him next time.

602
01:08:12,102 --> 01:08:14,187
Bernie, call a doctor.

603
01:08:14,229 --> 01:08:15,439
I let no son of a bitch ...

604
01:08:14,481 --> 01:08:18,358
trespass on my land
in the middle of the night!

605
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,443
And I don't care what 
kind of uniform he wear!

606
01:08:20,485 --> 01:08:22,546
- What the hell is going on here?
- He fired on a police officer.

607
01:08:21,988 --> 01:08:26,533
You god damn right!
I'll do it again too! The bastard was trespassing!

608
01:08:47,137 --> 01:08:51,141
If you think it was Peter, then why
don't you just tell the police?

609
01:08:51,182 --> 01:08:52,726
Well because I'm 
not really sure.

610
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:56,730
Well he should be stopped.
Whoever it is, it should be stopped.

611
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:59,777
I didn't even have a minute sleep around here.
There has been so much noise in the house.

612
01:09:00,778 --> 01:09:02,778
What the hell was all
that yelling about?

613
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:05,071
Barb has a asthma.
She's having a nightmare.

614
01:09:05,113 --> 01:09:08,408
- Is she alright?
- Yes, she's fine. She's sleeping now.

615
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:13,788
He repeated almost word for word what
Peter said to me tonight.

616
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:17,584
- Could it be just be a coincidence?
- Oh God, Phil, I don't know.

617
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,461
I was so confused.

618
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:24,841
Oh look Jess, I really don't
think it could be Peter.

619
01:09:24,925 --> 01:09:28,470
You know I don't like Peter much, but I
don't think he's got sick.

620
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:33,141
I don't believe Peter would do this.
He's so gentle most of the time.

621
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:36,311
Oh God Phyl,
you know I'm really getting scared.

622
01:09:36,728 --> 01:09:39,272
Look, are you sure that cop is
still out there?

623
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:43,193
Yep, he's there ...

624
01:10:01,753 --> 01:10:03,004
Hello?

625
01:10:04,047 --> 01:10:05,715
Jess?

626
01:10:05,924 --> 01:10:07,175
Yes?

627
01:10:09,427 --> 01:10:10,512
(Whisper) It's Peter ...

628
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:14,557
Look, Peter,
Don't cry.

629
01:10:14,599 --> 01:10:18,061
We can straighten things out, there
is nothing to get so upset about.

630
01:10:24,276 --> 01:10:26,528
It's Bill Graham.
You want me to trace that one?

631
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:28,738
- Yea, try and get it.
- Right.

632
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:35,328
Jess, we can't do this ...

633
01:10:42,836 --> 01:10:44,129
Peter, where are you?

634
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:48,842
Please, Jess ...
You got to know how I feel for the baby ...

635
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:50,552
Don't do this.

636
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,888
Jess, don't hurt the baby.

637
01:10:54,097 --> 01:10:55,824
- Stop this, Peter.

638
01:11:00,395 --> 01:11:02,439
Please, tell me where you are.

639
01:11:05,358 --> 01:11:06,192
Shit ...

640
01:11:16,161 --> 01:11:19,748
I'm sorry, the call
just not long enough.

641
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,511
Yes?

642
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:38,308
Jess, Lieutenant Fuller.
You want to tell me what's that all about?

643
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:40,018
You listen to that?

644
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:45,148
Yes. What did he mean about 
killing the baby?

645
01:11:46,858 --> 01:11:49,569
Jess, it's important that 
you tell me.

646
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:57,786
I'm pregnant.
I told him I didn't want to have the baby.

647
01:11:57,827 --> 01:11:59,579
When did you tell him this?

648
01:12:00,622 --> 01:12:01,665
Today.

649
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:03,500
Just today?
You're sure?

650
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:04,584
Yes.

651
01:12:07,087 --> 01:12:11,258
"We can't kill the baby", that's
a strange way of putting it.

652
01:12:11,675 --> 01:12:14,803
Peter is an artist.

653
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:16,263
Neurotic, maybe?

654
01:12:16,304 --> 01:12:19,182
No, normal like a
lot of people.

655
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:22,356
Jess, are you telling 
me the truth?

656
01:12:23,357 --> 01:12:26,757
I've got a feeling you are
holding something back from me.

657
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:30,987
Now I don't want it to be Peter.
But if it is, he needs help.

658
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,740
Do you know what I mean?

659
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:34,614
The sooner the better.

660
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:36,491
Think back ...

661
01:12:37,117 --> 01:12:41,913
Was Peter with you any of the time since 
you got one of these calls?

662
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:44,751
Yes ...

663
01:12:45,704 --> 01:12:49,246
Yes he was here. He was at the 
house tonight when the first call came.

664
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,464
That's right, it couldn't
be Peter.

665
01:12:51,506 --> 01:12:54,426
Phyl, it couldn't be Peter.
He was here.

666
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:57,512
He's obviously upset about something.
I'd like to talk to him.

667
01:12:57,554 --> 01:12:59,598
Can you tell me where 
can I reach him?

668
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:01,516
He lives at home Bakerw.

669
01:13:01,558 --> 01:13:07,439
But when he gets like this, he usually goes on to the
recital hall at the music Conservatory.

670
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,693
Look Jess, if you get any more calls, 
you're gonna have to keep him on the line longer

671
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:14,321
You're not giving us enough 
time to get a trace.

672
01:13:14,362 --> 01:13:17,782
I'm trying, you know 
it really upsets me.

673
01:13:17,824 --> 01:13:22,996
- No, right, of course. Look, you're doing fine. 
I'll talk to you later. - Okay.

674
01:13:24,831 --> 01:13:30,086
- Thank God.
- I know it couldn't have been Peter.

675
01:13:33,006 --> 01:13:36,885
Well, what can I tell you?
We covered the entire campus area ...

676
01:13:36,927 --> 01:13:40,221
and working our way towards the lake now.
Where do we go from there?

677
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:47,395
Start them out from the south end of town, have them walk 
through way to town, then from house to house.

678
01:14:04,496 --> 01:14:07,415
Jess, you want one 
aspirin or two?

679
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:10,543
- Two please.
- Okay!

680
01:14:16,383 --> 01:14:18,885
Jess! Jess!

681
01:14:24,724 --> 01:14:25,558
What are you doing?

682
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,061
Some kind of 
search party.

683
01:14:30,355 --> 01:14:34,109
Sorry to scare you miss, but we
are with the search party.

684
01:14:36,194 --> 01:14:37,445
What do you want?

685
01:14:37,487 --> 01:14:40,115
Well we wondered if you see 
anything peculiar tonight.

686
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:40,991
Not until you got here.

687
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:41,950
Phyl ...

688
01:14:41,992 --> 01:14:44,202
Well, they scared the 
shit out of me.

689
01:14:44,244 --> 01:14:47,414
Sorry miss, but you do know that there
was a girl killed in the park tonight?

690
01:14:47,455 --> 01:14:48,039
Yes, we heard.

691
01:14:48,081 --> 01:14:50,792
We are just helping the police to look
for the killer.

692
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,544
Well we would like to ask you in.

693
01:14:52,586 --> 01:14:54,212
But our dog died last night.

694
01:14:56,214 --> 01:14:58,800
We don't want to bother you at the time
like that.

695
01:14:58,842 --> 01:15:03,138
We were just wondered if you 
notice anything suspicious here tonight?

696
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:04,431
Oh no, sorry.

697
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:08,852
Well, you just keep your doors and windows locked
and you will be safe.

698
01:15:08,893 --> 01:15:09,769
- Thanks a lot.
- Yes we will.

699
01:15:09,811 --> 01:15:11,839
And remember there might be others from the
search party around.

700
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,191
So don't be afraid. We'll be around 
seeing that you are safe.

701
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:18,528
- Well, Thank you.
- And remember to lock those
doors and windows.

702
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,560
Already I will this murderer.

703
01:15:27,228 --> 01:15:31,190
Seriously, are you sure
all doors and windows are closed?

704
01:15:35,153 --> 01:15:36,612
Nash!

705
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:39,741
Get the dean of 
administration on the phone.

706
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:46,414
Tell him I want all the records on
the Peter Smythe, a music student.

707
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,751
And have a car meet me out front.

708
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:26,871
Barb? Are you awake?

709
01:17:11,749 --> 01:17:13,209
Phyl!

710
01:17:15,086 --> 01:17:16,546
Are you there?

711
01:17:17,171 --> 01:17:18,423
Phyl!

712
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:40,111
Hello?

713
01:17:47,994 --> 01:17:49,912
/ You bitch pig.

714
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:10,975
/ Billy! / Billy!

715
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:30,370
Lieutenant!
The guy is on the phone again!

716
01:18:43,883 --> 01:18:45,593
/ Billy!

717
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:07,281
/ Where is Agnes?

718
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:11,452
/ Agnes ...

719
01:19:13,121 --> 01:19:17,500
/ Mommy?
/ Where is your baby?

720
01:19:20,837 --> 01:19:24,382
This is Graham. It's
140, terminal 55th

721
01:19:38,146 --> 01:19:39,605
Lieutenant Fuller.

722
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:41,041
Yes, Nash. What is it?

723
01:19:41,082 --> 01:19:44,463
A phone coming is on the other line, sir.
They say they got a trace on this one.

724
01:19:44,632 --> 01:19:45,445
Yea let's have it.

725
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:49,407
He says the calls are coming from
No 6, Belmont Street.

726
01:19:50,658 --> 01:19:54,829
For Christ sake, Nash, you got it wrong.
That's where the calls are going in to.

727
01:19:54,871 --> 01:19:58,374
That's where they are 
coming from too, sir.

728
01:20:01,493 --> 01:20:04,839
Oh shit ...

729
01:20:08,384 --> 01:20:09,844
Jennings ...

730
01:20:11,304 --> 01:20:12,555
/ Jennings ...

731
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:20,897
Jennings, where
the hell are you?

732
01:20:23,608 --> 01:20:24,233
Nash ...

733
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:27,570
Nash!

734
01:20:27,612 --> 01:20:28,821
Yes, sir.

735
01:20:28,863 --> 01:20:33,618
Look, I can't get through to Jennings.
I want you to call the girl.

736
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:37,789
Nash, be calm.
Don't tell her that the guy is in the house.

737
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:42,001
Just tell her to put down the phone and 
walk straight out the front door.

738
01:20:42,043 --> 01:20:44,462
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

739
01:20:44,504 --> 01:20:47,382
Nash, if you blow this
I'll kill you.

740
01:20:48,216 --> 01:20:49,676
Phyl!

741
01:20:49,717 --> 01:20:55,264
Phyl, where are you?
Please answer me.

742
01:21:12,407 --> 01:21:13,866
Hello?

743
01:21:13,866 --> 01:21:15,326
Who is this?

744
01:21:15,535 --> 01:21:17,620
It's Jess.

745
01:21:19,288 --> 01:21:22,333
Miss Bradford, this is 
Sergeant Nash.

746
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,585
Are you the only one
in the house?

747
01:21:24,877 --> 01:21:30,174
No, Phyl and Barb are upstaris asleep.
Why?

748
01:21:30,216 --> 01:21:36,723
Alright, now I want you to do exactly what I 
tell you without asking any question, okay?

749
01:21:36,764 --> 01:21:38,433
No questions.

750
01:21:38,474 --> 01:21:45,315
Now just put the phone back on the hook, walk through 
the front door, and leave the house.

751
01:21:45,356 --> 01:21:46,774
What's wrong?

752
01:21:46,858 --> 01:21:50,695
Please, Miss Bradford, please
just do as I tell you.

753
01:21:50,737 --> 01:21:53,656
Okay. I'll get Phyl and Barb.

754
01:21:53,698 --> 01:21:56,367
No, no, don't do that, 
Jess!

755
01:21:57,618 --> 01:22:04,292
Jess, the caller is in the house.
The calls are coming from the house.

756
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:07,003
Jess!

757
01:22:07,211 --> 01:22:11,090
Jess, get out!
And don't go up there!

758
01:22:13,051 --> 01:22:16,346
Don't go upstairs, Jess!

759
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:19,932
Miss Bradford! 
Miss Bradford!

760
01:22:22,644 --> 01:22:24,312
Miss Bradford ...

761
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:30,151
Barb ...

762
01:22:33,071 --> 01:22:33,905
Phyl ...

763
01:22:33,946 --> 01:22:38,284
Phyl! Barb!

764
01:22:38,826 --> 01:22:41,412
Please, answer me!

765
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:52,256
Phyl, Barb! Please
answer me!

766
01:27:58,396 --> 01:28:01,691
Jess ... Jess!

767
01:28:01,733 --> 01:28:03,401
Are you alright?

768
01:28:11,743 --> 01:28:14,037
Jess, are you in there?

769
01:28:45,943 --> 01:28:47,195
Jess ...

770
01:29:05,129 --> 01:29:07,215
Jess, is that you?

771
01:29:11,177 --> 01:29:13,846
Jess, are you in there?

772
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:44,335
Jess, why didn't you
answer me?

773
01:29:44,544 --> 01:29:47,046
Why are you hiding there?

774
01:29:49,132 --> 01:29:52,051
Jess, you had me worried.
What are you doing up here?

775
01:31:05,249 --> 01:31:06,292
Jess ...

776
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:18,388
I knew it. I knew it in 
my gut that it was that kid.

777
01:31:18,429 --> 01:31:21,224
Why would Peter start 
killing people?

778
01:31:21,265 --> 01:31:27,563
I don't know.
He must have made the calls after each murder.

779
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:34,362
How long do you think it will take before
I can talk to her?

780
01:31:34,445 --> 01:31:36,322
Just a couple of questions.

781
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,781
- What time will her parents get here?
- A couple of hours.

782
01:31:45,023 --> 01:31:52,171
I'll stay with her until it all ends. But the condition that she's in, 
I wouldn't count on talking to her before tomorrow afternoon if I were you.

783
01:31:52,797 --> 01:31:55,091
Did someone notify
Patrick Cornell?

784
01:31:55,133 --> 01:31:57,885
- Who?
- Phyl's boyfriend.

785
01:31:57,927 --> 01:32:02,265
It's okay, I will do it.

786
01:32:02,307 --> 01:32:06,311
Lieutenant, I think we got to take these bodies to
the morgue in Lincoln Ville.

787
01:32:06,352 --> 01:32:09,564
The hospital doesn't have facilities to 
handle these bodies in one time.

788
01:32:09,605 --> 01:32:13,401
Well, tell the coroner,
they can start the autopsy right away.

789
01:32:13,443 --> 01:32:16,946
I'll notify the parents 
for identification.

790
01:32:16,988 --> 01:32:18,811
Yes, sir. I think that's wrap up everything
around here sir.

791
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:24,245
State labs guys will be here 
in about an hour.

792
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:29,250
Reporters, sir, and television news guys are
taking up pictures.

793
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:30,543
Get them hell out of here.

794
01:32:30,585 --> 01:32:33,254
Tell them that speak to them
at the police station.

795
01:32:34,505 --> 01:32:35,923
Okay, people, please to d.

796
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:45,832
Yes, the girl's father is upstairs,
but he can't attend you.

797
01:32:46,067 --> 01:32:49,154
Would you keep it down please,
 we got a sick girl in here.

798
01:32:58,905 --> 01:33:03,660
He is in shock.
He got to go to hospital.

799
01:33:04,744 --> 01:33:07,372
You will be alright,
Mr Harrison.

800
01:35:34,477 --> 01:35:38,022
It's me, Billy ...

801
01:35:39,022 --> 01:35:49,022
