00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:23,481
Hello.

2
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:24,682
Hello.

3
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,452
-Hello.
-Hello.

4
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:29,029
That's what we do at Club Indigo.

5
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,029
The more you drink,
the better I look.

6
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,896
And the more you drink,
the better your date's gonna look.

7
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:36,071
A couple of you guys
valet parked your cars.

8
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:39,298
Well, you need to make good friends,
you're gonna need a ride home.

9
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,272
We don't have valet here.

10
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:42,842
Anybody valet?

11
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:44,035
You need a ride home.

12
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:50,176
This is one of the baddest sisters
around. This black gal can sing!

13
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:53,014
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll try to show some love.

14
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:57,249
Put those hands together for
the one and only, not May, not June...

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,692
...but April. Give it up for Miss April!

16
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:26,541
Damn Joe better sit--

17
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:32,215
I know ain't nobody
breaking in this house.

18
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:36,691
Must be somebody new
to the neighborhood...

19
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:38,690
...they gonna break in my house.

20
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:41,762
I'm Madea,
and they gonna break in this house?

21
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:43,889
Oh, hell no.

22
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,294
Oh, see you later, Helmer.

23
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:51,903
-Joe.
-Now roll the joint up.

24
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:57,311
Joe.

25
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:02,113
Mabel, what the hell wrong with you?
You don't be coming--

26
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,547
Wake the hell up.

27
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,584
You about to give me a heart attack.

28
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,587
You too ugly
to be waking somebody up...

29
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,885
...in the middle of the night,
I told you that.

30
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,959
You gotta ease that ugly
up on people.

31
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,131
You can't just show it to them
all at once.

32
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:19,199
Code five, fool. Code five. Hurry up.

33
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:22,132
-Get out the bed.
-Code five? Hell, go get them, Mabel.

34
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:25,796
-Hell, you look like armed services.
-Hurry up.

35
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,841
Ain't nothing in here but me.
This is your house.

36
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:35,283
Wait a minute. My weed down there.
Oh, hell no now.

37
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:38,910
Is this worth you getting
a cap busted in your ass for?

38
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:45,293
-What the hell?
-Did they done drop my damn VCR?

39
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,996
What you doing with my--?
Not your TiVo.

40
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:52,031
Sit your ass down!
Wait, this is from me.

41
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,033
Hold on, Joe. Hell.

42
00:03:59,008 --> 00:03:59,997
Them children.

43
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,095
Clap your hands, girls!

44
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,374
Y'all eating like y'all ain't ate nothing
in days.

45
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:09,977
I don't know why the hell you feeding
these children.

46
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:13,012
You feed them, they gonna
keep coming back, just like roaches.

47
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:15,183
You got one roach,
you gonna have thousands.

48
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:17,784
You never gonna be able
to get rid of these children.

49
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,285
You ain't been able
to get rid of what you got.

50
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:24,920
Scratch and sniff.

51
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:29,621
Shut your mouth. I was in
a experiment with-- In Tuskegee.

52
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,697
-You want some more sandwich?
-Yeah.

53
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,961
-You say "yes, ma'am" to me.
-Yes, man.

54
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,303
He say "yes, man."

55
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:41,903
No, son, that ain't--

56
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:44,375
That ain't no man.
She just look like one.

57
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,912
-You say "yes, ma'am."
-What does that mean?

58
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,346
Don't know what's wrong
with these children today.

59
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:53,318
Ain't nobody teach you some respect?
"Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. No, sir"?

60
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,955
-Nobody teach you that?
-No.

61
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:58,126
Somebody should've. I don't know
what's wrong with parents today.

62
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,126
Hey, slow the hell down, boy.

63
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,092
Wipe your mouth.
What the hell's wrong?

64
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,630
-He crazy?
-No.

65
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,863
What's wrong with him?

66
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,037
-He's a weirdo.
-Eat your food and shut up.

67
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,638
Girl, eat something.
Get you some butter and jelly.

68
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,139
No, I'm good.
Just wanna make sure they eat.

69
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm mad as hell about my VCR.

70
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:18,837
I'm trying to be nice to you,
but I'm mad as hell about this VCR.

71
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:22,347
I ought to shank you.
This is my VCR.

72
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:25,884
I had this VCR back in 1 973...

73
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,886
...when Otis Redding came by
and he sat there with me...

74
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,787
...and both of us watched
a movie on this VCR...

75
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:33,859
...and you just drop it
like it's nothing.

76
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:37,157
This is a antique, girl.
You know what a antique is?

77
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:39,800
There one right there.
This is a antique.

78
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:42,232
-Still gonna call the cops?
-Hell, yeah.

79
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:45,464
You done broke in somebody's house.
Just because you looking sad...

80
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:50,044
...you don't think nobody gonna call
the police? I'm calling the po-po.

81
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:53,409
It's tore up, anyway. I don't see
no reason for you to call the cops.

82
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:56,983
Don't tell me not to call the cops.
If I wanna call the cops, I'm gonna.

83
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:59,484
I might not call
if you done learned your lesson.

84
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,987
The lesson is simple.
You can ask people for stuff.

85
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:04,159
You ain't gotta be
trying to steal nothing.

86
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,692
I'm feeding you
out of the kindness of my heart.

87
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:09,922
I'm doing the good Christian thing,
doing what Jesus would've did.

88
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,191
I'm feeding you.
My daughter would be proud...

89
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:14,869
...feeding the people
that came in here to steal.

90
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:18,666
All this stuff going on in the world,
I can help y'all if you ask me to help.

91
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:20,603
Ain't gotta come
breaking in the house.

92
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,778
People are working hard
for what they got...

93
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:25,037
...and you gonna break up
in somebody's house.

94
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,738
-What's wrong with y'all?
-Hey, Big Bird, calm down.

95
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,783
Making me upset, stealing
and break into somebody's house.

96
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:33,352
-You hear me, boy?
-Yes, man.

97
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,327
Boy, you're cute.

98
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,724
He said it again.

99
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,424
He said--

100
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:50,769
You said it again.
Boy, you funny. You is funny.

101
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,373
That ain't no man.
You can't say "yes, man."

102
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:55,407
But that's what--

103
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:58,106
Yes, ma'am. Yes, dude.

104
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,372
As in, yes, sir.

105
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:00,879
As in, yes, dude.

106
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,108
As in, yes, bro.

107
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,513
Where are your people?

108
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,779
-My grandma--
-She's at work.

109
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:08,722
Is that what you was gonna say?

110
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:10,687
-No.
-Yes.

111
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:15,261
-They lying.
-You know I can hear you, right?

112
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:19,426
Let this child talk to me
before I choke you out.

113
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:25,363
We haven't seen our grandma
in four days.

114
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:26,871
Four days?

115
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:28,373
Why? Is she on that stuff?

116
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:30,477
No, she went to work
like she always do...

117
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,374
...but this time,
she never came back.

118
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:35,812
Manny, can you just shut up
and eat your food, please?

119
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:38,145
This child can talk to me
if he want to.

120
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:41,812
-Where your mom at?
-Dead. My grandma's at work.

121
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:44,788
-Where's she work at?
-I don't know.

122
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:48,293
-Y'all ain't got no living relative?
-We got an aunt.

123
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:50,958
April. April.

124
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,229
-Hey.
-Girl, wake up.

125
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:55,926
I'm up. I'm here.

126
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:58,405
Where did everybody go?

127
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,576
Home. It's past closing.

128
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:05,645
-Did Randy come get me?
-No, I ain't seen no Randy.

129
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,611
Give me one more drink
while I wait.

130
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:09,842
Girl, you had enough. Get up...

131
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,714
-...and go now.
-lf you love me, give me another drink.

132
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:14,947
I love you.
I can't give you another drink.

133
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:17,387
Okay. All right. Okay.
I'm gone. I'm gone.

134
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:18,855
-Have it your way.
-Hurry up.

135
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:22,189
-Hey.
-Be careful.

136
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,768
-Good night.
-Good night.

137
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,131
-Oh, hey, April.
-Hey.

138
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,067
You got some money?

139
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,639
Man, didn't I just give you
some money?

140
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:35,310
Yes, I did.

141
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:36,705
Don't lie. Don't lie.

142
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:40,348
Hey, hey! Hold it! Hold it!

143
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,916
Man, superstar coming through.

144
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,191
Should I get this? Wifey's calling.

145
00:10:00,402 --> 00:10:02,962
Shit, I wish you would.

146
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:05,470
I dare you. Put it down.

147
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,539
You need to fix
the floor in the bathroom.

148
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,540
Everything in this damn house
is broken.

149
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:12,407
Well, when I get some money to fix it,
I'll fix it.

150
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:14,879
But until then,
what you get is raggedy.

151
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:16,544
Who's snapping?

152
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,482
Hello?

153
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,281
Hey, baby.

154
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:27,461
No. No, I ain't off--

155
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,890
-You did? Stop.
-Stop.

156
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,567
You what?

157
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:36,533
Janice, I told you....

158
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:40,368
No, I know that. Look, I'm happy.

159
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:43,739
Look, I said I'm happy.
Yeah, okay. I'll call you later.

160
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:47,712
-Yeah, you sound real happy.
-She's pregnant.

161
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:50,742
Congratulations.

162
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:54,855
April, you know good and damn well
I don't want no more kids.

163
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,252
I can barely pay
the damn bills in my house.

164
00:10:57,893 --> 00:10:59,554
And yours.

165
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:03,732
What the hell am I gonna do
with some more kids, huh?

166
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:08,199
I got four already. I can't even handle
this damn child support.

167
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:10,804
-Killing my ass.
-Whose fault is that?

168
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:12,963
What did you say?

169
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,545
Nothing.

170
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,942
-You said something.
-Nothing. Baby, nothing.

171
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,208
It's nothing.

172
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:23,407
Nothing.

173
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:24,813
-Nothing?
-No.

174
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,045
What, you gonna tell me
you pregnant now?

175
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:30,748
You know I don't want kids.
All I want is you.

176
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,451
Well, good. Come on.

177
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,399
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

178
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:41,933
You know I love you, right?

179
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,368
Me too.

180
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:49,166
Now, go tell wifey I said hi.
Kiss the kids for me.

181
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:53,337
-That's funny.
-I'm serious. Tell wifey I said hi.

182
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:55,711
I'm going to sleep.

183
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:06,517
This better be the right address.

184
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,823
If I go one more place, and y'all
done sent me to the wrong place...

185
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:13,468
...I'm gonna hurt somebody.
Get on out of the car, little boy.

186
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,694
Come on, girl, with that attitude.

187
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:24,207
You call that a knock?
Bang on the door and step down here.

188
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:34,486
Somebody gonna open this door,
I don't care.

189
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,750
-Okay!
-Kick the door, kick it.

190
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,157
What the hell y'all banging my door
for at this time of the morning?

191
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:42,557
It's 7 a.m.

192
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:44,733
I don't know who you think
you talking to...

193
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,458
...but it is 1 2:30 in the afternoon.

194
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,069
-Do you know these children, hooker?
-No.

195
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:51,830
Aunt April.

196
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:53,672
Snitch.

197
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:56,811
All right, that's my niece
and my nephews. What did y'all do?

198
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,707
They broke into my house...

199
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,973
...and broke my VCR
trying to steal something.

200
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,208
I want my money.
That's why I brought them.

201
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,080
These are not my kids.
You know what?

202
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:08,188
-Take them to my mama.
-Hold the hell on.

203
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,154
They ain't seen your mama
in four days.

204
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,327
-That's not like her. Where is she?
-They don't know.

205
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,363
Hell, why I'm supposed to know?
I don't know. I don't know her.

206
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:20,262
Okay, my sister is dead.
Their mama, she dead.

207
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:22,130
And so my mother is raising them...

208
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:25,033
...and that's who you should talk to
to get your money.

209
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,368
If she ain't there, you better get me
the $300 and get my VCR.

210
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:29,839
That's all I'm telling you.

211
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:33,105
I'm telling you I don't have $300,
and these ain't my kids.

212
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:36,375
Let me explain something to you.
If you don't give me my money...

213
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:39,019
...I'm calling the po-po
on all three of these thugs.

214
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,620
You can use my phone.

215
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:43,690
Help us, Aunt April.
We tried to find Grandma.

216
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:49,094
What if I bring them
over to your house...

217
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:50,890
...and they can work the money off?

218
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,863
-Work it off? Hell, no.
-Clean up?

219
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:54,933
-What do you mean "what"?
-No, no.

220
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:57,901
I want my $300.
You gonna bring them to work for me?

221
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:00,200
You can't bring them to my house
to do nothing.

222
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,809
I got a white woman next door to me
and I have a dog.

223
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,069
You know what that mean?

224
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,544
I don't wanna let O.J.
and Michael Vick at my house.

225
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,714
Well, I don't know what to tell you,
because I don't have--

226
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,250
Fine. Fine.

227
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:14,217
Make sure
they be over at my house.

228
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:15,720
That thing ain't even worth--

229
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,415
Say something else.
I want you to say something-- Say--

230
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:21,926
Snatch away from me,
I'm gonna punch you like I dude.

231
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:23,655
Say something.

232
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,100
Come in here.

233
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,707
Little O.J., that thug and
Sister Souljah, she know where I live.

234
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:35,809
-Make sure they be at my house.
-Yeah.

235
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,138
Where is your grandmother?

236
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,476
-We don't know.
-Y'all can't stay here.

237
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,549
Okay, I got a man,
and he don't like kids.

238
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,983
So y'all gonna have
to figure something else out.

239
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,090
All right, y'all can't stay here.
So where is she?

240
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,260
You can't smoke around him.
He has asthma.

241
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,259
Girl, this is my house.
You can wait outside.

242
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:57,091
-Fine, then. We will.
-Good.

243
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,167
Wait, we ain't been to sleep all night.
I'm tired.

244
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,804
Well, y'all can stay here, but I'm out.

245
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:08,067
Get up out of here with that attitude.
Come on. Get to stepping.

246
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:11,104
-Hey, look, I'll see y'all later, okay?
-All right.

247
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:12,805
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

248
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,807
Puffy and Biggie,
y'all don't wanna go with Lil' Kim?

249
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:21,154
-Nope, I'm going to sleep.
-I'm going to bed. Y'all shut up.

250
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:23,984
Don't make no noise.
I gotta work tonight.

251
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,994
Oh, okay. Good.

252
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:31,894
Bless you.
God bless you, and come again.

253
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,692
Glad we could help.

254
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,864
-Hi.
-Hello.

255
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:41,133
I am from Pastor Hector Romalle's
church in Columbia.

256
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:45,245
-You used to run missions there.
-That was a long time ago.

257
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:48,507
-What's your full name?
-Sandino. Sandino Ramirez.

258
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:51,914
You seemed to be doing so well there.
What are you doing here?

259
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:54,912
I've come to this country
to find a better life.

260
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:59,025
To find some work.
Not having much luck.

261
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:02,226
I remember you're here,
I wanted to see if you could help me.

262
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,895
Got any special skills?
What is it that you do?

263
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:08,703
I'm a handyman.

264
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,895
We have some things around
need to be fixed.

265
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:14,371
Got plenty of tools,
plenty of supplies.

266
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,874
Don't have much pay,
but we will pay you something.

267
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:19,047
Stop! Come here!
Stupid, come here!

268
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:22,106
-Deacon, Deacon, stop that girl.
-Hold on now.

269
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,751
-Come here.
-Let go of me.

270
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:26,750
If I ever catch you
in my store again--

271
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:30,220
Miller, Miller, I got it.
I'm gonna take care of it.

272
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,416
Hey, you'd better, pastor.

273
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:37,232
-Young lady, are you on drugs?
-No. Why?

274
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:39,957
-Where are your parents?
-I don't got no parents.

275
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:42,926
Jennifer?

276
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,032
-Miss Wilma.
-You know this child?

277
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:47,868
Yeah.

278
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:51,534
That's Rose's granddaughter.
She lives next door to me.

279
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:54,045
Your grandmother's
a member of this church.

280
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,114
-Well, have you seen her?
-Not in a while.

281
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:58,786
-You don't know where she is?
-No.

282
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:01,478
-You staying with April?
-No.

283
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:05,916
Sister Wilma, take this man and show
him where we're having a problem.

284
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:08,426
Sandino, I'm gonna work
on a place for you to stay.

285
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,599
-Good seeing you again.
-Thank you. Good to see you too.

286
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:31,815
Okay!

287
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:35,847
Bullsh--

288
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,524
Pastor.

289
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,685
Hi, April.

290
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:43,421
May we come in?

291
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,901
-How are you, April?
-Sleepy. And you?

292
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,541
All the better for seeing you.

293
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:56,176
What did she do now?

294
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:59,313
She was caught stealing
from the drugstore.

295
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,346
Maybe she was hungry.

296
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,981
Then why was she
stealing needles?

297
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:09,282
Oh, I don't know.

298
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:13,392
Her mother died from drugs, so
maybe she's following in her footsteps.

299
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:16,223
-April.
-This one right here.

300
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,557
Come on, she's a kid.

301
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:20,792
-You know where my brothers at?
-Yeah, they out back. Go join them.

302
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:24,961
-Glad to.
-Get out of here with all that attitude.

303
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,038
-I should've left you outside.
-April.

304
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:30,905
That's okay. Because when they find
my mama, they're going back to her.

305
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:34,241
-I ain't got time for these kids.
-Look, April.

306
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,009
-Your mother's getting older.
-Yeah?

307
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:39,244
Yeah, she can't raise
these kids by herself.

308
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,615
Every time I see her,
she's looking weaker.

309
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:44,053
These are my sister's kids,
not mine.

310
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:47,160
Yeah, but your daddy left you
and your sister this house.

311
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:48,693
-And?
-You haven't done much.

312
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:51,092
Nope.
I left it just how my daddy left it.

313
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,597
-It's falling apart, April.
-I guess so.

314
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:57,038
There's a handyman
at the church today. Just listen.

315
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,797
And he needed a place to stay.

316
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:04,104
So maybe, maybe, in exchange
for his work, you can let him stay here.

317
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:06,610
That's if he does a good job
at the church.

318
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,510
That's a good idea, pastor, but--

319
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,082
-Time for me to go, huh?
-Yeah.

320
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:12,617
I gotta work tonight. I'm sleepy.

321
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:16,018
-You still working at the club, April?
-Six nights a week.

322
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:19,822
-I'm praying for you, April.
-Thank you, thank you so much.

323
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,017
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

324
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:23,697
I'm gonna say my prayers for you
before I go to sleep.

325
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:26,891
-You do that, April.
-Hallelujah.

326
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,106
You know what?

327
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,636
Oh, God.

328
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:40,144
You don't hear knocking
at this damn door?

329
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:41,940
This ain't our house.

330
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:47,778
-What?
-Hi. I'm Sandino Ramirez.

331
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:49,581
What do you want, man?

332
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,157
I went by the church today.
I spoke to Pastor Brian.

333
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,554
He told me to go see you.

334
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:55,493
What do you want?

335
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,995
I fixed a few things
at the church today and...

336
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:02,130
...well, the pastor told me to come
see if you need something--

337
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,770
Anything fixed in your house.

338
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:06,964
I can work for room and board.
It's fine.

339
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:08,498
Are you crazy?

340
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,078
No, I'm not crazy. You crazy?

341
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:14,306
I'm loco. Come on.

342
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:20,111
Hello.

343
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:25,224
Let me show you to the basement.

344
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:35,193
You can sleep down here.

345
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:38,998
I mean,
I know it's not much, but it's warm.

346
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:40,868
And there's a cot right there.

347
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:42,873
Since I don't know you all that well...

348
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,774
...I'm gonna have to lock you
down here in this basement.

349
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:48,709
Wait a minute.

350
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:52,318
What if there's a fire
or something like that?

351
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:55,615
You're a handyman, right?
Break yourself out of here.

352
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:59,626
Look, do you want it or not?

353
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:01,960
Okay. And what about food?

354
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,162
Come on.

355
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,527
So you worried about food?

356
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:10,865
I'm gonna leave a razor so you can
shave that caveman look off.

357
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,965
I'm not the one, you're it!

358
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:16,837
I got it!

359
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:30,982
Will y'all shut up down there?

360
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:35,126
Shut up!

361
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,095
So your name is Byron.

362
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,737
Right? And what is your name?

363
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:44,872
-I'm Manny.
-Manny.

364
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:46,734
Okay, Byron and Manny.

365
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,375
May I ask your name?

366
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:52,771
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer.

367
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,278
Okay.

368
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,916
-Byron doesn't speak, huh?
-No.

369
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,380
That's okay.

370
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,885
So, Byron, Manny,
you guys wanna go out and play?

371
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,579
-No.
-Yeah.

372
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:05,558
-Why not?
-We don't know you like that.

373
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,923
-Well, your mother's asleep.
-That's not my mom, that's my aunt.

374
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,893
Your mom or your aunt,
she's asleep.

375
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,030
Come on, let's go outside and play.
Throw me the ball.

376
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:20,271
Yeah, but I'm gonna come too,
so I can keep an eye on you.

377
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:21,737
Come on.

378
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,312
Slam it again!

379
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,181
I'll teach you how to play football.

380
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:36,823
Manny, don't run like that.

381
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:38,518
I'm thinking--

382
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:40,490
You got some moves, huh?

383
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,959
Get ready for the moves.

384
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,930
-You don't have anything on me, huh?
-Manny, take it easy.

385
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:50,165
Oh, I got you.

386
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:51,464
Take it easy.

387
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,231
I wanna be an athlete.

388
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,430
It's gonna be okay.

389
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,770
You okay?

390
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:58,407
Byron, where's the ball?

391
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:00,774
-Just behind the flowerpot.
-Okay.

392
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,142
-Manny.
-Go ahead.

393
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,184
Damn. You are fine.

394
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:08,080
I knew it.

395
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:12,149
You can't smoke around him.
He's got asthma.

396
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,720
You already said that.

397
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:22,828
-What's wrong with you, Manny?
-That thing can happen...

398
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,370
...when your mama's on crack
when she's pregnant.

399
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,041
The rate you're going,
you're gonna end up like her.

400
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:30,973
-You don't know about me.
-I know you're stealing needles.

401
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:33,511
The needles was for him.
He's got diabetes too.

402
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:36,445
-What don't you have?
-Cancer.

403
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:39,210
He's gonna need his insulin
in the morning.

404
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:43,380
-Well, where is it?
-I dropped it.

405
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,560
Brilliant. So, what happens
if he doesn't take it?

406
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,955
He dies.

407
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:51,496
I gotta hurry up and find my mama.
Y'all getting on my damn nerves.

408
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,899
I'm home.

409
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:02,239
What are these kids doing
in this house?

410
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:05,675
-Hi, baby. Hey.
-Hey. What's going on?

411
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:09,314
Those are my sister's kids.
You've met them before.

412
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,985
Look, my mother is MlA, okay?

413
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,587
I was about to go there
and find out what's going on.

414
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,518
-I can't be handling all this.
-I know.

415
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:19,489
Just sit down.
I'm gonna get you something to drink.

416
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:21,861
And who the hell is this?

417
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:25,226
-That's Sandino. He's renting a room.
-Renting a room?

418
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,162
You turn this
into a bed and breakfast?

419
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:30,235
No, the church sent him over
to help me out around here.

420
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:32,463
Just so he can have
somewhere to stay.

421
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,039
He needs a place to stay.

422
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:36,210
Everybody needs
a damn place to stay.

423
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:39,038
What's up, Mexico?

424
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:42,777
-You legal?
-Stop. Leave him alone.

425
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:45,953
Hey, he's a grown-ass man.
He can answer the question.

426
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:49,248
I said, you legal, Mexico, huh?

427
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:50,856
Look at that. See right there.

428
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,085
I know this boy ain't legal
just by the way he looking down.

429
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:55,852
Where are you going?

430
00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:59,497
-Take care of my business.
-No, I don't think so.

431
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:02,261
We're all going somewhere together
in a moment.

432
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,801
You don't tell me what to do.

433
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,735
Hey, little girl, check your tone
in your auntie's house.

434
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:08,738
-Who are you?
-Watch your mouth.

435
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:11,639
I'm the one paying the bills up in here.
That's who I am.

436
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,482
Sit down.

437
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,041
Sit down.

438
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,418
You better stop
rolling your eyes at me.

439
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:26,054
I'll be back. I'm gonna go find my keys.

440
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,458
What? Oh, you need to get by, huh?

441
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:35,825
All right, then.

442
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:41,769
Go on, then.

443
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,481
So you think you grown, huh?

444
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:54,180
I got something for little girls
who think they're grown.

445
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:57,825
I got something for grown men
who think they got something for me.

446
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:03,364
Got a fast one on my hands.

447
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:05,430
I'll show you what I got.

448
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:11,000
You're too grown to like chocolate?

449
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:15,999
Come on, go ahead. Come on, baby,
I know you want some.

450
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,503
Go on, take it.

451
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:22,807
I know you want some, little girl.

452
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:25,149
I didn't ask you a damn thing,
did l, boy?

453
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:27,378
-Go sit down, Byron.
-Sit your fat ass down.

454
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:32,851
-You don't talk to him like that.
-Oh, yes, ma'am.

455
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:34,858
Miss Jennifer.

456
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:40,227
-Leave me alone, man.
-I think I'm gonna call you Jenny.

457
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:42,164
You like that, Jenny?

458
00:26:42,737 --> 00:26:44,637
And what the hell
you looking at, Mexico?

459
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:48,369
-Speak English?
-Got them. Come on.

460
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:51,739
-I didn't think so.
-Come on, Let's go. Come on, let's go.

461
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:53,538
I'll see you later.

462
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,375
Come on.

463
00:27:05,193 --> 00:27:07,388
It's just you and me, Mexico.

464
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:09,426
Want me to turn on
some mariachi music?

465
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,895
I'm gonna take a nap.
You keep it quiet down here.

466
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:17,366
You need to take your ass home
and fix something.

467
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:21,200
Joe, I tell you, you will find that out.
Keep it up. Who's this?

468
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:23,001
Look who here.

469
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:26,180
Dumb, dumber, dumberer
and the big dummy.

470
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:29,475
-Here you are.
-All right.

471
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,845
They eat?
They're gonna need all their strength.

472
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:34,146
Yeah, they ate.

473
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,516
Jennifer, this is the key
to the house.

474
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:39,716
When you finish, go back,
and do not let anybody in the house.

475
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:42,863
-They ain't gonna listen to you.
-Yeah, okay.

476
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:45,362
-This one has attitude.
-You ain't got to tell me.

477
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:48,865
-Watch her.
-I wonder where she get that from.

478
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,697
Yes, bye. See you later.

479
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:53,066
I breaks attitude
with children like this.

480
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:57,108
You heard of The Horse Whisperer?
I'm the Kid Whisperer.

481
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,042
Look, lady, you gonna tell us
what you need us for, or what?

482
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:03,775
-Talk to me like that one more time.
-Quiet. This old woman don't play.

483
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:05,077
She doesn't scare me.

484
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:07,348
Look at her.

485
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:11,589
-You better be scared.
-I've been to jail. I will shank you, fool.

486
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:18,832
You better not touch us again,
or I'll call 91 1.

487
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,625
What do you mean,
"touch you again"?

488
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,700
I ain't touched you yet.

489
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:25,270
You gotta get to the phone
if you're gonna dial 911.

490
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:26,735
You got to get to the phone.

491
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:29,967
I will hit you so hard that
your cranium and your urethra tube...

492
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:32,578
...will all be tied up together
inside of each other.

493
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,078
You wouldn't be able to do nothing
but pee and run.

494
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:41,144
You don't know if I got a cell phone.

495
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:44,348
You're gonna need surgery
to get it from down your throat.

496
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,749
-Whatever.
-Say something again.

497
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:50,920
Say one more thing,
I will pimp-slap you. Say it again.

498
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,267
That's what I thought.

499
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:56,528
You're gonna come
into this house and clean.

500
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:59,502
And if anything come up missing
in my house, I promise you...

501
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:04,167
...you're gonna come up missing.

502
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,913
Come on.
We cleaning from top to bottom.

503
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:12,484
-Let's get in here.
-This is crazy.

504
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:13,881
What you say?

505
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:15,885
Yeah, this is one
of my favorite nights.

506
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,887
Yeah, go, April, go.

507
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,890
I need two Heinekens
and a shot of vodka.

508
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,191
Here. Last night, you were short.

509
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:26,526
Don't be short tonight,
else you're gonna come up missing.

510
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,368
Come in.

511
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:39,040
-Hey, April.
-Hey, Miss Wilma.

512
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,010
What are you doing here?

513
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:42,910
I was just wondering...

514
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:45,517
...have you talked
to your mother lately?

515
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,417
Yeah, I went by the house earlier,
she wasn't there.

516
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,592
I don't know.
I don't know where she is.

517
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:54,057
You know, this is just--
It's not like her.

518
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:56,253
No, it isn't. I don't know what to say.

519
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:59,092
I was gonna come by there later on.
Will you let me in?

520
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,733
No, I can't do that, child.

521
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:05,429
I let your sister in there one time.
She stole everything your mama had.

522
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,905
You should've known better than to let
a crackhead in somebody's house.

523
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,941
Well, I can't let you go in there.

524
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:16,373
Your mama
had such high hopes for you.

525
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:18,552
Miss Wilma,
is there anything else you need?

526
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:21,381
Because I really have
to get ready for my next set.

527
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,420
No, that's it.

528
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:24,955
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

529
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,559
-Thank you.
-God bless you.

530
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:29,286
Alrighty.

531
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,865
You're doing a good job cleaning,
Manny and Byron.

532
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:41,201
I don't know why you letting them
children clean up anything up in here.

533
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:45,436
You're gonna need a metal detectors
when they leave up out of here.

534
00:30:45,646 --> 00:30:47,637
All right.

535
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:50,147
-How the dishes coming?
-Fine.

536
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:54,787
Little girl, you got the nastiest attitude
I ever did see.

537
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:59,248
-Why are you so nasty?
-Because.

538
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,427
I'm about to come over there.

539
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:07,396
Joe, you better get this girl.
She just said "because" to me.

540
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:13,170
You better watch it, girl. That's the
heavyweight champion of the world.

541
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:15,899
She took out Ali and Frazier
and George Foreman.

542
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,011
They all came here
and she took them out.

543
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,943
-That's why Foreman's selling grills.
-Attitude like that...

544
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,278
...gonna be by yourself all your life.
Nobody wanna be around that.

545
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:28,851
Maybe I don't want nobody around.

546
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,853
Yeah, Madea want flies around here.

547
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:34,084
Every time she goes somewhere,
flies be flying around her.

548
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:36,957
Just funky. Maybe that
backwards boy washing the soap.

549
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:40,134
You get out of this life what you put in.
You give good things...

550
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,529
...good things will come back
most of the time.

551
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:44,326
That ain't true.

552
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:47,940
-I said most of the time, child.
-Yeah, whatever.

553
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:51,270
Girl, if you say "whatever" to me
one more time...

554
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:54,007
...before the "wha"
can get out of your mouth...

555
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:57,514
...I'm gonna be in the back
of a police car. Sit down.

556
00:31:57,718 --> 00:32:00,050
Sit down.

557
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,658
Know what happens to girls
that are mad at the world?

558
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:10,228
They become bitter old women
if they don't figure out what's going on.

559
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:14,868
Bitter old woman, just like the one
you're talking to, a bitter old woman.

560
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,129
A bitter 450-pound old woman.

561
00:32:19,774 --> 00:32:21,401
Oh, that's funny?

562
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:24,976
At least you could smile. Did that hurt?
Did it crack your face, Cruella?

563
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:28,148
-I ain't got a whole lot to smile about.
-Hush that up.

564
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,783
Got a whole lot to smile about,
you living.

565
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:33,010
They got children your age
in the hospital...

566
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:36,054
...strung out on HlV, drugs
and everything else.

567
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:39,524
You talking about you ain't got
nothing to smile-- You pretty.

568
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:43,356
Get you a mirror and see how pretty
you are and smile at yourself.

569
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:48,232
I'm not pretty. I mean,
I ain't got nice clothes or nothing.

570
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:51,064
Clothes don't make you pretty.
They make you broke.

571
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,507
You know what I want you to do?

572
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,199
There ain't no mirror down here.

573
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,378
When you get through
cleaning that window...

574
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,672
...Iook at yourself
and see how pretty you are.

575
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:04,681
Go on and clean it real good
until you see your smile:

576
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,281
We wanna give it up
for the Gap Band.

577
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,786
Give it up for the Gap Band,
ladies and gentlemen.

578
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:11,515
That's not the original Gap Band.

579
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:13,785
They just get
their clothes from the Gap...

580
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,428
...so we call them the Gap Band.

581
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,894
They sound good.
Don't they sound good tonight?

582
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,464
Look. She look good tonight.

583
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,656
Gotta have a fix.

584
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:23,496
Oh, my Lord. The church.

585
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:25,865
We got a lady here from the church.

586
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:30,669
And I'm telling you, this lady can sing.
She can really sing.

587
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:34,336
Ladies and gentlemen, now, the spirits
say that if we make a lot of noise...

588
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:39,918
...she just may come up here and sing
a song for us poor little sinners.

589
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:43,090
-Come on up here, Miss Wilma.
-No, don't do that.

590
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:47,057
Oh, Miss Wilma don't mind.
Come on up here, Miss Wilma.

591
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:49,661
How are you doing tonight?

592
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:52,264
-I'm doing fine, Freddie.
-Good seeing you.

593
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,331
-You look lovely.
-Thank you very much.

594
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:56,696
You gonna sing
something for us tonight?

595
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:59,930
Well, I'm always ready to give
my testimony anytime, any--

596
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,234
Now, Miss Wilma,
I don't mind you singing...

597
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:05,071
...but save all that testimony stuff
for the church.

598
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,747
Right now,
we just want you to sing a little song...

599
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:09,643
...make the people feel good.

600
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,580
What do you already know?
You know what she's gonna sing.

601
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:14,982
Hold this, Freddie.
Don't steal nothing.

602
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:18,181
Miss Wilma. Let's do it.

603
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,883
I'd like to dedicate this
to all you beautiful faces...

604
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:25,259
...but especially to April.

605
00:37:35,356 --> 00:37:37,119
Thank you.

606
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:42,924
Y'all go straight in the house,
you understand?

607
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,766
Boy, don't be slamming my door.

608
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:50,366
Hey, wait.

609
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:57,333
Thank you. Hey, how was it?

610
00:37:57,545 --> 00:38:01,709
I don't wanna steal nothing else
if that's what I gotta do to pay it back.

611
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,213
That lady's crazy.

612
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:09,648
That means all of your decisions,
your choices...

613
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:11,290
...they all have a price to pay.

614
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:14,256
So you do the crime,
you gotta do the time.

615
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,951
Yeah, whatever.

616
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:18,461
Look, we ought to take a bath.
Go on upstairs.

617
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,361
Jennifer.

618
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:23,025
What's this?

619
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:27,540
You bought his insulin.

620
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,274
I was gonna do it.

621
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:33,870
Well, now you don't have to.

622
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,209
Why are you so nice to us?

623
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,389
-I don't understand that question.
-You nice, why?

624
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,080
Why not?

625
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:46,589
You should expect people
to be nice to you.

626
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,625
You shouldn't expect people
to be mean.

627
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,091
Not in this world.

628
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:53,289
-You get what you expect, right?
-I guess.

629
00:38:56,236 --> 00:38:57,965
You do a great job
with your brothers.

630
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:02,067
I'm all they got.

631
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,665
Oh, come on.
What the hell is Mexico up to?

632
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,165
Are you serious?

633
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:35,664
Hey.

634
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,776
What--?
Do you know what time it is?

635
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:42,408
-Yeah, it's 1 :30 in the afternoon.
-What are you doing?

636
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:44,777
-I'm working off my debt.
-What?

637
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:48,146
I figured that I'd get up this morning,
get to work.

638
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:51,381
Figured if I fixed this floor,
then the kids can stay in this room.

639
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:53,423
You don't have to worry
about those kids.

640
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:57,324
They're not staying, pack up your tools
and go back down in the basement.

641
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:59,659
Why not?
Why they don't stay in here?

642
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,730
What do you mean--?
Hey, hey, hey!

643
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:06,462
Hey!

644
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:08,938
Stop it! Stop it!

645
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:12,637
Look, you have a serious problem
with this floor, okay?

646
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:13,835
I know that.

647
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:15,948
That's why no one
ever comes up here...

648
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,642
...and that's why I keep
the door closed. For safety, okay?

649
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:22,117
These kids,
they need a room of their own.

650
00:40:22,322 --> 00:40:25,382
Why are you so worried about kids
that don't even belong to you?

651
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,025
-What's up?
-That's your family.

652
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:28,387
Why you not concerned?

653
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,693
Jennifer has nightmares every night.
Manny, night sweats.

654
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:34,959
Byron, he tosses and turns
in his sleep.

655
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:37,399
Can you imagine
what those kids have been through?

656
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,196
I just wanna help them.

657
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,201
You wanna help them?

658
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,877
You live in my basement.
You can't even help yourself.

659
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,137
How are you gonna help?

660
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:49,713
-By giving them this room.
-No, no, you're not.

661
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,111
This is my house.

662
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:56,322
You can't give them nothing
that doesn't belong to you.

663
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:59,720
If you're so worried about the kids,
why are you making so much noise?

664
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:02,760
-You're waking them up.
-They were gone before I got up.

665
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:05,659
Well, where did they go?
Since you know so much about them.

666
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:06,855
I don't know.

667
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:10,161
What do you care? You don't even
make them comfortable to stay here.

668
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:13,066
That's right, three less things
I gotta worry about.

669
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:16,731
Pack up your little tools and follow me
back down to the basement, come on.

670
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,411
-You know, you don't--
-Let's go.

671
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:19,772
You don't even mean that.

672
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,612
You don't know me.

673
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,715
-Let's go, back to your blind spot.
-Hey.

674
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,942
These kids need someone.
They need some help.

675
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,212
Okay, well,
when my mama comes back...

676
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:32,017
...she will come and get them,
and they will have someone, happy?

677
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:35,394
You're not this heartless, April.

678
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:37,188
So why do you do this?

679
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,422
Is it because of your man?

680
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:41,362
Is it because of him?

681
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:44,761
You know, you're too good for him.

682
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:49,432
Please, Sandino, stop it.

683
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:55,373
Okay, I'll finish up
after your man wakes up.

684
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,476
Thank you.

685
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:08,626
I'm coming. Shoot.

686
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,668
Pastor.

687
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:25,806
Miss Wilma.
What are you guys doing here?

688
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:28,413
-Hi, April.
-Hi.

689
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:29,912
Can we come in?

690
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:37,354
-Hello.
-Hey, you clean up nice.

691
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:38,947
Thank you.

692
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:42,856
-Getting any work done around here?
-Yeah, as much as she'll let me.

693
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,896
Great job in the chapel.
We even have a check for you.

694
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,034
Well, that's great.
I'll come by to pick it up.

695
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:50,863
Hello?

696
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:54,140
Is that what you came by for?
Because I can go back to bed.

697
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:56,206
April, can we sit down?

698
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,378
Yeah, sure.

699
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,996
What is it?

700
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,660
It's about your mother.

701
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,333
-You found her. Where is she?
-I'm sorry, April.

702
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,335
She died.

703
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,300
What?

704
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:35,347
What?

705
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:37,544
I'm sorry, baby.

706
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:40,914
-When?
-About a week ago.

707
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:51,186
-What happened?
-She left for work.

708
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:52,997
I saw her.

709
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,933
And she had a brain aneurysm.

710
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,072
A brain aneurysm.

711
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:03,903
She was on the bus all day...

712
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:07,308
...and no one noticed.

713
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:08,742
She....

714
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,713
They assumed she was just asleep.

715
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:17,285
And when the driver tried to wake her,
it was too late.

716
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,384
There was nothing anyone could do.

717
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:22,391
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:26,389
She was at the city morgue.

719
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,534
No one claimed her.

720
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:31,468
No identification.

721
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,903
She was dead too long...

722
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,972
...so they cremated her.

723
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:42,980
Oh, my God.

724
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,416
These are her remains.

725
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:51,724
I....

726
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:54,687
I put them in this urn.

727
00:44:56,964 --> 00:45:00,525
I'm gonna go
and pack up her things...

728
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:04,637
...and you're welcome to come by
and get them.

729
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:07,596
I'm sorry, April.

730
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:19,781
If you need anything, April,
just come by the church.

731
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:22,683
You take care of her, huh?

732
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,123
Yes, of course.

733
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:28,360
April, what were you praying for?

734
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:58,586
What are you doing, man?

735
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,623
I'm sleeping.

736
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,572
You want some company?

737
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:28,744
That ain't no way
for somebody to die.

738
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,817
I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

739
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:58,879
When was the last time
that you spoke to her?

740
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,088
A year ago.

741
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,225
We....

742
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:11,596
We had an argument.
It's so stupid now.

743
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:17,698
My sister...

744
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,034
...was so strung out.

745
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:24,235
She screwed those kids up.

746
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:27,337
She--

747
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:33,445
She traded Jennifer for crack one time
when she was 9.

748
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:42,494
She was so high one time,
she put Byron in the oven.

749
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:46,029
She burned Manny
with her crack pipe.

750
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:50,933
And my mother was there
every time.

751
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:52,127
Every time.

752
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:58,773
She'd asked me to babysit...

753
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:01,672
...and I told her I couldn't.

754
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:06,783
And I wasn't doing nothing.
I just didn't feel like being bothered.

755
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:13,886
So she got mad at me
and I never spoke to her again.

756
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:22,759
I said some things
I really wish I could take back.

757
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:36,012
All the good she did for people
and she died on a bus.

758
00:48:37,517 --> 00:48:42,045
Oh, she was good to everybody.
She died on a bus alone.

759
00:48:49,296 --> 00:48:52,390
Watch out, y'all, stay close together.
I'm coming.

760
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:57,826
Where have you been?

761
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,903
Looking for Mama Rose.

762
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:07,545
I have something to tell you.

763
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,638
What is it?

764
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,779
My mother died.

765
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,989
What?

766
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,883
Why are you lying?

767
00:49:22,395 --> 00:49:23,384
She's not lying.

768
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:25,690
You will say anything
to get rid of us, huh?

769
00:49:25,899 --> 00:49:28,231
-Jennifer.
-lf you don't want us here, we'll go.

770
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:29,868
You don't have to say all that.

771
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:33,731
-It's not true.
-You will say anything.

772
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,738
-lt is true, Manny.
-Can I go feed them?

773
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:42,708
-Yeah.
-Jennifer. Jennifer.

774
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,039
Are you okay?

775
00:49:45,785 --> 00:49:47,810
Yeah, I'm fine. People die. So what?

776
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:50,546
Hey, listen,
it's okay to cry or to be upset.

777
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:52,520
I said I'm fine, okay?

778
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:12,707
Yo, turn the damn TV down, please.

779
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,670
Hey, Agnes, how you doing?

780
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:18,316
-Good to see you.
-Hi, Madea.

781
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,915
What you doing sitting out here?

782
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,323
Trying to steal something?

783
00:50:29,596 --> 00:50:31,359
What's going on with you?

784
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:34,464
My grandmother died.

785
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:36,636
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, babe.

786
00:50:36,836 --> 00:50:40,363
My Aunt April's gonna send us
back to foster care.

787
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,432
They're going to separate us.

788
00:50:44,311 --> 00:50:45,744
I'm all Manny and Byron got.

789
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:49,745
If we separate, I don't know--
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

790
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:53,117
-Oh, no.
-Calm yourself down, honey.

791
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,414
-Calm down. Getting all worked up.
-Can we stay with you?

792
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:03,159
Nobody wants us.

793
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:08,630
-That ain't true. Somebody wants you.
-I'm only 1 6. I'm....

794
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:13,170
-I don't know how to handle all this.
-Honey.

795
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:16,001
-I'm tired. I don't--
-Living takes a lifetime.

796
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:19,042
You got a whole lot more living
to do, honey.

797
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:22,612
I don't feel like I'm gonna--
I don't feel like I'm gonna make it.

798
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:24,340
You gonna make it. Hush, dear.

799
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:26,951
Gotta keep getting up every day,
one day at a time.

800
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:28,211
You're gonna make it.

801
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:34,155
My Grandma Rose used to tell us
to pray about it, and if....

802
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:38,888
Then that's what you ought to do,
pray about it, talk to the Lord about it.

803
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:44,196
Yeah, but she only told us--
She never told me how to do it.

804
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:47,636
Would you teach me?

805
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:50,704
Please.

806
00:51:51,344 --> 00:51:54,074
-Show you how to pray?
-Yeah.

807
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,374
Oh, child, I ain't talked to God...

808
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:01,247
...since the last time I saw a cop
in my rearview mirror.

809
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:04,823
I guess I can try.

810
00:52:05,024 --> 00:52:07,356
I can try to pray.
You know the number?

811
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,549
The what?

812
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:10,093
-The number.
-The number?

813
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:11,854
To call him.

814
00:52:12,065 --> 00:52:14,761
They say "Jesus On the Mainline."
I don't know the number.

815
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:16,492
Sit back, sit back.

816
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:19,365
Okay, bow your head.

817
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:23,608
First, giving honor to God,
to the head of my life.

818
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:31,342
Father

819
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:34,645
I stretch

820
00:52:35,121 --> 00:52:41,583
My hand

821
00:52:43,696 --> 00:52:44,788
To thee

822
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:47,723
Father God...

823
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:53,365
...God of Abraham, lsaac and Jacob.

824
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,771
God of Shadrach,
Meshach and the billy goat...

825
00:52:57,977 --> 00:53:00,445
...who was in the fiery furnace
that they barbecued...

826
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:03,411
...on the day of Pentecost
when the Jewish people returned...

827
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:07,985
...from the Sabbath day
up on the mountaintop in Ethiopia.

828
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:12,181
God of Mary J. Blige.

829
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:15,327
Madea, that don't sound right.

830
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:19,154
That don't sound right. That's not
how Mama Rose used to do it.

831
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:21,833
You ain't feeling it?
You didn't feel the anointing?

832
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:24,530
-No.
-I don't know nothing about praying.

833
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:27,934
But all praying is, is talking to God,
having a conversation with him.

834
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:30,109
And at the end,
you say the name of Jesus.

835
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,177
That's your stamp that will get it
up there to him. You hear?

836
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,943
Okay.

837
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:38,180
You know who you remind me of
right now?

838
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:41,512
You remind me of Peter in the Bible.
You know who Peter was?

839
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:45,257
Peter was one of the 1 2 disciplines.

840
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:48,222
And they were on a boat
out on the isle...

841
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:50,919
...of the Greek Atlantic Ocean.

842
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:54,827
And when they was on this boat,
the storm rose up.

843
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:58,060
And the 1 2 disciplines, they got really,
really worried and upset.

844
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:00,136
They said,
"Oh, no, what are we gonna do?"

845
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,638
They saw someone coming
toward them on the water...

846
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:05,743
...Iooked like a ghost.
But it wasn't a ghost. It was Jesus.

847
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:08,880
And Peter say, "Jesus, if that's you,
let me come out there."

848
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,175
You gotta be careful
what you ask the Lord for.

849
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:13,045
So Jesus said, "Come on out."

850
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:16,313
So Peter stepped out of the boat
and was walking on the water.

851
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:19,047
He was walking on water?

852
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,422
On the water. He was walking
on the water toward Jesus.

853
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:25,496
Long as he kept his eyes on him,
he stayed on top of the water.

854
00:54:25,698 --> 00:54:28,997
He took his eyes off him, though.
You know why? He got distracted.

855
00:54:29,202 --> 00:54:30,635
You know why he got distracted?

856
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:33,806
When you got your eye on Jesus,
can't get distracted by nothing.

857
00:54:34,007 --> 00:54:35,872
Jonah passed by
in the belly of the whale.

858
00:54:36,075 --> 00:54:38,771
He looked down, Free Willy
with Jonah inside the belly...

859
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:41,378
...and it made him distracted,
so he started to sink.

860
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,072
He said, "Jesus, Jesus, help me."
Jesus said, "l can't.

861
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:45,717
I gotta go to Calvary. I'm late."

862
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:48,945
Jesus went to the cross. He said,
"I'm gonna send you a comforter.

863
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:51,385
When the comforter come,
you gonna be all right."

864
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:53,218
So he's swimming.
He try and swim.

865
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:55,394
He's worried, Jaws was coming,
all that--

866
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:57,187
Spielberg had did that Jaws thing.

867
00:54:57,397 --> 00:54:59,126
It was surrounding him.
He was worried.

868
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:01,163
-You know what happened?
-What?

869
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:02,527
Just in the nick of time--

870
00:55:02,735 --> 00:55:04,566
When you think
you ain't gonna make it...

871
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,636
...in the nick of time,
something happens.

872
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:08,329
Noah came up in the arch.

873
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:12,734
That's right, Noah came rowing up
in the arch of St. Louis Arch...

874
00:55:12,946 --> 00:55:14,937
...and he pulled right up beside him.

875
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:17,776
He got on there, he said,
"Thank you for saving me."

876
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:20,384
Noah said, "No problem, man.
Cool, what's up, fool?"

877
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:22,646
He said, "Come on,
let me show you around."

878
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:24,846
Noah had turned the arch
into a cruise ship.

879
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:27,390
Ain't have nothing to do
after he saved the world.

880
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:29,027
Hey, you know who was on there?

881
00:55:29,228 --> 00:55:32,061
-Eve.
-Eve?

882
00:55:32,565 --> 00:55:35,159
She was in the VlP section.
Yeah, that's right.

883
00:55:35,368 --> 00:55:37,962
And Peter asked, he said,
"Eve, come on, go to the show."

884
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:40,799
So she went to see this show.
And they had tigers.

885
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:42,872
They had two tigers,
two bears, two lions.

886
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:44,634
You know, the male and the female.

887
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:47,677
Well, Siegfried and Roy was there,
and they had the two lions.

888
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,849
And them lions jumped out
and scratched Eve.

889
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,143
That's how Eve get them
two paws right there.

890
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:56,516
You ever see Eve with the paws?
She got two paws right there.

891
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:59,692
Read your Bible some time, honey.
Read your Bible.

892
00:56:03,796 --> 00:56:06,890
This is a mess, April.
I mean, you don't care?

893
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,831
I don't know. I mean, Tanya...

894
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:14,439
...you know I can't help them kids.

895
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:18,838
I mean, I didn't ask for none of this.

896
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:22,014
I ain't never seen
a more selfish person in my life.

897
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:27,778
Okay, what do you
mean by that, Tanya?

898
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:32,987
I mean, April, you gotta care
about somebody other than yourself.

899
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:35,353
You don't know me, man.

900
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:36,994
-Oh, I know you.
-No, you don't.

901
00:56:37,196 --> 00:56:39,255
-That's the problem.
-Tanya, look, l--

902
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:43,196
Look, I didn't come here
for that, okay?

903
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:46,531
Honey, I love you,
so I can say this, okay?

904
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:49,469
Girl, you always drunk. Always.

905
00:56:49,676 --> 00:56:52,474
There's not a day
that I have not seen you drunk.

906
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:56,013
You just care about alcohol
and "Where's Randy?"

907
00:56:56,215 --> 00:56:57,978
I mean, I'm sick of hearing that.

908
00:56:58,184 --> 00:57:00,618
You got a bigger problem
on your hands right now.

909
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,981
If I wasn't your friend,
if I didn't love you...

910
00:57:03,189 --> 00:57:06,681
...I wouldn't bring it to you real
just like I'm giving it to you right now.

911
00:57:06,893 --> 00:57:08,758
You don't care about nobody
but yourself.

912
00:57:08,961 --> 00:57:11,589
I mean, you sleeping
with a married man.

913
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:14,562
You know why? Because you don't
want him around all the time.

914
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:17,327
You got that big old house,
and you only want you in it.

915
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:19,767
You won't even give a bum
on the street 50 cents.

916
00:57:19,972 --> 00:57:23,339
I mean, you don't sound shallow,
you just sound damn selfish.

917
00:57:24,977 --> 00:57:29,380
Oh, so I'm just a bad person, huh?
I'm just evil.

918
00:57:29,582 --> 00:57:32,415
You know what?
Ain't nothing wrong with what you do.

919
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:35,849
But as long as it works for you,
that's all good, right?

920
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:38,683
You need to get
your life together fast.

921
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:42,019
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Miss Tanya.

922
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:44,729
Tanya.

923
00:57:50,903 --> 00:57:52,768
Bravo.

924
00:57:58,244 --> 00:57:59,905
Do it.

925
01:00:56,255 --> 01:00:57,984
What's wrong with him?

926
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:02,620
His blood sugar went up,
so I gave him his insulin shot.

927
01:01:02,828 --> 01:01:06,093
Don't worry about it, I got it.
He'll be fine.

928
01:01:20,413 --> 01:01:22,643
I can't keep y'all.

929
01:01:24,817 --> 01:01:26,114
You don't owe us nothing.

930
01:01:30,623 --> 01:01:33,922
I think we can find you
a great foster home.

931
01:01:34,126 --> 01:01:36,287
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be just like you.

932
01:01:38,297 --> 01:01:41,824
Ain't gonna give a damn
about nobody but myself.

933
01:01:42,468 --> 01:01:44,436
That's the only way to be.

934
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:46,866
What the hell do I look like...

935
01:01:46,978 --> 01:01:49,344
...sitting over here
worried looking after him, huh?

936
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:52,715
I'm 16.

937
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:56,980
When my life gonna start, huh?

938
01:01:57,188 --> 01:02:00,521
I'm not ready for kids, Jennifer,
I'm not. I can't do this.

939
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:02,386
Just leave us alone.

940
01:02:03,227 --> 01:02:05,092
Just leave us alone, just....

941
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:09,497
You don't need to be
hearing about all this.

942
01:04:03,395 --> 01:04:06,125
-Wow, you're up already. It's early.
-Yeah.

943
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:08,697
That's a good thing.
You're sleeping your life away.

944
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:11,761
-Am l?
-Yeah.

945
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,404
Hey, come with me.
I have something for you.

946
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:16,233
Where are we going?

947
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:17,567
It's a surprise. Come on.

948
01:04:18,043 --> 01:04:21,206
I don't play that getting my hair wet,
so don't....

949
01:04:21,413 --> 01:04:23,347
-You got a shower cap?
-No, sorry.

950
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:25,607
You didn't tell me
I was gonna be working out.

951
01:04:25,817 --> 01:04:28,342
-Have fun.
-Why do you sleep all day, huh?

952
01:04:28,553 --> 01:04:29,781
Why not?

953
01:04:29,988 --> 01:04:33,924
Why not? I don't know,
and that's not an answer.

954
01:04:34,826 --> 01:04:37,351
Well, since you're asking
all the questions...

955
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:40,087
...why did you hold me
the way you did...

956
01:04:40,298 --> 01:04:42,095
...when I told you my mother died?

957
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,359
Because you needed to be held.

958
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:48,232
Yeah, but it was the way
you held me.

959
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:52,536
I mean, you held me like....

960
01:04:56,181 --> 01:04:57,910
Like you care.

961
01:04:58,516 --> 01:05:00,347
You don't know that I care by now?

962
01:05:00,552 --> 01:05:02,042
Why?

963
01:05:04,055 --> 01:05:07,024
You know,
if you have to ask that question...

964
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:09,417
...then you just don't know yourself,
I guess.

965
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:12,393
That's still not an answer.

966
01:05:12,597 --> 01:05:17,500
April, I think that you are a very warm
and sensitive...

967
01:05:18,136 --> 01:05:19,296
...and loving person.

968
01:05:19,504 --> 01:05:24,032
And you are funny.
You are very funny.

969
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:27,707
I'm not that funny. Cut it out.

970
01:05:29,214 --> 01:05:31,341
But you hide it.
You hide it all away.

971
01:05:31,549 --> 01:05:34,643
I don't understand. You put up
this wall so that nobody sees it.

972
01:05:34,853 --> 01:05:36,980
But I see through it.

973
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:40,749
I don't understand you and him.

974
01:05:43,228 --> 01:05:46,095
-Talking about Randy again?
-Yes.

975
01:05:46,731 --> 01:05:47,720
He's not so bad.

976
01:05:47,932 --> 01:05:50,662
He's not so good either.
It doesn't make sense to me.

977
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:52,302
Do you love him?

978
01:05:54,739 --> 01:05:57,139
He helps me out. He pays the bills.

979
01:05:58,443 --> 01:05:59,740
That's not what I asked.

980
01:06:01,546 --> 01:06:05,607
April, do you love him?

981
01:06:08,853 --> 01:06:10,445
In a way.

982
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:12,350
I guess.

983
01:06:14,092 --> 01:06:16,686
That is not love, April.

984
01:06:17,162 --> 01:06:19,995
Loving a married man,
sharing him with his wife.

985
01:06:20,198 --> 01:06:23,031
Love is not having somebody
to pay your bills.

986
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:26,965
It's not having to work all night.
That is not love.

987
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:30,107
Love is....

988
01:06:31,276 --> 01:06:33,437
Love is being too tired
from the night before...

989
01:06:33,645 --> 01:06:35,840
...to even go to work the next day.

990
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,381
Whatever.

991
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:49,189
April, we're all looking for love,
one way or another.

992
01:06:51,229 --> 01:06:54,096
Love is having someone there
in the morning when you wake up...

993
01:06:54,299 --> 01:07:00,135
...that is gonna be there with you,
thick or thin, right or wrong.

994
01:07:06,978 --> 01:07:08,070
Let's go.

995
01:07:09,614 --> 01:07:12,777
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I let you talk me into getting on a boat.

996
01:07:12,984 --> 01:07:14,474
Be glad I didn't get my hair wet.

997
01:07:14,686 --> 01:07:18,144
You know black girls don't like
getting their hair wet. Thirsty?

998
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:20,381
Yes, I would like something
to drink, please.

999
01:07:24,028 --> 01:07:25,427
-Hi.
-Hi, kids.

1000
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,291
-How was school?
-Fine.

1001
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:29,796
-Good. You okay?
-Yeah.

1002
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:30,990
He's all right.

1003
01:07:31,202 --> 01:07:34,069
Okay, good. I have a surprise
for everybody, okay?

1004
01:07:34,272 --> 01:07:35,830
Come on, April. I want you to see.

1005
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,407
-You're gonna love it. Come on.
-You and your surprises.

1006
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:44,241
Keep your eyes closed, okay?
It's a big surprise, come on.

1007
01:07:44,782 --> 01:07:47,114
Come on, Manny, Byron.
Come here.

1008
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:48,580
Come here. Stand right here.

1009
01:07:48,786 --> 01:07:50,515
Jennifer, come on.

1010
01:07:50,722 --> 01:07:51,814
Right there.

1011
01:07:52,023 --> 01:07:53,786
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

1012
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:55,857
Open your eyes.

1013
01:07:58,363 --> 01:08:01,332
-ls this our room?
-This is your room.

1014
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:04,194
-Thanks.
-No, it's not.

1015
01:08:04,402 --> 01:08:06,495
-But it looks like it's for us.
-lt is.

1016
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:08,501
It's not.

1017
01:08:09,574 --> 01:08:11,235
Where you steal all this stuff from?

1018
01:08:11,442 --> 01:08:13,034
I did not steal any of this stuff.

1019
01:08:13,244 --> 01:08:16,042
The church gave it to me.
It was in the basement.

1020
01:08:16,247 --> 01:08:17,544
Right.

1021
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:20,579
My bed.

1022
01:08:22,387 --> 01:08:26,084
-My bed.
-Yes, Byron, that's your bed.

1023
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,594
I'd never heard him speak before.

1024
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:32,160
My bed.

1025
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:36,691
-My bed.
-This is the bomb, Sandino.

1026
01:08:38,503 --> 01:08:41,700
Why you gotta get their hopes up for?
You know she don't want us here.

1027
01:08:41,906 --> 01:08:43,669
Hey, that could change.

1028
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,342
"Could" is not definite.

1029
01:08:46,077 --> 01:08:48,671
She definitely don't want us here.

1030
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,509
Listen, how about you stay in this
room for as long as you're here, okay?

1031
01:08:52,717 --> 01:08:54,617
I made it for you.

1032
01:08:55,086 --> 01:08:58,954
Thank you, but we good.
We stay downstairs.

1033
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:03,790
Come on, y'all.
Manny, Byron, I said come on.

1034
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:11,096
-Do we have to go?
-Yes, we have to go.

1035
01:09:15,406 --> 01:09:17,806
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing this, huh?

1036
01:09:18,009 --> 01:09:21,001
-Now they're upset.
-What difference does it make, April?

1037
01:09:21,212 --> 01:09:23,612
You made it very clear to them
that you don't care.

1038
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:47,666
April, come on, we're going.

1039
01:09:51,209 --> 01:09:54,303
What the hell are you knocking
on this door for, Mexico?

1040
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:56,906
-I'm trying to wake up April.
-For what?

1041
01:09:57,115 --> 01:09:59,640
Because we're supposed
to be going to church.

1042
01:09:59,851 --> 01:10:02,046
Well, April ain't going to no church.

1043
01:10:02,253 --> 01:10:04,346
Hear this real good, houseboy.

1044
01:10:04,555 --> 01:10:08,753
Knock on this door again, I'm sending
you back to Mexico in a pine box.

1045
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,520
Ain't a damn thing for you in here.

1046
01:10:15,867 --> 01:10:21,703
This morning, our subject comes
from the text found in Luke 15 and 8.

1047
01:10:21,906 --> 01:10:25,899
It reads, "Either what woman
having 10 pieces of silver...

1048
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:29,136
...if she lose one,
does not light a candle...

1049
01:10:29,347 --> 01:10:34,683
...and sweep the house
and seek diligently until she find it?

1050
01:10:34,886 --> 01:10:38,879
And when she hath found it,
she calleth her friends and says:

1051
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:41,251
'Come rejoice with me...

1052
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:45,896
...for I have found the piece
which I had lost."'

1053
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:53,136
-Where the hell are you going?
-To church.

1054
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:54,599
Church? No, you ain't.

1055
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:59,301
Randy, I'm going to church.
We can talk about this later.

1056
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,772
April.

1057
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:05,540
Hey, come here now.
I said you ain't going, all right?

1058
01:11:05,883 --> 01:11:08,477
-Who's gonna stop me?
-And what is all this?

1059
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:10,711
I've never seen you dressed
for no church.

1060
01:11:10,922 --> 01:11:12,287
How do I look?

1061
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,457
April.

1062
01:11:15,259 --> 01:11:16,453
April, I'm talking to you.

1063
01:11:16,694 --> 01:11:20,391
Today, our subject is value added.

1064
01:11:20,598 --> 01:11:23,726
There are three things I wanna talk
about from this subject.

1065
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:27,268
Number one,
this woman was a good steward.

1066
01:11:27,472 --> 01:11:28,461
All right.

1067
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:32,575
Because she took time
to know what she had...

1068
01:11:32,777 --> 01:11:35,302
...and how much of what she had.

1069
01:11:35,847 --> 01:11:38,315
Therefore,
because she watched it every day...

1070
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:42,384
...she knew when a piece of silver
was lost.

1071
01:11:42,587 --> 01:11:43,576
Yeah.

1072
01:11:43,788 --> 01:11:49,693
Secondly, she gave value
to each piece of silver.

1073
01:11:49,894 --> 01:11:53,921
She did not extol one piece
over the other.

1074
01:11:54,131 --> 01:12:00,366
And thirdly, when she discovered
that one was lost...

1075
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:04,268
...she swept the house clean
to find it.

1076
01:12:04,475 --> 01:12:06,534
Amen.

1077
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:10,612
You don't know what it is
to walk the floor worried...

1078
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:12,373
...over something you've lost.

1079
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,813
-Aunt April's here.
-All of us love...

1080
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:17,886
...and somehow our love is limited...

1081
01:12:18,089 --> 01:12:22,458
...when someone ends up somewhere
that we don't want them to be.

1082
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:28,496
But what she knew is that even though
this piece of silver was lost...

1083
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:30,633
...it had not lost its value.

1084
01:12:30,835 --> 01:12:34,202
-Amen.
-lt had just lost its usefulness.

1085
01:12:34,405 --> 01:12:39,069
You cannot help anyone
when you're lost.

1086
01:12:39,277 --> 01:12:45,273
You cannot fulfill your mission in life
when you're lost.

1087
01:12:45,483 --> 01:12:50,318
You cannot help your family
or your fellow man when you're lost.

1088
01:12:50,988 --> 01:12:55,584
And somebody
has to care enough about you...

1089
01:12:55,793 --> 01:12:56,782
Yeah.

1090
01:12:56,994 --> 01:13:00,521
...to put a light in a very dark place...

1091
01:13:00,731 --> 01:13:03,427
...when you're caught
in the crevices of life...

1092
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:06,728
-...and can't figure out how to get out.
-All right.

1093
01:13:06,938 --> 01:13:11,773
You need somebody
that's gonna care enough about you...

1094
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:13,966
...that says you're worth it.

1095
01:13:14,178 --> 01:13:18,274
I want you to know
you're worth me waiting on.

1096
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:20,382
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

1097
01:13:20,585 --> 01:13:23,452
I said you're worth me waiting on.

1098
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,283
There are some things that we face.

1099
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:32,887
You've come to people...

1100
01:13:33,097 --> 01:13:36,999
...and it seems
as if they don't wanna know.

1101
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:38,793
I understand it.

1102
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:41,062
I've been there.

1103
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:44,972
As a matter of fact,
let me say it like this:

1104
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:50,004
I've hurt so many nights

1105
01:13:54,318 --> 01:13:59,483
I cried so many hours

1106
01:14:02,093 --> 01:14:06,393
Trying to make it right

1107
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:09,828
Trying to make it right

1108
01:14:10,635 --> 01:14:16,335
But just didn't have the power

1109
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:22,035
And you ignored all my tears

1110
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,979
It hurt me so bad

1111
01:14:24,181 --> 01:14:26,479
Sing that song!

1112
01:14:26,684 --> 01:14:33,613
You wanted them to disappear

1113
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:38,289
I tried to let it go

1114
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:41,056
But I guess

1115
01:14:41,265 --> 01:14:46,703
You just don't wanna know

1116
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:48,098
Listen.

1117
01:14:48,305 --> 01:14:51,934
If I had a dime for every time

1118
01:14:52,143 --> 01:14:56,136
I tried to call your name

1119
01:14:56,347 --> 01:14:57,712
Some tell me

1120
01:14:57,915 --> 01:14:59,678
Some tell me

1121
01:14:59,884 --> 01:15:01,545
I'd be wealthy

1122
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:03,515
I'd be wealthy

1123
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:06,519
Amen, amen.

1124
01:15:09,326 --> 01:15:10,315
Oh, Lord

1125
01:15:12,663 --> 01:15:15,223
But I learned that I could cope

1126
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:16,991
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1127
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:19,431
- Yes, I did
-Yes.

1128
01:15:19,637 --> 01:15:25,667
Through my struggle I discovered
I discovered I could make it

1129
01:15:28,112 --> 01:15:31,878
In nights so long and cold

1130
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,550
So cold

1131
01:15:34,185 --> 01:15:36,244
You don't know how cold

1132
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:41,756
I discovered
I discovered I could take it

1133
01:15:43,227 --> 01:15:47,789
Now I wouldn't
I wouldn't change a thing

1134
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:50,564
Lord, have mercy.

1135
01:15:50,768 --> 01:15:52,963
Not for the knowledge

1136
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:57,004
Not for the knowledge
That I've gained

1137
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:59,540
You know what I discovered
in my trials?

1138
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:04,909
I learned that I could grow

1139
01:16:05,116 --> 01:16:06,674
I really did

1140
01:16:07,218 --> 01:16:12,815
I tried, I tried to let, let it go

1141
01:16:13,023 --> 01:16:14,684
I did

1142
01:16:14,892 --> 01:16:20,194
I tried, tried to let it show

1143
01:16:20,397 --> 01:16:22,729
But I guess

1144
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:27,768
- You just don't wanna know
-Just don't wanna know

1145
01:16:27,972 --> 01:16:29,872
-No, no, no
- Yes

1146
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:33,802
Really don't wanna know

1147
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:37,139
You don't wanna know
How many nights I cried

1148
01:16:37,348 --> 01:16:41,910
You don't know how many times
I felt like I was gonna die

1149
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:46,021
But I kept on moving
I kept on hoping

1150
01:16:46,223 --> 01:16:49,590
I kept on believing
And now I can tell you

1151
01:16:49,794 --> 01:16:51,591
- That I'm over
- That I'm over it now

1152
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:52,956
Anybody here.

1153
01:16:53,164 --> 01:16:56,429
-Say "I'm over, I'm over it now"
-Over it now

1154
01:16:56,634 --> 01:16:58,431
-I can't explain it
-I can't say how

1155
01:16:58,636 --> 01:17:01,605
-But right now, I'm over it
-But I'm over it

1156
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:05,041
I'm hoping right now

1157
01:17:05,242 --> 01:17:07,233
One morning I just broke free

1158
01:17:07,444 --> 01:17:12,404
And the chains
They just dropped off from me

1159
01:17:12,616 --> 01:17:13,981
People can talk about me

1160
01:17:14,185 --> 01:17:16,244
-As much as they please
-Just don't wanna know

1161
01:17:16,453 --> 01:17:18,546
But I'm all grown up now

1162
01:17:18,756 --> 01:17:20,519
I said I'm all older now

1163
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:23,955
And I got the victory
Because I'm over

1164
01:17:24,161 --> 01:17:28,291
-But I'm over it now
-I'm over it now

1165
01:17:28,499 --> 01:17:31,024
-Over it now
-I'm over it now

1166
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:34,295
-I can't say how, but I'm over it
-Say it again, say I'm

1167
01:17:34,505 --> 01:17:36,097
Over it now

1168
01:17:36,307 --> 01:17:39,105
Just wave your hand
if you know you're over it.

1169
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,505
If you feel the presence of God...

1170
01:17:41,712 --> 01:17:45,011
...if you feel the anointing of God,
just declare now...

1171
01:17:45,216 --> 01:17:46,911
...that I'm over it now.

1172
01:17:47,117 --> 01:17:48,209
Say it right now.

1173
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:49,408
Over it now

1174
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:52,953
It's over,
I'm walking out of here free.

1175
01:17:53,157 --> 01:17:55,284
Because I'm over it now

1176
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:56,550
Amen.

1177
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,887
I'm really over it now

1178
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:04,056
Went to a meeting one night
And my heart wasn't right

1179
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:06,930
But something got ahold of me

1180
01:18:07,137 --> 01:18:08,866
And I'm over it now

1181
01:18:09,073 --> 01:18:11,337
Just don't wanna know

1182
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:15,034
Wilma. Wilma, would you just...?

1183
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:17,874
People don't know
you've been through some things.

1184
01:18:18,082 --> 01:18:20,949
They think because
you're looking so pretty in your hat...

1185
01:18:21,151 --> 01:18:23,119
...they don't know
what you've been through.

1186
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,016
But could you say one good time,
"I'm over it now"?

1187
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:30,626
I'm over it now

1188
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:35,356
Over it now, I can't say how

1189
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:38,330
But I'm over it now

1190
01:18:39,003 --> 01:18:43,940
Right now, right now, right now

1191
01:18:44,141 --> 01:18:45,972
-I'm over it now
-I'm over it now

1192
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:48,269
-I'm over it now
-I don't have to live with it

1193
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:49,639
Don't have to live with it

1194
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:52,111
-Don't have to be in it
-Don't have to be in it

1195
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:56,582
I'm over it, over it now

1196
01:18:56,787 --> 01:19:01,019
Over it now, I can't say how

1197
01:19:01,225 --> 01:19:03,523
But I'm over it now

1198
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:04,921
-Now
-Right now

1199
01:19:05,129 --> 01:19:06,687
-Now, now, now
-Right now

1200
01:19:06,897 --> 01:19:10,094
-Now, now, now
-Now, now, now

1201
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,867
I'm over it now

1202
01:19:14,071 --> 01:19:17,632
I tried

1203
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:21,004
To let it go

1204
01:19:21,211 --> 01:19:23,179
I really did

1205
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:28,044
I tried to let it show

1206
01:19:28,252 --> 01:19:30,152
Thank you, Jesus

1207
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:36,384
But right now
I learned that I could grow

1208
01:19:36,593 --> 01:19:39,460
But I guess

1209
01:19:39,663 --> 01:19:46,330
You just don't wanna know

1210
01:19:46,837 --> 01:19:48,805
Hallelujah.

1211
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,271
You're worth it.

1212
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:01,341
Give him praise
because he's worthy.

1213
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:05,446
His purpose is real.

1214
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:09,887
You're gonna make it.
You'll be all right.

1215
01:20:10,094 --> 01:20:12,722
You don't have to worry at all.

1216
01:20:13,764 --> 01:20:15,891
You're over it now.

1217
01:20:16,633 --> 01:20:18,624
You're over it now.

1218
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:48,491
Hold on. I'll be right back.

1219
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:23,262
How you doing, beautiful?

1220
01:21:25,936 --> 01:21:28,268
I've seen the way
you've been looking at me.

1221
01:21:28,772 --> 01:21:30,205
See, this here my house...

1222
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:33,535
...and I can let you
and two little nappy boys stay here.

1223
01:21:33,744 --> 01:21:35,336
Right.

1224
01:21:48,392 --> 01:21:50,121
I'll get you
all the medicine you need.

1225
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:51,760
I need to give him his insulin.

1226
01:21:51,962 --> 01:21:54,522
Now, see, what you need to do
is take care of me.

1227
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,996
If you don't stop right now,
I'm gonna tell April.

1228
01:22:00,204 --> 01:22:03,002
You think
she's gonna believe you, huh?

1229
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:05,232
You think she's gonna believe you?

1230
01:22:07,544 --> 01:22:09,341
Take it off.

1231
01:22:09,546 --> 01:22:11,070
I said--

1232
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:32,430
What are you doing? Get off of him!

1233
01:22:32,636 --> 01:22:34,729
Stop it! Stop it!

1234
01:22:34,938 --> 01:22:37,099
What are you doing to him?

1235
01:22:38,509 --> 01:22:41,273
-What is going on here?
-It's okay.

1236
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:43,070
It's okay. Come on.

1237
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,508
He tried to rape her.

1238
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:46,979
They lying on me, right--
They lying on me.

1239
01:22:47,184 --> 01:22:49,812
No, no, no. This little slut--

1240
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:53,012
You know she's a slut. She tried to
get me to have sex for money.

1241
01:22:54,324 --> 01:22:56,758
Baby-- Sandino, you saw her!

1242
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,019
-Tell her what you saw.
-He tried to rape her!

1243
01:23:00,664 --> 01:23:02,131
Who you gonna believe, huh?

1244
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,996
April, who you gonna believe, huh?
Them or me?

1245
01:23:06,203 --> 01:23:09,536
-He's lying, he's--
-He's lying, April, he's lying.

1246
01:23:10,474 --> 01:23:12,772
Who you gonna believe?
Them or me, babe?

1247
01:23:13,343 --> 01:23:14,503
You, baby.

1248
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:16,042
-He's lying.
-April.

1249
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:17,804
Go upstairs and get in the tub.

1250
01:23:18,015 --> 01:23:21,109
-I can't believe you believe him.
-It's okay, it's okay.

1251
01:23:22,686 --> 01:23:25,382
-It's okay.
-He's lying!

1252
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:26,851
He's lying, April.

1253
01:23:29,326 --> 01:23:30,793
It's okay, it's okay.

1254
01:23:30,994 --> 01:23:33,360
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1255
01:23:33,564 --> 01:23:35,259
Look at me, look at me.

1256
01:23:35,465 --> 01:23:37,490
Look at me. It's okay, it's okay.

1257
01:23:37,701 --> 01:23:39,396
It's okay, it's okay.

1258
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:42,163
Hey, no one's going to hurt you.

1259
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:48,670
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1260
01:23:48,879 --> 01:23:50,710
It's gonna be okay, all right?

1261
01:23:50,914 --> 01:23:52,506
It's okay.

1262
01:23:56,954 --> 01:24:00,390
Okay, no one's going to hurt you.
Nobody here will hurt you.

1263
01:24:00,591 --> 01:24:02,991
-Nobody's going to hurt you.
-No.

1264
01:24:03,193 --> 01:24:04,182
It's okay, Jenny.

1265
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:09,090
Baby, I think I broke my nose.

1266
01:24:12,302 --> 01:24:14,429
Oh, baby, thank you.

1267
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:16,898
You know I love you, right?

1268
01:24:18,075 --> 01:24:21,044
Baby, I'm just trying to provide
the best life for you I can.

1269
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:27,583
-What happened?
-Baby, I told you what happened.

1270
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:31,216
That little girl tried to get me
to have sex with her for money.

1271
01:24:45,202 --> 01:24:46,726
Baby, these kids ain't no good.

1272
01:24:46,937 --> 01:24:50,429
They spending up
all my damn money, baby, you know?

1273
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:53,474
I mean, everything was fine
before they got here.

1274
01:24:54,111 --> 01:24:55,976
It's all their fault, baby.

1275
01:24:56,179 --> 01:24:58,113
Them kids causing
all kind of problems.

1276
01:24:58,315 --> 01:25:00,010
Paying all these bills around here...

1277
01:25:00,217 --> 01:25:02,742
...these damn kids come here
snatching up all our money.

1278
01:25:07,491 --> 01:25:10,824
I didn't want these damn kids here,
I told you that.

1279
01:25:11,194 --> 01:25:14,823
We had all kinds of problems
since they got here.

1280
01:25:16,099 --> 01:25:17,726
Tell me what happened.

1281
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:21,898
April, I told you what happened.

1282
01:25:22,105 --> 01:25:24,130
Tell me what you did.

1283
01:25:24,341 --> 01:25:26,309
April, I didn't do nothing.

1284
01:25:30,781 --> 01:25:32,874
That's my niece.

1285
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:35,677
She's 16.

1286
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,078
Baby, calm down now.

1287
01:25:38,989 --> 01:25:42,254
What did you do?

1288
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:44,859
I told you, I didn't do nothing, April.

1289
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:47,121
You are just like Lee.

1290
01:25:48,332 --> 01:25:49,321
April, stop!

1291
01:25:49,533 --> 01:25:52,661
He told my mother
he didn't do nothing either.

1292
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,665
Stop! Stop it, April. Damn!

1293
01:25:55,872 --> 01:25:58,272
April, get that thing
away from the water.

1294
01:25:58,475 --> 01:25:59,965
April, stop!

1295
01:26:00,177 --> 01:26:02,111
You wait here, okay?

1296
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,341
-You watch your sister.
-Stop playing!

1297
01:26:05,549 --> 01:26:07,779
I told you. Get that thing off!

1298
01:26:08,785 --> 01:26:11,948
-April, damn it!
-Just like Lee.

1299
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:14,715
He told my mother
he didn't do nothing.

1300
01:26:14,925 --> 01:26:16,017
April.

1301
01:26:16,226 --> 01:26:21,095
-That it was my fault, that I did it!
-That is plugged in and I'm in water!

1302
01:26:21,298 --> 01:26:24,165
-Shut up!
-He's not worth it. Put the radio down.

1303
01:26:24,368 --> 01:26:26,734
-Stop! Let--
-You want me to put it down?

1304
01:26:26,937 --> 01:26:30,134
-Ap! Calm down!
-You want me to put it down?

1305
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,329
April, no!

1306
01:26:45,522 --> 01:26:48,980
You got three minutes to get your stuff
and you get the hell out of here.

1307
01:27:02,572 --> 01:27:04,130
Hey.

1308
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:06,335
Why did you leave him alone?

1309
01:27:06,543 --> 01:27:11,037
April, he's gone, okay?
I took his keys, he won't be back.

1310
01:27:12,682 --> 01:27:14,377
Are you okay?

1311
01:27:17,888 --> 01:27:20,118
I should've known.

1312
01:27:20,891 --> 01:27:23,451
-April, this is not your fault.
-I should've known.

1313
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,390
The way he looked at her.

1314
01:27:29,533 --> 01:27:31,524
I should've known.

1315
01:27:34,204 --> 01:27:36,672
Like my mother should've known.

1316
01:27:40,977 --> 01:27:42,171
She was always saying...

1317
01:27:42,379 --> 01:27:48,318
...whatever happens in this house
stays in this house.

1318
01:27:52,989 --> 01:27:56,982
Nothing ever gets healed
if you keep it covered up.

1319
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:00,095
I should've known.

1320
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:08,704
When a man...

1321
01:28:08,905 --> 01:28:11,567
...a grown man...

1322
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:16,812
...takes interest in a little kid...

1323
01:28:17,447 --> 01:28:19,347
...something ain't right.

1324
01:28:19,549 --> 01:28:21,141
Come on, April, that's enough.

1325
01:28:21,351 --> 01:28:22,579
Get off of me.

1326
01:28:27,757 --> 01:28:29,691
Are you one too?

1327
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,357
What?

1328
01:28:34,464 --> 01:28:36,227
A child molester.

1329
01:28:36,433 --> 01:28:40,096
-Are you a child molester, Sandino?
-Are you asking me this question?

1330
01:28:40,303 --> 01:28:42,430
Why do you care so much
about those kids?

1331
01:28:45,008 --> 01:28:46,566
I hit a nerve.

1332
01:28:46,776 --> 01:28:48,869
-Enough.
-What do you like, huh?

1333
01:28:49,079 --> 01:28:52,139
Do you like the little girls
or do you like the little boys?

1334
01:28:52,349 --> 01:28:54,613
I said, that's enough.
You shut your mouth.

1335
01:28:54,818 --> 01:28:58,049
Who are you talking to?
Come back here.

1336
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:02,556
Come back here. Hey!

1337
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:04,283
Hey! Tell me.

1338
01:29:04,494 --> 01:29:05,483
-Stop it.
-What is it?

1339
01:29:05,695 --> 01:29:07,219
-Tell me!
-Enough, April.

1340
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:09,364
You get your stuff out of my house!

1341
01:29:09,566 --> 01:29:12,126
I'm not a child molester,
you stop calling me that.

1342
01:29:12,335 --> 01:29:15,429
-Why are you so uncomfortable?
-You wanna make me a bad person...

1343
01:29:15,639 --> 01:29:18,836
...for showing these kids some love?
These kids that have nobody?

1344
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:22,136
You're sick! You're out of your mind,
you know that?

1345
01:29:22,345 --> 01:29:24,336
You don't know my life, April.

1346
01:29:24,548 --> 01:29:26,209
I have nobody.

1347
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:28,145
From the time
that I was 7 years old...

1348
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:30,683
...and picking coca leaves
1 0, 1 2 hours a day...

1349
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:33,151
...and getting beaten
when I'm hungry or tired.

1350
01:29:33,356 --> 01:29:34,345
When I'm old enough...

1351
01:29:34,558 --> 01:29:37,493
...the cartel send me to recruit children
to do the same thing.

1352
01:29:37,694 --> 01:29:41,653
I see these kids, I wanna help them,
and you wanna get in the way of that!

1353
01:29:42,232 --> 01:29:43,597
I feel sorry for you.

1354
01:29:52,108 --> 01:29:54,303
What the hell are you looking at?

1355
01:29:54,511 --> 01:29:57,412
Move out of the damn way!

1356
01:30:11,528 --> 01:30:14,395
You don't ever have to worry
about him coming back.

1357
01:30:14,598 --> 01:30:16,828
He's never coming back.

1358
01:30:18,335 --> 01:30:21,463
-Get some sleep.
-Wait.

1359
01:30:24,207 --> 01:30:26,038
Aunt April.

1360
01:30:29,846 --> 01:30:32,110
Thank you for believing me.

1361
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:36,217
Baby, I believed you
when you said it.

1362
01:30:38,488 --> 01:30:39,716
I know that look.

1363
01:30:44,661 --> 01:30:46,856
Wait, wait.

1364
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:53,631
If you let us stay here,
I promise we won't be no trouble.

1365
01:30:53,837 --> 01:30:58,740
I'll cook and clean for you.
And the boys, I'll take care of them.

1366
01:30:58,942 --> 01:31:00,273
You won't have to do nothing.

1367
01:31:00,477 --> 01:31:02,411
-Jennifer--
-Wait, let me finish.

1368
01:31:05,148 --> 01:31:07,241
-I'll quit school, I'll get a job.
-Jennifer.

1369
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:09,850
You don't have to quit school.

1370
01:31:10,053 --> 01:31:11,748
And I'll help you pay the bills...

1371
01:31:11,955 --> 01:31:16,722
...and I can be a good girl.
I won't be so angry.

1372
01:31:16,926 --> 01:31:20,555
I'm just so tired
of going from place to place.

1373
01:31:21,031 --> 01:31:23,693
I need y'all to stay with me.

1374
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:32,633
I just messed--
I messed everything up.

1375
01:31:33,476 --> 01:31:35,671
And I gotta fix this.

1376
01:31:35,879 --> 01:31:38,939
So you gotta stay here
with me, okay?

1377
01:31:40,216 --> 01:31:41,843
And I really--

1378
01:31:42,052 --> 01:31:48,287
I would love it if you taught me
how to take care of your brothers.

1379
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:52,350
Jennifer.

1380
01:31:55,832 --> 01:31:57,823
We will get through this, okay?

1381
01:31:58,034 --> 01:31:59,934
You're a good girl.

1382
01:32:00,136 --> 01:32:02,502
We're gonna be all right, okay?

1383
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:08,174
Now, get your brothers
and come up to your new room.

1384
01:32:08,378 --> 01:32:11,040
Hey, come on, go get your brothers.

1385
01:32:16,186 --> 01:32:18,882
Manny? You have to get up.

1386
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:26,885
Come in.

1387
01:32:31,835 --> 01:32:36,169
-She's gonna let us stay.
-I know.

1388
01:32:36,372 --> 01:32:40,035
-Ain't that supposed to be good?
-Yeah, Manny, that's really good.

1389
01:32:40,243 --> 01:32:41,540
Why do you look sad?

1390
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:45,709
I'm not sad.

1391
01:32:55,425 --> 01:32:56,915
I have to go away for a while.

1392
01:32:57,127 --> 01:32:59,595
-What?
-Where you going?

1393
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:02,555
I'm gonna shoot straight
with you guys, okay?

1394
01:33:03,032 --> 01:33:06,229
Things aren't going very well
with me and your aunt.

1395
01:33:06,436 --> 01:33:08,768
So it's best that I leave.

1396
01:33:08,972 --> 01:33:11,668
In the meantime,
I'm going to call you...

1397
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:14,708
...and write letters.

1398
01:33:14,911 --> 01:33:16,811
Okay? And you make sure
you write me back.

1399
01:33:17,013 --> 01:33:18,503
All right.

1400
01:33:22,285 --> 01:33:24,150
I understand.

1401
01:33:24,554 --> 01:33:25,987
I mean...

1402
01:33:26,456 --> 01:33:28,788
...you gotta do
what you gotta do, right?

1403
01:33:32,162 --> 01:33:34,062
We're gonna miss you.

1404
01:33:35,965 --> 01:33:38,092
I'm gonna miss you too.

1405
01:33:45,942 --> 01:33:48,911
Give me a hug. All right?

1406
01:33:49,112 --> 01:33:52,343
-I'm gonna miss you so much.
-I'm gonna miss you too.

1407
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:04,692
-Hey.
-Hey.

1408
01:34:08,464 --> 01:34:09,453
He's gone.

1409
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,868
Yeah, I know.

1410
01:34:15,271 --> 01:34:17,933
You wanna help me unpack
some of Mama Rose's things?

1411
01:34:18,675 --> 01:34:20,074
Sure.

1412
01:34:26,015 --> 01:34:27,710
That's cute.

1413
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:43,558
You know,
I think you're wrong about him.

1414
01:34:45,435 --> 01:34:46,800
What do you know about this?

1415
01:34:47,003 --> 01:34:48,470
That's a good man...

1416
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:53,631
...and I don't think
you should just let him go like that.

1417
01:34:55,378 --> 01:34:58,245
You're too young
to understand, baby.

1418
01:34:59,082 --> 01:35:00,743
Yeah, but...

1419
01:35:01,718 --> 01:35:04,312
...I know there's a lot of bad people
in this world.

1420
01:35:04,988 --> 01:35:07,286
-Yeah.
-lf you find somebody you can trust...

1421
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:10,015
...then you should probably
hold on to them.

1422
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:13,595
I mean, it's like....

1423
01:35:13,796 --> 01:35:16,663
When Peter
was walking on the water...

1424
01:35:16,866 --> 01:35:20,825
...and he got distracted by the whale
and he started to drown...

1425
01:35:21,037 --> 01:35:23,096
...and Noah came in
in the St. Louis Arch--

1426
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:26,036
Wait, wait. What? What?

1427
01:35:26,242 --> 01:35:27,402
He was drowning and Noah--

1428
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:30,636
He was-- Wait a minute.

1429
01:35:34,684 --> 01:35:36,208
Who taught you this story?

1430
01:35:36,853 --> 01:35:38,912
Madea was telling me
all these Bible stories--

1431
01:35:39,122 --> 01:35:42,990
Oh, Lord, her?
Girl, even I know that ain't right.

1432
01:35:43,192 --> 01:35:45,422
I know that story. Come on.

1433
01:35:46,829 --> 01:35:49,354
I guess
I should've known better, huh?

1434
01:35:49,565 --> 01:35:52,932
Yeah, I guess I'm gonna have to
take you to church more often, huh?

1435
01:36:22,966 --> 01:36:24,627
What is it?

1436
01:36:30,473 --> 01:36:31,997
That's weird.

1437
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:34,642
They're singing
Mama Rose's favorite song.

1438
01:36:36,112 --> 01:36:38,580
She still knows when to show up.

1439
01:38:58,321 --> 01:39:00,915
Come on down now for prayer
if you want the Lord.

1440
01:39:44,967 --> 01:39:46,025
Hi.

1441
01:39:46,235 --> 01:39:47,463
Hi.

1442
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,365
I'm....

1443
01:39:51,541 --> 01:39:52,803
I'm so sorry.

1444
01:39:54,911 --> 01:39:56,936
I'm not really good
at knowing how to love...

1445
01:39:57,146 --> 01:39:59,011
...anything...

1446
01:40:00,683 --> 01:40:02,116
...or anybody.

1447
01:40:02,318 --> 01:40:04,786
But I really like having you around.

1448
01:40:04,987 --> 01:40:07,148
And since you talked me
into keeping the kids...

1449
01:40:07,356 --> 01:40:11,622
...I really, I would love for you
to just stay here with me...

1450
01:40:11,827 --> 01:40:14,261
...and help me with the kids.

1451
01:40:14,864 --> 01:40:16,058
Please?

1452
01:40:18,734 --> 01:40:20,201
Say something.

1453
01:40:20,403 --> 01:40:23,372
-What do you want me to say?
-What do you wanna say?

1454
01:40:23,573 --> 01:40:24,801
I don't know. What is this?

1455
01:40:25,007 --> 01:40:27,771
Your way of telling me
that you like me or something?

1456
01:40:29,111 --> 01:40:32,205
I do. I can admit that.

1457
01:40:33,482 --> 01:40:35,347
I think I love you.

1458
01:40:38,554 --> 01:40:40,419
Please say something.

1459
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:42,821
I don't know what to say.

1460
01:40:45,294 --> 01:40:47,558
I mean, you're a good human being.

1461
01:40:47,763 --> 01:40:52,166
I love you like a friend,
like how I love Tanya.

1462
01:40:59,442 --> 01:41:01,000
Okay.

1463
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,370
Like you love Tanya.

1464
01:41:02,578 --> 01:41:06,378
-You don't believe me.
-No, I don't believe you, okay?

1465
01:41:06,582 --> 01:41:10,450
-You don't believe I love you.
-April, let's not get into this, okay?

1466
01:41:10,653 --> 01:41:11,642
No, tell me, please.

1467
01:41:11,854 --> 01:41:14,687
It's okay.
You don't fully love yourself, okay?

1468
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:17,256
Everybody that loves you,
you push them away.

1469
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:19,724
You keep them at a distance.

1470
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:23,792
What are you, a psychiatrist?

1471
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,094
Not a psychiatrist, but I know love.
Look at you, that's not love.

1472
01:41:27,303 --> 01:41:29,396
You're drinking,
smoking yourself to death.

1473
01:41:29,605 --> 01:41:31,163
Your father dies of liver cancer.

1474
01:41:31,374 --> 01:41:33,672
You don't love yourself
the way I love you.

1475
01:41:36,812 --> 01:41:38,302
What?

1476
01:41:38,514 --> 01:41:40,072
I said that I love you.

1477
01:41:40,283 --> 01:41:42,274
What? Like a...?

1478
01:41:42,485 --> 01:41:45,318
Like a friend, like a buddy?
Like a pal or something?

1479
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:48,581
No, April, I don't wanna make love
to my buddies and my pals.

1480
01:41:49,258 --> 01:41:51,123
I'm in love with you.

1481
01:41:51,327 --> 01:41:52,385
I'm ready to love you...

1482
01:41:52,595 --> 01:41:56,224
...but you have to be ready
to give it back the right way.

1483
01:41:56,432 --> 01:41:58,366
I wanna learn...

1484
01:41:58,934 --> 01:42:00,424
...how to love the right way.

1485
01:42:02,605 --> 01:42:03,936
Will you show me?

1486
01:42:12,348 --> 01:42:14,111
I'll show you.

1487
01:43:06,435 --> 01:43:08,369
That's right.

1488
01:43:08,938 --> 01:43:10,462
Can't hold my girl down.

1489
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,904
Because she a good woman, y'all.

1490
01:43:15,745 --> 01:43:17,372
Y'all ready?

1491
01:46:37,913 --> 01:46:39,244
There you have it.

1492
01:46:42,751 --> 01:46:45,117
I'm still with you, my sisters.

1493
01:46:45,321 --> 01:46:47,687
My troubled sisters.

1494
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:50,490
I still got problems too.

1495
01:46:50,693 --> 01:46:52,923
You're not alone.

1496
01:46:55,331 --> 01:46:57,060
He's slow.

1497
01:46:57,266 --> 01:46:59,826
Elevator don't go
all the way up there.

1498
01:47:00,035 --> 01:47:03,027
The lights is on at the mall--
Oh, no, no.

1499
01:47:03,238 --> 01:47:06,173
The mall is open
but ain't nobody shopping.

1500
01:47:07,242 --> 01:47:08,402
You ain't gonna eat?

1501
01:47:08,611 --> 01:47:11,273
You gotta learn how to talk
in the real world.

1502
01:47:12,047 --> 01:47:13,878
When people ask if you slow,
you say:

1503
01:47:14,083 --> 01:47:17,280
"Do you ride the big bus
or the little bus?"

1504
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,885
-Don't know what I'm talking about?
-No.

1505
01:47:20,089 --> 01:47:22,114
Okay, fine, yeah.

1506
01:47:22,658 --> 01:47:25,491
I believe
you're on the little bus too.

1507
01:47:26,095 --> 01:47:27,619
Go ahead, boy. You funny.

1508
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:29,627
You the next....

1509
01:47:29,832 --> 01:47:33,029
Who that? Tyler Perry!
You the next Tyler Perry, man.

1510
01:47:33,235 --> 01:47:35,362
I'm telling you, you funny.

1511
01:47:35,571 --> 01:47:37,903
I love that Madea.

1512
01:47:40,009 --> 01:47:44,537
He's slow. The mall's open
but ain't nobody shopping.

1513
01:47:45,114 --> 01:47:46,604
What are you talking about?

1514
01:47:46,815 --> 01:47:50,251
The elevator don't go
all the way up to the top floor.

1515
01:47:52,521 --> 01:47:55,649
The car is running
but ain't no engine.

1516
01:47:55,858 --> 01:47:57,257
Are you okay?

1517
01:47:57,459 --> 01:47:58,653
I'm-- No, hell, I'm fine.

1518
01:47:58,861 --> 01:48:00,328
Is he okay? I'm just trying to--

1519
01:48:00,529 --> 01:48:03,362
Boy, maybe you're a little slow too.

1520
01:48:03,565 --> 01:48:07,399
Maybe your book
ain't got no pages in the middle.

1521
01:48:08,003 --> 01:48:10,972
Your grandma went to work for
four days and ain't ever come back?

1522
01:48:11,173 --> 01:48:14,631
-Yeah.
-I know what she do for a living.

1523
01:48:15,711 --> 01:48:17,008
What?

1524
01:48:17,212 --> 01:48:21,444
Well, I'll tell you
when you get a little older.

1525
01:48:21,817 --> 01:48:25,514
There's a reason women disappear
for four days and come back.

1526
01:48:32,061 --> 01:48:35,827
The looks he give me are priceless.
Okay, keep going.

1527
01:48:36,031 --> 01:48:37,020
Shut your mouth.

1528
01:48:37,232 --> 01:48:39,166
-She never, never came back?
-Yup.

1529
01:48:39,368 --> 01:48:41,734
I wouldn't have come back either
trying to feed him.

1530
01:48:41,937 --> 01:48:43,336
I hate you.

1531
01:48:43,539 --> 01:48:46,667
Manny, eat your food and shut up.

1532
01:48:46,875 --> 01:48:50,675
Yeah, you better eat it, because
I'm getting ready to choke you out.

1533
01:48:54,283 --> 01:48:56,717
Yeah, they can talk to me.
Where's your mama?

1534
01:48:56,919 --> 01:48:58,853
Say something else to me.

1535
01:48:59,054 --> 01:49:01,454
I dare you to say something to me.

1536
01:49:01,657 --> 01:49:03,318
Say one more-- Say one more thing.

1537
01:49:03,525 --> 01:49:05,288
I dare you, I dare you.

1538
01:49:05,494 --> 01:49:07,121
Ugly.

1539
01:49:08,163 --> 01:49:10,358
Leave him alone.

1540
01:49:10,566 --> 01:49:11,999
Eat.

1541
01:49:13,469 --> 01:49:15,801
What you laughing at, Freddie?

1542
01:49:16,405 --> 01:49:17,736
They're lying.

1543
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:20,135
I can still hear you, you know.

1544
01:49:20,809 --> 01:49:24,267
Mabel, I'm gonna beat him down.

1545
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,538
Will you shut up?

1546
01:49:25,748 --> 01:49:28,182
-Who the hell you talking to?
-Get your hands off me.

1547
01:49:28,383 --> 01:49:30,146
-Back up.
-Who the hell you talking to?

1548
01:49:30,352 --> 01:49:31,649
-On mark.
-Stop laughing.

1549
01:49:31,854 --> 01:49:34,220
Turn right here.
The camera's rolling.

1550
01:49:36,058 --> 01:49:38,083
Get out the way, crackhead.

1551
01:49:39,328 --> 01:49:43,424
-I can't work like this.
-That'll be cut, we're good.

1552
01:49:44,933 --> 01:49:46,696
Maybe she was hungry.

1553
01:49:46,902 --> 01:49:49,268
Hungry, April?
I mean, is that a reason to steal?

1554
01:49:49,471 --> 01:49:50,460
No.

1555
01:49:50,672 --> 01:49:54,005
Even more,
she was caught stealing needles.

1556
01:49:55,644 --> 01:49:58,204
Wow, did you hear my stomach?

1557
01:49:59,047 --> 01:50:03,609
Yeah, you don't feed me around here.
I'm hungry!

1558
01:50:03,819 --> 01:50:06,549
Here we go. Go one more time.

1559
01:50:06,755 --> 01:50:09,087
You touch us again,
I'm gonna call 911 this time.

1560
01:50:09,291 --> 01:50:11,350
You call 911, honey.
They don't scare me.

1561
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:13,255
I call 911. I will call them for you.

1562
01:50:13,462 --> 01:50:16,431
I will ask them over here.
I won't ask them to send the police...

1563
01:50:16,632 --> 01:50:21,001
...or Child Welfare. I will ask them
to straight up send a ambulance.

1564
01:50:23,772 --> 01:50:26,798
Cough again. Cough one more time.

1565
01:50:28,644 --> 01:50:30,475
Hell, I'm trying to learn these lines...

1566
01:50:30,679 --> 01:50:32,772
...but she over there
coughing off-camera.

1567
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:35,882
And I'm trying to do a scene.
What the hell I'm supposed to do?

1568
01:50:36,084 --> 01:50:38,518
Come here.
Come here, bring me the book now.

1569
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,518
Bring me the book.
I need to see where the hell I am.

1570
01:50:41,723 --> 01:50:43,486
Come here.

1571
01:50:43,692 --> 01:50:45,785
Now, give me the lines.

1572
01:50:47,963 --> 01:50:51,296
"But when I shove it down your throat,"
would that be a good one?

1573
01:50:51,567 --> 01:50:53,626
Say it like I say it.

1574
01:50:53,836 --> 01:50:58,170
-But when I shove it down your throat.
-Okay, now settle down.

1575
01:51:01,109 --> 01:51:03,577
When I shove it down your throat....

1576
01:51:04,613 --> 01:51:07,138
There's a letter in here for you.

1577
01:51:07,349 --> 01:51:09,374
From Mama Rose.

1578
01:51:10,953 --> 01:51:12,318
To me?

1579
01:51:13,055 --> 01:51:14,647
-You wanna read it?
-No.

1580
01:51:16,091 --> 01:51:17,558
-No, you read it.
-Me?

1581
01:51:17,759 --> 01:51:19,056
Yeah.

1582
01:51:22,698 --> 01:51:24,666
"Dear April.

1583
01:51:25,767 --> 01:51:30,431
If you're reading this,
I'm probably past my suffering.

1584
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:34,835
April, my dearest child...

1585
01:51:35,043 --> 01:51:39,070
...you are beautiful,
bright and brilliant.

1586
01:51:40,082 --> 01:51:43,415
If you're ever nominated
for an Academy Award...

1587
01:51:43,619 --> 01:51:45,849
...be humble about it.

1588
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:50,448
Remember the people
that helped you along the way.

1589
01:51:50,659 --> 01:51:55,426
Props, Hair, Makeup, Wardrobe...

1590
01:51:55,631 --> 01:52:00,500
...Grips, Electricians,
Camera, Sound...

1591
01:52:00,702 --> 01:52:03,034
...script and most of all
Mr. Tyler Perry."

1592
01:52:03,238 --> 01:52:05,536
I knew that one was coming.
I knew that was coming.

1593
01:52:05,741 --> 01:52:08,301
"And, April, if you're ever walking
from your trailer...

1594
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:10,137
...and you see an airplane, duck."

1595
01:52:10,345 --> 01:52:12,575
Duck. Yeah.

1596
01:52:12,781 --> 01:52:14,874
"Love, Mama Rose."

1597
01:52:16,351 --> 01:52:18,615
You know what?
Everybody just get out of here.

1598
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:20,412
Good night.

1599
01:52:24,325 --> 01:52:28,662
