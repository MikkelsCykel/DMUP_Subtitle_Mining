00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:14,128
 There is a happy land

2
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:17,453
 Far, far away

3
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:20,528
 Where saints in glory stand

4
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:23,765
 Bright, bright as day

5
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,084
 Oh, how they sweetly sing

6
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,464
 Worthy is our Saviour King

7
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:33,769
 Loud let His praises ring

8
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:37,040
 Praise, praise for aye

9
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:47,369
 Come to that happy land

10
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:50,654
 Come, come away

11
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,209
 Why will you doubting stand?

12
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:57,654
 Why still delay?

13
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,774
 Oh, we shall happy be

14
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:04,290
 When from sin and sorrow free

15
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,770
 Lord, we shall live with Thee

16
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:11,001
 Blest, blest for aye

17
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,690
 Bright, in that happy land

18
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,055
 Beams every eye

19
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,530
 Kept by a Father's hand

20
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,055
 Love cannot die

21
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,295
 Oh, then to glory run

22
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,911
 Be a crown and kingdom won

23
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:42,491
 And, bright, above the sun

24
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:46,166
 We reign for aye. 

25
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,611
Where's my gun? Fuckin' hell.

26
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:02,491
Fuck. Fuckin' bastards. Fuckin'...

27
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:07,671
Come on, you fuck... Argh! Argh!

28
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,771
Mikey, get down. Christ!

29
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,204
Mikey!

30
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:19,697
I'm hit, Charlie. I'm hit.

31
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,252
You'll be alright, Mikey. Hold strong.

32
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:30,325
You'll never take me alive,
you bastards.

33
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,730
Argh!

34
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:41,412
Ugh!

35
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,513
Do I need to introduce myself?

36
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,813
I know who you are.

37
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,018
Good.

38
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,293
I know who you are.

39
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:19,893
My brother's taken a bullet, Stanley,
and is in need of medical attention.

40
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:23,170
Well, allow me to address
the subject of your brother, Mr Burns.

41
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:29,532
Christmas, as you're probably aware,
is fast approaching.

42
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:33,574
And Christmas this year
will hold a unique significance

43
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,814
for young Micky here.

44
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,611
Mikey.

45
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:41,219
Because on Christmas Day,

46
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:44,734
I have made plans
that he be taken from the jail in Banyon

47
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,654
and hanged by the neck until he is dead.

48
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,419
Charlie.

49
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,573
You're a copper, Stanley,
not a judge and jury.

50
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:54,692
Well, clearly, Mr Burns,
I am what I wish to be.

51
00:04:58,255 --> 00:04:59,735
So what is it that you want?

52
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,248
I want Arthur Burns.

53
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,095
I no longer ride with my brother.

54
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,495
Arggh!

55
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,850
Now, I will allow you
a moment to think about it.

56
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,696
What's happening, Charlie?

57
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:39,216
It's alright, Mikey.

58
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:42,289
It's alright.

59
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,049
Australia.

60
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,412
What fresh hell is this?

61
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:03,975
I have kept company
with bad men all my life.

62
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,817
I was 22 years
in Her Majesty's land forces.

63
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,770
I've dealt with your type many times.

64
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,689
Touch my brother again and I'll kill you.

65
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,622
Make no mistakes, Mr Burns.

66
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:26,135
It will be done.
I will civilise this place.

67
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,613
What the fuck
are you talking about, Stanley?

68
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:35,397
Listen to me now, Charlie.

69
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:36,902
Don't speak.

70
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,977
Hush, Mikey. You'll be fine.

71
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,418
Hush.

72
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,647
I wish to present you with a proposition.

73
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,574
I know where Arthur Burns is.

74
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:03,614
It is a godforsaken place.

75
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,498
The blacks won't go there,
nor the trackers.

76
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,329
Not even my own men.

77
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,810
I suppose, in time,
the bounty hunters will get him.

78
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,159
But I have other plans.

79
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,179
I aim to bring him down.

80
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,624
I aim to show

81
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:30,659
that he is a man like any other.

82
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,464
I aim to hurt him.

83
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,967
When you're ready, sir.

84
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,095
And what will most hurt him?

85
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,464
Hmm.

86
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:46,571
Well, I've thought
long and hard about that.

87
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,864
And I have realised, Mr Burns,

88
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:54,779
that I must become
a little more inventive in my methods.

89
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,940
Now, don't speak, Mr Burns.
Listen to me now.

90
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,896
Don't say a word.

91
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,905
Now, suppose I told you there was a way

92
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,296
to save your little brother
Mikey from the noose.

93
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,457
Suppose I gave you a horse... and a gun.

94
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,025
Suppose, Mr Burns,

95
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,181
I was to give both you
and your young brother, Mikey, here,

96
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,137
a pardon.

97
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:33,901
Suppose I said that I could give you

98
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:36,826
the chance to expunge the guilt...

99
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:39,375
...beneath which you so clearly labour.

100
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,577
Suppose I gave you till Christmas.

101
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:48,421
Now, suppose you tell me
what it is I want from you.

102
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:49,866
Hmm?

103
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:51,573
You want me to kill my brother.

104
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:54,418
I want you to kill your brother.

105
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:02,742
Arthur Burns is a monster.

106
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:06,027
An abomination.

107
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,611
 La, la, la. 

108
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:14,222
You were right
to part company with him

109
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,178
and to take Mikey with you.

110
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:21,022
What happened at the Hopkins place
was unforgivable.

111
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:23,987
 La, la, la. 

112
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,987
I have never seen
such a sickening sight.

113
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:29,262
Did you know that
that poor woman, Eliza Hopkins,

114
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:31,218
had a child in her belly?

115
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:28,984
Your business
with your brother is unfinished.

116
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,975
You have nine days, Mr Burns.

117
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:42,789
Bring the horses round.

118
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:46,818
Coming now.
Come on. Get that on now.

119
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,821
It's the fucking Burns boy.

120
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:16,618
Come on. Let's hit 'em.

121
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:19,254
Got 'em.

122
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,336
I fucking got him!

123
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,911
Pigs.

124
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,777
Who have you got?

125
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:44,218
Troopers... dismount!

126
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,866
The man I have brought in...

127
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,800
...is Mike Burns...

128
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:55,700
...of the Burns gang.

129
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:04,540
That's one down and two to go,
gentlemen.

130
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,227
You've got to
get the other ones now.

131
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:12,378
I will... civilise this land.

132
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:16,898
Make yourself at home, Mikey.

133
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:00,588
Good evening to you, Mrs Stanley.

134
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:02,021
Good evening, Mr Broussard.

135
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:15,827
He's not so fuckin'
dangerous now, is he?

136
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:33,661
Martha?

137
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,429
Good evening, gentlemen.

138
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,195
Evening, Mrs Stanley.

139
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,555
You should... really not come here.

140
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,583
Cannot a lady visit her husband
in his place of work?

141
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,755
You men...

142
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,223
...you wait outside.

143
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,870
We spoke about
why you shouldn't come here.

144
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,315
This is not appropriate...

145
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,421
Morris, you've been gone for three days.

146
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:21,101
It's Ionely up there at the house.

147
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,211
It's so quiet without you.

148
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:25,996
Are you coming home now?

149
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,465
Well, I have things to attend to.

150
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,231
I'll have Officer Dunn escort you home.

151
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:34,956
I'll be back soon.

152
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,911
You look terrible, Morris.

153
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,344
Yes.

154
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,109
Yes, I do.

155
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,636
Dunn.

156
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,310
Who is that?

157
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:53,797
But he's no more than a boy.

158
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:56,632
He's man enough, ma'am.
He's man enough, indeed.

159
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,509
Enough.

160
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:08,632
Escort Mrs Stanley home
and wait there till I return.

161
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,472
How long will you be, dear?

162
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,905
Later.

163
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,032
Never speak to my wife
about such things again.

164
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,798
Do you understand?
My apologies, Captain.

165
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,233
What happened today on the flats,
that's between you and me.

166
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:30,958
Of course, sir.

167
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:33,553
Because there would be consequences
were it to become common knowledge.

168
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:35,623
Yes.

169
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:31,514
Eliza Hopkins
was a good Christian woman,

170
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:33,279
and she was my friend.

171
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:36,715
I pray to God that her death
was mercifully swift.

172
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,840
It was, wasn't it?

173
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,868
Martha, can we speak of other things?

174
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:46,430
Come here, Captain Stanley.

175
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,588
Mmm.

176
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:10,834
My poor husband.

177
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:22,553
Oh.

178
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,952
The world you live in in there.

179
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:39,992
Don't be gloomy, dear.

180
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:44,828
This burden you carry...

181
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:48,672
...you might let me carry it too.

182
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,517
I believe in you.

183
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:13,266
Stay down. Stay in bed.

184
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:32,158
What in God's name...?

185
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:34,043
Christ, sir...

186
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,875
...I've shot my bloody toes off.

187
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,998
There's nothing to see here, Martha.
Go back to bed.

188
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,670
Officer Dunn has shot his t...

189
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:50,714
Martha, go back inside.

190
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:08,157
 "When?" said the moon
to the stars in the sky

191
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,829
 "Soon," said the wind
that followed him home

192
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,834
 "Who?" said the cloud
that started to cry

193
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,553
 "Me," said the rider, as dry as a bone

194
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,392
 "How?" said the sun
that melted the ground

195
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,957
 "Why?" said the river
that refused to run

196
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:41,315
 "Where?" said the thunder
without a sound

197
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,556
 "Here," said the rider,
and took up his gun. 

198
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,432
Bloody flies.

199
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,000
Kill one and a dozen more
turn up to his funeral.

200
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,766
Ha!

201
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:06,446
 Oh, Danny Boy

202
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:10,201
 The flies, the flies are crawl... 

203
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:17,521
Oh, a thousand pardons, my dear man.

204
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:21,006
It appears that I am a little scuppered.

205
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:25,241
Oh, no need for that, sir.
No need for that.

206
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:27,311
We are white men, you and I.

207
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,281
Permit me to introduce myself.

208
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:34,126
My name is Jellon Lamb.

209
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,361
Citizen of the world, you might say.

210
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:37,926
An adventurer.

211
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:43,514
And, if I may be so bold,
a man of no little education.

212
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,767
And you, sir?

213
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:51,000
By what name
am I honoured to address thee?

214
00:20:54,562 --> 00:20:58,521
Of course, a... mere detail.

215
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:02,078
Mere detail.

216
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:06,647
Forgive me, sir, but I've been stuck here

217
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,322
with no-one but this sorry sack
of Hibernian pig shit for conversation.

218
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:14,636
Poor, poor Dan O'Reilly.

219
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:17,914
Sit, sir. Drink with me.

220
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:23,723
One more crack about the Irish,
Mr Lamb, and I'll shoot you.

221
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,168
Am I clear?

222
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:27,383
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.

223
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:29,528
Let us drink, then, to the Irish.

224
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:33,761
No finer race of men
have ever... peeled a potato.

225
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,803
Do you pray, Mr Lamb?
Good Lord, son.

226
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,608
No, I do not.

227
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:42,648
I was, in days gone by, a believer.

228
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:47,083
But, alas, I came
to this beleaguered land

229
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:49,040
and the God in me just...

230
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,249
...evaporated.

231
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:55,421
Let us change our toast, sir.

232
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:58,558
To the God who has forgotten us.

233
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,369
But first...

234
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:05,889
...cardinal rule.

235
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:11,396
Never raise a glass with a man
whose name you do not know.

236
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:15,883
My name is Charles Murphy.

237
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:31,210
Charles, eh?

238
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:32,690
Perhaps you've read

239
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,565
'On The Origin Of The Species
By Means Of Natural Selection'

240
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,370
by Charles Darwin.

241
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:38,970
Oh, don't be thrown by the title.

242
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:43,085
He had some most fascinating
things to say.

243
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,770
Chilling things.

244
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:50,525
Mr Darwin spent time
studying Aboriginals.

245
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,725
He claims we are, at bottom,

246
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,766
one and the same.

247
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:05,451
He infers, Mr Murphy,

248
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:10,446
that we share
a common ancestry with monkeys.

249
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:16,486
Monkeys!

250
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:25,891
Mr Murphy, Russia, China, the Congo.

251
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:29,726
Oh, I have travelled
among unknown people

252
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:32,286
in lands beyond the seas.

253
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,892
But nothing...

254
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:39,047
...nothing could have prepared me

255
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:42,422
for this godforsaken hole.

256
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:45,762
You see... Mr Murphy...

257
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:51,123
...I am something of a fortune hunter.

258
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:58,145
And what fortune do you hunt
out here, Mr Lamb?

259
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,683
That would be my question
to you, Mr Murphy.

260
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,646
Unhand me, Murphy, or I'll slit
your fucking throat.

261
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,357
We are white men, sir.

262
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,558
Not beasts.

263
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,333
Ah!

264
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:44,999
He sits up there
in those melancholy hills.

265
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:50,529
Some say he sleeps in caves
like a beast.

266
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:54,546
Slumbers deep like the kraken.

267
00:24:54,581 --> 00:24:57,995
The blacks say that he's a spirit.

268
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,374
The troopers will never catch him.

269
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:05,294
Common force
is meaningless, Mr Murphy,

270
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:10,642
as he squats up there
on his impregnable perch.

271
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:17,320
So I wait, Mr Murphy.

272
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,726
I wait... Arggh!

273
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,295
Aye, you wait.

274
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,286
You wait here, bounty hunter.

275
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,369
Hang him, sir.
Hang him high, sir.

276
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:04,287
Hail the conquering hero.

277
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:20,441
What a vile specimen of humanity.

278
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:25,003
What a little piece of filth.

279
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,972
Not really the one that
we're looking for, though, is it, Captain?

280
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:31,172
In the end, justice will be done.

281
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,497
Mm. Justice.

282
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:36,888
Save your little wisdoms
for the mob, Stanley.

283
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:41,252
Has he told you where his brothers are?

284
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:43,377
With due respects, Mr Fletcher,

285
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:45,412
perhaps it would be wise
to allow police work

286
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:46,970
to be done by policemen.

287
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:49,525
Hmm.

288
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,448
What a little piece of filth.

289
00:26:58,172 --> 00:27:01,268
Still, better than nothing, I suppose.

290
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:04,366
Good evening, Captain.
Good evening.

291
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:14,365
"When?"
Said the moon to the stars in the sky.

292
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:19,322
"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home.

293
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:24,969
"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry.

294
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,853
"Him," said the rider, dry as a bone.

295
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:44,173
Me roses are looking lovely.

296
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,092
I got green thumbs, I 'ave.

297
00:27:47,814 --> 00:27:49,486
I was just
thinking about England.

298
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:54,409
Do you not miss it, Martha?

299
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:57,174
There's much to miss.

300
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,768
There and here.

301
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,206
Let's get rid of that headache.

302
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:10,939
Now... Captain Stanley,

303
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:14,335
eat your breakfast before the flies do.

304
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:22,540
Made by
me own fair 'ands, them eggs.

305
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,735
Me eggs
have never tasted so fine, ma'am.

306
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:28,740
You're a good man, Morris.

307
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:31,575
And you're a good woman, Martha.

308
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,575
Do we have company?

309
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,295
Yes, I'm afraid we do.

310
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:46,168
Captain!

311
00:28:57,576 --> 00:29:00,010
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, sir.

312
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,141
Martha, would you excuse us?

313
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,416
It's fine, Morris.
No, Martha, please.

314
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:08,247
This is police business.

315
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:19,296
How dare you come
to my house in that state?

316
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:22,022
Sir.
What exactly do you want?

317
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:24,222
We just got back from
the Arooka Ranges, sir.

318
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:26,817
We rounded up six rebel blacks, sir.
Sean killed one.

319
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,377
Thought you'd want to know
about it straightaway.

320
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,697
Captain?

321
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:39,405
Captain?

322
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:46,297
No, leave the door open.
It's rank in here.

323
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:47,730
Yes, sir.

324
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:52,257
Are you sure you've put enough iron
on these men, Sergeant?

325
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,094
They have been
adequately secured, sir.

326
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:57,863
Jacko, get over here.
Yes, Captain, sir.

327
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:01,498
Ask them how long they've been
hiding up in the ranges.

328
00:30:04,978 --> 00:30:06,570
He says they very tired.

329
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:10,703
Well, you'll have a nice long rest

330
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:14,258
if you don't open your fuckin' mouths
and start yapping, you black bastards.

331
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:15,452
Sergeant.

332
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,423
Wait outside.

333
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,263
Wait outside the door.

334
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:22,254
I'll call you if and when I need you.

335
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,704
Ask them again

336
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:37,970
how long they've been
hiding up in the ranges.

337
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,979
Captain, sir, he said
they don't hide in the ranges,

338
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,424
they live in the ranges.

339
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:52,398
Then ask him how long
they have lived in the ranges.

340
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,337
Them always been living
in the ranges, Captain, sir.

341
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,339
Ask him if they've seen
a white man up there.

342
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:03,694
Yes, Captain, sir. I'll ask them.
Mm.

343
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,660
They seen white man.
White man catches them.

344
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:19,425
Jesus Christ.

345
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,973
I don't mean the police.

346
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,178
This... this man.

347
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,020
This man. A man with this man.

348
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,453
A white man.

349
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
This man. This man.

350
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,380
Ask him.

351
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:43,941
Fella in the picture...

352
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:46,101
...he live in a cave.

353
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:47,638
Dog man.

354
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,106
Big fella.

355
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:53,821
He said dog man never sleep.
He sit there all day.

356
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,386
Sit down in a cave. Way up.

357
00:31:57,421 --> 00:32:00,731
He live with small fella...
and black fella.

358
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,501
Cannot catch him. Cannot kill him.

359
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:06,626
He's dog.

360
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:09,146
What, he eats dog?

361
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:11,461
No, Captain, sir. He is dog.

362
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,458
He changed to dog.

363
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,387
He grows hair.

364
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:17,907
He grow teeth. Sharp.

365
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:20,422
And he grows a tail, this way.

366
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:21,867
Long.

367
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:25,222
And he stand with two leg, like this.

368
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:28,222
And he goes...

369
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:34,400
Sergeant.

370
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:36,378
Sergeant!

371
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:43,092
"When?"
Said the moon to the stars in the sky.

372
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:48,412
"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home.

373
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:54,221
"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry.

374
00:32:56,823 --> 00:33:00,228
"Me," said the rider, dry as a bone.

375
00:33:00,263 --> 00:33:04,336
"How?" said the sun
that melted the ground.

376
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:11,693
"Why?" said the river that refused to run.

377
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:16,101
"Where?" said the thunder
without a sound.

378
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,261
"Here," said the rider,
and took up his gun.

379
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:37,629
The captain is weak, a weak man.

380
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:41,464
Oh, so you reckon he's weak,
eh, Lawrence?

381
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,909
Fuck off, Cox.

382
00:33:42,944 --> 00:33:44,544
Come out here
to sort out the niggers.

383
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:46,309
Fuck me, he's done nothing.

384
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:49,144
These black bastards,
they're running all over us.

385
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:51,561
They chose
the wrong man for the job.

386
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,944
This isn't London. It's not England.

387
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,424
This is fuckin' Australia.

388
00:33:56,904 --> 00:34:00,430
Did I say I wanted to fuck
the captain's wife?

389
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:02,865
Will you go back to sleep, Paul?
For gawd's sake.

390
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,430
I would like to fuck his wife.

391
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:07,665
If I was married to that bucket
of pig's tripe you call a fuckin' wife,

392
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,145
I'd want to fuck her too.

393
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,190
"I want to fuck his wife."

394
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:13,790
I want to fuck his wife.

395
00:34:13,825 --> 00:34:15,425
I could fuck her so...
Yeah, alright.

396
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,585
We all want to fuck Mrs Stanley.

397
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:22,977
She certainly isn't getting anything
from the good captain, is she?

398
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:26,590
You know why?

399
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,058
Ah, because he's weak.

400
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:32,325
He's got other things on his mind.

401
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,146
Because he really fucked up this time.

402
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,871
He got the boy, yeah.

403
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:39,026
He let the other one go.

404
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:40,459
Eh?

405
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:40,942
Fix him right up.

406
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:43,634
Got him good...

407
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,829
Got him good medicine.
Fix him no time good.

408
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:48,709
Gonna need sleep. Gonna need rest.

409
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:54,670
Don't cry, Daddy.
Blood all gone. Good and clean.

410
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:57,059
Gonna need sleep.
Gonna need rest.

411
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:54,545
Good afternoon, Mr Broussard.

412
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:58,073
Remember to save a turkey for me.

413
00:38:58,108 --> 00:38:59,909
Of course, Mrs Stanley.

414
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:01,711
Is everything alright?

415
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:08,768
Go home, you stupid cow.

416
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:10,583
I'm sorry. What did you say?

417
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:16,273
Mrs Stanley... perhaps
you'd better ask your husband.

418
00:39:20,514 --> 00:39:22,354
Oh.

419
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,829
Shut up, dog.

420
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:43,279
Holy mother of mercy.

421
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,959
Look who's raised himself
from the dead.

422
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:47,914
Him much better now.
Him much better because I fixed him.

423
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:49,348
He don't look better to me.

424
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:53,115
You know, Samuel, the thing
I relished the most while I was away

425
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,080
was not having to see
your fuckin' face all the time.

426
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:58,915
If it weren't for me and my crack
shooting, you'd be fuckin' dingo dinner.

427
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,680
30 yards away, I was, and...

428
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:04,475
Blew that black bastard's head right off.

429
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,040
It was beautiful.

430
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:10,075
<i>Show a bit of respect
or I might just have to shoot you...</i>

431
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,747
...with my new Winchester.

432
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:16,313
Fuck! That hurt!

433
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,717
Aw, Charlie.
Go easy there.

434
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:20,150
It's alright, Charlie.

435
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:25,891
Do you want to know
why I've come back?

436
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:28,146
I know why you've come back, Charlie.

437
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,230
Look at that.

438
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,838
Be humble of heart, Charlie.
This is the end of things.

439
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,518
You're my brother, Charlie.

440
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:42,951
You belong with me.

441
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,198
We are a family.

442
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:47,995
All of us.

443
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:50,518
Yeah, I was just getting reacquainted.

444
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:52,523
Samuel.

445
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:56,398
Oh, be kind. A little tolerance, Charlie.

446
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:57,843
Samuel's a boy.

447
00:41:57,878 --> 00:41:59,358
He's a vicious little cretin.

448
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:13,924
Where's Mikey, Charlie?

449
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:16,044
Mikey stayed behind in Clarence.

450
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,434
You left Mikey alone?
He met a girl.

451
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,284
Mikey met a girl?
Aye.

452
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:25,674
Mikey met a girl.

453
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,719
What's her name, Charlie?
Molly.

454
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,484
Molly.

455
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,435
Molly O'Boyle.

456
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,352
Molly O'Boyle.

457
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,040
A red-headed colleen, no doubt.

458
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:46,805
Aye. Red.

459
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,717
Like the sunset.

460
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,193
Like the sunset.

461
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,360
What does she do,
this... Molly O'Boyle?

462
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,765
I'm feeling a bit tired right now, Arthur.

463
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,280
Is she a farmer's daughter?
Can she cook a good lamb stew?

464
00:43:16,315 --> 00:43:17,714
Would you stop it?

465
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:29,766
Mikey's not
the same stuff as us.

466
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:32,156
We'll be flung to the depths, you and I.

467
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,840
He worships you, you know.

468
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:38,517
There was a time
we both did.

469
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:50,806
Mikey deserves better.

470
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:53,595
You were right to leave -
take him with you.

471
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:57,567
I need to rest.

472
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,927
Mary O'Boyle.

473
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:02,207
Molly, Arthur. Molly.

474
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:05,234
Molly. Molly. Right. Molly.

475
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:35,757
Mikey, Mikey.

476
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:39,115
 On the fifth day
of Christmas

477
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:42,403
 My true love gave to me

478
00:44:42,438 --> 00:44:45,700
 Five cats a-flogging

479
00:44:45,735 --> 00:44:49,269
 Four nooses swinging

480
00:44:49,304 --> 00:44:52,933
 Three crows a-pecking

481
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:56,145
 Two dogs a-pissing

482
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,288
 And little Mikey

483
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:02,764
 Hanging from a pear tree. 

484
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,280
Only five more days to go, Mikey.

485
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:19,635
Martha.

486
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:22,877
Martha.

487
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,689
When Sergeant Lawrence said...

488
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:32,002
...that the boy that you are holding
at the lock-up was man enough...

489
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:34,929
...what did he mean by that?

490
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:39,005
Sergeant Lawrence is an ignorant thug
with the moral fortitude of a snake.

491
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,525
Just disregard...
What did he mean?

492
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,450
What did the boy do?

493
00:45:43,485 --> 00:45:44,930
He's a member of the Burns gang.

494
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:46,965
There are certain things
a woman should not be privy...

495
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,682
I know that. I asked you a question.

496
00:45:48,717 --> 00:45:50,361
I asked you not to visit me at work.

497
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:52,005
Tell me what he did to Eliza.
Enough.

498
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,758
She was my friend!
Enough!

499
00:45:56,925 --> 00:45:58,563
That's enough.

500
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,639
Headache, Captain Stanley?

501
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:14,803
So, what can I do for you, Mr Fletcher?

502
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:25,766
Word has it that your men captured
half a dozen rebel blacks two days ago,

503
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,722
and that one was shot in the process.

504
00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:32,322
Do you have a problem with that?

505
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:35,291
Yes, Captain, I do.

506
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,686
Word came this morning
from Eight Mile Creek

507
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:40,246
that Dan O'Reilly's place was attacked.

508
00:46:40,281 --> 00:46:41,731
Are you sure it was blacks?

509
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,731
Dan O'Reilly had so many spears in him

510
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:47,396
that he resembled your good old
garden variety English hedgehog.

511
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:50,412
It's simple, Captain.

512
00:46:50,447 --> 00:46:53,052
It's called the law of reciprocity.

513
00:46:53,087 --> 00:46:57,047
Kill one of them and they're
going to kill one of ours.

514
00:46:57,082 --> 00:47:01,727
Do the job I brought you
here to do, hmm?

515
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:03,852
If you have to kill one,

516
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,082
make sure you bloody well kill them all.

517
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,123
Well, I'll send some troopers out today.

518
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:16,683
Well, is our business here finished?

519
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:20,047
I'm going to have Mike Burns flogged.

520
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:22,048
What?
100 lashes.

521
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:28,588
Martha.

522
00:47:28,623 --> 00:47:30,173
Thank you.

523
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,483
I thought you gentlemen
might like a little tea.

524
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:34,961
Please, sit down.

525
00:47:37,128 --> 00:47:39,562
Thank you, Martha.
That would be lovely.

526
00:47:42,968 --> 00:47:44,401
Thank you, Martha.

527
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:03,323
Is there anything else I can get you?

528
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:05,557
No, thank you, Martha. This is lovely.

529
00:48:07,729 --> 00:48:11,085
Well, then, I'll leave
you two gentlemen alone.

530
00:48:24,649 --> 00:48:28,528
A clever and well-bred woman,
your wife.

531
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:32,360
You did well for yourself, Captain.

532
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,215
Word has it...

533
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,206
...that you had Charlie Burns.

534
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,409
And you let him go.

535
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:50,290
Word has it... that you offered him
some kind of deal.

536
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:52,246
Tell me this isn't so, Captain.

537
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,295
Word has it
that you promised

538
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,050
those animals who raped
Eliza Hopkins a pardon

539
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:00,735
if Charlie Burns
brought back his brother.

540
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:04,010
A pardon for the annihilation
of the Hopkins family.

541
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:06,936
Are you completely out of your mind?

542
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:09,656
Listen to me.
Mike Burns is a simpleton.

543
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:12,336
He spends all day in his cell,
crying like a child.

544
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:15,091
It is my belief that he is
not responsible for his actions.

545
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:18,131
I'm not interested in
your beliefs, Captain Stanley.

546
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,211
Who do you think you are?
The judge and jury?

547
00:49:20,246 --> 00:49:22,096
Arthur Burns must be stopped.

548
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:25,296
It is he who is responsible
for this outrage.

549
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:29,211
And I know that Charlie Burns
will stop at nothing

550
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:31,361
to protect his younger brother Mike.

551
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:35,571
So all we need do now is wait.

552
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,656
Wait?

553
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:40,216
My God, man. They raped a woman.

554
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:42,925
Tomorrow morning,
I want Mike Burns flogged.

555
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:48,657
As I said, 100 lashes.

556
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:50,812
This will kill him.
So be it.

557
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,057
But what if I'm right?

558
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:57,372
What if Charlie Burns does as I ask?
What if he comes back?

559
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:59,567
Then we will hang the lot of them.

560
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:05,088
Good day.

561
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:17,966
Martha.

562
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:21,218
Martha. Stay here.

563
00:50:21,253 --> 00:50:24,006
Do not let anyone in.
I shall return tomorrow.

564
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:28,173
Martha! Do you hear me?

565
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,891
Please. Stay here.

566
00:51:17,894 --> 00:51:19,327
What's going on in here?

567
00:51:22,854 --> 00:51:25,574
I believe Officer Davenport
and Officer Matthews

568
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:27,632
were entertaining the prisoner, sir.

569
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,620
Is that right, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.

570
00:51:29,655 --> 00:51:32,100
Well, I've got a job for you.
Yes, sir.

571
00:51:32,135 --> 00:51:34,015
You have unfinished business
in the Arooka Ranges.

572
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,020
Sir.
Rebel blacks, Sergeant.

573
00:51:36,055 --> 00:51:39,175
Within two hours,
you must find Jacko...

574
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:43,575
...and recruit some more troopers

575
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,008
and depart.

576
00:51:49,695 --> 00:51:52,448
You fucking snake.

577
00:51:53,535 --> 00:51:56,935
Why are you still standing there?

578
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,005
You've been dismissed.

579
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:10,446
Where's Charlie, Mr Stanley?

580
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:14,456
I don't know, son.

581
00:52:14,491 --> 00:52:15,889
I don't know.

582
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:27,729
Captain?

583
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:46,455
Captain?

584
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:02,974
Bring him out, Stanley!
Bring him out, Captain!

585
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:20,943
Michael Burns.

586
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:22,969
Let's see him, Stanley!

587
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,534
Give him to us, Stanley!

588
00:53:32,698 --> 00:53:34,957
Bring him out, Stanley.

589
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:37,217
Stand aside, Stanley.

590
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:39,931
We want justice.

591
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,144
I'll shoot...

592
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:52,459
...the first person
who lays hands on Mike Burns.

593
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:53,892
Give him to us.

594
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:01,329
He'll sort it.

595
00:54:03,379 --> 00:54:06,104
You heard me.

596
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:08,175
You move, I'll shoot you dead.

597
00:54:09,299 --> 00:54:12,496
Are you going to shoot
your wife as well, Captain?

598
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:18,344
Martha?

599
00:54:18,379 --> 00:54:21,898
She was with child, for God's sake.

600
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:25,417
Martha, if this flogging goes ahead...

601
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,340
...it will be our death sentence.

602
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,570
What if it had been me?

603
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,061
Come on,
you fuckin' nasty...

604
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,786
Captain Stanley?

605
00:54:56,821 --> 00:54:58,746
Help me!
Get up, Mikey!

606
00:54:58,781 --> 00:55:00,341
Get it over and bloody done with!

607
00:55:02,181 --> 00:55:04,541
Go on! Go on. Get up.
Stop it!

608
00:55:04,576 --> 00:55:06,866
Get off me!

609
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,506
Now stay still.

610
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,221
My good people...
Stay still!

611
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:15,946
...before you stands

612
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:19,221
one of the vilest,
most bloodthirsty villains

613
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:22,066
this country has ever seen.

614
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:23,666
Rapist.

615
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:26,586
Looter. Murderer.

616
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:28,861
His crimes are
of the most heinous kind.

617
00:55:29,982 --> 00:55:32,502
Before the year is out,
this man will hang.

618
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,222
Today, he will be flogged.

619
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:35,667
A message to all

620
00:55:35,702 --> 00:55:39,342
who would dare transgress
the laws of this land.

621
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,062
100 lashes.
Please.

622
00:55:41,097 --> 00:55:42,427
Proceed.

623
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:44,542
One!
Please!

624
00:55:44,577 --> 00:55:45,874
Arggh!

625
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,171
Two!

626
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,322
Three!

627
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:52,987
Please!

628
00:55:53,022 --> 00:55:54,617
Arggh!

629
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:59,697
 Oh, Peggy Gordon

630
00:55:59,742 --> 00:56:05,623
 You are my darling

631
00:56:05,658 --> 00:56:11,503
 Come sit you down

632
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:15,880
 Upon my knee

633
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:21,549
 And tell to me

634
00:56:21,584 --> 00:56:27,148
 The very reason

635
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:31,983
 Why I am slighted so

636
00:56:32,018 --> 00:56:35,788
 By thee

637
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:39,829
 I wish I was in

638
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:46,664
 Some Ionesome valley

639
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:51,541
 Where womankind

640
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:56,200
 Could not be found

641
00:56:56,235 --> 00:57:00,789
 And little birds

642
00:57:00,824 --> 00:57:05,624
 Sing up on the branches... 

643
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:11,304
 And every moment

644
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:15,622
 A different sound

645
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:19,870
 Oh, Peggy Gordon

646
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:25,105
 You are my darling... 

647
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:31,385
 Come sit you down

648
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,342
 Upon my knee

649
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:39,858
 And tell to me

650
00:57:39,893 --> 00:57:44,339
 The very reason

651
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:51,466
 Why I am slighted so

652
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,981
 By thee. 

653
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:08,380
He could shame a nightingale.

654
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:21,023
Thirty-eight.

655
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,344
Thirty-nine.

656
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:29,623
Go on.

657
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,624
Your days are over, Captain Stanley.

658
00:59:08,308 --> 00:59:10,908
 La, la, la. 

659
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:12,387
Martha.

660
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:15,101
Come on.

661
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:27,146
 La, la, la. 

662
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:59,116
Martha, you must eat.

663
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:01,107
Tobey's made you some soup.

664
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:17,264
Here you go.

665
01:01:21,432 --> 01:01:22,865
This is good.

666
01:01:32,712 --> 01:01:34,987
You must eat something,
Martha, please.

667
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:39,545
No.

668
01:01:43,352 --> 01:01:44,785
No.

669
01:01:56,273 --> 01:01:57,706
I'm so sorry.

670
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:01,598
Forgive me, please.

671
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,589
I just wanted to protect you.

672
01:02:05,673 --> 01:02:07,664
I had an idea about justice and...

673
01:02:09,353 --> 01:02:11,309
...for the town, for the country...

674
01:02:12,393 --> 01:02:13,826
...for you.

675
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:16,626
For you.

676
01:02:18,793 --> 01:02:20,226
And now...

677
01:02:22,633 --> 01:02:24,066
...I don't know.

678
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:27,352
Hey, quit pissing down my leg.

679
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:29,214
Well, find your own fuckin' tree.

680
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,034
What do you need a fuckin' tree for?

681
01:02:31,069 --> 01:02:32,639
Just piss out there, not on me.

682
01:02:32,674 --> 01:02:35,034
Fuck off. You pissed on me, you idiot.

683
01:02:35,069 --> 01:02:37,394
Strange mob... you whities.

684
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,434
Mm.

685
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:46,079
Good news.

686
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:47,547
Sergeant Laurie...

687
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:50,474
...over there.

688
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:52,051
What?

689
01:02:52,086 --> 01:02:53,940
Where?

690
01:02:53,975 --> 01:02:55,759
See it?

691
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:57,227
Hard to see it.

692
01:02:58,394 --> 01:02:59,919
At foot of the ranges.

693
01:02:59,954 --> 01:03:01,994
What? I can't see a bloody thing.

694
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:03,469
There.

695
01:03:03,504 --> 01:03:04,908
What?

696
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:09,308
Smoke.

697
01:03:26,115 --> 01:03:27,548
Love.

698
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:30,228
Love is the key.

699
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,993
Love and family.

700
01:03:37,435 --> 01:03:40,436
For what are night and day -

701
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:43,436
the sun, the moon, the stars -

702
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,869
without love...

703
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:48,392
...and those you love around you?

704
01:03:51,276 --> 01:03:54,616
What could be more hollow...

705
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:57,956
...than to die alone... unloved?

706
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:01,561
What the fuck was that?

707
01:04:01,596 --> 01:04:03,921
Fuckin' trooper's rifle... 450s.

708
01:04:03,956 --> 01:04:06,476
Shooting blacks.
Be calm, Samuel.

709
01:04:06,511 --> 01:04:08,546
The shots are miles away.

710
01:04:35,357 --> 01:04:38,677
 Thou shalt flourish

711
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:41,634
 Great and free

712
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,557
 The dread and envy

713
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:47,975
 Of them all

714
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:51,323
 Rule Britannia

715
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:55,398
 Britannia rules the waves

716
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:59,438
 Britain never, never, never

717
01:04:59,473 --> 01:05:05,035
 Will be slaves. 

718
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,804
Burn it.

719
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:35,478
Burn the fuckin' lot.

720
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,838
Don't stand there moping.

721
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:42,684
What are you doing?

722
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:45,358
Burn everything!

723
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:53,069
Molly O'Boyle, my arse.

724
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,230
Who the fuck left Danny Boy
out in the sun?

725
01:06:35,481 --> 01:06:38,046
Hey, Jacko, you lazy bugger.

726
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:40,881
I told you to bury that bastard last night.

727
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:44,081
He stinks worse than you.

728
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:45,514
Jacko.

729
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:51,401
You got the wrong fuckin' black man.

730
01:06:51,436 --> 01:06:52,846
Slowly now, Sergeant.

731
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:56,078
Put your privates back in your pants
and turn around.

732
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:03,281
Come to steal my brother a horse
and we find ourselves a copper.

733
01:07:03,316 --> 01:07:06,401
You fire that gun,
you'll have eight more all over you.

734
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:07,835
Fair enough.

735
01:07:12,522 --> 01:07:15,482
Step into the shade, Sergeant.

736
01:07:15,517 --> 01:07:17,712
To the back.

737
01:07:24,442 --> 01:07:26,562
Has... has Charlie found you, then?

738
01:07:26,597 --> 01:07:28,762
Stanley's little mate.

739
01:07:28,797 --> 01:07:30,195
Over there.

740
01:07:31,482 --> 01:07:32,927
By the straw.

741
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:34,527
Good boy.

742
01:07:34,562 --> 01:07:38,487
That's right.
Stay. Lay down, Sergeant.

743
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,362
Hey, hey. Whoa. Come here.
Lie down.

744
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:42,808
I know something you don't know.

745
01:07:42,843 --> 01:07:46,128
Hush now, Sergeant.
Whoa, whoa.

746
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:48,208
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
Hush.

747
01:07:48,243 --> 01:07:50,837
Your brother's come to kill you.

748
01:07:50,872 --> 01:07:53,432
I can help.
You can help me?

749
01:07:54,523 --> 01:07:56,643
Help... your... fuckin'... self.

750
01:07:56,678 --> 01:07:58,728
Steady. Come on.

751
01:07:58,763 --> 01:08:01,643
Help... your... fuckin'... self.

752
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:04,523
Help... your... fuckin'... self...

753
01:08:04,558 --> 01:08:06,718
... copper.

754
01:08:15,403 --> 01:08:17,360
Here's your knife back, you dog.

755
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:29,640
There's something
I want to tell you.

756
01:08:32,644 --> 01:08:35,841
I've been having a dream...
most nights.

757
01:08:36,884 --> 01:08:38,809
I've kept it from you.

758
01:08:38,844 --> 01:08:40,800
But I don't suppose it matters now.

759
01:08:42,724 --> 01:08:44,157
I'm in a room.

760
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:46,844
It's our bedroom, I think.

761
01:08:46,879 --> 01:08:48,729
And...

762
01:08:48,764 --> 01:08:50,641
...I'm searching for something.

763
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:56,565
And then suddenly...
I feel a presence in the room and...

764
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,920
...I stand up and I turn around...

765
01:09:00,325 --> 01:09:04,405
...and there in the doorway
is Eliza Hopkins.

766
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,570
And she looks frightful.

767
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:11,225
Her... her dress is all...
creased and torn...

768
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,810
...and covered in blood, and her face, too.

769
01:09:15,845 --> 01:09:18,805
All battered and bruised
and splashed with blood.

770
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,690
Martha...
But listen to this.

771
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:24,643
In her arms... she's holding something.

772
01:09:24,678 --> 01:09:27,562
I... I... I can't see what it is...

773
01:09:29,486 --> 01:09:31,795
...because it's covered by her hair.

774
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:35,436
And then she walks towards me.

775
01:09:36,886 --> 01:09:38,319
Very slowly.

776
01:09:40,766 --> 01:09:42,199
And...

777
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:46,115
...she hands me a tiny bundle.

778
01:09:49,126 --> 01:09:50,923
And I look down...

779
01:09:52,966 --> 01:09:55,719
...and I see that it's a baby.

780
01:09:57,406 --> 01:09:58,839
A newborn.

781
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:04,164
And this baby...
Oh, it's a beautiful baby, Morris.

782
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:09,812
And it... it opens its eyes.

783
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:13,647
And then... I feel a pressure on my hand

784
01:10:13,682 --> 01:10:15,572
and I look down and I see

785
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:19,023
that the baby has taken hold of my finger

786
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:22,439
and it's squeezing
it tight in its tiny fist.

787
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:29,363
Then I wake up.

788
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,908
But after I wake, it's...

789
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,173
...it's the strangest thing.

790
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:45,168
I can still feel...
I can still feel the pressure

791
01:10:45,203 --> 01:10:47,128
of that dream baby's hand

792
01:10:47,163 --> 01:10:49,164
on my finger.

793
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:55,159
What do you think of that?

794
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:10,849
That's the boy. Argh! Good boy.

795
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:15,602
Nice and tight, eh? Right.

796
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:18,959
Up we get.

797
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,854
Oh, no. I wouldn't try that if I were you.

798
01:11:22,889 --> 01:11:25,847
Ligatures and knots
are one of my many talents.

799
01:11:32,169 --> 01:11:34,729
And it appears
that you are singularly bereft

800
01:11:34,764 --> 01:11:37,849
in any talents whatsoever, Mr Burns.

801
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:43,027
To be speared by a savage.

802
01:11:43,062 --> 01:11:45,446
How extraordinarily quaint.

803
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:50,362
Easy, Mr Burns.

804
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,015
I was drunk.

805
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,135
You only got me because I was drunk.

806
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:00,799
Well, I'm not drunk now.
I'm on the job now.

807
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:04,335
Not a bad day's work either.

808
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:09,490
What is an Irishman...
but a nigger turned inside out?

809
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,135
Now...

810
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:14,210
We're going to sit down...
Charlie!

811
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:16,015
On this log.

812
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:18,910
Nice and easy, Mr Burns.

813
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:21,771
There.

814
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:41,611
I really should stop saving
your life, brother Charlie.

815
01:12:41,646 --> 01:12:43,727
Come on! Come on!

816
01:12:45,171 --> 01:12:46,616
All things considered.

817
01:12:46,651 --> 01:12:50,651
"There's night and day, brother.

818
01:12:50,686 --> 01:12:53,536
"Both sweet things.

819
01:12:53,571 --> 01:12:58,965
"Sun and moon and stars,
all sweet things.

820
01:13:00,892 --> 01:13:05,329
"Likewise... there's a wind on the heath.

821
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:09,977
"Life is very...

822
01:13:10,012 --> 01:13:12,651
"...sweet, brother..."

823
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:18,492
"Life is very sweet... brother.

824
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,972
"Who would wish to die?"

825
01:13:23,772 --> 01:13:25,410
George Borrow, I believe.

826
01:13:26,892 --> 01:13:28,737
A worthy writer.

827
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:31,173
And a beautiful sentiment, sir.

828
01:13:32,173 --> 01:13:34,129
But you're not my brother.

829
01:13:44,693 --> 01:13:46,604
Finish him.

830
01:13:47,733 --> 01:13:50,042
Oh, dear.

831
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:57,293
This may hurt.

832
01:13:57,328 --> 01:14:00,930
Arggh!

833
01:14:00,965 --> 01:14:04,533
Arggghhh!

834
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,254
Why can't you ever just...

835
01:14:26,289 --> 01:14:27,687
...stop me?

836
01:14:33,454 --> 01:14:35,524
They're hanging Mikey
come Christmas Day.

837
01:14:37,694 --> 01:14:39,474
When's Christmas, Charlie?

838
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,255
I have some riding to do.

839
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,768
Brother!

840
01:14:59,935 --> 01:15:01,380
Where did you get it?

841
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:03,275
I'm a very resourceful woman.

842
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,982
I never doubted it for a moment.

843
01:15:05,017 --> 01:15:06,655
Look real good, missus.

844
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:08,700
Thank you, Tobey.

845
01:15:08,735 --> 01:15:11,124
And...

846
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:23,689
And look.

847
01:15:30,296 --> 01:15:31,729
Snow.

848
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:48,692
Who is it?
Dr Bantrey.

849
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,856
Are you alone?
Yes.

850
01:15:59,657 --> 01:16:01,090
Then you may come in.

851
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:11,657
It doesn't look good, Morris.
The boy is dying.

852
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,888
Nothing I can... do.

853
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:21,342
Sure is pretty.
Ah!

854
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:23,262
You can never get your fill
of nature, Samuel.

855
01:16:23,297 --> 01:16:27,058
To be surrounded by it is to be stilled.
It... it salves the heart.

856
01:16:27,093 --> 01:16:31,218
The mountains, the trees,
the endless plains.

857
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,143
The moon, the myriad of stars.

858
01:16:33,178 --> 01:16:36,023
Every man can be made
quiet and complete.

859
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:39,538
Even the lowliest misanthrope
or the most wretched of sinners.

860
01:16:39,573 --> 01:16:42,263
What's a misanthrope, Arthur?

861
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:44,698
Some bugger who fuckin' hates
every other bugger.

862
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:46,778
Hey, I didn't ask you,
you black bastard.

863
01:16:46,813 --> 01:16:48,223
He's right, Samuel.

864
01:16:48,258 --> 01:16:50,089
A misanthrope
is one who hates humanity.

865
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:54,178
Is that what we are - misanthropes?

866
01:16:54,213 --> 01:16:56,692
Good Lord, no. We're a family.

867
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:22,536
 "Adieu," said the bird
in the branch of a tree

868
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:28,489
 "Farewell," said the snake
to the dying light

869
01:17:29,739 --> 01:17:33,857
 "Adieu," said the fish
in the river of sleep

870
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:39,578
 "Goodbye," said the rider,
"Goodbye and goodnight"

871
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,018
 "No," said the stars
to the moon in the sky

872
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:48,657
 "No," said the trees
that started to moan

873
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,997
 "No," said the dust
that blinded his eyes

874
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:57,654
 "Yes," said the rider
and pointed his gun. 

875
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,813
Best you go now, Tobey.

876
01:18:18,181 --> 01:18:20,695
Tobey.

877
01:18:23,101 --> 01:18:25,490
Merry Christmas.

878
01:18:34,221 --> 01:18:35,893
Merry Christmas, Captain.

879
01:19:04,942 --> 01:19:07,934
Prisoner coming through!

880
01:19:10,022 --> 01:19:11,467
Prisoner coming through!

881
01:19:11,502 --> 01:19:13,062
Stand back, ladies and gentlemen,

882
01:19:13,097 --> 01:19:14,787
this black fella bites!

883
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:17,502
Keep moving,
you murdering bloody bastard!

884
01:19:17,537 --> 01:19:18,988
'Tis the jailhouse for you!

885
01:19:19,023 --> 01:19:21,228
You led us a merry bloody dance
for many days,

886
01:19:21,263 --> 01:19:24,463
but alas for you,
you dirty mongrel, we've got you!

887
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:26,588
How am I doing?

888
01:19:26,623 --> 01:19:28,853
You're doing just fine, Sergeant Stoat.

889
01:19:31,783 --> 01:19:34,748
Keep moving,
you dusky devil. Don't lag.

890
01:19:34,783 --> 01:19:37,903
And keep your lustful eyes
to the ground, you lecherous dog,

891
01:19:37,938 --> 01:19:40,701
or I'll whip the filthy
black hide right off you!

892
01:19:41,863 --> 01:19:43,296
Good morning, miss.

893
01:20:03,304 --> 01:20:05,420
What's happening?
I don't know.

894
01:20:06,544 --> 01:20:09,304
It must be some of Lawrence's lot.

895
01:20:10,464 --> 01:20:11,944
Oh, shit.

896
01:20:15,864 --> 01:20:17,949
Mikey. Mikey.

897
01:20:17,984 --> 01:20:19,629
This one's pissed himself.
Help!

898
01:20:19,664 --> 01:20:22,417
Where are the keys,
you bastards?

899
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:25,575
The fuckin' keys.

900
01:20:27,104 --> 01:20:30,305
Please. Oh, God. Oh, please.

901
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,863
Mikey?

902
01:20:33,105 --> 01:20:34,590
Mikey.

903
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:36,310
Mikey. Mikey.

904
01:20:36,345 --> 01:20:37,985
Will you shut him up, Charlie?

905
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,710
Mikey! Mikey!

906
01:20:39,745 --> 01:20:42,385
Mikey! It's Charlie.

907
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,340
Two Bob.

908
01:20:45,025 --> 01:20:46,585
I think the job's fucking done.

909
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,682
Two Bob, you fuckin' yellow dog.

910
01:20:48,717 --> 01:20:50,745
Come on, sons of bitches, get down.

911
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,310
Arthur!
Arthur!

912
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:55,305
I'll see you at the good Captain's.
We'll save the best till last.

913
01:21:01,265 --> 01:21:02,470
Get!

914
01:21:02,505 --> 01:21:04,866
Stand back.

915
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:06,299
Get!

916
01:22:15,908 --> 01:22:17,864
You look grand, Samuel.

917
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:23,708
Well... we're going visiting.

918
01:22:23,743 --> 01:22:25,141
That's right.

919
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:51,068
It's all your fault, Charlie.
You should never have left us.

920
01:24:07,191 --> 01:24:09,028
Would you like me to carve?

921
01:24:09,063 --> 01:24:10,866
No. No, no, no. I'll carve.

922
01:24:32,632 --> 01:24:34,797
Finest bird I ever 'ad, ma'am.

923
01:24:34,832 --> 01:24:37,426
Made with my own fair 'ands.

924
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:08,946
Thank you.

925
01:25:32,033 --> 01:25:34,453
For what we are about to receive...

926
01:25:34,488 --> 01:25:36,873
...may the Lord make us truly thankful.

927
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:38,625
Amen.
Amen.

928
01:25:40,793 --> 01:25:42,226
Merry Christmas.

929
01:25:44,154 --> 01:25:45,587
Merry Christmas.

930
01:25:49,954 --> 01:25:50,909
Mmm!

931
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:14,474
Guard the woman, Samuel.

932
01:26:14,509 --> 01:26:16,624
Shit.

933
01:26:31,755 --> 01:26:34,040
Move out of your seat again, ma'am,

934
01:26:34,075 --> 01:26:36,873
and I'll stick this fork
through your fucking eye.

935
01:26:37,915 --> 01:26:39,360
Shut up.

936
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:41,511
I said shut up.

937
01:27:05,236 --> 01:27:06,669
It's Christmas.

938
01:27:33,197 --> 01:27:34,630
What does that say?

939
01:27:46,917 --> 01:27:49,157
"To my darling wife...

940
01:27:49,192 --> 01:27:51,397
"...whom I love so much.

941
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:52,830
"I'm sorry."

942
01:27:55,277 --> 01:27:56,869
Sorry for what?

943
01:28:10,558 --> 01:28:13,643
Oh... ma'am...

944
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:15,123
...they're beautiful.

945
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:17,838
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

946
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:19,833
Samuel!
That's us.

947
01:28:19,868 --> 01:28:21,793
Come on.

948
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:42,959
You won't want to miss this, Captain.

949
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,445
Samuel,
sing us Peggy Gordon.

950
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:23,020
 Oh, Peggy Gordon... 

951
01:29:23,055 --> 01:29:27,560
 You are my darling... 

952
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,840
 Come sit you down... 

953
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,405
 Upon my knee... 
Charlie.

954
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,160
Just in time.
 And tell... to me... 

955
01:29:39,195 --> 01:29:41,925
Mikey's dead.

956
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,725
 The very reason... 

957
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,441
Listen to that. He sings like a bird.

958
01:29:46,476 --> 01:29:48,318
 Why I... 

959
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,317
Not the gut, Charlie.

960
01:30:11,121 --> 01:30:13,401
Shit.

961
01:30:16,481 --> 01:30:17,914
No more.

962
01:31:03,163 --> 01:31:05,119
I'm going to be with my brother.

963
01:32:11,445 --> 01:32:14,517
You got me, Charlie.

964
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:26,116
What are you gonna do now?

965
01:33:17,647 --> 01:33:21,247
 "When?" said the moon
to the stars in the sky

966
01:33:21,282 --> 01:33:24,964
 "Soon," said the wind
that followed him home

967
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:28,943
 "Who?" said the cloud
that started to cry

968
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:32,852
 "Me," said the rider, as dry as a bone

969
01:33:32,887 --> 01:33:36,527
 "Who?" said the sun
that melted the ground

970
01:33:36,562 --> 01:33:40,284
 "Why?" said the river
that refused to run

971
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:44,057
 "Where?" said the thunder
without a sound

972
01:33:44,092 --> 01:33:47,795
 "Here," said the rider,
and took up his gun

973
01:34:03,488 --> 01:34:07,208
 "No," said the stars
to the moon in the sky

974
01:34:07,243 --> 01:34:10,945
 "No," said the trees
that started to moan

975
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:14,714
 "No," said the dust
that blinded his eyes

976
01:34:14,749 --> 01:34:18,578
 "Yes," said the rider,
as white as a bone

977
01:34:18,613 --> 01:34:22,408
 "No," said the moon
that rose from his sleep

978
01:34:22,443 --> 01:34:26,054
 "No," said the cry of the dying sun

979
01:34:26,089 --> 01:34:30,085
 "No," said the planets
that started to weep

980
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:34,082
 "Yes," said the rider,
and laid down his gun. 

981
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:10,205
One, two, three, four.

982
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:28,010
 Clean hands and dirty hands

983
01:35:28,045 --> 01:35:32,447
 Brown eyes and blue

984
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:40,891
 Pale cheeks and rosy cheeks

985
01:35:40,926 --> 01:35:45,203
 Jesus loves you

986
01:35:50,491 --> 01:35:54,187
 If you'll come to Him today

987
01:35:54,222 --> 01:35:57,884
 He will wash your tears away

988
01:36:03,811 --> 01:36:07,291
 Clean hands and dirty hands

989
01:36:07,326 --> 01:36:11,570
 Brown eyes and blue

990
01:38:05,455 --> 01:38:08,735
 Clean hands and dirty hands

991
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:11,568
 Brown eyes and blue

992
