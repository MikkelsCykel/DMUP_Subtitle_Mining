1
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,680
# <i>Shoot, shoot,</i>
<i>shoot the animal</i> #

2
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,080
# <i>Run, run,</i>
<i>run to Canada</i> #

3
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,760
Where are we?

4
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
How specific
do you want me to be?

5
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,640
How specific can you be?

6
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
Try Australia.

7
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,360
We're getting there.

8
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,760
It'd help if
we knew where "there" was.

9
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,920
Dace knows
where he's going.

10
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,680
Ooh, easy.
I bet he does.

11
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,640
What does that mean?

12
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
# Kris has got a boyfriend #

13
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,920
both:
# Kris has got a boyfriend #

14
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
Holy shit!

15
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
Oh, hello.
What's this?

16
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,240
Don't you dare.

17
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,200
Oh, I think I dare.

18
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
Don't you dare!
Warren, Warren!

19
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,120
Don't you fucking dare.
Don't!

20
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
Warren!
Fucking don't you dare.

21
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,600
Fucking give it here!

22
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,040
It's not yours, Warren.
Don't open it.

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,320
If it was mine,
I wouldn't want to open it.

24
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Whatever.
Open it. I don't care.

25
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,880
Eh, I don't want to open
your dumb bag.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,120
Grow up, Warren.

27
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,600
Get over it, Chad.

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
I don't know.

29
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,080
I just wish
we had more to go on.

30
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,360
They're your family heirlooms.

31
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,720
I just wish
there was more detail.

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,560
There's plenty of detail.
It all checks out.

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,840
He was a total nutcase.

34
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Wow, really?

35
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,920
He was your uncle.

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
You said he was reliable.

37
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,800
He was my
great-great-great uncle, Chad,

38
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
and it was 120 years ago,

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,640
and I didn't say
he was reliable.

40
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
I just said we weren't taking
parenting tips

41
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,520
from the man
and that he's unlikely

42
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,200
to have hallucinated
these rock paintings.

43
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,280
What's wrong with
rock paintings closer to home?

44
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
What have you got
against them?

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,640
These paintings
haven't been seen for 120 years,

46
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,120
that's what.

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,640
There isn't a doctorate
in paintings closer to home.

48
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,880
Sorry, lassie.

49
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm bored.

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
Well,
we could play a game.

51
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Great.
I spy with my little eye...

52
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,720
No, a game's a good idea.
Like what?

53
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
I don't know.
20 questions?

54
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
We could play backpacker.

55
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
How do you play that?

56
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,920
We choose someone
to be a backpacker,

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,760
then we murder them
and dump their body in a ditch.

58
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
Warren!

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
Sorry, Anja.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,280
That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

61
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,200
Sorry?
Sorry?

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,760
She gets...
she gets a sorry?

63
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,360
Where's my apology,
you cunt?

64
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,120
Where is it?
Give me one!

65
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,680
Come on, Warren!

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,640
Sorry, Angina.

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,080
I forgot you don't like
the O word.

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Are you serious?
What's not to like?

69
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
It's not that
I don't like it, Smell.

70
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,720
Ah, come on.
I could feel your eyes roll.

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
It's about context.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Ah, context.

73
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,120
So what context
would you be cool with it in?

74
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
Give it a rest.

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,520
Come on.
I want an answer.

76
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,960
I'll let you know
when I think of one.

77
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,920
How about, "Get down there,
boy, and lick my cunt"?

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
all: Hey!

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,480
What? What?

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,080
I say it to Chad
all the time.

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
You do not.

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
Can say it to me
any time you like.

83
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,360
Ooh, baby,
maybe I will.

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,520
This one's malfunctioning.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm kidding, baby.
Chad, I'm kidding.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
I love my little Chaddikins.

87
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,120
I don't know.

88
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,400
I still wish
we had more to go on.

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,600
So?

90
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,680
Ye of little faith.

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
Everybody out, please.

92
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,920
Ah, thank God.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
Oh, yay.

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,160
Bags not sitting in the middle
next time.

95
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Guys, be careful when
you're walking on the rocks.

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,480
Chad,
how sweaty is your back?

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,760
I need to go to the toilet.

98
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,800
Do you think I could cop a squat
over here?

99
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,800
Coming.

100
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,960
Thanks, guys.

101
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,240
Look out for snakes.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
# I wish all the ladies #

103
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
# I wish all the ladies #

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,160
# Were sculptures
of Venus #

105
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,960
# Sculptures of Venus #

106
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,560
# And I was a sculptor #

107
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,160
# I was a sculptor #

108
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,440
# I'd sculpt them with my... #

109
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
# Penis #

110
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,080
# Singing,
hey, boppa-loobah #

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
# Hey, boppa-loobah #

112
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,440
Mel?
Mel?

113
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,040
Hey, it's over here.

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,880
Ah!
Spiderwebs!

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,640
Oh, here we are.

116
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,200
Everybody,
watch your head.

117
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,240
Whoo,
come on, Anja.

118
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,600
We'll quickly go through,

119
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,200
and then we'll come back
for the stuff.

120
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,640
Oh, rocks.

121
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
Shit.

122
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay, watch your heads.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Yep.

124
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
Dace, were you ever
a prefect at school?

125
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,080
Where's Anja?

126
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,040
Anja?

127
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Anja, hey.

128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,200
Kris?

129
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,320
Are you okay?

130
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,040
I'm fine.
I just need a moment.

131
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,200
You don't have to do this, An.

132
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,880
Can you talk to me?

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,640
About what?

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,160
Anything.
Something happy.

135
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,920
Pregnant.

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
Pregnant?

137
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,080
"Pregnant"
is my happy word.

138
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,840
Every time I hear it,
I get a rush of joy.

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,560
Are you serious?

140
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,120
It's all I want
is to have babies.

141
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,720
You're 23.

142
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,240
I know.
It's... it's silly.

143
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,440
Whoa, look at this.

144
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,040
It's beautiful.

145
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,560
Mmm, oh, my sensitive boy.
So cute.

146
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,000
What? You have to be sensitive
to find this beautiful?

147
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,400
Or gay.
Watch the puddle.

148
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Gah!

149
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,960
Warren!
Fuck!

150
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
Ooh!
You'll get yours!

151
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Oh, really?
I can't wait.

152
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,640
- Fuck.
- Oh, yes, you can.

153
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,040
Keep moving.

154
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,480
Dace!

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,720
Dace!

156
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
Anja.

157
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
What?

158
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,280
Anja,
you blacked out.

159
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Yeah.
Better let me check you out.

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
No, I'm okay.

161
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,520
Just let me check.
You could be concussed.

162
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
She didn't hit her head.
She blacked out.

163
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,160
There's something wrong
with that tunnel.

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,080
We shouldn't go through it.

165
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,560
Anja,
don't be ridiculous.

166
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,000
It's perfectly safe.

167
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,080
It'll take us five minutes
if we walk through the tunnel

168
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,160
and probably hours
to drive around the mountain.

169
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,520
She had a panic attack.

170
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Well,
why didn't you say?

171
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,640
It wasn't the same.

172
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,840
It was different
from last time.

173
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,000
Here's what
we're going to do.

174
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,040
We are going
to go to the car

175
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
and get the stuff
that we need,

176
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,600
go through the tunnel
and set up camp,

177
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
and you are going
to drive around

178
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,640
and meet us up
on the other side, all right?

179
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
Yeah.

180
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
Thanks.

181
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,600
At some point, you've got
to get over this shit.

182
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
What?

183
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,240
It's only
a fucking tunnel.

184
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
How much longer?

185
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,320
Yes!
We have daylight.

186
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,480
Oh, my God.

187
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,440
Wow.

188
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,280
Look at that.

189
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,160
Forget that.
Check this out!

190
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Oh.

191
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,160
Ah, it's actually
kind of beautiful.

192
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,120
Oh, my God.

193
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
Eh, I've seen better.

194
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
Find it all right?

196
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Thanks to yours truly.

197
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,560
Found this one
running around screaming,

198
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,840
waving his arms
like a girl.

199
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Hey, you'll keep.

200
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,160
I want to get my pink bag.

201
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,720
There's a few things
I want to just check.

202
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
- What do I do with this?
- Chuck it in the back?

203
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,960
Mine and mine.

204
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,000
- Where's... where's my bag?
- It's mine.

205
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
Which way?

206
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,280
Here.
The mossies are psychotic.

207
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,200
Finally.

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,720
Pookie,
I'm gonna put you there.

209
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,680
Hi, baby.

210
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
Wait, wait, wait.

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,520
Pookie doesn't need
to see this.

212
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,240
Ah, to be young
and in love.

213
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,160
Ah, to be young
and fucking.

214
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,200
Where's Dace
and Kris?

215
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,480
Speaking of
young and fucking.

216
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,440
They're not.

217
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,560
Give them time.

218
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,680
They're at
the rock painting.

219
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
Is it good?

220
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,720
Oh, you know, there's rock.
There's paint.

221
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,680
Ticks all the boxes.

222
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
Hey, check this out.

223
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,760
Whoa, billabong!

224
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,040
Well, I wouldn't drink
from it.

225
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,040
If you want water,

226
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,440
there's a brook
a little further on.

227
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,680
Great for swimming in,
though.

228
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,640
Great for swimming?

229
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,000
That sentence
makes no sense.

230
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
It's just a bunch of words
randomly shoved together.

231
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,440
Jesus, Mel,
a little bit of respect.

232
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,880
What the fuck?

233
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Fucking insects.

234
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,480
Oh, here.

235
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Come on, I'll show you
those rock paintings.

236
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Whoa, nobody's seen this
painting for 120 years.

237
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,680
Okay, Dace,
what's it all mean?

238
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Well,
as near as I can tell,

239
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,040
it means
I'm gonna get published,

240
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
get a doctorate,
and get a job on TV.

241
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
What is that?

242
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,880
That is gruesome.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,280
Looks like weird squid porn,
if you ask me.

244
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,400
Well, it does.

245
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,160
This color here,
this pigmentation,

246
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,640
it's usually related to death
or danger or something.

247
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Hey, hey!

248
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
What?

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,560
Don't touch it.

250
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,920
Sorry.

251
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,080
Do you want
to go get dinner on?

252
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Love to.

253
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,600
Just after
I've poked out my eyeballs

254
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,440
and inserted them
up my anus.

255
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,400
Anus later.
Dinner first.

256
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,880
So what do you think?

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,640
I think it's beautiful.

258
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,120
No, what do you think
it's about?

259
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,360
Well, I could be wrong,

260
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,960
but I think
it's about that.

261
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,560
You reckon?

262
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,320
I don't know.
Probably not.

263
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,960
No, no, no.
You could be right.

264
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,760
But if you ask me,
I think it's about that.

265
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,240
Typical.

266
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,440
What?
Why?

267
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,720
No reason.

268
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,720
No, I'm being serious.

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,960
I think that's the crux
of it all.

270
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,160
I know you do.

271
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,760
I am being scientific here.

272
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,600
Of course you are.

273
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,840
What?

274
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,080
What what?

275
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,480
You're kind of sexy
when you mess with my head.

276
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,120
What?

277
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,560
Something attacked me.

278
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,080
Really?

279
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,960
Shit.

280
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,400
Come on,
you little fucker.

281
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,440
Have another go.

282
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
Yummy.

283
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,440
Are they chicken?

284
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,360
Nope. Beef.
Beefy beef.

285
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,760
Oi.
Look what just attacked us.

286
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,720
Oh, what is it?

287
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,320
- Fucking rabbit.
- Bullshit.

288
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Look at this.

289
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,040
Whoa, you better
get that thing checked.

290
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
It might have rabies.

291
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,880
We don't have rabies
in Australia.

292
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,480
Here,
get a load of its teeth.

293
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,240
- Whoa.
- That's gross.

294
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,720
There's something wrong
with that.

295
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,160
I know.

296
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,960
That's why I am making
an example of it.

297
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah!

298
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,480
Yeah, that'll teach 'em.

299
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,240
Freaky-assed mutant rabbit
will think twice

300
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,000
before attacking you again.

301
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,680
You can't leave it there.
It'll stink.

302
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,640
Don't be such a girl.

303
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,600
Yeah, what's with you?

304
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,080
First "cunt"
and now rotting corpses?

305
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,800
Hey, yeah,
you got a context for me yet?

306
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,160
Oh, at least wash your hands,
you skank.

307
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,440
Careful!
Careful!

308
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Mmm!

309
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,320
Come on,
just one.

310
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,920
Just use it in a sentence.

311
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,440
Just give me one example.

312
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,440
Oh, seriously.

313
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,920
Come on, Warren,
give us a song.

314
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,840
# Sometimes
you need to get away #

315
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,760
# Blow the town
and flee the fray #

316
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,680
# Where night is night,
and day is day #

317
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,160
# And just sit on your ass #

318
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,600
# Perfect nights
are made like this #

319
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,680
# Firelight
and a woman's kiss #

320
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,800
# Freaky-assed mutant rabbit
on a stick #

321
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,440
# And the wide-open sky #

322
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,520
Where are you two going?

323
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,240
Ah, just looking
at the stars.

324
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,840
They're really amazing
out here.

325
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,160
# Dace is turning the S.N.A.G.
up high #

326
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,720
# Yee-haw #

327
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,360
# Showing little Krissy
the stars in the sky #

328
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,520
# But we all know #

329
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,200
# That's just another
tired old line #

330
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,240
# So he can bone her blind #

331
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,320
Oh, please.

332
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,440
Whoo!

333
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,160
Maybe Chad and I should come
and join you guys.

334
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,080
Well, yeah, it's not really
a two-man tent,

335
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,160
so Chad's gonna
have to wait outside.

336
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,840
I'm sure he wouldn't mind,
would you, Chad?

337
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,840
Whatever.

338
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,960
Nasty Mel
making Chaddikins angry?

339
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Be like that then.

340
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm going swimming.

341
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,240
What, now?

342
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah,
it's the best time.

343
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,280
Your bathers
are in the tent.

344
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,760
Chad, we're in
the middle of nowhere.

345
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,280
We don't need bathers.
Whoo-hoo!

346
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
Yeah, baby!

347
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,200
Ow!

348
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,600
Oh...

349
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,720
Hey, Chad.
Come in.

350
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,800
Nude up.
Get your winky wet.

351
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,600
Come on.
It's beautiful.

352
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,800
Towel's there
when you need it.

353
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,280
You being
a whiny bitch?

354
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,640
How about
a bit of fucking dignity?

355
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,920
What?

356
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,160
You heard me.

357
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,560
I'm skinny-dipping
in the middle of nowhere.

358
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,200
How does that
affect my dignity?

359
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,520
Chad, how does that
affect my dignity?

360
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, Chad.

361
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,920
Chad, wait.

362
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,520
Chad, wait.

363
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Fuck.

364
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
What?

365
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Get them off me!
Get them off me!

366
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,960
Hey, don't rip them off.

367
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,240
Chuck us the salt.
It's leeches.

368
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,520
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

369
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,760
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

370
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,720
Stand still.

371
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,320
Get 'em off me!

372
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Quick!

373
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,880
Ow!
They're everywhere!

374
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,680
Quick! Quick!

375
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,160
All done.

376
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,360
Are they gone?
Are they gone?

377
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,600
You need to check.
Check, check.

378
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,560
That's it.

379
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,080
I guess swimming's out,
then.

380
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,080
See you in the morning.

381
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,400
Night.

382
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,640
Looks like
we're sharing a tent.

383
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,800
If we really must.

384
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,040
So how are you going
with everything?

385
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,400
Oh, you know.

386
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280
Bit up and down.

387
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,680
I know it'll get better
with time.

388
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,440
It's just, I've got
this inescapable feeling

389
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,720
I've just got shit taste
in men.

390
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,800
An, you can't blame yourself
for David.

391
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,240
I mean, we all knew
he was a tool,

392
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,160
but none of us
saw that coming.

393
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Yeah,
but that's just it.

394
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,560
I didn't know
he was a tool.

395
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,520
And he wasn't the first.

396
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,600
Graham was a fuckwit too.

397
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,320
Yeah, you're right.
You've got shit taste in men.

398
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,280
You know the thing
I can't forgive myself for?

399
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,720
When it came to the crunch,

400
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,680
when I should have fought back,
I blacked out.

401
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
An, that's bullshit.

402
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,800
And today in the tunnel...

403
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,840
Maybe I am a born victim.

404
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,400
Anyone who spends a week
locked in a basement

405
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,120
is gonna have
a little bit of baggage.

406
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,800
If it's just a little bit
of claustrophobia.

407
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,840
You're doing
pretty damn well.

408
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,920
I'm going to get some sleep.

409
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,480
I might sleep out here
by the fire

410
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,760
and keep watch in case

411
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,760
any more of those freaky-assed
mutant rabbits attack.

412
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,000
Thanks.

413
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,280
# His heart breaks
as she walks away #

414
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
# Her chest heaving
and her hips a-sway #

415
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,400
# Oh, well,
tomorrow's another day #

416
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
Shut up, Warren.

417
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,560
# He'll just have to wait #

418
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,920
Night, Warren.

419
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,000
An, can you have
a look at Mel?

420
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,520
She's got a fever.

421
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,920
Hey, baby.
How's it going?

422
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Good.

423
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,720
I just got to get out
of this suit.

424
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,480
Oh, Melly,
you're burning up.

425
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,240
Let's get you out of this.

426
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,480
I don't know how people
wear them every day.

427
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
It's the leeches.

428
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
They've got to be poisonous.

429
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,120
Leeches aren't poisonous.

430
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,560
There's no mileage in it
for them.

431
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,680
They're parasites.

432
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,920
They do secrete anticoagulants
and stuff.

433
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,640
Looks like an allergic reaction
to me.

434
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,160
Well, should we get her
to a hospital?

435
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,520
No, we shouldn't move her,
not yet anyway.

436
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,280
Best thing for her
is rest.

437
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,040
What do you know?
You're not a doctor.

438
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,000
If it was serious,
she'd be anaphylactoid.

439
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,920
"Anaphylactoid"?
That's not even a word.

440
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,160
Listen, we give her panadol
for the fever,

441
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,080
and we see how she is
in the morning.

442
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,520
I've got antihistamines.

443
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

444
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,240
Ah, boring.

445
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,480
Who fucking
let him make a speech?

446
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,040
Get 'em off.

447
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,600
Chaddy.

448
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,080
Let's split this scene?
Okay?

449
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,720
Take these, baby.

450
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,600
Chad...

451
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,280
Chaddy?

452
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,200
Chad?

453
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,880
Mm?

454
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,640
Chaddy?

455
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,080
Can you hear the bells?

456
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,960
Babe?

457
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,960
Hmm?

458
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,160
Chaddy?

459
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,920
Shit, baby...

460
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,440
Oh, Jesus.

461
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
That's it.

462
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,560
I'm gonna take a break.

463
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,560
There's fucking chunks
in this burger.

464
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,080
Oh!

465
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,720
I found a penny.

466
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,960
What's wrong
with her teeth?

467
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,880
Shh.
Get Dace.

468
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Get Dace!
Get Dace!

469
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,200
- What's going on?
- We gotta get her to a doctor.

470
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,160
- Settle down.
- Don't tell me to settle down.

471
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,720
Look, these paintings
haven't been seen

472
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,800
for over a century.

473
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
It's the find of a lifetime.
Fuck.

474
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,920
We're not leaving just
'cause someone's got a fever!

475
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,400
She's hallucinating.
Her teeth are falling out.

476
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
It took us ages
to get here!

477
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,680
Take a look at her,
Dace.

478
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Christ.

479
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,680
Um, do you know the way
back to the last town?

480
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,080
Yeah, I reckon.

481
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,160
Okay, if you leave now,
you can get there by lunchtime,

482
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,600
mid-afternoon
at the latest.

483
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,840
Um, fuck. I'm gonna stay here
and work on the paintings.

484
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,880
I'll stay with you.

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Take what you need.

486
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,520
Chad, help me get her
to the car, come on.

487
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,480
What food do we want?

488
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,760
Stuff we don't
have to cook.

489
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,240
All right.

490
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,400
Can I help carry her?

491
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,200
No, I've got her.
You go help Warren.

492
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,680
Dace, we've got to get out
of here.

493
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,440
There's all these bugs
eating everything.

494
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,360
Open the door.

495
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,320
Dace, they've been through
everything in my tent.

496
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,360
They've destroyed it all.

497
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,920
Warren, did you leave us
enough food?

498
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
Are you fucking listening
to me?

499
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,240
Yes. Insects.
Whatever.

500
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,040
What is it?

501
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,280
What the fuck?

502
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,840
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

503
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,880
What are we gonna do?

504
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,640
We're gonna
have to walk it.

505
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,920
Yep. Okay.

506
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,840
Let's get her
back into the tent.

507
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,760
Warren, you're going to help me
build a stretcher.

508
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
We can make one
out of a camp bed.

509
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,760
Here.

510
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,720
I'll be outside, baby.

511
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,960
What can I do?

512
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,360
I've known you for two years,
still got no idea.

513
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
What's up your ass?

514
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,680
I don't know.

515
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,760
Maybe that my whole fucking
thesis has gone to shit

516
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,920
because of your girlfriend.

517
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,520
She didn't get sick
just to spite you.

518
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,520
Well,
I didn't tell her

519
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
to go swimming with leeches,
did I?

520
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,920
And I did?

521
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,960
She's your girlfriend.

522
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,240
Why don't you try
a tighter leash?

523
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,680
And we're going through
that tunnel.

524
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,680
What?

525
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,960
Shaves half a day's hiking
off.

526
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,560
Jesus, Dace.
I can't. I told you.

527
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,400
We have to, An.
I'll help you through it.

528
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
Mel?

529
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,040
You shouldn't be out here,
Smelly.

530
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,880
Mel?

531
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,400
Ah!

532
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,680
Rah!

533
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Kris, come behind me!

534
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,920
Mel!
Mel!

535
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,720
What the fuck?

536
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,000
What's wrong with her?

537
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,880
I don't know, some sort of
episode or something.

538
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,040
Episode?
Did you see her teeth?

539
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,480
Nasty fucking teeth.

540
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,440
Fucking leeches?

541
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,840
Fuck.

542
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,120
Where's the first aid kit?

543
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,240
It's in the car.

544
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,960
I'll get it.

545
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,160
Fuck.

546
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Fuck.

547
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,320
Dace, get back!

548
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,600
What's wrong with her?

549
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
What's wrong with her?

550
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,360
Don't know, Chad.

551
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,800
Oh...

552
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,000
How bad is it?

553
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,960
It's really messy.
It needs to be stitched.

554
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,240
I've got a sewing kit
in the car.

555
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,800
You're not fucking
sewing me up.

556
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,000
It's okay.
I can make do.

557
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,320
Good, because
I'm not going back to the car.

558
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,480
That painting's
not a story.

559
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,040
It's a warning.

560
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,320
Go through those photos.

561
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,960
See if there's anything there
that'll help.

562
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,920
She hardly felt this log,
and I wasn't holding back.

563
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah, I noticed.

564
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,920
Whatever's wrong with her,
she's still Mel.

565
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Uh!

566
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,000
Okay, what do we do?

567
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,800
Well, we can't stay here.

568
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,920
She's gonna come back
for us.

569
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,880
We've got to run.

570
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,400
No,
we've got to stay here.

571
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,280
She's afraid of the fire.

572
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,880
Got to use that
to our advantage.

573
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,600
How?

574
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,440
Dace?

575
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,760
The way I see it,
we got two options.

576
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,760
And they are?

577
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,160
We either trap her,

578
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,120
or we kill her.

579
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,480
- Whoa, whoa, Dace.
- This is Mel!

580
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,760
I know killing shit is kind of
like your default position...

581
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,720
This is bad.

582
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,680
She needs our help,
you prick,

583
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,960
and you want to kill her.

584
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,760
- I kind of like Mel.
- Shut up!

585
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,680
He's right.

586
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,360
What?

587
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,960
He didn't say
we're gonna kill her.

588
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,640
He said they're our options,
right?

589
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,840
Yeah.
Right.

590
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,200
Well,
we're not killing her.

591
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,400
Okay.
So we trap her.

592
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Okay.

593
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,320
Chad, you're the bait.
You stay here.

594
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,720
The moment you see her,
get to the edge of the trap.

595
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Stay there.

596
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,040
Do I get one of those?

597
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,320
No, you're the bait.

598
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
You don't get jack,

599
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,520
so try not to get killed.

600
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm gonna be up in the tree
with the ropes.

601
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,880
The moment she sets foot
onto the trap,

602
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,320
I'm gonna jump down
and spring it,

603
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
using my body weight to...

604
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,200
haul her up.

605
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,120
You guys go into
different parts of the bush,

606
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,320
flush her out.

607
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,840
How do we do that?

608
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,920
Wave your torch.
Make some noise.

609
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,160
When she sees you guys
have got flame and Chad doesn't,

610
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,920
she's gonna go for Chad,
all right?

611
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,160
And if she doesn't?

612
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,040
Well, you make sure you keep
the flame between you and her,

613
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
you'll be fine.

614
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,320
Come on, guys,
let's do it.

615
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,800
Fucking hell.

616
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,840
Dace?

617
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,160
Shut up.

618
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,680
Mel?

619
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,240
Melly?

620
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,200
Mel?

621
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,080
Mel?

622
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,840
Mel?

623
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,000
Fucking nature.

624
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,360
What's the fucking point?

625
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,480
What'd it ever do for me?

626
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,720
Fucking nothing,
that's what.

627
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,240
Fucking rocks and moss
and grass.

628
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,640
Fuck you, Mr. Branch.

629
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,480
Mel?

630
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Mel?

631
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,840
She's over here!

632
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Mel?

633
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,760
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

634
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,160
Run!

635
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,200
Fuck this!

636
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,160
Ahh...

637
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,600
Chad!

638
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,520
Fuck!

639
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,800
She's coming!

640
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,440
Give us a hand.

641
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,600
That was intense.

642
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,560
Now what?

643
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,000
Dace?

644
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,280
You got nothing.
No plan?

645
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,920
We've got
Chad's saber-toothed girlfriend

646
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
stuck in a tree,

647
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,600
and that's it?

648
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,560
Chuck me the ropes.

649
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,200
Jesus fucking Christ,
are you serious?

650
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,160
That's it?

651
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,440
Chuck me the fucking ropes.

652
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,080
All right,
this is great!

653
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,840
Quarter of a billion alpha males
in the world,

654
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,880
and we get the dog shit one.

655
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,080
Shut up, Warren.

656
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,400
No, I don't think
I fucking will.

657
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,120
I'm getting really sick
of your negativity.

658
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,560
Everything's a fucking joke
to you.

659
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,160
Well, this is
a fucking joke.

660
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,080
You want a plan.
Here's the plan.

661
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,040
The moment she gets down...

662
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,920
Fuck!

663
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,400
Fuck me!

664
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,200
Grab it!

665
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,680
Ah!

666
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,680
Fuck!

667
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,760
Good.

668
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,240
Now let's get her tied up.

669
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,880
You've been
a bad, bad girl.

670
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,720
Warren!

671
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,680
Fuck!

672
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,080
No!

673
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,120
There.
Warren...

674
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,760
Dace!

675
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,080
Dace!

676
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
- Dace!
- Dace!

677
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,360
Get out of the water!

678
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,960
The leeches!

679
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,160
Oh, God!
Is there anything on me?

680
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,120
There's nothing.

681
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,120
There's nothing.

682
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,520
Warren?

683
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,760
No! No!

684
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,640
Oh, no, no!

685
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,880
This is bullshit.

686
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,160
What is?

687
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,040
This is!

688
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,600
Jesus Christ, when are we gonna
call a spade a spade?

689
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,360
We've got to work out
what's wrong with her.

690
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,800
I don't care
what's wrong with her.

691
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,040
The only thing I care about
is what we do now.

692
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,800
We can't help her
if we don't know.

693
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,880
Help her?
Help her?

694
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,800
Wake up
and smell the viscera, Chad!

695
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,520
Oh, Jesus.

696
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,920
Hey!
Get out of here!

697
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,240
Go on, get!
Get out of here!

698
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,720
We have to kill her.

699
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just say that.

700
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,200
Fucking get your head right,
Chad.

701
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,320
No, I'm not buying

702
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,520
any of your psycho
survivalist bullshit.

703
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,440
She fucking killed Warren.

704
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,960
She's sick.

705
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,480
She's eating him.

706
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,800
She needs help.

707
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,400
She's fucking eating him!

708
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,440
Enough.

709
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,040
Go on!
Get out of it!

710
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
She needs help.

711
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,240
You need help.

712
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,480
She needs to be dead.

713
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,400
He's right.

714
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,840
She's gonna kill all of us.

715
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,200
We don't have a choice.

716
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
You people are fucked up.

717
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,800
I don't want to die,
Chad.

718
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
And Mel does?

719
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,440
It's us or her,
dickhead.

720
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,280
You on board with this?

721
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,600
Yeah.

722
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,720
This is so fucking wrong.

723
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
That's not Mel anymore,
Chad.

724
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,080
I'm not giving up on her.

725
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,200
How do we do it?

726
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,640
What weapons do we have?

727
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,000
None.

728
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,640
Knives, bottles,
anything?

729
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,520
No, useless.

730
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
This is sharp.

731
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,240
No, we won't get anywhere
with that.

732
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,200
Well, what then?

733
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,760
Um, fuck,
we need the machete.

734
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,640
Machete?

735
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,160
Oi.
Where'd you put it?

736
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,600
It's in
the back of the car.

737
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,680
Well, how are we gonna
get it?

738
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,440
We'll take torches.
We go over there.

739
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,880
And one of us goes in
and gets it,

740
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,800
and the others
stand guard.

741
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,480
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

742
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,240
Kris, come on.
We need you.

743
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,800
Count me out.

744
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,840
Come on, Simon.
We need all hands on deck.

745
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,800
What?

746
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,240
What?

747
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,160
You called me Simon.

748
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,760
Chad.
Fuck. Whatever.

749
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,600
Ah, fuck.
Forget him, okay?

750
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,800
Three's enough.
Okay.

751
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,760
Are you okay?

752
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

753
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,120
Let's take these.

754
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,640
Okay.

755
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,880
We get over there
as quickly as we can.

756
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
Kris, you go in
and get it.

757
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,800
Anja, don't forget
the pudding.

758
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,080
Dace?

759
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,320
Ah?

760
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,280
I hate Christmas.

761
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,640
Everyone hates Christmas.

762
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,560
But Mum busted a gut
over this.

763
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,680
Fuck.
They got him.

764
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,280
The fucking leeches
got him.

765
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,880
It's not the leeches.

766
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's the water.

767
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,960
What are we gonna do?

768
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,360
Get him the fuck away
from me.

769
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,320
Settle down.

770
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,880
I'm serious.

771
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,680
Why would you
paint your house orange?

772
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,960
Fuck.
It's doing my head in.

773
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,760
Jesus!
What are we going to do?

774
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,680
We have to kill him.

775
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,400
Yeah.

776
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,160
Yeah,
we have to kill him.

777
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,200
Nice about-face.

778
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,400
You've seen
how strong Mel is.

779
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,040
We don't stand a chance
against this prick.

780
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,880
We have to, Anja,
now.

781
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
What's the problem,
Anja?

782
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,240
You were
all for killing Mel.

783
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,680
He was all for killing Mel,
for Christ's sake.

784
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,080
You know,
we got to do this.

785
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,280
Quickly,
before he turns.

786
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,200
Who's going to do it?

787
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,960
We draw straws.

788
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,880
I mean it.
We draw straws.

789
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,720
Who's first?

790
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,560
Fuck.

791
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,520
Here.
Grab a knife.

792
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,320
Come on. Quick.
Take one.

793
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,360
Package over there.

794
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,840
Just grab it.
Meet me in the cafe.

795
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,960
Better out than in,
hey, Dad?

796
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,840
Come on, Anja.
Take a knife.

797
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,840
Take it!

798
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,600
Ow.

799
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,160
It's okay now, Dace.

800
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,080
You get some sleep.

801
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,560
Yeah.

802
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,400
It's really good to see you,
sis.

803
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,640
It's good to see you.

804
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,760
Do it!

805
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,400
Come on, Anja,
quit piss-farting around.

806
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,120
Just stick the prick.

807
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,080
Do it!

808
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,000
Quick!

809
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,240
- Shut up!
- Now!

810
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,360
- Do it!
- Shut up.

811
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Just fucking stick it in!

812
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,840
Fuck!

813
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,920
Jesus Christ, Anja!

814
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,280
I can't.

815
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,840
Take the fucking knife
and fucking kill him.

816
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,200
I can't.

817
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,320
You have to.

818
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,840
Come on.
We're running out of time.

819
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,240
Get fucked!

820
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,880
Again.
Quick.

821
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,040
You fucking do it!

822
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,080
You drew the short straw.

823
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,280
Fuck you
and your fucking straws.

824
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,320
What was that?

825
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,440
That wasn't Mel.

826
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,240
Well, what could it be?

827
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,160
Shit!

828
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,280
Shit. Shit.

829
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,880
Shit.

830
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,800
Chad, get Dace.

831
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
What?

832
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Get a knife
and finish him.

833
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,920
You drew
the short straw.

834
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,240
Do it!
Now!

835
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,200
Now!

836
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,440
Fuck.

837
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,040
Useless.

838
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,000
We're gonna die.

839
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,560
No, there's still time.

840
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,800
We've got to get
that machete.

841
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,720
Then what?

842
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,920
Then we kill them both
before Dace is up and running.

843
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,480
And no more bullshit
from you.

844
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,000
That thing out there,
that's not Mel.

845
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,960
We're killing it.

846
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,240
I'm getting a torch.

847
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,520
We need to follow them.

848
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,440
We need to know
where they're going.

849
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Who's going to the car?

850
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,480
I will.

851
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,920
Now?

852
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,400
There's Dace.

853
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,240
Where's Mel?

854
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,560
Mel, I know
you're in there.

855
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,640
That's good.

856
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,120
Keep her attention.

857
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,840
I'll try to get Dace.

858
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,240
I know you're in there,
baby.

859
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,560
You're everything to me.

860
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,720
I'm not gonna abandon you,

861
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,680
but you've got to fight this,
sweetheart.

862
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,680
I know you can do it.

863
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,920
You're the strongest person
I've ever known.

864
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,960
But you got to fight.

865
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,720
You got to find your way
out of the darkness, baby.

866
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,080
I know you can do it.

867
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,480
Here, baby.

868
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,680
It's Pookie.

869
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,680
He's missing you.

870
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,200
He's missing you.

871
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,160
I'm going
to put down the torch.

872
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,760
I'm putting it down,
baby.

873
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,800
There's nothing between us.

874
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,920
It's just you and me and Pookie,
Mel.

875
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,000
No.

876
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,160
It's just us.

877
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,240
Chad.

878
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,200
Fuck!

879
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,640
Where is it?

880
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,360
Fuck!

881
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,840
Where is it?

882
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,240
Shit! Shit!

883
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,480
Where is it?

884
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,640
Where is it?

885
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,560
Shit! Fuck!

886
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,400
What's the matter, Mel?

887
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,640
Afraid of the dark?

888
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,880
Come on, Mel.

889
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,640
It's only
a fucking tunnel.

890
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,120
It's here.
It's here. It's here.

891
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,960
No!

892
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,840
Run, Kris!

893
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,200
Kris, run.

894
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,760
Let her go!

895
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,160
Come on.
We got to help her.

896
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,360
It's too late.

897
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,880
What was that back there
with that toy?

898
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,800
What do you want from me,
Anja?

899
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,200
I just want you to do
what we agreed to do.

900
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,640
I did what we agreed to do.

901
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,080
I lost two fucking fingers.

902
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,680
You put down your torch!

903
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,960
You put down your torch!

904
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,600
I was trying to reach her.

905
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,520
That thing out there,
that's not Mel.

906
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,040
You don't reach that,
Chad.

907
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,200
She's an animal.

908
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,800
She's scared of fire,
for fuck's sake.

909
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,040
Kris?

910
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,760
If she's scared
of something,

911
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,480
that means there's still
something left.

912
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,040
The tunnel.

913
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,000
What?

914
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,760
They're scared of it.

915
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,160
What?
How do you know?

916
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,040
Because when I went in there,
she didn't follow me in.

917
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,120
Well, what?
So what about it?

918
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,200
So we go through
the tunnel.

919
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,680
At the very least,
it buys us some time.

920
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,400
If we're lucky,
we lose them altogether.

921
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,200
What about
your claustrophobia?

922
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,760
We'll try and get up there
without being seen.

923
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,800
There's two of them now.

924
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,720
It'll be that much easier
for them to pick one of us off,

925
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,160
which is why I'm not using this
unless we have to.

926
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,600
Keep moving.
It's not Mel anymore.

927
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,120
Keep moving.

928
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,240
Come on.

929
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,360
Chad, come on.

930
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,800
Fuck.

931
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,680
I'm sorry.

932
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,400
Come on, Chad.

933
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,680
It's not her anymore.

934
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,040
Chad.
Come on.

935
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,880
It's not her.
Come on, Chad.

936
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,760
We're nearly there.
Come on.

937
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,000
Fuck.

938
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,080
Fuck you.

939
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,800
Kris.

940
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,400
It's me.

941
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,680
Kris?
Kris?

942
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,800
There's nothing there,
Kris.

943
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:24,840
There's nothing there.

944
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,440
It's just me.
It's Anja.

945
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,160
It's okay, sweetie.

946
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,880
It's okay.

947
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,840
Come on.

948
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,240
Come on.

949
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,200
Come on.

950
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,760
Come on, sweetie.

951
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
It's okay.
It's okay.

952
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,040
I've got you.
Got to keep moving.

953
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,520
It's okay.
Come on.

954
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,560
Kris! Kris!

955
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,720
Grab the machete, please!

956
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,440
Please!

957
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:05,240
Quick!
Cut me loose.

958
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,280
Please, Kris.

959
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,200
Please, Kris.

960
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,880
Please.

961
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,440
Kris.

962
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,600
Kris.

963
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,040
Help, please.

964
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,920
Kris.

965
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,600
Help me.

966
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,920
Come on.
Please.

967
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,760
Help me.

968
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,960
That's right!
Fuck off!

969
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,200
Fuck off,
you gutless turd!

970
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,720
splat!

971
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,520
Cunt.

972
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:08,320
# <i>Sometimes</i>
<i>you got to get away</i> #

973
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,880
# <i>Blow the town</i>
<i>and flee the fray</i> #

974
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,760
# <i>Where night is night</i>
<i>and day is day</i> #

975
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:27,680
# <i>And just sit</i>
<i>on your ass</i> #

976
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,400
# <i>Perfect nights</i>

977
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,960
# <i>The firelight</i>
<i>and a woman's kiss</i> #

978
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,680
# <i>A freaky-assed mutant rabbit</i>
<i>on a stick</i> #

979
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:54,080
# <i>And the wide-open sky</i> #

980
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,640
# <i>We all know that's just</i>

981
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,440

982
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,680
# <i>Bone her blind</i> #

983
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,960
# <i>No, I ain't got a problem</i>

984
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,800

985
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,240
# <i>But every time I go there</i> #

986
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,360
# <i>My friends</i>

988
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,800

989
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,000

992
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,560
