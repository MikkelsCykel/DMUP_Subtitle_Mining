Gold.

8
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,878
Some people say love.

9
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:39,983
They're right too. lt is love.

10
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,787
Love of gold.

11
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,911
Hold on.

12
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,915
Thank God you're there
There's been an explosion.

13
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,416
Pick up the phone and dial 911.

15

''18.36.7. Pound.''

16
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,096
What are you doing?

17
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,399
Find the security tape!

18
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,109
Enough.

19
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,425
Hey, thanks.

20
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,662
Hey, how'd it go?

00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,134
Finest kind.

22
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,400
- Where'd you get that?
- Here you go.

23
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,476
- You fixed it
- l made a new one.

24
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,012
- You're a pretty smart fella
- Not that smart.

25
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,778
- How'd you figure it out?
- l imagined someone smarter than me.

26
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,320
Then l tried to think
''What would he do?''

27
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,163
- That's one hell of a boat
- Sign up, l'll build you one.

28
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,658
- l wanna buy that one
- Well, that's my boat.

29
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,632
Come up with a down payment
and l'll have it in 18 months.

30
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:44,275
- We're good at this conversation
- Then close the deal.

31
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,445
- There you go
- What is it?

32
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,205
Open it up. lt's yours.

33
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,978
lt's shaped like an arrow
Freccia means arrow.

34
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,983
- So you told me
- lt looks like gold.

35
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,453
- That's because l gilded it
- Why?

36
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,554
l wanted to sell you a boat.

37
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,527
Good try, though
l want that boat.

38
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:15,699
Sell me that boat, and l'll come
down with a laundry bag of cash.

39
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:20,503
Take the money, take your little girl
cruise down to a tropic isle.

40
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,306
- How will you get the cash?
- Don't be coy.

41
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,781
You know who l am. Sell me your boat
you'll be under my wing.

42
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,250
That's my private number.

43
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:36,257
l can't do it. l'm working on
your boat. Take mine out.

44
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,656
Does that girl go with it?

45
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:44,726
Call me, l'll have five guys here
Monday laying out the hull.

46
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,265
You decide to sell me your boat...

47
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,040
...let's do something, huh?

48
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:06,424
- l'd have Ked to build him that boat
- Walk away from it.

49
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,994
Well, let's start getting
the gear on board.

50
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,909
- You got the charts?
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,479
Why so many?

52
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:39,457
Wouldn't want somebody to look
at them and follow us.

53
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,394
- How'd l get so lucky?
- You're the law west of the Pecos.

54
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,463
Yeah, l used to be
the law west of the Pecos.

55
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,995
Now l'm cashing out.

56
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:55,668
- You got your picture took
- ls that why l'm cashing out?

57
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,668
lf you say it, it's right.

58
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,678
You're the brass ring, babe.

59
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,645
Glad you Like me.

60
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,823
Off you go.

61
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,863
See you tonight.

62
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,862
Stay in the shadows.

63
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,573
Everyone's gonna be looking there.

64
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,576
- Where's the place to be?
- Place to be is in the sun.

65
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,789
Beautiful.

66
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,926
Just gorgeous.

67
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,288
Nobody gets the goods like you.

68
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,935
Anybody can get the goods
The hard part's getting away.

69
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,866
Plan a good getaway
you can steal Ebbets Field.

70
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,236
- Ebbets Field is gone
- What'd l tell you?

71
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,747
My nephew, Jimmy Silk.

72
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,515
Yep, that's who he is.

73
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,059
- He don't say hello?
- He must have things on his mind.

74
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,857
Anything you want while you're here?

75
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,402
Something for that pretty lady?

76
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,402
- What's she see in you anyway?
- l'm resilient.

77
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,873
- So's Gumby
- l got a better profile.

78
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,374
You're gonna leave that
down south in Argentina.

79
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,354
- How you doing, Bobby?
- l think you're looking at it.

80
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,452
You go down south, sit in the sun.

81
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:57,094
Pull down your bathing suit
stick your ass out at the world.

82
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,059
You think the world's ready for that?

83
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,196
The other thing
We got the go-ahead.

84
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,770
We got a firm date on the Swiss thing.

85
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,339
l'm burnt. They got my picture.

86
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,239
Of you in drag
with your war paint on.

87
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,482
lt's a blessing
lt's time to check out.

88
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,753
What do we got?

89
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,793
- lt's higher than the estimate
- Half is yours.

90
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,900
We're on for the Swiss thing.

91
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,798
Why did he tell me that half is mine?

92
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,941
l know half of it's mine
Me and my crew got it.

93
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,477
l went in hock
and set it up on your say-so.

94
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,182
Let's review. You let me
walk in there with my crew...

95
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,510
...and now you're stiffing me?

96
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,119
- lf it was me..
- Yeah. l owe my crew.

97
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,949
l gotta get out of town
l gotta go.

98
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,958
- Should have shot the girl
- Should have been there.

99
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,132
This Swiss thing. lf l was
a publisher, l'd publish the plans.

100
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,301
Why don't you?

101
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:15,633
lf l was a publisher. But l'm a thief
so l have to do that thing.

102
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,772
Give me our cut
We'll do the Swiss job.

103
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,413
You know that's bullshit
You're going traveling.

104
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,780
You gonna play me for a sucker?
l give you the money and you're gone.

105
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,454
The job's set up, you understand?

106
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,659
We did the job, my partners and me.

107
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,021
Hey, fuck you and fuck your partners.

108
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:43,234
l'm your partner. Without me
you've got, what? Little Lambsy Divy.

109
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:49,032
- l bankroll this job on your say-so
- l drove here, l didn't take the bus.

110
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,039
- Fuck you, go back to prison
- What'd l tell you?

111
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,874
l don't think so.

112
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,117
- Guess again
- You stay the fuck down.

113
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,252
Want to play OK Corral?
Wanna dress up and play?

114
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,928
ls that the thing?
ls that it?

115
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,833
Give me that fucking bag!

116
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,637
Your weight and your fate right here.

117
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,778
Your weight and your fate right here.

118
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,304
- Bag's empty, Bobby
- What?

119
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,608
The bag is empty.

120
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,612
Put the bag down, it's empty.

121
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,920
Want me to pull up a chair
while you rape me?

122
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,428
lf you'd pause in your
headstrong progress...

123
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,369
Joe, l'm in hock for all the toys.

124
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:58,565
All the toys you said go out
and buy. Two trucks, the plane.

125
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,439
- You said spend the money
- What do you want?

126
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,875
l want you to do the other thing.

127
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,915
You screwed me
Now my face is on a cereal box.

128
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,486
You got no money!
You're burnt and busted.

129
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:16,251
What the fuck does it take
to get you to do the other thing?

130
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,767
Excuse me, Mr. Bergman
asked you a question.

131
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,732
Excuse me
my uncle asked you a question.

132
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,533
- Fuck your uncle
- Fuck my uncle? You're the help.

133
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,579
Yeah, l'm the help, motherfucker
Why'd the chicken cross the road?

134
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,511
Because the road crossed the chicken.

135
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,481
- Walk away
- Hey, you! Hold on!

136
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,315
Situation is pristine.

137
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,320
Cut him off.

138
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,765
l didn't see him.

139
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,936
Oh, my God!

140
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,202
How is he?

141
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,207
lt's his road game.

142
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,162
- Your man does good work
- That's why l use him.

143
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,996
Yeah, these will pass anywhere.

144
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,435
Why don't you take advantage of it?

145
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,338
No.

146
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,075
l need somebody to throw me
in the briar patch.

147
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,585
Yeah, give the gentleman a call.

148
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,831
- l need some walking-around money
- That's reasonable.

149
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,805
And l'm gonna need my men's share
on the lastjob.

150
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,013
- Give it to me
- Now?

151
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,647
You got it in your pocket.

152
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,511
You're ahead of me every turn.

153
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,614
Stunning.

154
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,487
The plan holds
you get your shipment on the 14th.

155
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,753
The plan has changed
We split it 50/50 on the site.

156
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,295
50/50.

157
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,623
So be it.

158
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,973
- Now what's your surprise?
- My boy comes with you on the job.

159
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,478
- He's got terrible manners
- Which of us is perfect?

160
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,185
So be it.

161
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:02,826
Wait a sec. lf it's about
your wife, why didn't you...?

162
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,964
Will you wait? lf the whole thing
is about your wife...?

163
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,259
You know what?
The hell with it!

164
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,102
Not a happy camper, huh?

165
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,239
l'm not a camper at all, stud
Pour it.

166
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,972
See anything you like?

167
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,042
l'm busy.

168
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,084
- Pour it!
- Hope you're not driving.

169
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,484
l hope l am, and l run into
some fucked abutment.

170
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:37,024
- Take me off, will you?
- That'll rot your stomach lining.

171
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,425
Yeah, but l get to drink it first.

172
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,707
- That's all l need
- What?

173
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,466
There goes my job
You see his badge?

174
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:58,515
Do you know where that guy is from?
And he caught me drinking on shift.

175
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,524
End of a perfect day.

176
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,139
- That's Betty Croft
- What's her problem?

177
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,779
- She's a drunk
- She's a drunk.

178
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,472
You bet she is.

179
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,684
- Why is she important?
- She gets us in the door.

180
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,117
She gets us in the door, how?

181
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,625
l want you to leave the uniforms
on the porch 3 or 4 days.

182
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,331
Get the dry-cleaning smell
out of them.

183
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,227
When we do the switch, the highway...

184
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,868
- Nobody can hear
- lf you don't say it.

185
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,235
l'm as quiet as
an ant pissing on cotton.

186
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,139
l don't want you as quiet as that ant.

187
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,408
l want you as quiet as an ant not
even thinking about pissing on cotton.

188
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,174
Hello. l gotta report
a breakdown here.

189
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,210
l got one of your rentals
l need a tow truck.

190
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,543
Oh, come on, don't tell me that.

191
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:52,383
- Yeah, all right
- What's the story on your pal?

192
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,092
He was born, he suffered, he died.

193
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,423
- Can he do the thing?
- He was doing it before you were born.

194
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,495
See, that's what troubles me.

195
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,534
Maybe you want to pray about it?

196
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,640
- No, l'm not a religious man
- That's a shame.

197
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,978
- How's the leg?
- Never better.

198
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,413
- How long has he been with that girl?
- Who?

199
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,382
- His wife
- How long is a Chinaman's name?

200
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,722
How long is a Chinaman's name?
You ever notice that?

201
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,929
Got the uniforms?

202
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,329
Yeah, l got them
l got them all aired out.

203
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,079
- Rental trucks?
- Yeah.

204
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,207
What do we got?

205
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:54,316
Gotta redo some of these figures.

206
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,489
- l gotta start from scratch
- Worked out on the plan. Why now?

207
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,454
When things start to go sour
someone's gonna be pissing.

208
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,959
Looking to shoot somebody
l want an alternate idea.

209
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,166
Why should it go sour?

210
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,427
- You timing the wrecker?
- Yeah.

211
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:18,369
Why should it go sour?
Was that such a stupid question?

212
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:24,081
You ever cheat on a woman? Something
stand her up, step out on her?

213
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,646
What?

214
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,648
- Ever do that?
- Yeah.

215
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,720
- Did you have an excuse?
- Yeah.

216
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,450
What if she didn't ask?
Was your alibi a waste of time?

217
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,162
ls he gonna hold up?

218
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:50,136
He's only gotta hold it together
till the thing.

219
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,609
- Okay. All right
- ls he backing up?

220
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,247
Here he comes.

221
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,811
Ain't that pretty.

222
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,791
Don't start the car
lt's just a routine stop.

223
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,658
Don't start the car.

224
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,895
Good morning.

225
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,732
- Can l see some identification?
- Good of you to come.

226
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,307
You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

227
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,273
Just forget about this.

228
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:32,677
lt's no big deal. But we're
out here without protection.

229
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,511
- Who'd you talk to?
- lt burns my butt!

230
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:40,521
- l understand
- We're out working for the city!

231
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,160
- Who did you talk to?
- l know it's not your fault.

232
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,888
Who did you talk to?
Who did you talk to, sir?

233
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,237
- Keep it together
- Can he cool the guy out?

234
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,307
- Pretend to write in your clipboard
- ls he gonna be cool?

235
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:04,277
My motherfucker's so cool
when he goes to bed, sheep count him.

236
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,058
Appreciate that
Why are you mad at him?

237
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:18,194
He's right. He's right
Beg your pardon.

238
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,431
- Get off
- Get in the car.

239
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,040
- Get back in the car
- You know....

240
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:36,774
Give Pinky the piece
Put your hands on the wheel.

241
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,917
And keep them there
Just keep it right there.

242
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,349
We got it taken care of
lt's all right.

243
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,255
- Thanks so much
- All right.

244
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,258
Chuck! You got a phone call
right here.

245
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,725
Excuse me.

246
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,593
lt's Mr. Smith at the office.

247
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,872
- Yeah. Yeah
- Thank you, officer.

248
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:07,101
Well, it's one of those days
Got it.

249
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,319
- You son of a bitch
- Oh, that was real good.

250
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:24,791
You fucking lame! Leave me dead
and the crew on the road.

251
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,122
- l saw..
- You fucking cowboy!

252
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:31,267
- Tell me why don't l kill him?
- How about we do?

253
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,199
l'll put you down
Like the dog you are.

254
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,897
- You gonna shoot your way to stardom?
- l only...

255
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,271
l don't want you
to do anything unless...

256
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,605
We hit the city, you burn the car.

257
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,874
- l'll take the..
- No, you do it!

258
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:52,446
Car's filthy. Whole fucking job's
in the car. You do it, Pinky!

259
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,797
Get me the fuck out of here.

260
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,973
Listen, it's very simple
lt's several elements.

261
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:14,939
You got the tow truck
You got the roadblock.

262
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,783
l can do it, okay? l know the job
l got the job cold.

263
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,577
You can't cut me loose.

264
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,555
Please, guys. We got a deal here!

265
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,885
Why should we bet on you?
Young, dumb, full of cum.

266
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,565
Leave me bleeding on the side
of the road. ''He's just impetuous''.

267
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,668
Joe, security truck to the garage
We beat the tow truck...

268
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,897
What's so fucking funny?
You got no job without me!

269
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,370
You got nothing without this job.

270
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,342
You want to go down south?
You want to go broke?

271
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:55,645
Without me, you got nothing
You need the job. You need me!

272
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:59,323
- You can't take him
- Okay, l got loose, but...

273
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,253
You cannot take this lame
on the job, Joe!

274
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,429
Can we just go calm here
for a minute?

275
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,566
Go calm?
So, what happened to you now?

276
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,565
l'll tell you what happened to me.

277
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,467
l need a fucking minute
to make a decision.

278
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,076
- Fine
- Joe, can l talk to you?

279
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,718
- What the hell is it?
- They found the car.

280
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:35,690
- What car?
- The station wagon. The cops found it.

281
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,363
How could they find it?
l told you to ditch the car.

282
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,997
l stopped off to see my niece.

283
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,896
- Did you wipe it down?
- You saw your niece?

284
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,074
Did you wipe it down?

285
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:56,076
- l left my clipboard in the car
- What does this do to the job?

286
00:31:56,314 --> 00:32:00,216
- You left your clipboard?
- My leg was troubling me.

287
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,046
- The job is on the clipboard
- What about the job?

288
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,951
- The job's on the clipboard!
- Job stands.

289
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,456
- Are you crazy?
- The job stands?

290
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,893
- The job is bust. This place is burnt
- What does this mean?

291
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,294
Job stands.

292
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:22,199
You're out of your fucking mind
We can't sink with the job!

293
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,974
Tell you what
You want to run the show?

294
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,475
lt's fun to play pretend
Come on!

295
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,238
You're gonna roll over
for these guys?

296
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,715
- l gotta go away
- You took this lame on the job.

297
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,883
Can't leave with nothing.

298
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,685
You're drawing dead
You want a fucking telegram?

299
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,524
The job is dead.

300
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,667
You put your man in the street
you lamed up the job.

301
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,839
- Wait, wait, wait. Bobby!
- l can't sink with the job!

302
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,598
Wait a second. Wait a second!

303
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:04,410
Baby, you got old.

304
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,846
l'm gone, l'm out
That's it.

305
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,354
l don't see how

306
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,856
Fuck the car, Pink!

307

- Place is burnt.

310
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,635
Hold it, hold it.

311
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,705
For chrissake!
You gotta move your car.

312
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,641
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

313
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,646
What's going on?
What's the shot?

314
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,616
You got someplace to go? Some shade?

315
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,724
You best get to it
And move your car. l gotta go.

316
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,620
Shit, where's my piece?

318
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:58,058
What am l telling you?
Just follow me!

319
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:02,966
Bobby, hold on! Just a minute!
For God's sake!

320
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,541
Walking away, Bobby?
You walking out on me?

321
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,077
Are you walking out on me
you weak son of a bitch?

322
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,112
Joe, l'm sorry.

323
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,320
Gonna get in your car?
After all this time!

324
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,987
What the hell?

325
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,885
Come back here, you fucking coward!

326
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:28,462
You're a fucking coward!
Go on, get the fuck out of here!

327
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,225
Little prick.

328
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,506
- And there they go!
- That's right.

329
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,237
You get gone too.

330
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:53,687
- l would've loved to do the Swiss job
- lt's a good plan.

331
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,950
Never Ked the Swiss
Their clocks...

332
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,663
...two guys come out with hammers
and hit each other.

333
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,764
What kind of sick mentality is that?

334
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,264
You take care, pally.

335
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,635
Get Bobby's share to him.

336
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,603
- What'll you do for cash?
- We're taking down the boat guy.

337
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,973
You're gonna take his cash?

338
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,844
- l'm selling him my boat
- And then?

339
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,244
Then we'll take my boat back.

340
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:29,218
- Well, baby, then aloha
- See you later, Pinky.

341
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:34,295
lt's a shame we didn't get to do
the Swiss job. lt's a beautiful plan.

342
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,194
- Cute
- Cute as a pail of kittens.

343
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,994
- Say goodbye to your niece for me
- You bet, pal.

344
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,717
You might want to put that out, sir.

345
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,501
- Put it out. Put the cigar out
- l told him.

346
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:15,331
We got a fuel leak
trying to put your cleat in.

347
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,564
- Your arrow cleat
- Her idea.

348
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:22,609
- To put your stamp on it
- Damned if l didn't cut the fuel line.

349
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,714
l wanted to take her out tonight.

350
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,477

and l'm sorry as hell.

351
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:35,454
l'm gonna work all night and
l'll have it ready for sunup, okay?

352
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,622
All right, l want to re-ballast her.

353
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,366
Put her a bit by the stern.

354
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:55,145

guard certification and bill of sale.

355
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,871
Let me show you something pretty.

356
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,284
That's a lot of cash
to be carrying around.

357
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,924
- l brought a friend
- Nice friend to have for a rainy day.

358
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,420
Yes, sir.

359
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:15,530
- l'm sorry about that leak
- Forget about it.

360
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,760
We got forms, certifications....

361
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,095
Fran.

362
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,639
- Would you Like a cup of coffee?
- Yeah.

363
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,737
l want you to do something for me
Look at this.

364
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,549

You're gonna love it.

365
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,549
This is what l want for a figurehead.

366
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,120
Robin Hood
What do you think?

367
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:44,286
l Like it because
it puts a twist on my name.

368
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:48,555
Freccia is ltalian for ''arrow''
so you see the thing?

369
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,960
To personalize the boat.

370
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:56,265
Robin Hood, robbing from the rich
but who wants to rob from the poor?

371
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,271
Let's see. Bill of sale.

372
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,240
We got certificate of title.

373
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:08,114
1400 hours on the engine.

374

Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

377
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,649
Are you alone? Are you alone?

378
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,655
Are you alone?

379
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:38,825
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- l left my copy of the plans.

380
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,905
Hey, hold on.

381
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,669
Call Freccia.

382
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,884
Call Freccia.

383
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,093
You said the joint was burnt
l don't understand.

384
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,992
- l didn't want..
- To what?

385
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,599
l'm looking out for you two.

386
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,497
He won't answer.

387
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:17,935
What does she see in you?
You must be hung Like man-of-war.

388
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,047
You want to play the dozens?

389
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,416
Here we go.

390
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,249
There was an error at the hospital
You died at birth.

391
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,256
Cat got your tongue?
Don't you want to play?

392
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,963
Joe, leave him.

393
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,236
You going somewhere?

394
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,010
What are you
the social service lady?

395
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,292
- Going somewhere?
- Taking the baby back?

396
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,290
You can't run
You gotta do the job.

397
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,896
You know that you got to
You know you do.

398
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,729
Can you shoot me and walk away?
They'll hunt you down.

399
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,401
- Shoot him
- l can't go down there with nothing!

400
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,245
Well...

401
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,539
...that's the thing.

402
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,275
- What'll you do?
- Out!

403
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:40,188
And what? You owe them money
Think you can just sail away?

404
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,358
- They'll never let you walk away
- Get out!

405
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,113
What are we gonna do?

406
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,524
That's what everybody wants to know.

407
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,273
How do we get the gold home?

408
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,908
What's the difference?
They'll never trust you.

409
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,305
They need me to do the job.

410
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,845
How can they trust you
not to walk over?

411
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,881
- The kid came back?
- Yeah.

412
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,681
- All right. Let's start again
- Why'd the kid come back?

413
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,023
Listen.

414
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,056
He don't come back
you're on some island.

415
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,958
- l got an idea
- You should've left him on the road.

416
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,191
You shouldn't have left him
with the plans!

417
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,266
What plans?

418
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:04,531
He forgot his cheat sheet
That's why he came back.

419
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,672
He didn't forget it
because l got it right here!

420
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:18,684
What, am l gonna leave my papers
in the hands of some fucking lame?

421
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:22,016
- That's why he came back
- He came for me.

422
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,050
What?

423
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,494
He came back to make sure l was okay.

424
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,296
- He came back for you?
- That's right.

425
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,444
l know how to get the gold.

426
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:46,248
- Suit up
- Sure you want to do that?

427
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,144
- She's the go-getter
- Tell me what you want me to go get.

428
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,380
l need you to suit up
ls that all right?

429
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,058
You say it, it's right.

430
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,588
All right.

431
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,791
- We'll put the job off for a month
- For a month?

432
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:10,198
l need dates for next month's shipment
and the name of a freight forwarder.

433
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,439
Freight forwarder
and a customs broker.

434
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:19,140
- Good
- Where are you going with this?

435
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,445
You just listen.

436
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:27,252
We're gonna stand this thing
on its head.

437
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,063
Are you fucking with me?
Or are you done fucking with me?

438
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:40,702
l've financialized the problem, and
you're more trouble than you're worth.

439
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:44,599
The girl says you'll do it
You said that before.

440
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,208
Why now?
What is it, all of a sudden?

441
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:54,515
Everybody needs money
That's why they call it ''money''.

442
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,720
Let me add this sweetener.

443
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:00,082
Do the fucking job
or l'll turn you over.

444
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:05,057
l'll drop a Roosevelt dime on you
Finita la Commedia.

445
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,786
ls that strict, you fucking vonce?

446
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:11,466
Sorry to use such language
in front of a woman...

447
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:15,728
...were it not for who
l'd waste your fucking ass.

448
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,100
lf you say you'll do the job, do it
No more charades.

449
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,972
Save the bold moves
for the brilliant players.

450
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,374
- Sorry for the language
- How generous.

451
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,885
And fuck you too! Save the bullshit
He wants the job.

452
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,318
ls that a question?

453
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,497
You came begging to me, doxy
l didn't come to you.

454
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:45,964
He'll do the job next month
He needs a month.

455
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:51,106
- ls that the thing?
- ls that what l just told you?

456
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:58,375
- Ain't you a piece of work
- l came from China in a matchbox.

457
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,973
Thank you.

458
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,653
Fill up her drink
she seems to enjoy it.

459
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,189
What do you think?

460
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,793
- He's scared
- He's never scared.

461
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,498
- He's getting old
- She said that?

462
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:20,829
He's broke, he's tired
She says he wants to play ball.

463
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,336
Why should we believe her?
Why did he send her?

464
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:28,066
- She came to me
- To you?

465
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,380
- He put her up to it
- She came to me on her own.

466
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:36,575
Yeah, but as rational men
don't we have to doubt her?

467
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,517
She thinks he's weak
She's scared, she's sincere.

468
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,248
Let me put a question to you:

469
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:47,361
lf you had the job
how would you test her sincerity?

470
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:05,446
Okay, we're all on one team
all arrayed against a common enemy?

471
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:08,651
Thanks for coming
l'm going to bed.

472
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,521
- l'll see you back
- l'm all right.

473
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,917
- You're all right now
- Am l?

474
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,026
You just need somebody to lean on.

475
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:37,175
- Adrenaline gives you the shakes
- l'm okay.

476
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:41,043
l'm just saying
adrenaline gives people the shakes.

477
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,651
Some mistake it for cowardice
You could pray.

478
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,515
l'm not a religious man.

479
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,157
- There's nothing wrong with prayer
- Think so?

480
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:56,128
l knew this trooper who always
carried a Bible next to his heart.

481
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,502
- lt stopped a bullet
- No shit?

482
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,400
Hand to God, it stopped a bullet
Would've ruined his heart.

483
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:10,045
Had he had another Bible in front
of his face, he'd be alive today.

484
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,642
- What time you got?
- 5:18.

485
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,046
Make the call.

486
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:33,900
Hello? l got one of your rental
trucks. The engine quit on me.

487
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:49,901
- Nobody lives forever
- Frank Sinatra gave it a shot.

488
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,316
You'll do.

489
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,473
Good morning.

490
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,982
lt's the acid.

491
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,663
lt isn't the acid, it's the asphalt
lt's making me sick.

492
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:44,094
How can they work in that
all day long?

493
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,030
- Got any Rolaids?
- Want an Alka Seltzer?

494
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:50,671
- Doctor said not to drink
- You shouldn't then.

495
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:58,748
Same old story everywhere you go.

496
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,983
You know....

497
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,678
Oh, no.

498
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,718
- Do l know you?
- No. Please, please.

499
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:13,224
- What?
- Don't fire me. Please.

500
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,422
- What do you mean?
- Don't fire me.

501
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:20,033
l saw you in the bar
You're with the FAA.

502
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:35,583
Miss Croft, you're drinking
on the job. You're done.

503
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:40,722
l got two kids at home
Please, mister.

504
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,720
Give me your keys.

505
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,219
Mister, l need a break
l'm begging you.

506
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:53,425
l swear to you on my life that
l will never take another drink.

507
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,864
Don't fire me.

508
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,633
Did you ever ask anybody
for a break?

509
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,777
Do you have any kids?

510
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,042
Oh, Christ.

511
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:11,151
ln about three minutes

...in which is hidden
three dangerous items.

00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,933
lt's a test of
the personnel under you.

516
