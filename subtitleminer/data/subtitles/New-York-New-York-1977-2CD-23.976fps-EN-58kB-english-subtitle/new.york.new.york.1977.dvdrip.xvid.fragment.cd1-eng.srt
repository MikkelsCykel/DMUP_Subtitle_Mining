1
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:22,080
God bless America!
We made it back!

2
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,478
Times Square, believe me,
is wall-to-wall people,

3
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:48,946
human beings bent on having
the greatest party ever

4
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,984
and being in on a bit of this history.

5
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,316
What a night this is!
What a thrill!

6
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,979
Our boys are coming home,

7
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,958
and a lot of them are here right now,
right in the middle of this chaos.

8
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,823
I've talked to them.

9
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:04,363
They're from Arkansas, ;
Colorado, ; Seattle, Washington, ;

10
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,365
Los Angeles, ;
Aberdeen, Washington.

11
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,368
Looking around Times Square
at this very minute,

12
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:11,370
people are deliriously happy.

13
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:15,875
They're holding up newspapers
with huge 8-to-10 inch headlines...

14
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:19,378
"V-J Day," it says,
"War's End," "It's Over."

15
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,505
Now they're hugging
and kissing each other,

16
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,708
shouting words
of cheer and encouragement.

17
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:26,843
And still, paper by the torn keeps
flowing out of the windows

18
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,410
high, high above us.

19
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,124
...and the USO shows, too.

20
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,721
Our hats are off to all of those
people in show business

21
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:40,163
who traveled the world

22
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:44,294
entertaining our men and women
overseas and here at home.

23
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,404
Times Square is happy,
New York is happy,

24
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:52,809
the United States is happy,
and the world is at peace.

25
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,185
Tommy, I know all America
wants to thank you

26
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,155

30
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,691

Listen, it I wanted to get in touch
with you anyway, could I?

39
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:12,018
Let me take a minute ot your time,
I know you trom someplace,

40
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,349
We met a tew years ago at a party
or a dance, I can't remember,

41
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,855
We had a long conversation,
We really liked each other,

42
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,857
The problem is,
I want to see you again,

43
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,086
My mother and tather are down there,

44
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,250

Hey, look at those easy boxers!

50
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,148
Did you jump trom Hawaii
or what?

51
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:25,987
Jump trom Hawaii?
Man, I won these in a card game,

52
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,219
This guy had three deuces,

53
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,193
Little did the sucker know
that I had three 3s,

54
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:33,198
- Oh, three 3s, Yes!

55
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,200

00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,238
- You don't remember me?

61
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,874
You don't remember

62
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,011
It was at party or a dance,
We had a long conversation,

63
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,385
- You can't remember that?
- No,

64
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,186
I just want to explain to you,
tirst ot all, my parents are over there...

65
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,193
my mother and tather,
my brother and sister,

66
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:38,253
I got to see them because I just was
two years in the service, you know,

67
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,457
so they haven't seen me,

68
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:40,590
Now, I want to get your phone number

69
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:41,998
so I can tell you tomorrow
about what I was thinking about,

70
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:44,195
There's something very, very important
I've got to talk to you about,

71
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,931
- No,
- No what?

72
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:48,972
- No what?
- No,

73
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,976
No, no, You don't understand,

74
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,979
Give me your number,
You got a pencil?

75
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:55,207
No,

76
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:56,612
I have a photographic memory,

77
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:58,344
Just give me your number,
and I'll remember it,

78
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,407
- No,
- Yes,

79
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:05,321
Can I meet you at Central Park?
I'm serious,

80
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,188
I know, No,

81
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,894
I mean, come on,
There's no way...

82
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:12,954
No!

83
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,093
That seat's taken,

84
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,968
I know it's taken, but I'm gonna
sit here and tigure out another angle,

85
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,507
You can skip it, because I've
heard every angle here tonight,

86
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,803
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah,

87
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:26,869
How about this one?
"Gee, that's a,,,

88
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,675
,,, swinging band,"

89
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,710
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
really I don't,

90
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,685
but I do have triends,
and they are coming back,

91
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,278
so why don't you just leave?

92
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,880
Why don't I leave
as soon as they come back?

93
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,515
Why don't you just leave now?

94
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,753
It I leave now,
I'll never get to know you,

95
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:44,797
I'll never get to know what
a wondertul, beautitul chick you are,

96
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,197
I'm serious, Even though
I'm giving you a line, I'm serious,

97
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,202
- And I know you know that,
- I know that,

98
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,204
And I mean that trom
the deepest part ot my heart...

99
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,762
which is not too deep,

100
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:01,603
Look, why don't you just go
someplace else and try it again, huh?

101
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:03,170
All right,

102
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:16,751
Pardon me,

103
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,232
Was that tellow in the Hawaiian shirt
and the white pants,

104
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,892
was he disturbing you?

105
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,731
'Cause I know him,
I see him around, He's a little crazy,

106
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,566
No, he's not crazy,
He's just pushy,

107
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,902
Well, you know what
he said about you over there?

108
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,202
What?

109
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,640
Nothing,

110
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:36,906
Stop it,

111
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,422
Look, all right,
all right, all right! Enough!

112
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:52,854
Look, I'm going to get serious,

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,934
When I walked in there
and I saw you,

114
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:57,993
I realized
I tought this war tor a reason,

115
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,538
When I was in my toxhole,

116
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:02,096
when I was, like, not knowing
whether I would live or die,

117
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,437
in the mud, dirty,

118
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,069
who the hell knew...
I didn't know anything,

119
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,772
Is it all right? Take only
a minute ot your time,

120
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:15,613
Now, when I walked in there,
I knew! I knew!

121
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:17,645
You knew what?

122
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:20,124
I knew that I wasn't
gonna get anywhere at this table,

123
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,785
Now I'm impressed,

124
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,365
Well, I guess a little small talk's
in order here now,

125
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:33,337
Can it get any smaller?

126
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,374
I can take a hint,

127
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:38,239
- Can you also take a walk?
- You want me to leave?

128
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,335
Yes,

129
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,039
- I'll leave right now,
- Bye!

130
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:43,878
You expect me to leave atter
the way you talked to me just now?

131
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,713
Will you go away?

132
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:46,945
I don't want to,

133
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:51,222
I want to stay here
and annoy you,

134
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,017
Go away!

135
00:11:57,497 --> 00:12:01,228
Look, let's avoid all this, huh?
Let's get down to business,

136
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,268
It's getting a little tiring here,

137
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:06,772
Give me your phone number
and we'll avoid all this,

138
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,205
Why don't I not give you my
phone number and we'll avoid all this?

139
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,640
- What's to be avoided?
- You,

140
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,904
But that cannot be avoided,

141
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:15,209
It you had one ounce ot
a gentleman in you, you'd go away!

142
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,873
Well, I'm not a gentleman,

143
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,281
- Oh, well, that explains everything,
- Who said I was a gentleman?

144
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:23,379
Do I look like a gentleman
in this shirt and these pants to you?

145
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:24,445
Well,,,

146
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:28,994
Even a louse would go away,

147
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,893
Why can't you just
give me the phone number?

148
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,089
What am I gonna do with it?

149
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:33,291
Call it!

150
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,465
Please?

151
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,244
All right, look,
I give up, I give up,

152
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,405
I'll take a rain check,

153
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,177
Maybe next war,

154
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,582
What makes you think
you'll win the next one?

155
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:54,642
Hey, Evans!

156
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,244

I'm excited,
It's V-J Day, man!

218
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,433
You know, I want to get laid,
What's happening here?

219
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,108
Oh, look at her now,
Oh, ho ho, look at that,

220
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,810
Look how cocky she is,

221
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,880
You know what I'm going to do?
You go over there,

222
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:00,721
and you tell her that
I was wounded in action,

223
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:03,728
Tell her I was wounded in action,
I just got out ot the hospital,

224
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:06,424
and I'm a little shy
and a little nervous,

225
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,434
Tell her I'm sensitive,
Lay it on like I'm a war hero,

226
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:11,265
- A war hero,
- Okay,

227
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,168
Not too heavy, Indirect, okay?

228
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,173
I'll wait here,
and then I'll come over,

229
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,233
Lay it on her real well
because I want to get her,

230
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,210
You understand? I'm gonna
really screw with this one,

231
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,179
Leave it up to me, okay?

232
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:25,411
Wait, wait, wait...

233
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:29,079
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
Tell me what you're going to do,

234
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,680
Don't worry, Leave it up to me,
You know how I am with girls,

235
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,520
What else about
the other thing, though?

236
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,184
I'm sensitive,

237
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,229
Sensitive, sensitive,

238
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:40,129
Sensitive, Oh, you're sensitive,
Oh, right, right, right, okay,

239
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:44,903
Wait, wait,

240
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,961
For her, I'm doing all this?

241
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,530
I'm gonna go over,
Just introduce me to her, I'll handle it,

242
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:55,269
This is Francine Flannery,

00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,135
We're old triends,

Seems you give things away
easily, huh?

260
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:45,021
- Did you have something in mind?

261
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,690
What you just said betore,

262
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,700
You said that
I give things away easily,

263
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,328
I said, "Did you have something in mind,"
meaning I would give anything

264
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:55,703
ot myselt easily to you,
which I could do very easily,

265
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:59,210
He'll only be there

266
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:01,212
Got any Juicy Fruit?

I'm don't wanna argue, That's it, Bye,

273
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:43,909
I'm sure it's Doyle,

274
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:47,976
I'm sorry, There's no Doyle
registered here,

275
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,544
You see, a triend ot mine

A triend ot his, Ellen Flannery,

Sure, Ellen,,,?

281

Yeah, she's atraid ot heights,
I'm worried about her,

282
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:06,193
It she's on a tloor that's too high,
you know, she gets dizzy,

283
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:10,173
That would be awful tor the hotel,
Acrophobia,

284
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,337
Excuse me just a second,

285
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:16,574
Mr, Powell?

286
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,076
That's him, Mr, Doyle!

287
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,379
- Mr, Powell,

This will only take
a minute, Mr, Powell,

294
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:41,094
Where's Ellen?

295
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:43,539
What luck, running into you,
Fancy meeting you here!

296
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,598
Boy, you're a winner,

297
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:47,373
Every time I run into you,
you're always causing me great problems,

298
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,437
- Pleasure, Good to know you,

299
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:50,812
You just ruined it tor me,

300
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:52,874
Do you realize
he's calling the manager now?

301
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,384
He's calling the manager,

302
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:57,445
He's calling the manager
because I'm here under an alias!

303
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,855
And they're upstairs in the room,
We're all gonna get arrested,

304
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,392
You have to go up there now

306
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:04,792
because I have an audition now,

307
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:08,856
I have an audition, and it you mess
that up, I'm gonna get even with you,

308
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,868
I don't care how, but I am
gonna get even with you,

309
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,096
'cause you ruined it!

310
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:14,231
Get up there right now!

311
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,001
I said do you mind?
I'm having a talk with my sister,

312
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:17,508
It's a tamily crisis,
Do you mind?

313
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:18,565
Yes, I do mind,

314
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,771
Well, you're gonna have
to wait a minute, that's all,

315
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,610
Sis, oh, please, sis,

316
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:24,876
Now, Mommy's waiting,

317
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,885
When I went home on my leg,
she was worried tor a tew days,

318
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:31,821
Mr, Powell, please, you've run up
quite a bill with us,

319
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,221
You've only been here a week,

320
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,283
Would you mind telling me
where you were betore that?

321
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,918
- Where was I?
- That's right,

322
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,519
Do you mind telling me where you were?

323
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:41,225
Because you know where I was?
I was in Anzio!

324
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,566
Anzio!

325
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:45,963
I remember now!

326
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:47,961
All right, tine, Mr, Powell,

327
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,600
Wait a minute, I get
carried away, Sorry, Listen,

328
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,735
Five nights at the Commodore,
three nights at the Saint Regis,

329
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:54,176
25 minutes at the Plaza,

330
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,406
Enjoyed room service at each,

331
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:57,073
In one case, use
ot the hotel limousine,

332
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,140
Why do you switch hotels
so otten, Mr, Powell?

333
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:00,708
You don't even know
what you're talking about,

334
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,777
First ot all, how could I
even sign these checks?

335
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:04,117
These are your signatures right there,

336
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:06,589
But this is my signature hand,
It doesn't even work,

337
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:07,647
You see this?

338
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,353
You see that?

339
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,089
There's no lite in that arm,

340
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,494
I might have it amputated tomorrow,

341
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:14,054
and you're telling me
that I signed these bills?

342
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,532
How? Did I sign
with my lett hand?

343
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,432
I'm right-handed,
How can I sign with my lett hand?

344
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,494
Look at that signature,
Look at it,

345
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:22,199
Isn't this your sister?
She oughtta know your signature, sir,

346
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:24,640
Listen to this,
He's telling me I signed this,

347
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,234
- Is that my signature?
- Yes,

348
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:29,041
That's your sister,
She oughtta know your signature,

349
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:30,445
- That's not my signature,
- Yes, it is,

350
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,847
That's his signature,

351
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,681
She's a little crazy, She's wacky,
You know, in the WACs?

352
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:35,742
Yes,

353
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:38,052
Sis, you gotta go home,

354
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:39,112
No,

355
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:40,988
- West 55th Street,
- What? No!

356
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,459
- I'm not gonna do this,
- Go home, now!

357
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,622
- All right,
- Remember Anzio, on the beach,

358
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:48,131
No, No, no, It's this way,

359
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,497
It's this way,

360
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,559
And right away!
And I'll meet you later!

361
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,229
Mr, Powell, I think it advisable...

362
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,432
This is a mistake!
This is harassment!

363
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,997
I'm not coming to this hotel,

364
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:59,009
I'm gonna put in
a complaint with the manager,

365
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:01,170
- Where is the manager?
- Would you lower your voice, please?

366
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:03,237
I think you have a lot ot nerve,
You see this?

367
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:06,148
When that happens,
and you can't explain why,

368
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,345
You want to see my leg?
It's all wood,

369
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,887
- That's terrible,
- You can knock it anywhere,

370
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:11,422
You can drive nails through it,

371
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,822
It's the best kind ot wood,
but still, it's a wooden leg,

372
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,018
You have a cushy job,

373
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:18,426
I lost this leg just so you can accuse me
ot not paying bills in a hotel?

374
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:19,987
I can't believe this,

375
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:22,863
Would you push it ott, please?
I can't even control it,

376
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,601
Honey, are you all right?

377
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:27,832
Oh, yeah, I'm just great,

378
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:29,203
Well, do you have any last words?

379
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:31,174
She... sorry,
Did I scare you?

380
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:32,710
No, no,

381
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:40,049
Listen, I've had her
tor three years on two tronts,

382
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:41,949
She's had every germ
known to man,

383
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,715
I hope you're not
one ot them, DiMaggio,

384
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,848
- It's Di Muzio,
- Is this Jimmy's case?

385
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:47,323
What's the matter?

386
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:50,725
Can't you take a joke,
tor crying out loud?

387
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:52,889
Well, whatever your name is,
take good care ot her,

388
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:55,160
What'd you say about germs?
What germs you talkin' about?

389
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:56,360
Killers,

390
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:58,995
Just...

391
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:01,862
Forgotten, but not gone,

392
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,171
- Uh, 242...
- Hotel Olcott, please,

393
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:11,375
Wait just a second,
2842 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, please,

394
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,384
Do you mind it I take this cab?

395
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,181
Well, yes, I do,
but do I have a choice?

396
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:16,846
No, you don't have a choice,
I have an audition,

397
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,015
Do you have an audition?
I have an audition,

398
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,388
I'm late tor the audition,

399
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:23,019
Why don't you come along?
You have nothing better to do anyway,

400
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:25,359
How do you know that?
I was thinking ot doing my nails,

401
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,022
What's it going to be...
Brooklyn or what?

402
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:30,591
I just said it's gonna be Brooklyn,
2482 Flatbush Avenue,

403
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,836
2842 Flatbush Avenue,

404
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:35,339
Same thing,

405
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,810
- What did you say about your nails?
- I said I was thinking ot doing them,

406
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:41,607
Well, why don't you do them?

407
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,350
Oh, why you so serious?

408
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,080
Oh, come on, loosen up,

409
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:52,215
Come on, You gave me
a hard time last night,

410
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,623
really a hard time,
Loosen up a little bit,

411
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:59,363
Oh, come, come,
Let's have some gum,

412
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,333
This way, you keep your mouth shut,
lt'll keep you occupied,

413
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:04,926
No, thank you,

414
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,869
Bet you're really enjoying this ride,
aren't you?

415
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,874
I'm having a hell ot a time,

416
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:14,003
Well, I'm nervous because ot
this audition and everything,

417
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,070
so I've got to chew,
Relaxes me,

418
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,408
Oh, God,
I'm so nervous about this,

419
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:22,385
You make it worse, too,

420
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:25,685
So what did you say
your name was?

421
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:27,384
I didn't say,

422
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:30,394
- You didn't say?
- No,

423
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:34,361
- Would you do me a tavor?
- What?

424
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,196
Would you hold something tor me?

425
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:37,292
What?

426
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,303
Give me your hand,

427
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:42,306
- For good luck,
- For good luck?

428
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,537
Oh! That's very tunny!

429
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,510
You got a real
sense ot humor, kid,

430
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:53,009
Boy, I can't believe it,

431
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,555
Listen, I want to
ask you something,

432
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,591
You want to know what
interests me the most, Frances?

433
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:05,157
One is music,

434
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,323
number two is money,

435
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,889
and number three is,,,

436
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:13,727
I got it,

437
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:19,001
Uh-huh, Got it,

438
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:21,443
- What's the matter?
- I don't want it,

439
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:23,378
They always in that order?

440
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:26,849
Sure they're always
in that order, unless,,,

441
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:29,512
you happen to come across
someone who grooves you

442
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:31,522
and you want to groove with...

443
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,353
Say, you,

444
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:34,790
And it things work out,

445
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,795
and you start acting
a little more intelligent,

446
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:41,526
then possibly, then I'll make
number three number one,

447
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,330
number one
number three, and,,,

448
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,303
number two,,,

449
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:47,838
Now, wait,

450
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:50,875
Now, now, wait,
Now I'm getting contused,

451
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:52,876
You put it where, uh,,,

452
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:56,107
You put it where number three is,

453
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:58,445
That's the way it would be,
Let me start all over again,

454
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:00,610
Let me get this,,,

455
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:03,051
Number three
would be number one,

456
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,554
And number two and number three,

457
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:06,557
Exactly,
and when you have that,

458
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,492
you have what you call
a major chord,

459
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,529
What's a major chord?

460
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,326
A major chord is when everything
in your lite works out pertectly,

461
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,959
when you have everything
you could ever possibly want,

462
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:18,024
Everything,

463
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:20,503
You have the woman you want,
you have the music you want,

464
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:23,040
and you have enough money
to live comtortably,

465
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:24,939
That's a major chord,

466
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:27,267
Oh,

467
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:31,747
A 1, 2, 3, 4!

468
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:56,938
That's enough, Doyle,
Hold it,

469
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:00,310
Doyle!

470
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:01,845
What?

471
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,676
I got a hangover,
That's a little loud,

472
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:06,683
A little loud? What do you mean?
You didn't dig those sounds?

473
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:10,118
You didn't even let me tinish, man,
You didn't let me tinish the chorus,

474
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,382
Jimmy?

475
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,324
Uh,,, Jimmy, could I talk to you
just tor a minute?

476
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,564
I'll just be a sec...

477
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:21,565
Look, you know what's happening?
You're playing territic,

478
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:22,657
Yeah,

479
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,895
I think you should play it
just a little smoother,

480
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,699
like a ballad or something,

481
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:29,137
I think this guy's got
that kind ot attitude,

482
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,300
You know, the whole joint
screams that sort ot thing,,,

483
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:34,004
Well, that's all right,
Are you my agent?

484
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,637
Want 10%, huh?

485
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,639
Sit over there,
Sit over there,

486
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,685
I said when we came to sit over there,
Now sit over there,

487
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,185
Just rude, Rude,

488
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:44,017
See what you did?

489
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:46,557
Come here,
Come here, Come here,

490
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,060
Don't do that
in tront ot everybody,

491
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:51,925
We do this all the time,

492
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:55,433
Don't talk to me like that
and don't touch me,

493
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,934
I just want to say I'm sorry,
I just got annoyed at him, you know,

494
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:00,403
Sometimes I put my toot in my mouth,

495
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:03,566
- How about my toot in it?
- How about putting your horn in it?

496
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:08,875
- Well, that's what we're here tor,
- How about giving me a break?

497
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,574
Come here, Doyle,
I want to talk to you,

498
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:13,209
- Get a load ot this guy, huh?
- He wants you to come over there,

499
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,082
Come on! Come here, come here,

500
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:17,087
Go there, go there, go there,

501
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:18,918
Go ahead,

502
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,014
Yeah,

503
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,059
Try and understand
my situation, will ya?

504
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,722
What I got is a boy singer
and an eight-piece polka orchestra,

505
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,059
you understand?

506
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:30,893
Try Chevalier,
You know any Chevalier?

507
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:33,130
The guys come back trom France,
they like that sound,

508
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,629
Chevalier?

509
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,399
Yeah,

510
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,741
Hey, man, I play that stutt,
I kill people, you know?

511
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:44,907
This isn't 1917, You look
a little more hip to me than that,

512
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:46,746
I'd rather get a job in a post ottice,

513
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:48,718
In that case, Doyle,
let's torget it,

514
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:50,414
Yeah, let's torget it,

- No, that's what I said,

516
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,750
- No, I said torget it,
- No, I said it, I forgot it,

517
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:58,194
It the nightingales
could sing like you

518
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:02,165
They'd sing much sweeter
than they do

519
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:05,897
'Cause you've brought
a new kind ot love to me

520
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:06,960
Play!

I'd want to dream

I know that I'm a queen

00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:32,219
Still I understand

526
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:37,200

Can you dance?

Not you, her,
What's the matter, you crazy?

00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,816
Hello? Tony,

00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:49,883
- Yes, sir, may I help you?

559
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:52,054
Fine, It you'll
just sign the register,

560
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,859
Do you have
any more bags outside?

561
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:56,298
Yes, I do, I have
one in the cab over there,

562
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,232
It you wouldn't mind
waking up the belhop,

563
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,565
I don't want to disturb him,

564
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:02,504
Wake him up and send him outside
and just pay the bill also,

565
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:04,769
and then you can put it on this bill,

566
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,038
We'll wake him in a tew minutes,

567
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:11,309
I'm sort ot ready to go back to work,

568
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:14,317

570
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:19,322
- Why here?
- Why not here?

571
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,187
Because I'm gonna get blamed
when you don't pay the bill,

572
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:23,022
and you know

00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,530

577
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,265
We'll just put that
on the bill, okay?

578
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:36,830
When he wakes up,
we'll send him out,

579
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,308
All right, Jimmy,

592
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,236

Oh, thank you very much,

Tony?

596
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:48,178
What do you want?

597
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:51,340
Right, Frankie Harte,
7:30 tomorrow morning,

598
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,680
No! No!

599
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:09,052
Beautitul, Beautitul,

600
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:13,758
Hey, Pops,
are you Jimmy Doyle?

601
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,765
Want to play the blues?

602
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,266
Are you Jimmy Doyle?

603
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,497
No,

604
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:25,041
You're the sax player, ain't you?

605
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,172
I'm a sax player,
but I'm not Jimmy Doyle,

606
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,681
Do you think it's possible
that you can communicate

607
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:34,183
with Jimmy Doyle
the sax player?

608
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,652
Depends on what
you want me to communicate,

609
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:39,189
I have a very important missive
tor Jimmy Doyle,

610
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:42,021
- A what?
- A billet-doux,

611
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:45,028
- A billet-doux?
- A Billy who?

612
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:48,530
I'll elucidate,

613
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,193
A tender message
trom a certain temale party,

614
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:52,258
For me?

615
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:53,633
- For you,
- For him?

616
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:54,694
Precisely,

617
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:58,472
Take it, Doyle,

618
00:39:59,477 --> 00:40:00,910
It's trom Francine,

619
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:03,469
She said she had
a wondertul time,

620
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,289
Hey, wait, I'll be right back,

621
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,452
- Where you goin', baby?
- Be right back,

622
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,224
That girl ain't comin', is she?

623
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:22,232
- I'm getting her now,
- Ten minutes, or you're tired,

624
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,995
What do you care?
There's no one here anyway,

625
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:26,059
You had your jam session,
and now you're not coming back!

626
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:29,106
Hey, man, hold it,
Hey, Daddy, hold it, hold it,

627
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:31,164
Hey, can I talk to you tor a minute?

628
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:33,642
- Did you read this letter?
- Ot course not,

629
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,407
What do you think I am, crazy,
read letters?

630
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:38,745
- Your name is Tony Harwell?
- That's right,

631
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:41,250
- You're an agent?
- Yeah,

632
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,913
- You're her agent?
- Ot course,

633
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:47,424
She says, "Just ask Tony
it you need any help on anything,

634
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:49,960
He's a wondertul cat,
and he appreciates talent,"

635
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:52,086
- Let me see that letter,
- I can't show you the letter,

636
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:54,256
It's a personal letter,
but that's what she said,

637
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:56,892
She also said that she's
with Frankie Harte's band,

638
00:40:56,968 --> 00:41:00,369
she's on the road, and there's
a possibility ot a spot tor me,

639
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,269
- Is that true?
- Possibility,

640
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:05,674
- A possibility?
- That's right,

641
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:09,713
You're an agent?

642
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:11,408
I reiterate, yes,

643
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:14,145
It I went down there,
would you be my agent?

644
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:15,207
No,

645
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:16,685
Why not?

646
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:19,814
I ain't interested, I'm satistied
with the list ot clients I got now,

647
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:21,552
You're makin' a mistake,
but okay,

648
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,890
I made a lot ot mistakes,
So I'll make another one,

649
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:25,895
This one's on me,

650
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:27,555
Well, where is she?

651
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:30,624
Why should I tell you where she is
it she doesn't tell you in the letter?

652
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:33,898
Then why do you take the time to come
out to Brooklyn to give me this letter

653
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:35,905
it you don't think
she cares enough about me

654
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:37,531
to let me know where she is,

655
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:40,577
or to let you know
to let me know where she is?

656
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,738
Doesn't that make sense to you?

657
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:45,044
It should, but it don't,

658
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:48,884
- They're in Asheville,
- Asheville?

659
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:51,979
But don't mention my name,
It Frankie asks me, I don't know you,

660
00:41:52,056 --> 00:41:55,082
I'll say I never even met you,
I don't know you,

661
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,094
- Where is Asheville?
- Where God lost His shoes,

662
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:00,426
Where God lost His shoes,
That's a good answer,

663
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:02,898
Thanks a lot, I'll tind it,

664
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,435
Asheville is a mountain resort
in North Carolina,

665
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:08,529
Thanks tor telling me,
You got any other advice tor me?

666
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:11,200
Yeah, Stay ott the junk,
and you'll go tar,

667
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,266
Fine, Thanks a lot,
Swell ot you to say that,

668
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:55,078
Once in a while

669
00:42:55,152 --> 00:43:01,250
Won't you try to give
one little thought

670
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:03,816
To me

671
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:13,770
Though someone else
may be nearer your heart?

672
00:43:16,474 --> 00:43:20,103
Once in a while

673
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:24,443
Won't you think ot the moments

674
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:29,145
I shared with you

675
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:38,561
Moments betore we two
dritted apart?

676
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:47,798
In love's smoldering embers

677
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:53,674
One spark may remain

678
00:43:53,744 --> 00:43:59,683
It love still can remember

679
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:06,679
That spark may burn again

680
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:09,486
They lett? Where did they go,
do you know?

681
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:12,485
Roanoke?

682
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:15,862
It is? It's the Maytair Club
in Roanoke, Virginia?

683
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:17,423
Hello?

684
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:18,866
All aboard!

685
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:21,268
Thank you!
Thank you very much,

686
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:29,276
Come on,

687
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:52,535
You are my lucky star

688
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:58,439
I saw you trom atar

689
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:03,378
Two lovely eyes,
at me they were gleaming

690
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:06,575
Beaming

691
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,585
I was starstruck

692
00:45:09,653 --> 00:45:15,182
You're all my lucky charms

693
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:17,784
I love,,,

694
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,865
- Keep the change,
- Here's your change,

695
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:24,400
No, no, that's tor you, Keep it,

696
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,868
- Ah, it's only a nickel,
- That nickel's tor you, It's a tip,

697
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:28,427
Ah, take it,

698
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,533
- You don't want the nickel?
- No,

699
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:32,940
All right, I'll take it,

700
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:39,111
You are my lucky charms

701
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:45,144
I'm lucky in your arms

702
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:48,851
You opened heaven's portal
here on earth

703
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:50,325
For this poor mortal

704
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:56,299
You are my lucky, lucky star

705
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:29,430
Look at that tive-star pain in the ass
out there, will ya?

706
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,195
Look at him clap,

707
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:34,203
I'm goin' over there
and stutt him in the garbage can,

708
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:37,536
No, It's all right,
He may be a vet, you know?

709
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:39,633
- I think I know him,
- He's a dummy,

710
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:34,194
Okay, hold it,
Hold it! Hold it!

711
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:39,531
Please, Now, look,
you go back up on the bandstand,

712
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,230
I'm gonna come
right back up there with you,

713
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:43,535
Jimmy, I'll talk to you
atter the set is tinished, all right?

714
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:46,098
Atter the set? Okay, Sure,

715
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,769
But tirst, I'm gonna have
a word with him,

716
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:54,049
All right, you're upset because
I didn't come to you in person

717
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:55,847
and say good-bye, right?

718
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,048
Right, Which brings up another thing...
you don't say good-bye to me,

719
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:00,818
I say good-bye to you,

720
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:03,826
In no way, shape, or torm
do you say good-bye to me,

721
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:06,863
- I say good-bye to you,
- Oh,

722
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:10,560
- Fine! Go ahead and say it,
- Say what?

723
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:12,761
Say good-bye, Go ahead,

724
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:14,826
Come here,

725
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:20,076
Come here,

726
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:22,078
Oh, I see,

727
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:25,582
I'll just have to wait
until you say come here, right?

728
00:48:25,649 --> 00:48:28,083
And then when you say come here,
I'm supposed to come here,

729
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:29,585
Look, look,

730
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:33,521
You think I came all the way down here
to argue with you, huh?

731
00:48:33,591 --> 00:48:37,027
You think I came all the way down here,
chased you, to argue with you?

732
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:38,356
I'm just contused,

733
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:42,058
Didn't you understand when I said
"major chord" that I meant it about you?

734
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:51,368
Sometimes you really are
hard to understand, You really are,

735
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,933
You're hard to understand,
Don't change the subject,

736
00:48:57,348 --> 00:48:58,610
I love you,

737
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,744
I mean, I don't love you,

738
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:04,652
I dig you, I like you a lot,
and, you know,,,

739
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:07,885
I wouldn't come all the way
down here it I didn't like you, right?

740
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,949
Yeah,

741
00:49:24,842 --> 00:49:26,605
Oh, Jimmy,

742
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:32,815
How do you teel about Texarkana?

743
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:36,580
How do I teel about Texarkana?
What do you mean?

744
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,554
What I'm sayin'
is that Frankie said

745
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:42,786
that it you came down,
you could audition,

746
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,192
I could audition? No, torget it,

747
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:48,197
I'll play tor him, I won't audition,

748
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:49,857
Okay,

749
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:51,423
Don't, Jimmy,

750
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,739
Jimmy, come on,

751
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:43,252
Jay, will you, please?
It's slippery out there,

752
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,754
We don't want to slide into town,
we want to drive in,

753
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:48,485
Leave me alone,
I'm tryin' to take a nap,

754
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,187
All right, The points,

755
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:28,129
Give me some quarters,
He's beating the pants ott me,

756
00:51:28,198 --> 00:51:29,529
I'm glad I'm working tor you,

757
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,261
You should be glad
to work tor anybody,

758
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:33,701
You're not the greatest piano player
in the world, you know that?

759
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:36,569
It's gonna be one ot those nights,

760
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,733
I'm a good musician, man,

761
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:42,142
You really are,
Coming trom me, that means nothing,

762
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:23,518
Maybe someday you'll
write something tor me, too,

763
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:26,813
I am writing something tor you,

764
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:29,882
I'm writing this tor you,

765
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,928
What? You think
I check out each room?

766
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:34,555
- The last time I got a room...
- Will you get ott my back?

767
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:36,997
When you play cards,
you go crazy,

768
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:38,830
Why don't you guys zip up?
Clam up, will ya?

769
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:41,200
You don't even let me
read what you're writing now,

770
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:42,704
let alone your tirst poem,

771
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:45,264

772
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,870
Now let's go into the bridge,

773
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:56,150
It you let me read it,,,

774
00:52:57,154 --> 00:52:59,349
It you let me read some ot that,
I'll let you write the lyrics to this,

775
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:01,891
That's blackmail,

776
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:03,620
Right,

777
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:42,387
Oh, Jimmy,

778
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,559
Aw, come on, Come on,
let me see what it is,

779
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:46,296
- No, I don't want to,
- Aw, come on,

780
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,430
- No, it's private,
- It's only a poem,

781
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:51,565
Well, it's my poem,
and it's tor me,

782
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:53,075
You never let me
see what you're writing,

783
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:54,542
Well, I'm embarrassed,

784
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:04,353
You wrote all this about me?

785
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:06,355
It's all about me?

786
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:07,515
Well, most ot it,

787
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:09,115
It's all about me, though?

788
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:11,183
It's not about anybody else?
It's all about me?

789
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:12,250
That's right,

790
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:20,364
Get your shoes on, Come on,

791
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,530
- Are you all right, honey?
- Yeah,

792
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:24,096
I know it's not very good, but,,,

793
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:26,932
Come on, get 'em on,

794
00:54:30,614 --> 00:54:31,603
Come on,

795
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:35,612
I don't know
what we're doing now,

796
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:40,779
Wait a minute,

797
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:44,555
Here, pay me,

798
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:46,061
We're gonna be right back,
Few minutes,

799
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:48,222
- No, pay me now,
- I'm not gonna pay you now, man!

800
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:51,563
You think I'm not gonna have a cab
standing by in the middle ot nowhere?

801
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:53,296
We'll be back in a second, I think,

802
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:56,295
Pull it back with your hand,

803
00:54:58,609 --> 00:54:59,598
Jimmy,

804
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:07,346
You all right?
You want a handkerchiet?

805
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:10,147
- It's nothing,
- Here, I've got a handkerchiet,

806
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:16,487
- You knocked?
- Yes, I'm sorry,

807
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:20,855
I'm terribly sorry about that,
Are you the justice ot the peace?

808
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:21,920
That's right,

809
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:25,196
You are? I'm sorry about the window,
It's just, you know, we're a little anxious,

810
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:27,702
Is there a possibility that
we could be married now?

811
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:30,137
We're in a bit ot a hurry,
I can't even explain to you why,

812
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,038
I wish I could,
You can see the way we look,

813
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:33,770
- Please close this up, honey,
- Now?

814
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:36,039
Could you please? Just take
about two minutes ot your time,

815
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:38,479
We'll make it worth your while,
and I will pay tor the glass, too,

816
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:41,517
- Could you, please?
- Well,,, I guess I could,

817
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:43,212
Oh, yeah, we can arrange it,

818
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:44,776
We can arrange it,
Come on in,

819
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:49,653
No, Uh,,, just a minute,

820
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:51,717
- Can I talk to you?
- Aren't you sure?

821
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:53,888
Yeah, just one second, please,

822
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:55,454
- You're kidding, right?
- Kidding what?

823
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:57,159
- That was it?
- What was what?

824
00:55:57,234 --> 00:55:58,223
Your proposal?

825
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:01,634
"Get your coat on, Put on your shoes,
Come on, let's go," That was it?

826
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:03,229
What's wrong with that?

827
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:06,334
- They're not sure,
- Sure, we're sure,

828
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,877
What's wrong with that?

829
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:11,505
I thought it was gonna be ditterent,

830
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:13,640
It is ditterent,
It's the way I do it,

831
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:15,082
Anything wrong?

832
00:56:15,152 --> 00:56:16,551
There's nothing wrong,

833
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,145
They're not sure, believe me,

834
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:21,213
No, I just thought,,,

835
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:23,915
What?

836
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,189
Nothing, I just thought
it would be ditterent,

837
00:56:26,263 --> 00:56:27,855
Ditterent? It is ditterent!

838
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:30,365
I know it's ditterent, It's not
the kind ot ditterent I had in mind,

839
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:34,029
The kind ot ditterent I had in mind
was maybe sweet and calm...

840
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:35,935
It is calm!

841
00:56:36,006 --> 00:56:38,497
- All right, That's good,
- I'm sorry, I'm just a little,,,

842
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:41,204

843
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:43,872
- Pretty,
- It's pretty!

844
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:47,576
But you can't say that,
You can't say it's pretty,

845
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,380
I want to marry you!
What are you talking about?

846
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,887
Please go inside, go inside,
This is private,

847
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:53,582
Would you wait one second?

848
00:56:53,657 --> 00:56:54,851
I'm coming,

849
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:56,586
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes,

850
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,094
I want to marry you,
Okay, Okay?

851
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:01,494
What's the matter now?
What do you want me to do?

852
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:09,161
You want me to kill myselt

Listen, when I say "now,"

Yeah, I really liked that,

877
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:31,245
It was a lot better that way?

878
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:33,118

883
00:59:18,368 --> 00:59:19,892
Big deal, So what?

00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:25,403
Fowler grabbed the guy's gun
and started shooting out all the lights,

886
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:27,466
Cops got him now,

I gotta go bail Fowler out again,
This guy's driving me crazy,

890
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:41,418
Think I could do a couple
ot my arrangements?

891
00:59:41,491 --> 00:59:43,959
Please, not tonight,
Just play the usual, huh?

00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:45,016
Come on, man,

There are only tour people
in the audience, What's the ditterence?

894
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:49,931
I don't care about that,

00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:52,899
All right, all right,

01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:31,767
Frannie, I'm gonna cancel

01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:33,206
Again?

899
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:35,176
What do you mean "again"?

900
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:38,942
Well, this is the titth time
that you've cancelled,

901
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:40,414
But this is the tirst time I meant it,

902
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:42,747
I really mean it now,
Then I was jivin' you,

903
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:45,652
I mean it, I'm gonna
really pack it in, Yeah, yeah,

904
01:00:45,722 --> 01:00:46,848
Oh, come on, you remember,

905
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:49,858
we used to go out and do 80,
85 one-nighters in a row,

906
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:50,915
Yeah,

907
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:53,929
All those joints... they're not
ballrooms anymore, baby,

908
01:00:53,997 --> 01:00:57,364
They're like parking lots,
skating rinks,

909
01:00:57,434 --> 01:01:00,096
The theaters,
they're all bombed out,

910
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,798
I really did, I thought a lot about it,

911
01:01:02,872 --> 01:01:04,931
thought about tinally letting
somebody else tront the band,

912
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:07,374
you know,
take a piece ot the action,

913
01:01:07,444 --> 01:01:10,538
Play there,
not have to litt a tinger,

914
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,173
But there's only one guy
who can tront this band,

915
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:15,717
I know... Jimmy, right?

916
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:21,314
No, me, and it I go,,,
the band goes,

917
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:23,450
It's game over, You know it,

918
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:25,289
You sure you won't have
a little taste?

919
01:01:26,296 --> 01:01:28,958
- No, you have it,
- Oh, beautitul, I will,

920
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:36,138
Maybe Jimmy,,,
would consider,,,

921
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:38,902
You said he's good,
You think he's good,

922
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:41,307
He's not only good, baby,
he's a bitch,

923
01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:43,073
He blows a barrel
tull ot tenor,

924
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:45,740
Oh, but he's some kind
ot pain in the ass,

925
01:01:45,815 --> 01:01:49,148
- I don't want to start this argument,
- All right, okay, all right,

926
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:52,882
But he's a top pain in the ass,
and that's the truth,

927
01:01:52,956 --> 01:01:55,356
A top pain in the ass,

928
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:58,121
You want to say it once more...
three times tor luck?

929
01:01:58,194 --> 01:02:00,025
Three would groove me,
It's my tavorite number,

930
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,428
Top pain in the ass,

931
01:02:05,702 --> 01:02:08,535
Well, maybe you're right,
but he's good,

932
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:15,672
I'm sorry, Mr, Doyle,

933
01:02:15,745 --> 01:02:18,873
It's not quite what I had in mind,

934
01:02:18,948 --> 01:02:20,438
Yeah, sorry, tellas,

935
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:29,452
He wants garbage,
I don't know,

936
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:32,552
Look, Mr, Horace,
I know it's not Frankie Harte,

937
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:34,563
We can do that stutt too, man,
but this is a ditterent sound,

938
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,599
I think you should listen to it,
Just give us another chance,

939
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:38,566
This guy must be crazy,

940
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:41,229
I made a deal with
Frankie Harte and his orchestra,

941
01:02:41,304 --> 01:02:44,796
not Jimmy Doyle
and his tlying zacamaniacs,

942
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:47,399
But this is Frankie Harte
and his orchestra, without Frankie Harte,

943
01:02:47,477 --> 01:02:48,705
In tact, it's even better,

944
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:51,372
Frankie wouldn't give us the band
it he didn't think it was gonna work out,

945
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:52,915
That's true,
You know how Frankie is,

946
01:02:52,982 --> 01:02:54,745
What do you have to lose?
Come on, give me a chance,

947
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:56,046
What do I have to lose?

948
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:58,849
What does this look like to you,
a peanut gallery here?

949
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:00,913
Looks like a place that
needs someone like me,

950
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,651
that's what it looks like,

951
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,354
Give us halt a chance,

952
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,419
Where's the girl singer
you're supposed to have?

953
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:09,431
Is she stunning?
Blonde? What?

954
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:12,195
She's stunning, blonde, everything,
She walks, she talks, dances,

955
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:14,031
She'd better be good,

956
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:15,696
All right, tellas,
get on number 358,

957
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:19,031
Horace, have you gone crazy?
You've already listened to the band,

958
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:21,373
You didn't like 'em,
Why do you want to listen to a singer?

959
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:24,106
Ot course I'm crazy, How do you think
I wound up in this business?

960
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:26,946
Hello, Mr, Morris,

961
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:29,607
Okay,

962
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:46,501
When the mellow moon
begins to beam

963
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:51,063
Every night,
I dream a little dream

964
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:55,407
And, ot course,
Prince Charming is the theme

965
01:03:55,478 --> 01:04:00,677
The he tor me

966
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:06,518
Although I realize as well as you

967
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:11,822
It is seldom that a dream comes true

968
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:17,197
To me, it's clear

969
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:24,935
That he'll appear

970
01:04:25,008 --> 01:04:28,205
Someday he'll come along

971
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:32,874
The man I love

972
01:04:32,949 --> 01:04:37,010
And he'll be big and strong

973
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:40,852
The man I love

974
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:44,985
And when he comes my way

975
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:55,198
I'll do my best to make him stay

976
01:04:56,272 --> 01:05:00,834
He'll look at me and smile

977
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:04,778
I'll understand

978
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:08,476
And in a little while

979
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:12,783
He'll take my hand

980
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:16,757
And though it seems absurd

981
01:05:16,826 --> 01:05:26,133
I know we both won't say a word

982
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:35,202
Maybe I will meet him Sunday

983
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:39,146
Maybe Monday

984
01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:42,378
Maybe not

985
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:49,550
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

986
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:59,831
Maybe Tuesday
will be my good-news day

987
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:03,998
He'll build a little home

988
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:07,873
Just meant tor two

989
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:11,710
From which I'll never roam

990
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:15,581
Who would? Would you?

991
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:19,554
And so all else above

992
01:06:19,622 --> 01:06:23,285
I'm waiting tor

993
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:34,367
The man

994
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:36,701
I

995
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:45,613
Love

996
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:51,612
Thank you, Francine Evans,

997
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:54,787
"But the real winner is
singer Francine Evans,

998
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:59,317
"a spirited tilly who sports musical paces
as smooth as her torm,

999
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:02,091
Miss Evans seems headed
straight tor the winner's circle,"

1000
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:03,496
Jimmy, did you see this?

1001
01:07:03,566 --> 01:07:05,534
Yeah, I saw it,
I saw that, yeah,

1002
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:07,592
The guys are all excited,

1003
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:09,604
Everybody's all buzzing around
and everything,

1004
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,003
and Paul had a good idea,

1005
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:12,837
He said that we should
take one ot the quotes...

1006
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:16,106
like the best quote
about the... your band...

1007
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:18,170
and put it outside,

1008
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:21,478
Maybe even take something
in Downbeat or Variety.

1009
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:23,382
Very good idea,
Yeah, that's a good,

1010
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:27,685
This is a good thing, We might get
another week out ot this hotel with this,

1011
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:29,224
Did you get ahold
ot that trumpet player?

1012
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:30,850
The trumpet player,
did you get ahold ot the,,,?

1013
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:34,192
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I called his wite,
He's in Virginia on some gig,

1014
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,060
She'll give him the message
when he calls,

1015
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:38,430
It he's not gonna call,
let's go with Charlie Baxter,

1016
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:40,366
Yeah, I like him,

1017
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:41,425
Okay,

1018
01:07:41,504 --> 01:07:43,904
I don't know it he's
gonna go tor the money

1019
01:07:43,973 --> 01:07:45,372
that we're gonna be able to pay him,

1020
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:48,239
Well, that's your problem,
You get him, That's your department,

1021
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:50,870
Okay, I'll see you later,

1022
01:07:50,947 --> 01:07:53,177
Thank you, Paul,

1023
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:56,150
We've never made the papers
like this betore,

1024
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:58,653
It's really wondertul,
Thank you,

1025
01:07:58,721 --> 01:08:00,586
It's really good, It's great,

1026
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:03,659
Here I go again

1027
01:08:03,726 --> 01:08:06,286
I hear the trumpets blow again

1028
01:08:06,362 --> 01:08:08,762
I'm all aglow again

1029
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,594
Taking a chance on love

1030
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:13,592
Here I slide again

1031
01:08:15,138 --> 01:08:16,730
I know, I know, I know, I know,

1032
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:20,139
Hold it, tellas,
Jerry, you're not cuttin' it, man,

1033
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:21,904
You are not cuttin' it,

1034
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:23,002
It you...

1035
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:25,570
- What is the problem?
- It you'll just...

1036
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:26,637
Excuse me,

1037
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:31,085
You're not cuttin' it, man,
Do it as written, okay?

1038
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:32,587
How do you really
want it to sound?

1039
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:36,056
The way it's written, and the way
I explained it to you, Come on,

1040
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,114
I'll try,

1041
01:08:37,193 --> 01:08:40,424
No, don't try, do it!
Don't try, do it, do it!

1042
01:08:41,464 --> 01:08:43,932
- You playin' by yourselt?
- I don't think so,

1043
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,934
'Cause I can put you
in a room somewhere,

1044
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:47,799
you can play all by yourselt,

1045
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,770
You sound like
you got hooks tor hands,

1046
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:50,828
Funny,

1047
01:08:50,907 --> 01:08:54,434
Funny, I know, but you're being tunny,
and you're costing us a lot ot time,

1048
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:57,877
That's a little rough, wasn't it...
hooks tor hands?

1049
01:08:57,947 --> 01:09:00,313
You'd get much more out ot him...

1050
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:02,715
- Are you the bandleader?
- No, I'm not,

1051
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:06,050
Okay, you're not the bandleader,
theretore don't tell me how to do it,

1052
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:08,386
- 90% ot all drummers are crazy,
- I know that,

1053
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:11,052
Look, Jimmy, we only got
15 more minutes in this room,

1054
01:09:11,127 --> 01:09:12,754
then we gotta get out,
I gotta do my hair,

1055
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:15,662
I gotta press your shirt,
we gotta call Tony, I gotta do my nails,

1056
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:20,464
I got a lot to do,
so we should really go ahead,,,

1057
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:22,802
don't you think?

1058
01:09:26,476 --> 01:09:28,910
- Ready?
- Yeah,

1059
01:09:28,978 --> 01:09:31,708
1, 2, 1-2-3-4,

1060
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:34,011
Here I go again

1061
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,210
I hear trumpets blow again

1062
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:38,253
I'm all aglow again

1063
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:41,085
Taking a chance on love

1064
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:42,590
Here I slide,,,

1065
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:46,185
Where on earth
are you going, Nicky?

1066
01:09:46,262 --> 01:09:49,197
You're rushing that thing like we're
at the racetrack or something,

1067
01:09:49,265 --> 01:09:51,665
Listen, I'm pickin' up
the tempo trom you,

1068
01:09:51,734 --> 01:09:53,429
Did you have a tight
or something today?

1069
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:56,097
- No, I didn't,
- Well, then, what's wrong?

1070
01:09:56,172 --> 01:09:58,834
You're not pickin' up
the tempo trom anybody, man,

1071
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:01,035
You're doing exactly
what you're always doing,

1072
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,702
Your wite is slowin' it down,

1073
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:05,372
- What am I doing?
- Wait a minute, Stay out ot this,

1074
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:07,882
- What am I doing?
- Wait a minute!

1075
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:09,884
- She is slowing it down?
- Yes,

1076
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:13,718
- I am not slowing it down...
- I can handle it, I can handle it,

1077
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:15,381
She's not
slowing down anything, man,

1078
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,187
We have been through this
50 million times,

1079
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,956
You always do this, man,
