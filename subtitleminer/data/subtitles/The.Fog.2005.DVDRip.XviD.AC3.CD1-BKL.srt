1
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,033
Malone!

2
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,169
Williams, what is it?
What did we hit?

3
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,834
I don't know.
There's something in the water.

4
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,179
Clear us now, Williams.

5
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,509
- Hold steady, Wayne.
- There's something down there.

6
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,084
Clear it away.

7
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,387
I can't see anything.

8
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,996
Williams.

9
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,493
<i>Hey, out there.</i>

10
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,428
<i>You've got the one and only</i>
<i>Stevie Wayne...</i>

11
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,125
<i>... broadcasting from my own</i>
<i>little corner of the world...</i>

12
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,137
<i>... high in the KAB lighthouse</i>
<i>on Antonio Island.</i>

13
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:31,038
<i>It is perfect weather for this week's</i>
<i>dedication of the new statue...</i>

14
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,174
<i>... honoring the memory</i>
<i>of Antonio Bay's founding fathers.</i>

15
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,283
<i>So get on down to the town hall</i>
<i>and check out the monument...</i>

16
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,351
...<i>to those four brave men.</i>

17
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,149
<i>One of whom was</i>
<i>my great-great-grandfather...</i>

18
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,916
<i>... Richard Wayne.</i>

19
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,719
<i>Did I already mention that?</i>

20
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,592
David Williams.

21
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,527
Patrick Malone.

22
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,796
Norman Castle. Richard Wayne.

23
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,700
- It's all wrong.
- Oh, come on, Kathy.

24
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,601
Who cares which one
holds the telescope.

25
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,002
It's a spyglass, Tom.

26
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,168
David Williams is supposed to be
holding it. He was the visionary.

27
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,002
We've gotta get this right.

28
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,672
The four of them rode out
against impossible odds...

29
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,750
...to defend this island
with their lives.

30
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,477
I know, I know. Through the fog.

31
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,815
The Malone family name is on
that statue, Tom.

32
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,394
- It has to be accurate.
- We've got tourists arriving on Friday.

33
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,087
What do you wanna do,
send it back?

34
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,096
Fine. We'll have
the unveiling tomorrow...

35
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,599
...and I'll send it back
at the end of the season.

36
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,064
Look around you, boys.
This is God's country.

37
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,398
Anywhere you go on Earth...
Sea of Cortez, Nantucket Sound...

38
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,029
...Gulf of Mexico.... You'll never find
better fishing than what we had here.

39
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,577
- Sushi?
- No. I'm good, thanks.

40
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,609
Nice speech.

41
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,751
And you've been to how many
of those places?

42
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,545
Not a one.

43
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,019
My dad used to tell me stories.
He was the traveler.

44
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,715
Sure is a long way out
to find the sandbar.

45
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,159
Well, this is where
the ocean floor is.

46
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,662
Which is where the kelp
and the little fish are...

47
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,993
...which is why you got
some big fish here today.

48
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,668
- Mr. Spooner?
- Sir?

49
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,032
- Let's weigh the anchor, call it a day.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,285
Damn. Hey, yo, Nick.
We're snagged on something.

51
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,866
Spooner? You all right?

52
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,060
The winch is jammed.
I can't shut it off.

53
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,865
- Shut it down.
- I'm trying to.

54
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,035
Spooner. Spooner.

55
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,035
- Nick, get up here.
- Give it some slack.

56
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,737
I'm trying to, all right?
The winch is stuck.

57
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,147
Hey, I lost all my fish.

58
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,554
- We're going down.
- We're not going down.

59
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,088
- Spooner.
- Can't get it. It's not coming loose.

60
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,174
You guys okay?

61
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,850
Yeah. See?
You got a little something there.

62
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,161
Sorry about the mishap.
Come back and see us again.

63
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,027
Yeah, we'll be back.

64
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,360
What? They said they'd be back.
They... They... I believe them.

65
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,899
I was convinced, when they said...

66
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,804
..."We'll be back,"
they had the "I'll be back" face.

67
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,141
- Hey, yo, Nick.
- Yeah, in here.

68
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,146
I don't suppose they left
a brother a tip.

69
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,306
Yeah, right.

70
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,215
Hey, you know
that wasn't my fault, right?

71
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,082
Don't... Do that again.

72
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,387
Damn, you sexy as hell
when you're mad. It's incredible.

73
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,622
Where you going?
We got decks to swab.

74
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,762
I'm going to Little Ray's to get
a clutch for the one you broke.

75
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,524
I broke it?

76
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,932
Make sure you end up at Little Ray's.
Don't end up at little Stevie's.

77
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,364
- That was a one-time thing.
- All three times?

78
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,441
Because I remember the lighthouse,
then the time in the field.

79
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,704
Oh, let's not forget about
the little church parking lot, choir boy.

80
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,713
- Twice. It was twice.
- Twice all three times?

81
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,215
- Your point is?
- Really don't have one.

82
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,717
But she does know Elizabeth.
What if she blabs?

83
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,885
Elizabeth...

84
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,854
...is 3000 miles away.
She's been gone for six months.

85
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,122
Distance is not a factor.
Women have testicle telepathy, man.

86
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,787
Hose down the boat, lock it up...

87
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,092
...so we don't go out of business.
- "We"?

88
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,361
We need to book
another charter to make money.

89
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,664
I got a idea.
Why don't you do some work here...

90
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,101
...and I'll get the clutch.

91
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,866
I'm The Skipper,
and you're Gilligan.

92
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,840
Like that? After all that "we,"
now I'm just Gilligan?

93
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,843
And I'm by myself, huh?

94
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,884
So that's it, huh?

95
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,117
How much that cost?

96
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,627
A heartfelt tribute to the founding
fathers of Antonio Bay.

97
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,231
Could've used that money
down at the marina.

98
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,061
New sea-wall, shore up that pier.

99
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,430
These four men built this town
out of nothing.

100
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,801
Without their sacrifice,
there wouldn't be a marina or a pier.

101
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,272
In honoring the past,
we celebrate the present.

102
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,240
I never understood that line myself.

103
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,779
- And I'm sure you never will, Nicholas.
- Mrs. Williams.

104
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,941
Gonna come to the unveiling?
Your family's name is on that statue.

105
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,245
I can't help that, can I?

106
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,812
Oh, no.

107
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:43,229
<i>- Adrift. North-by-northwest swells</i>
<i>past the break.</i>

108
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,634
<i>Otherwise, you've got fair winds</i>
<i>and flat waters.</i>

109
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,799
<i>Oh, and me, your lighthouse keeper,</i>
<i>Stevie Wayne.</i>

110
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,171
Voice that launched
a thousand ships.

111
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,744
<i>So if you're not in the mood...</i>

112
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,246
...turn it down,
because I'm gonna turn it up...

113
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,977
...on 94.5, KAB...

114
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,486
...your island alternative to
the modern music establishment.

115
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,820
Playing the music I wanna hear.

116
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,654
- Want a ride?
- Wrong direction.

117
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,653
Not anymore.

118
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,297
You're not a freak, are you?

119
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,366
Yeah, actually, I am.

120
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,432
- Good.
- Shit.

121
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,302
I leave town, you start picking up
strange girls on the road.

122
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,172
- Elizabeth? No, no. I recognized you.
- I haven't been gone that long, Nick.

123
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,041
I knew it was you.

124
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,157
- So you're back.
- No place like home.

125
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,385
Only took you six months
to figure that out.

126
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,456
I just need to come back for a while.

127
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,301
And, Nick...

128
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,640
...next time
open the door for a lady.

129
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,015
<i>Ahoy, mateys.</i>

130
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,180
<i>Another perfect moonlit eve</i>
<i>here on the isle...</i>

131
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,484
<i>... and you're listening</i>
<i>to Stevie Wayne...</i>

132
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,595
<i>... your very own</i>
<i>beacon in the night.</i>

133
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,424
Oh, shit.

134
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,199
Can't say that on regular radio
but what the hell.

135
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,666
I can say whatever I want.
It's my very own station.

136
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,434
Listen up. Got a low-tide warning
in the a.m. For you.

137
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,737
And as I check
my lighthouse gauges...

138
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,676
...looks like the old barometer
is on the rise.

139
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:16,079
So it could be, Dan the Weatherman
might just be right for a change.

140
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,891
Hey, yo, Sean.

141
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,128
Get your ass up here
and take the helm.

142
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,431
One second, ladies.

143
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,774
Yeah. My turn to play.

144
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:41,379
- This is my cousin's boat, man.
- Well, Nick's not here, is he?

145
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,037
Huh? You see your cousin?

146
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,773
That sucks.
Why do I have to drive?

147
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,941
Because I'm The Skipper,
and you're Gilligan.

148
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,484
Oh, right.

149
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,088
Ladies, the Spooner wait is over.

150
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,458
Yeah. <i>Booty on the Boat</i>,
the new reality show.

151
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,825
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
introduce you to our guests of honor:

152
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,393
Mandi and Brandi, the twins.

153
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,796
We're not twins.

154
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,995
- My name's Jennifer.
- Sean, they're not twins.

155
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,902
- Neither are we.
- So we can do this now.

156
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,337
You swear y'all ain't twins?

157
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,910
You know you girls could model?
I could hook you up.

158
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,979
Right after this little audition tape.

159
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,214
I just gotta pick up
a part for the <i>Seagrass</i>.

160
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,978
It'll just take a second.

161
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,248
And, you, don't go anywhere,
all right?

162
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,875
You know the difference
between flotsam and jetsam?

163
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,982
- Machen.
- People get washed up on shore.

164
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,449
Some bob around at sea forever.

165
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,047
You used to be Elizabeth.

166
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,891
- I still am.
- I have something to show you.

167
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,532
If you touch it, things will change.

168
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,251
It's still ticking.

169
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,979
It wasn't ticking before.

170
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,320
Where'd you get it?

171
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,555
From the sea. Came back.

172
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,663
Sooner or later, everything does.
Do you have a lighter?

173
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,293
Yeah.

174
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:50,474
It's a hallmark. Tells where a piece
was made and roughly when.

175
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,114
Looks familiar.

176
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,377
Elizabeth.

177
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,953
Farewell, Elizabeth.

178
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,658
What was that about?

179
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,728
He found a watch on the beach.

180
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,402
That guy gives me the creeps.

181
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,832
I know it sounds crazy, but I felt like
I'd seen it somewhere before.

182
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,375
Where?

183
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,277
I don't know. Let's go.

184
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,849
- Hey, Andy.
<i>- Hey, darling.</i>

185
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,323
Hey, Dan.

186
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,462
<i>You lonely over there without me?</i>

187
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,928
Remind me why I gave you
my cell phone number again?

188
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,158
Because I'm 6 feet of burning love.

189
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,131
Actually you're 5'9", Dan.

190
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,272
Now tell me why you called,
or I'm gonna hang up.

191
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,534
Okay, okay. I just thought you might
like something to talk about.

192
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,937
<i>Okay. I'm listening.</i>

193
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,875
I got something
on my Doppler a minute ago.

194
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,275
<i>Sounds kinky.</i>

195
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,179
Looks like a fog bank
about 10 miles out...

196
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,080
...and it's moving
straight towards us.

197
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,155
Well, my gauges must be wrong then.
I'm showing a wind blowing due west.

198
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,918
<i>Now, what kind of fog</i>
<i>moves against the wind?</i>

199
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,359
You got me.
But my radar doesn't lie.

200
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,761
<i>- Gotta go. I'm on.</i>
- Okay.

201
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,266
It is just before 10 on Spivey Point.

202
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,272
This is Stevie Wayne,
beaming my signal across the sea.

203
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,707
<i>Dan the Weatherman says</i>
<i>a fog bank is rolling in offshore.</i>

204
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,909
So if I were you,
I would lock the doors...

205
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,882
...throw away the keys
and whip up a pitcher of martinis...

206
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,784
<i>... while you listen to another hour</i>
<i>of music on KAB.</i>

207
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,415
Serving up the platters that matter.

208
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,128
There's no fog out there.

209
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,731
Hey, Spooner.
You see any fog out there?

210
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,130
There's no fog out here.
Ladies, you see any fog?

211
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,997
I don't see any fog out there.

212
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,698
Did they talk about beautiful women?
Because that's definitely out here.

213
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,775
Look at this. Blurring my vision.

214
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,078
Spooner, the engine's dead.

215
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,813
Nobody care about that.

216
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,178
You know why? Because we got beer.
And for two, we got beer.

217
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,677
And after that, beer.

218
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,648
And we got music too.
That's all that matter, all right?

219
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,883
Dance over here
and have some fun.

220
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,151
Look at that. My Lord.

221
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,425
Yeah.

222
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,696
Yeah. You all wanna see
Spooner get low? Let me get low.

223
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,103
Harbor patrol, this is <i>Seagrass</i>.
Do you copy?

224
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,338
Coast Guard, this is <i>Seagrass</i>.
Do you copy? Over.

225
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,117
Damn. Wait a second.

226
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,278
This new radio is...
I don't know why it does this.

227
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,582
It's that new song
that starts with the static.

228
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,955
It starts with static then it goes to
the beat and music. Wait a second.

229
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,688
What are you doing?
No coats.

230
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,162
Coats, bad. Naked, good.

231
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,304
It's freezing out there.

232
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,200
What's going on?

233
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,313
Hell of a fog bank.

234
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,083
Where'd that come from?

235
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,459
Hey, Spooner.
What's going on out there, man?

236
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,130
Spooner.

237
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,363
Dude, do you see this?

238
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,864
So I guess New York is just, like,
the best thing ever, huh?

239
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,137
I wouldn't say that.

240
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,801
Well, you happy there?

241
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,438
Sometimes.

242
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,078
I don't know, Nick.
What do you want me to say?

243
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,617
I don't know. I wake up
one morning and you're gone.

244
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,516
No note, nothing.

245
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,923
I don't belong on this island, Nick.

246
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,026
The thing I always loved most
about you...

247
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,858
...is you were the one person
who understood that.

248
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,161
The day you left,
I bought you something.

249
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,274
- What?
- A ring.

250
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,409
You bought me a ring?

251
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,208
No. But I thought about it.

252
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,085
You're such a liar.

253
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,093
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

254
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,358
- What the hell was that?
- Murderers.

255
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,502
Nothing but murderers.

256
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,566
Blood for blood.

257
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,603
Father Malone.

258
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,439
Nicholas.

259
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,780
Elizabeth.

260
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,084
Did you see what happened
back there?

261
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,091
- I...
- Did something hit us?

262
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,825
I didn't see anything.

263
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,160
Looking for my car.

264
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,704
It's around here somewhere.
I can't...

265
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,372
Sure you're all right?

266
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,103
Yeah.

267
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,114
Man, I can't see nothing.

268
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,291
- What's going on?
- These...

269
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,821
- The hell did you do?
- Nothing. I just called for help.

270
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,493
Oh, my God. There's something
right in front of us. Look at that.

271
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,569
Stop. Screaming will get
nothing done.

272
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,075
You all right? Calm down.

273
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,770
Just get us out of here, please.

274
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,643
You're all right.
You'll be okay, all right?

275
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,809
- Are there any lights anywhere?
- Wait. One second.

276
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,920
You okay?

277
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,423
Hello?

278
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,893
Is somebody out here?

279
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,591
Hello?

280
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,251
Sean.

281
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,947
- Sean.
- Does this radio work?

282
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,824
- It's gone. It's gone.
- What?

283
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,725
- What is?
- There was a big sailing ship.

284
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,366
- Y'all didn't see that ship?
- No.

285
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,826
I'm trying to tell you...

286
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,538
It was right here.

287
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,136
Let's just see what the hell
happened to the engine.

288
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,107
Jennifer, what are you doing?

289
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,366
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I don't know.

290
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,399
Dude, let's fix it
and get out of here.

291
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,709
- What the hell is that?
- Don't know.

292
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,663
Somebody in there?

293
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:55,637
- You sure you wanna go in there?
- My mom will kill me if I don't.

294
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,346
Call you tomorrow?

295
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,888
Good luck.

296
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,663
Hello?

297
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,603
Who's there?

298
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,166
It's me.

299
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,902
Well...

300
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,307
- This is a surprise.
- A good one?

301
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,579
Don't see any suitcases. I guess
that means you're not moving back.

302
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:41,420
I thought you'd be happy
I came back at all.

303
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,526
I wish you'd called me. I...

304
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,529
I mean, it's not like
I'm running a hotel here.

305
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,130
Good to see you too, Mom.

306
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,303
You waited.

307
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,002
You lasted 30 seconds longer
than I thought you would.

308
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,684
You're learning.

309
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,550
Did you say hello for me?

310
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,118
So where to now?

311
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,020
- Let's go to your place.
- For some wild and crazy sex?

312
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,995
With a strange hitchhiker?

313
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,930
You wish.

314
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,737
Elizabeth? Hey.

315
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,437
Hey, it's... What is it?

316
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,579
What's wrong?

317
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,548
I...

318
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,412
I keep seeing people...

319
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,413
...burning.

320
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,728
And they're screaming.

321
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,866
And I'm watching and... And...

322
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,767
And then I'm drowning.

323
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,703
It's just a dream.

324
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,234
It's just a dream.

325
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,174
I've been having them a lot.

326
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,185
It's why I came home.

327
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,015
Come here.

328
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,389
Come on.

329
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,959
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

330
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,262
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

331
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,309
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

332
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,904
Elizabeth.

333
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,839
You okay?

334
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,243
What are you doing down here?
It's freezing. Come on.

335
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,317
Let's go back to bed.

336
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,038
Mom.

337
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,911
Mom, wake up. Look what I found.

338
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,580
Andy, what is that?

339
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,686
I found it on the beach
between some rocks. It's heavy.

340
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,253
Feel.

341
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,854
Looks like it must've been somebody's
hairbrush once upon a time.

342
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,854
Want me to make you
some breakfast?

343
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,759
No, I wanna go back
down to the beach.

344
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,524
Fine, just a half an hour, okay?

345
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,794
I have to go into work early.
I have a very busy day.

346
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,528
Can I come to the station with you?

347
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:11,102
No. Not today, hon.

348
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,039
I have too much work to do.
But maybe later in the week, okay?

349
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,204
How's that?

350
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,645
Maybe Aunt Connie'll go to the beach
with you and help you find more stuff.

351
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,949
No.

352
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,891
All she does is eat Ding Dongs
and watch <i>Jeopardy!</i>

353
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,524
I love you.

354
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,598
"Love you too, Mom."

355
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,599
It's usually after a storm when
anything's washed up on the beach.

356
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,899
Yeah, but we haven't had
a storm in months.

357
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,443
- It's an interesting piece, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

358
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,849
- I'll let you know.
- Thanks.

359
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,395
Oh, this is a beautiful piece.

360
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,668
If it washes up on the beach,
it's ours now, right?

361
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,828
Well, technically speaking.

362
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,031
So, what's it worth?

363
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,393
Hey, Nick.

364
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,393
Stevie, how you doing?

365
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,192
Great. I hear your girl's
back in town.

366
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,598
- Yeah, she is. She's back.
- Good. She's gonna be here a while?

367
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,936
Who knows.

368
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,972
Yeah, who knows.

369
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,777
Saved by the bell.

370
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,511
Hello? Hey, Uncle Hank.

371
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,008
- Elizabeth?
- Mr. Latham.

372
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,241
It is you. How are you, dear?

373
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,019
- Good.
- God, we missed you around here.

374
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,049
What are you up to?

375
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,417
This stamp. I feel like I've
seen it somewhere before.

376
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,356
You recognize it at all?

377
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,723
No. Can't say I do.

378
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,696
But I know Prince William Island.

379
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,133
It was a big trading post up north.

380
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,433
Gold, seal furs, fox pelts.

381
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:08,908
They traded with Shanghai
for spices and jade.

382
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,981
A lot of people got rich in a hurry.

383
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,710
So then why did they stop
production suddenly in 1871?

384
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,917
Nobody lived there
after the outbreak.

385
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,852
What outbreak?

386
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,553
Leprosy.
The Chinese brought it over.

387
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:30,064
Wiped out half the island.
The other half left by ship.

388
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,601
That's as much as I know.
They never came back.

389
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,705
- Elizabeth.
- Nick, what's wrong?

390
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,967
Hank just called.

391
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,338
Spooner took the <i>Seagrass</i> out
and never came back.

392
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,440
We gotta go.

393
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,920
Like I said on the phone...

394
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,187
...I saw them head out
last night at 8:30.

395
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,728
Haven't been heard from since.

396
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,992
- And no one's seen her?
- Not that I've heard.

397
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,395
- I gotta call the Coast Guard, Nick.
- Don't do that just yet.

398
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,698
They... They're probably just...

399
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,604
...anchored up the channel
somewhere. We'll go find them.

400
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,608
- Can we use your boat?
- Sure.

401
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,371
Thanks.

402
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,145
Spooner!

403
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,216
Spooner?

404
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,190
Maybe somebody picked him up.

405
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,090
Let's hope.

406
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,026
Look at this.

407
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,294
The gauges are all smashed.

408
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,738
Got a half a tank of gas.

409
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,736
The engine still works.

410
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,725
Spooner?

411
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,463
Sean?

412
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,230
Sean?

413
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,814
Nick?

414
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,958
- Nick, what's wrong?
- Sean. He's dead.

415
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,558
- What?
- His eyes...

416
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,921
- What?
- He's dead.

417
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,996
No!

418
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,958
Oh, God. Oh, God.

419
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,662
Go inside. Call for help.

420
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,410
Mayday. Mayday.

421
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,879
Hello?

422
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,054
No!

423
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,838
Let me go. Jennifer.

424
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,792
Did he say anything to you two?

425
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,457
Not a word.

426
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,332
Mayor, you still want me
to lock him up?

427
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,438
Lock him up for what?

428
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,338
You saw the bodies.

429
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,276
You think they got that way
by accident?

430
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,287
Tom, Coast Guard wants you
on the radio.

431
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:28,221
You tell your pal, when he thaws out
he better have a damn good story.

432
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,168
I hid from it.

433
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,842
You hid from what?

434
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,212
It killed them.

435
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,038
The fog killed them.

436
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,776
I hid in the freezer.
It couldn't get in the freezer.

437
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,442
All right, Spooner, just relax.

438
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,851
You're not making any sense.
You'll be all right.

439
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,253
Okay, guys, we'll take care of him.

440
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,957
Okay, come on.
It's gonna be all right.

441
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,864
It's okay now. It's okay.

442
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,737
The fog killed them?

443
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,173
Look. I found this on the boat.
Take it. Keep it safe.

444
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,541
It's a piece of evidence.

445
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,048
It might prove
that Spooner's innocent.

446
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,049
Just keep it safe.

447
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,491
Okay.

448
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,330
Let's see.

449
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,243
<i>So you like your gift?</i>

450
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,005
I think it's more for you
than it is for me, Dan.

451
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,680
It's pretty cool, though, huh?

452
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:29,285
<i>If I wanted people to see me,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have gone into radio.</i>

453
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,388
- Over and out.
<i>- You hear about the</i> Seagrass<i>?</i>

454
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,854
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

455
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,724
Well, I gotta go.

456
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,488
<i>- Call me later, okay?</i>
- I will.

457
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:45,432
Somebody please
beam me out of here.

458
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,806
<i>Look at that.</i>

459
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,774
<i>Beautiful women</i>
<i>cavorting around half-naked.</i>

460
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,345
<i>This new radio is...</i>
<i>I don't know why it does this.</i>

461
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,180
<i>- We're going inside.</i>
<i>- No, no.</i>

462
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,185
<i>- Oh, God. It's freezing.</i>
<i>- Wait.</i>
