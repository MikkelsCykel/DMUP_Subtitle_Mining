00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,707
So, what's on your mind,
Luke?

2
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,243
Nothing.

3
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:50,749
I mean, I can
make something up.

4
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:54,252
Fine.
Make something up, then.

5
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:57,255
Okay.

6
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:02,259
Um,

7
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:08,566
- I'm having trouble getting laid.
- Common problem.

8
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,686
How old are you
again, Luke?

9
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:14,855
Old enough
to be getting laid.

10
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:17,190
And getting older every day.

11
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:19,993
Have you ever
gotten laid?

12
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:23,246
Two years ago, I fucked
Katie Randall in Battery Park.

13
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:28,117
But she had drank
like two 40-ounces,

14
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:30,003
and the cops came
and broke us up before we...

15
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:33,422
So, she was drunk?

16
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,257
Homegirl weighs,
like, 60 pounds,

17
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:40,212
and she drank two
40-ounce bottles of Crazy Horse.

18
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,548
- Crazy Horse?
- Look, Dr. Squires...

19
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,051
- Call me Jeff.
- Look, Jeff...

20
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,136
Dr. Squires...

21
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:53,356
How much
do you need, man?

22
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:55,108
You're the one
who needs this, son.

23
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:57,945
- How much?
- A quarter.

24
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:03,200
Well, I can give you two eighths.
It's the same thing.

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,071
- That entitles you to another...
- Forty-eight minutes.

26
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:14,293
Forty-eight minutes. If you go now,
you're getting ripped off.

27
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:17,796
I'm just not feeling all this
feeling shit today, Dr. Squires.

28
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:21,717
Luke, tomorrow's a very big day
in your life. One of the biggest.

29
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,752
And I look at you
and there's...

30
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,423
There's just
no joy, you know?

31
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:32,428
Tell Stephanie
I say what's up.

32
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,512
Mmm-hmm.

33
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:40,735
Hey, you ever feel
kind of like a fuck up?

34
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:45,273
Buying weed from the same dude
that deals to your daughter?

35
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:49,610
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter. Exactly.

36
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:54,280
- Later, Mr. Squires.
- I'm a doctor, Luke.

37
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,582
Dr. Squires.

38
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:07,375
<i>I met Dr. Squires
in the spring of '94.</i>

39
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:10,262
<i>First as a client,
then as a patient.</i>

40
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:13,766
<i>At the beginning we didn't
talk about much of anything.</i>

41
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:17,519
<i>I don't know why I kept seeing him,
to be honest.</i>

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,387
<i>But sometimes it's nice
to have someone to talk to.</i>

43
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:23,474
<i>Even if you're
just talking shit.</i>

44
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:28,896
<i>He told me the drug thing was
a cry for help. Maybe he's right.</i>

45
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:32,983
<i>I am Luke Shapiro.
I'm a drug dealer.</i>

46
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:33,785
<i>Hear my cry.</i>

47
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:48,882
<i>My occupation takes me to
exotic places like Brooklyn and Queens.</i>

48
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:53,302
<i>Now, I like it most in the summer
when no one's around. Just me,</i>

49
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:58,390
<i>the sweaty girls in their short skirts
with their breasts and their panties,</i>

50
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:01,593
<i>which I like to see
when I can see them.</i>

51
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:07,181
<i>I like fly ladies. I like tank tops.
I like short skirts.</i>

52
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:12,186

Yeah. It's the

- Good looking out.

come through with the madness.

102
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:45,769
This is gonna last us
till that first weekend in Amsterdam.

103
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,389
- You're going to Amsterdam?

I'm interning
for one of Daddy's patients.

116
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:49,947
So, it's just gonna be like you and me here
all alone and all, all summer.

117
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,250

Yeah, of course something's

- Sure.

It doesn't get any better.

244
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:56,478
- Tell me that's not true.
- Oh, you're fucking living, Luke.

245
00:15:57,012 --> 00:16:00,982
It's great, living. Get your heart broken.
Find yourself face down in the gutter.

depressed, Luke.

- No, I'm depressed.

suggest I deal, then?

254

I suggest you talk about it

255
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:32,262

- You have me.

supposed to tell you, right?

and what not?

272

Whatever. I don't know.
He tells me anyway.

I'm not kidding, a chronic masturbator.

- Yeah.

275

- That's crazy.
- The guy jerks off seven times a day.

276
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,320
Literally.
And when his nuts are dry,

277
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,322
he just lies in bed
with his hands down his pants,

278
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,107
like, touching himself
and shit.

279

328
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,780
He's a really nice guy.

329
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:49,000
Luke, can I ask you something?
Just for a sec.

330
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,087
Why are men
so complicated?

331
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:54,089
Is it because
I'm intimidating?

332
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,592
Am I intimidating because
I play an instrument?

333
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:58,376
No.

334
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:02,596
- You play an instrument?
- No, I know.

335
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:05,182
I forgot you don't know
anything about me.

336
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:09,353
I mean, I don't really need to know
anything about you, Elanor.

337
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:13,974
I played in a band in the '80s.
Well, in '82 we were really big.

338
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,060
What about you?
Stephanie? Right?

339
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:21,981
You must have some insight
into the mind of men.

340
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,484
I mean, he must
be a handful.

341
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,737
- Oh, we're not that.
- We're not like that.

342
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:31,406
I think you're really beautiful
and you have really good chemistry.

343
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:35,912
Don't you think you should try it once
and just see how it feels?

344
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,999
Elanor, you know,

345
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,969
I could just sell you some weed
and we could leave it at that.

346
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,557
Oh, yeah. Okay.
A quarter of bubble gum?

347
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:52,978
Yeah.

348
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,431
- All right.
- We're gonna...

349
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:00,735
Yeah. And the door, when you shut it,
it just locks behind you.

350
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,904
Thanks, you guys.

351
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:08,909
Yo, Shapiro, you should take my number.
Okay. Call me some time.

352
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:11,912
- Call you?
- Yeah.

353
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:18,918
- You mean, like, for weed?
- No, man. To hang out.

354
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:22,621
This city can get so lonely
when there's nobody to talk to.

355
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:25,040
I think we could
be friends.

356
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,676
- Friends?
- Yeah, friends. You know, like,

357
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:31,213
homies, buddies, amigos.
Just take my number, okay?

358
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,102
All right, word.
I'll definitely call you.

359
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,921
What do you want
from me, Luke?

360
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:18,224
I don't know.

361
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:24,563
Come on, Luke,
you can tell me.

362
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:27,432
After all, I'm just
in your head.

363
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:29,517
Be honest.

364
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:32,686
Do you wanna do
dirty things to me?

365
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:35,239
Not, like,
especially dirty.

366
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,692
Just, like, normal dirty.

367
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:42,781
Do you want to fuck me?
On the beach? In the sun?

368
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:49,036
Do you wanna be my friend?

369
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:53,373
- Do you wanna be my best friend?
- Maybe.

370
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,212
Place your hand on my shoulder.
It's warm.

371
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,882
Put your hand
between my thighs.

372
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:06,885
Come to the sun, Luke.
Come.

373
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,604
- Come.
- I'm coming.

374
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:10,689
Come.

375
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:13,309
Fuck.

376
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:15,278
Yo!

377
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,781
What's up, Dad?

378
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:24,319
What's a seven-letter word
for a subatomic particle?

379
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:26,904
I don't know, Dad.
What's up?

380
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,706
Son, would you please
turn down the air conditioning?

381
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:30,324
The electric bill
is through the roof.

382
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:33,911
- Dad, it's like 90 degrees out.
- Please, just do it.

383
00:24:59,986 --> 00:25:01,988
Such a beautiful evening.

384
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,025
- What are you doing?
- Seating.

385
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:12,531
- For that charity thing.
- Do you wanna go out?

386
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,167
Out?

387
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:21,288
You know, out.
Grab a drink, chill.

388
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:25,793
It's a Tuesday night.
And I'm almost 40.

389
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,795
Two.
You're 42.

390
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:11,469
<i>I've been thinking about your dilemma
a lot recently, Luke.</i>

391
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:17,224
- What's my dilemma?
- The girl thing.

392
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:21,727
Luke, back when I went to school,
drug dealers had no problem getting girls.

393
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:24,981
In fact, that's why
I always wanted to be one.

394
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:27,483
Were you popular in high school,
Dr. Squires?

395
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:32,489
Well, I wouldn't
say popular, no.

396
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,157
I wasn't one of those cool kids,
if that's what you're asking.

397
00:26:36,158 --> 00:26:38,243
I played baseball,
I was a debater...

398
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,412
Did you ever
wanna kill yourself?

399
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:44,333
- Not till much later.
- Then you must have been popular.

400
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,835
I'm not.

401
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:49,338
This has got nothing to do
with being popular, Luke.

402
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,339
You're just not
trying hard enough.

403
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:57,295
You must think about it.
The different scenarios.

404
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:01,799
Random sex in phone booths,
chance encounters in discos,

405
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,802
the way they smell,
the things they say,

406
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:06,803
even when they're saying
nothing at all.

407
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:12,191
I mean,

408
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:16,479
I'm married, so I don't contemplate
that type of thing.

409
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,782
No.
Of course not.

410
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,320
Surely there's
someone, Luke.

411
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:28,574
Yeah.

412
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:32,210
This one girl.

413
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:36,466
That's fantastic, Luke. Who is she?
Does Stephanie know her?

414
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,549
No.

415
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,554
No, she goes
to school downtown.

416
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:48,342
- So what's the problem?
- She just wants to be friends.

417
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:51,513
- What makes you think that?
- She said so.

418
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,265
Make her like you, Luke.
That's what I did with my wife.

419
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:58,268
How did you do that?

420
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:01,272
Be her friend.
Confide in her, earn her trust.

421
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:03,274
Then, when you are
least threatening to her,

422
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:07,160
grab her and stick your tongue so far down
her throat she starts to gag from pleasure.

423
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:10,245
- Can I grab her tits, too?
- Baby steps, Luke.

424
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:12,247
Right.

425
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:14,500
Pursue her, Luke.
You're the perfect age for it.

426
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:18,370
You haven't yet been systematically
numbed to the allure of romance.

427
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:19,672
You still have
your youthful...

428
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:23,292
I got it.

429
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:26,712
Young men need sex, Luke.
All men, actually.

430
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:31,632
I can get you a hooker,
if you like.

431
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,635
God, I was this close
to respecting you.

432
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:37,139
Big mistake, Luke.
Call your girl.

433
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,027
You don't need medication, Luke.
You just need to get laid.

434
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:47,948
<i>It's a surprise attack.
I don't want these...</i>

435
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:48,900
<i>What is the postmark on that?</i>

436
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,735
<i>What do you mean?
I just got it today.</i>

437
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:53,653
<i>I just wanna know
what the postmark is.</i>

438
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,123
<i>- When did you get it?
- I don't wanna talk about the postmark!</i>

439
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:13,172
Oh, my God!

440
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:24,734
Jeffrey!

441
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,021
<i>Hello?</i>

442
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:35,026
Hello?

443
00:29:35,527 --> 00:29:37,027
Um...

444
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:40,531
- I'm looking for...
- Luke?

445
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:46,203
- Luke, is that you?
- Dr. Squires?

446
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,622
It's okay, Luke.
I know why you're calling.

447
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,377
- You do?
- The beaver hunt.

448
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:56,879
The pussy quest.

449
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,183
I can help you, Luke.
Let's grab a drink.

450
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:03,269
<i>I got just the place.</i>

451
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,139
All right.

452
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:17,949
It's strange.
This place used to be packed.

453
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:22,036
The city's not the same anymore, Luke.
This place,

454
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:26,040
it really used to be
something down here,

455
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:29,160
the drugs, the girls,
the music,

456
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,163
the fucking music.

457
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,132
Speaking of which.

458
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,972
<i># "Season of The Witch"
by Donovan #</i>

459
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:50,229
What kind of music
do you like, Luke?

460
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,733
Tribe Called Quest.
Pharcyde. De La Soul.

461
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:59,238
That's rap, right?
I don't know much about that stuff.

462
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,743
- I'll make you a mixtape.
- I'd like that.

463
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:08,496
Maybe I'll make
you one, too.

464
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:11,667
Some Bowie, maybe
a little Pink Floyd.

465
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:16,254
Some classical.
Brahms, Haydn.

466
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,210
Haydn?
Yeah, Haydn's dope.

467
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:26,380
- You serious?
- No, Dr. Squires.

468
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:31,600
Hey, Luke.

469
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:35,805
Why couldn't Mozart find his teacher?
Because he was Haydn.

470
00:31:38,191 --> 00:31:39,693
That's not funny.

471
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:42,896
Yo, order me
another drink, please?

472
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:47,482
Another Bud,
right here.

473
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:52,121
<i># Must be the season
of the witch #</i>

474
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,624
Lucas, I hate my wife.

475
00:31:57,126 --> 00:32:00,378
<i># Must be the season
of the witch #</i>

476
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:04,465
- I hate my parents.
- I need to get laid.

477
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,168
We both need to get laid.

478
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,723
Lust.

479
00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:17,310
Luke, I've never cheated
on my wife before, ever.

480
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,811
But I want to now,
it is my mission.

481
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,764
You have no idea
how much I want to.

482
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,601
Sometimes it's right
to do the wrong thing,

483
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,487
and right now
is one of those times.

484
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,359
But we need to
fix ourselves first.

485
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:37,747
- You need fixing?
- Lucas, I need a whole lot of fixing.

486
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,536
- Union?
- Luke, hi.

487
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:48,122
<i>I can't believe
you're here!</i>

488
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:50,592
We came in to check out
all the old weird people.

489
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:55,797
Oh, wait.

490
00:32:57,766 --> 00:33:00,717
- Don't even think about it.
- Is this the mystery girl?

491
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:03,437
No, but it doesn't mean
she's fair game.

492
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:10,778
This is Gruden. My date to the Midsummer
Night Cancer Ball. It's for charity.

493
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:15,781
He's an exchange student
from Rotterdam. He's a joke.

494
00:33:15,782 --> 00:33:20,619
Yo, what up? What happened to
home boy you were with in the park?

495
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,789
Albert?
Oh, he's so amateur.

496
00:33:23,873 --> 00:33:27,209
Gruden, I'm Haydn.

497
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,495
- Like the classical guy?
- Yes.

498
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,662
I was named after him.

499
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:36,500
- That's so awesome.
- Do you like the Grateful Dead?

500
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:39,171
Followed them for four years
after college.

501
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:42,924
Whoa!

call that thing?

509
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:00,607
- It's a blunt.
- It's a blunt. I like that.

- The second set.</i>

511
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:05,995
Oh, yeah.

512
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:10,500
They opened up

514
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:15,505

when the acid kicked in.

515
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:17,423
Amazing!

516
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,011
- Your dad's mad cool.
- He's not my dad.

517
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:28,851
Luke is very into the rap of The Soul Tribe
and many of their other songs.

518
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:32,352
- Tell her, Luke.
- Tell me.

519
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:35,306
Tell her. Go ahead, talk.
Talk to her.

520
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:41,611
- I'm gonna go get another beer.
- Gruden, yo!

Goldilocks.

525

I am one of the three bears.
Guess which one.

526
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:57,327
- Which one?
- Baby bear.

527
00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:48,758
The game's not called
Four Minutes in Heaven, Luke.

528
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:50,343
We have like
three minutes.

529
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:53,378
All right, that's enough, kids.
You are all too young to be in here anyway.

530
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:56,382
Oh, come on.
They're all 18.

531
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:01,854
Since when is
the drinking age 21?

532

<i>
Bye, Haydn!</i>

533
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:07,859
- Since forever.
- Fucking Giuliani.

534
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:13,198
Look around you, Luke,
is this what you want for your mind?

535
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:15,533
For your life? You want it to be
like this city?

536
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:21,037
Sweep all the nasty bits under the rug?
Make everything okay?

537
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:26,876
He puts the homeless people in prison,
you know? These people are sick, mentally.

538
00:36:26,877 --> 00:36:30,797
They're being put in jail.
What do you think about that, Luke?

539
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:32,749
- Doesn't seem right.
- No.

540
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,335
No, it doesn't. That's why
I don't want you on medication, Luke.

541
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:39,171
You may as well open up a Starbucks
in your brain. You follow me?

542
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:42,175
Don't jump for the quick fix.
This whole fucking city wants a quick fix.

543
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:44,561
Embrace your pain.
Make it a part of you.

544
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:48,014
You don't want to be like them.
I don't want you to be like them.

545
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:51,516
So, you've never taken
any of that stuff?

546
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:55,654
Jesus, Luke, I'm on all of it.
I don't want you to be like me, either.

547
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:58,357
Sex is a drug too,
you know?

548
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:01,076
More powerful than any
synthetic pharmaceutical.

549
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,695
Yeah? Is that why you go around
trying to fuck little girls?

550
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,112
That was just
second base.

551
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:09,200
Oh, second base, huh?
Hey, what happened to getting fixed first?

552
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,702
Sometimes getting laid
is getting fixed, you know?

553
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:15,706
Except for dogs.
Now break out that blunt.

554
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:19,210
- This is a joint.
- Joint. I know that.

555
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:29,802
- Why'd you do that, Luke?
- Tag this wall?

556
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:33,639
I'm just kind of putting my stamp on it,
fucking let people know I was here.

557
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,025
- It's illegal, isn't it?
- It is.

558
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:39,727
- May I?
- You may.

559
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:42,314
- Just be careful.
- Careful.

560
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:53,458
M.D.

561
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:02,249
- Excellent penmanship, Dr. Squires.
- Why, thank you.

562
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,918
- Oh, no, I thank you.
- No, no, no, I thank you.

563
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,554
- Oh, you're welcome.
- M.D.

564
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:13,726
- Hey! You two!
- Fuck!

565
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:14,728
Stop right there!

566
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:20,316
Forrest Gump, Luke.

567
00:38:20,317 --> 00:38:23,069
- What are you talking about?
- Running.

568
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:35,698
Oh!

569
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:50,678
Who put you up to this, boys? Giuliani?
You got some kind of quota to fill?

570
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,180
Used to be,
you could lick a sheet of acid,

571
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:54,181
hold up a bank,
fuck a whore in Times Square

572
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:58,184
without any of you batting an eyelash.
Now, one blunt, we're in the clink.

573
00:38:58,185 --> 00:39:00,687
This whole city's fucked.
We give you character!

574
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:02,523
Hey, shut the hell up!

575
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,775
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, now, brother. Join the revolution!

576
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,810
- What are you in here for?
- I stabbed my wife in the pussy.

577
00:39:08,811 --> 00:39:11,781
Oh, wow!

578
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:14,783
Yo, Squires, maybe we should
keep this on the DL, all right?

579
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,785
- Yo, DL!
- Quiet!

580
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,655
- Hey, shut up!
- Please, come on!

581
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:28,462
Shapiro!
Squires!

582
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:30,214
You made bail.

583
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,168
Bail.

584
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:40,340
- Hi there, Stepdaddy.
- Hi, precious.

585
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:42,559
- Hey, Steph.
- Shapiro.

586
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,145
Thanks a lot for getting
my stepdad thrown in prison.

587
00:39:45,146 --> 00:39:48,014
You know, you're really
a great influence on him.

588
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,568
- But it wasn't my fault.
- It was my fault.

589
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:53,771
I know. I was kidding.
Anyway...

590
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:57,523
- What are you doing today?
- Shapiro's busy.

591
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:59,525
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

592
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:03,747
Okay, well, look, Squires, why don't you
just take the car back to the garage,

593
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:07,833
and I won't tell my mom
about this whole prison thing

594
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:10,336
and Shapiro's
coming with me.

595
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:14,172
Don't touch
my daughter, Luke.

596
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:15,341
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter.

597
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:21,463
So, what's the deal
with you and my stepdad?

598
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,383
Are you guys,
like, gay together?

599
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:29,887
- We're friends, I guess.
- Weird.

600
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:32,890
Not really.

601
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:37,310
- He's very immature.
- I know.

602
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:40,396
Him and my mom fight about that
all the time.

603
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:41,898
I know.

604
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,286

Don't you wanna know
where I was last night?

609
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,725
Do you want to tell me?

610
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:14,145
- I was having an affair.
- Good for you.

611
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:17,848
I was in prison.
I went to jail.

you know, but

Yo, Mom.

678
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:14,654
Hello.

679
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:24,713
Can I make you
a sandwich?

680
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:27,249
Absolutely.

681
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:35,589
- Where have you been?
- I think I'm in love.

682
00:45:39,477 --> 00:45:41,979
Well, that's wonderful.
Who's the lucky girl?

683
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,981
Stephanie Squires.

684
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:01,581
- You're up late.
- Oh, hi. So are you.

685
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,085
You have a nice day
with Luke?

686
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:10,539
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

687
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:16,462
Do you like him?

688
00:46:18,546 --> 00:46:21,048
I don't know.
What do you care?

689
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:24,468
Do you like-like him?

690
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:26,520
Maybe, yeah.

691
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:31,441
- He's a drug dealer.
- Yeah, I know. Thank you.

692
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:37,313
Look, I'm really not in the mood for a father
daughter moment right now, Dr. Squires.

693
00:46:37,314 --> 00:46:40,734
Well, may I watch TV
with you?

694
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:44,488
- Whatever.
- Cool.

695
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:51,993
So, fill me in.

696
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:57,500
Well, basically there's been, like,
this big misunderstanding,

697
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:04,005
- and Mr. Furley thinks Jack's gay.
- I think I've seen this one.

698
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:09,844
Oh, good morning, Luke.
You're up early.

699
00:47:11,346 --> 00:47:13,848
Couldn't sleep.
It's mad hot.

700
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,654
What's that?

701
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:30,496
- We're getting evicted?
- Keep your voice down.

702
00:47:30,497 --> 00:47:34,000
I'll take care of it.
I've got a very big deal coming through.

703
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:35,534
It's not a problem.

704
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:38,538
- Where will we go?
- I don't know. Downtown, maybe? Jersey?

705
00:47:39,038 --> 00:47:41,540
Not everyone has to live
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

706
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:43,041
Well, I can't live
in Jersey.

707
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:45,545
Look, I messed up,
and I'm trying to fix it.

708
00:47:47,046 --> 00:47:50,047
- Then fix it.
- All I can do is try.

709
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:52,434
Be a man, Dad.
Fix it.

710
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,638
What can I do, Luke?
Deal pot?

711
00:47:58,223 --> 00:48:00,642
I don't think you'd be
very good at that.

She's not for you.

What's so bad
about me?

720
00:48:45,184 --> 00:48:48,736
She'll break your heart, Luke.
She's just bored.

721
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:53,741
- That's not true.
- Fine. Ignore my advice.

722
00:48:54,325 --> 00:48:56,828
What? You think she's hot?
You want to fuck her?

723
00:48:57,328 --> 00:48:59,329

you've wasted your entire life

724
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,750
on a girl you got nothing
in common with, Luke.

00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:07,753

Remember living?

727
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,214
And who said anything
about my entire life?

728
00:49:17,764 --> 00:49:22,433
This is it, Luke. This is your life.
The choices you make.

729
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:25,937
And I guess you've chosen
to be a hoodlum drug dealer,

730
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:28,357
who latches onto the only girl
who'll pay attention to him,

731
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:31,227
simply because he's scared
of being alone.

732
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:34,730
And what about you?

733
00:49:37,732 --> 00:49:39,734
Telling me not
to take medication.

734
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:44,738
Your "You don't want me to be like
Times Square" fucking metaphor.

735
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:46,741
What the fuck was that?

736
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:52,746
I mean, you said it yourself, right?
You're on half that shit.

737

hanging out with me, anyway?

your own age?

Right.

791
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,859

this weekend?

792
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,860
- Nothing.
- Good.

793
00:54:00,861 --> 00:54:03,863
My mom and Squires are going to
Barbados or something,

794
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:05,865
so my house in
Fire Island is free.

to join me for some beachcombing.

00:54:14,374 --> 00:54:16,376

a honeymoon.

798
00:54:17,877 --> 00:54:19,878

799
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:22,882
You know what people do
on honeymoons, right?

800
00:54:25,385 --> 00:54:26,386
I think so.

801
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:01,417
It's nice.

802
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:05,372

- Got anything stronger?

803
00:55:07,424 --> 00:55:11,427
- Whiskey?
- Yeah, I'll try.

804
00:55:11,428 --> 00:55:14,930
- Very well.
- You got anything to mix it with?

805
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:19,935
- Uh, there's some juice boxes.
- Yeah, that's good.

806

Yo, I made this for you.

807

- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

808
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,391
This whiskey's
a lot of drunk.

809
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,394
No shit.

810
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:10,398
So, let me
ask you something.

811
00:56:10,399 --> 00:56:11,400
Uh-oh.

812
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,904
What's going on here?

813
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,905
What do you mean?

814
00:56:17,906 --> 00:56:21,409
I've never been
in this situation before.

815
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:25,113
And what situation
is that?

816
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:27,666
Chilling

817

you know,

820
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:45,132
what happens?

821
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,270
What happens when
everybody comes back?

822
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,773
What do you mean?
Like, do I turn into a pumpkin?

823
00:56:54,974 --> 00:56:56,476
Basically, yeah.

824
00:56:57,977 --> 00:56:59,479
I don't know.

825
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:03,982
It doesn't matter.

826
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:06,485
It doesn't matter?

827
00:57:07,986 --> 00:57:09,071
Why not?

828
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:14,576
Because how could anything
possibly matter right now?

829
00:57:18,796 --> 00:57:21,298
You know what
your problem is, Shapiro?

830
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:27,304
It's that you just have this really shitty
way of looking at things, you know?

831
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:28,305
I don't have
that problem.

832
00:57:28,306 --> 00:57:30,807
I just look
at the dopeness.

833
00:57:30,808 --> 00:57:35,312
But, you, it's like you just look
at the wackness, you know?

834
00:57:36,313 --> 00:57:38,315
- I do?
- Yeah.

835
00:57:40,317 --> 00:57:43,820
Well, all you gotta do
is just look at me.

836
00:57:45,322 --> 00:57:47,823
- All right.
- And kiss me.

837
00:57:47,824 --> 00:57:48,824
Kiss you.

838
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:58,833
Oh...

839
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,632
Take these off.

840
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:35,618
- Condom? Condom?
- That's what the pill's for.

841
00:58:46,162 --> 00:58:49,665
- You're not really hard.
- No?

842
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:54,169
Oh, man. Fuck!

843
00:58:58,473 --> 00:58:59,974
Here.

844
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:07,680
You know, I never
drank coffee before.

845
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:12,101
Really? I drink it all the time.
It's like Ritalin.

846
00:59:12,102 --> 00:59:17,356
Yo, Steph, you know, I'm not
trying to be a bitch or nothing, but...

847
00:59:17,357 --> 00:59:21,160
- What?
- I've kind of never had sex before.

848
00:59:22,245 --> 00:59:24,447
- You're a virgin?
- No!

849
00:59:24,947 --> 00:59:25,948
Nah!

850
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:31,871
- I just never officially had sex.
- Okay.

851
00:59:32,371 --> 00:59:34,924
I think that's why
I'm nervous, you know?

852
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:38,876
That's why the thing
with my dick.

853
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:43,798
Oh, Shapiro, don't worry about it.
It's okay.

854
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:46,300
I've done it, like,
a hundred times.

855
00:59:46,301 --> 00:59:50,105
- I can teach you.
- I'm down.

857
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:58,611
- Probably.
- Okay.

858
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:01,449

for our first lesson.

How was your weekend?

- Uneventful.
- You got a nice tan there, Steph.

Yeah?

909
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,315
Anyway, I'm going to bed.
I just wanted to say hey.

It's, uh,
it's me, Luke.

916
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:12,996
Uh...

917
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:15,498
I know you said
you'd call me this week,

918
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:17,000
and, uh,

919
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:20,503
it's a week from
when you said that, so...

920
01:09:21,004 --> 01:09:25,507
I mean, I guess there's still time
in the week, technically.

921
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:27,510
I mean, technically,
there's a couple of hours left.

922
01:09:29,512 --> 01:09:31,480
I hope you're
aware of that.

923
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:35,567
Look, are you not calling me back
'cause I said I love you?

924
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:40,072
'Cause that's stupid.
I mean...

925
01:09:42,574 --> 01:09:47,078
I didn't mean it really,
and, you know, even if I did,

926
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:51,582
I'm going to college in three weeks,
so it's not like it matters.

927
01:09:56,788 --> 01:09:58,289
You know what?

928
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,292
Fuck it.

929
01:10:02,794 --> 01:10:04,095
I meant it.

930
01:10:04,846 --> 01:10:06,846
I do love you.

931
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,882
All right?
I'm not scared to say it.

932
01:10:09,383 --> 01:10:13,886
I fucking love you, okay?
And if that scares you,

933
01:10:13,887 --> 01:10:17,390
well, then fuck you.
Huh? You know what?

934
01:10:17,391 --> 01:10:21,394
Fuck off, all right?
You're a fucking bitch. Peace out forever!

935
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:35,708

01:10:41,629 --> 01:10:42,630

937
01:10:44,049 --> 01:10:45,550

01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:28,874
- or something?
- No.

946
01:11:30,292 --> 01:11:32,377
Well, I need
your help.

947
01:11:35,213 --> 01:11:38,098
What is it, Lucas?

948
01:11:38,099 --> 01:11:41,102
You know anybody
who could use some weed?

949
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:44,972

I need to unload this month.

950
01:11:48,893 --> 01:11:52,896

work something out.

<i># "Long Shot Kick De Bucket"

952
01:12:00,236 --> 01:12:03,739
All right, if we're gonna do this,
Dr. Squires, we're gonna do it right.

953
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,908
- All right? You gotta be more careful.
- Don't worry, Luke.

954
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:08,993
- I'm not going back to prison.
- Good.

955
01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:12,831
Let's establish a few ground rules.
Number one, we use pagers.

956
01:12:13,415 --> 01:12:15,384
Someone pages us, we call them back
from a payphone.

957
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:17,970
We never use home phones
for this type of stuff. Never.

958
01:12:18,554 --> 01:12:22,056
That's great, Luke. I already have
a pager for my medical practice.

959
01:12:22,057 --> 01:12:23,557
All right, good.

960
01:12:23,558 --> 01:12:28,428
Number two, we sell weed by the gram,
by the eighth, and by the ounce.

961
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:32,432
Gram's the highest profit margin,
but it's also the most potent,

962
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:34,151
that's why we try to encourage people
to buy the grams.

963
01:12:34,152 --> 01:12:37,737
Principal Edwards, I can give you
two grams for 125 bucks, all right?

964
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:40,739
Anything less than that,
I don't make a profit.

965
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,743
You always were
very good at math, Luke.

966
01:12:45,245 --> 01:12:47,246
All right,
11 grand,

967
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:50,249

- Not in this neighborhood.

997
01:14:56,318 --> 01:14:58,286
I can't believe this is
a fifth floor walk-up.

998
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:01,821
Oh, please behave yourself,
Dr. Squires, all right?

999
01:15:01,822 --> 01:15:05,875
- This is my connect.
- Who the fuck lives in a fifth floor...

1000
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,911
Hi, Luke.

1001
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:10,798
- ...walk-up. Hello.
- Hi.

1002
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:16,419
Come on in.
I'm, uh, I'm Elanor.

1003
01:15:16,636 --> 01:15:19,588
I'm, um, Haydn.

1004
01:15:19,589 --> 01:15:24,093
- No need for aliases with her, Squires.
- Oh, well then, I'm Jeff.

1005
01:15:24,094 --> 01:15:25,812
Oh, I'm still Elanor.

1006
01:15:33,902 --> 01:15:38,490
- So, how much you need?
- A quarter.

1007
01:15:40,025 --> 01:15:43,660
I'm going to see that guy
in New Hampshire.

1008
01:15:43,661 --> 01:15:50,702
I was just packing and stuff and then I was
thinking I need some grass. I almost forgot.

1009
01:15:53,588 --> 01:15:55,006
So, that's how
this happened.

1010
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:57,591
- So, a quarter, then?
- A quarter. Yeah.

1011
01:15:57,592 --> 01:15:59,926
He doesn't
appreciate you.

1012
01:16:00,427 --> 01:16:03,263
- How do you know that?
- He couldn't possibly.

1013
01:16:03,847 --> 01:16:06,967
- That's a compliment, right?
- Ma'am.

1014
01:16:08,935 --> 01:16:12,938
Here it is.
And I have this for you, too.

1015
01:16:12,939 --> 01:16:14,439
Thanks.

1016
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,558
It's the
greatest hits?

1017
01:16:16,559 --> 01:16:20,061
Well, actually, it's more like
three songs, mixes...

1018
01:16:20,062 --> 01:16:22,865
Well, really it's more
like one song.

1019
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:26,451
You were in
Emergency Breakthrough?

1020
01:16:26,452 --> 01:16:28,371
- Yeah.
- No shit.

1021
01:16:28,953 --> 01:16:31,405
- I love your music.
- What?

1022
01:16:31,406 --> 01:16:32,740
Oh...

1023
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:34,491
Mmm!

1024
01:16:34,492 --> 01:16:37,578
Wow. See, Luke? I told you
I know a little about music.

1025
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:40,080
I keep trying to
broaden his horizons,

1026
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:42,417
you know, rap music isn't
everything. I tell him, but...

1027
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:44,500
You should listen
to this woman, Luke.

1028
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:47,503
She's as smart and talented
as she is beautiful.

1029
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:49,005
# Wear and tear...? #

1030
01:16:49,006 --> 01:16:53,343

- Total fucking lunatic.

1032
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:04,987

ignoring me, huh?</i>

1033
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,356
<i>That's a shame,</i>

1034
01:17:09,409 --> 01:17:14,946
because it would be really cool to hang
out or whatever before I go to school.

1035
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:20,952
The school year is rapidly approaching,
as you know.

1036
01:17:23,455 --> 01:17:24,956
And...

1037
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,961
I miss you.

1038
01:17:32,096 --> 01:17:34,180
<i>- But I love you.
- No, you don't.</i>

1039
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:37,183
<i>Please, Kristen. Don't leave me
all alone. I can't be all alone.</i>

1040
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:40,687
<i>Cut the crap, Jeffrey.
You asked for it.</i>

1041
01:17:40,688 --> 01:17:43,974
Stephanie?
Are you leaving, too?

1042
01:17:44,558 --> 01:17:49,479
No. Stephie will be here
for the next few weeks.

1043
01:17:50,063 --> 01:17:51,397
I'll deal with all the details
when I'm back.

1044
01:17:51,898 --> 01:17:52,899
Details?

1045
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,652
Please, say something
to your mother, Steph.

1046
01:17:56,653 --> 01:17:59,706
Jeffrey, leave her
out of this.

1047
01:18:02,157 --> 01:18:03,658
Sweetheart,

1048
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,627

- What?

1053
01:18:36,156 --> 01:18:39,276
- Justin?
- Yo, why you calling me Shapiro?

1054
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:42,746
<i>No reason.</i>

1055
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:46,866
How was, um, Florence?

1056
01:18:46,867 --> 01:18:49,450
Oh, it was crazy, yo,
mad crazy.

1057
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:50,952
Yo, I'll tell you
all about it.

1058
01:18:50,953 --> 01:18:54,256
We're hitting this club
downtown tonight. You coming?

1059
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,009
Yeah, totally.

1060
01:18:57,376 --> 01:18:58,760
Yeah.

1061
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:01,846
- Doll your shit up.
- Okay, call me later.

1062
01:19:01,847 --> 01:19:03,348
- Peace.
- Bye.

1063
01:19:30,991 --> 01:19:33,075
Yo, yo, yo,
what happened?

1064
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:36,579
- What happened?
- What do you think?

1065
01:19:36,913 --> 01:19:39,664
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, Dad. I have money!

1066
01:19:39,665 --> 01:19:42,167
- Put that down. I got money!
- Leave the guys alone.

1067
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:45,171
- Let them do their job.
- Dad, I got $26,000,

1068
01:19:45,588 --> 01:19:47,173
that should be
more than enough.

1069
01:19:47,673 --> 01:19:49,391
- Luke.
- What?

1070
01:19:50,976 --> 01:19:52,344
It's not enough.

1071
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:55,564
It's not even close.

1072
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:03,321
You said you'd fix it.
You said you'd fix it, right?

1073
01:20:03,821 --> 01:20:06,106
I need you to go upstairs
and pack up your room, okay?

1074
01:20:08,776 --> 01:20:11,494
Go on upstairs.
Pack up your room.

1075
01:20:11,495 --> 01:20:13,863
Hey, be careful with that,
would you, guys?

1076
01:20:13,864 --> 01:20:15,916
Are you being careful
with my father's silver?

Okay.
Okay.

1159
01:26:01,071 --> 01:26:03,023
Nothing's okay.

1160
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:05,942
None of it's
gonna be okay,

1161
01:26:05,943 --> 01:26:08,445
everything is going
to be terrible.

1162
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:13,032
I tried to kill myself
twice today.

1163
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:18,287
Once with pills, turns out I have
a very high tolerance for those.

1164
01:26:18,288 --> 01:26:23,125
Next by hanging.
The hanging is very hard. The weight.

1165
01:26:23,126 --> 01:26:27,512
You lose too much weight,
or you put on too much weight...

1166
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:31,098
Oh, well.

1167
01:26:31,099 --> 01:26:34,303
- Dr. Squires, what are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1168
01:26:35,304 --> 01:26:38,273
I just...
I'm done.

1169
01:26:40,642 --> 01:26:44,946
This is it. Last call, Luke.
I'm glad you're here to see me off.

1170
01:26:51,235 --> 01:26:53,904
- Where you going, Dr. Squires?
- In there.

1171
01:26:54,705 --> 01:26:56,824
I'm ready to die, Luke.

1172
01:26:58,208 --> 01:26:59,959
Stop fucking around, Jeff.

1173
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:04,047
I'm the weird old guy, remember?
You said so yourself.

1174
01:27:05,548 --> 01:27:09,252
Look, I didn't mean it, all right?
You're my friend.

1175
01:27:10,754 --> 01:27:12,639
You're my best friend.

1176
01:27:12,922 --> 01:27:15,974
So just, please,
would you come back for me?

1177
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:20,061
You're not
worth it, Shapiro!

1178
01:27:20,062 --> 01:27:23,064
So that was all
bullshit, right?

1179
01:27:23,065 --> 01:27:27,403
All that stuff about embracing your pain,
making it a part of you?

1180
01:27:30,605 --> 01:27:32,657
You can't do this!

1181
01:27:33,691 --> 01:27:36,193
You can't just give up.

1182
01:27:36,194 --> 01:27:39,613
Life is hard and it's full of pain
and what not,

1183
01:27:39,614 --> 01:27:42,700
but we take it
'cause there's great stuff, too!

1184
01:27:44,201 --> 01:27:46,452
And we can do it
because we have friends!

1185
01:27:46,453 --> 01:27:48,538
Because we help
each other!

1186
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:52,542
Stop! Stop!

1187
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:01,406
Luke!

1188
01:29:30,935 --> 01:29:34,437
That was really fucking cheesy,
what you said just then.

1189
01:29:37,941 --> 01:29:41,444
There's enough assholes
in the world, Dr. Squires.

1190
01:29:43,446 --> 01:29:45,448
Don't be another one.

1191
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:48,951
Now you sound like me.

1192
01:29:58,961 --> 01:30:02,463
You wanna go to the city
to fill out my prescriptions?

1193
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:07,969
Sounds good.

1194
01:30:21,598 --> 01:30:23,265
Thank you, Luke.

1195
01:30:23,266 --> 01:30:24,351
How you feeling?

1196
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:31,825
Please, don't
do that again.

1197
01:30:33,609 --> 01:30:36,362
- All right? You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

1198
01:30:38,364 --> 01:30:40,583
Dr. Squires,
I gotta get back.

1199
01:30:42,084 --> 01:30:43,868
To my folks.

1200
01:30:43,869 --> 01:30:46,671
Where you living
these days, Luke?

1201
01:30:46,672 --> 01:30:48,756
We're moving in
with my grandparents.

1202
01:30:50,758 --> 01:30:54,127
- In New Jersey.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1203
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:56,214
I'm sorry to live it.

1204
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,602
I'm sorry about
Stephanie, too.

1205
01:31:06,106 --> 01:31:08,108
She would have been
a lucky girl.

1206
01:31:11,478 --> 01:31:13,313
Good luck in school.

1207
01:31:15,816 --> 01:31:20,119
Try and fuck a black girl.
I never got the chance at college.

1208
01:31:24,907 --> 01:31:27,627
Baby steps.

1209
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:32,547
It'll be okay.

1210
01:31:32,548 --> 01:31:35,550
- I can't answer that.
- It wasn't a question.

1211
01:31:38,086 --> 01:31:40,755
- Peace, Doc.
- Peace out, Luke.

1212
01:31:55,352 --> 01:31:56,937
Luke. Hey.

1213
01:31:57,938 --> 01:31:59,489
Hey.

1214
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:02,610
- Look, man, I just wanted to say...
- Do me a favor, Steph.

1215
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:06,613
Don't say nothing, okay?

1216
01:32:07,113 --> 01:32:09,198
Just stand there
till I leave.

1217
01:32:09,699 --> 01:32:11,701
I wanna remember this.

1218
01:32:13,202 --> 01:32:16,706
- I've never done it before.
- Never done what?

1219
01:32:19,759 --> 01:32:21,760
Had my heart broken.

Luke?

1224
01:33:14,843 --> 01:33:16,345
Have you had
any more thoughts

1225
01:33:16,845 --> 01:33:19,897
about what you're gonna be
as far as a profession goes?

1226
01:33:19,898 --> 01:33:23,350
- Mom, he's got time.
- I'm just asking.

1227
01:33:23,351 --> 01:33:25,402
Actually, I'm thinking
about becoming a shrink.

1228

Psychology!

1229
01:33:27,488 --> 01:33:30,490
It's not quite the shoe business,
but it's a very interesting field.
