2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,955
Voila! I'm on the road again...

3
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,715
Shit!

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,999
Battery depleted.

5
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,719
Thirty years old...
You gotta take stock.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,956
If I look at my life,
it's not impressive.

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,999
What've I done?

8
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,235
I was madly in love with one girl.
Martine.

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,033
No, that's not it.

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,474
Then I was madly in love
with another. Neus.

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,715
Okay...

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,638
this story's already a big mess.

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,638
That's because I'm a mess.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,954
Let me sort things out.

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,675
"Writing is sorting out
the mess of life."

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,236
I'm not telling this in order.
Order's a real mess.

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,155
So, that's me.
Last month, in Russia, for a wedding.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,153
Those are people I used to know.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,157
Okay, here goes.
Five years ago,

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,110
I went to Barcelona
to study economics.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,958
I met them all there.

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,117
We shared an apartment for a year.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,908
We lost touch, then reconnected
here, in Saint Petersburg.

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,553
Because William, that guy,
is marrying a Russian, Natasha.

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,229
Her.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,634
A monumental event
is about to take place in my life.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,837
Something really fundamental.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,118
But to explain why
this thing's so fundamental to me,

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,391
let's jump back a year.

30
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,831
R U S S I A N D O L L S

31
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,989
Voilà! Now, I write.

32
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,077
My job is telling stories.

33
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,997
But this woman has heard
some of my best stories.

34
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,794
Mrs. V., my bank officer.

35
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,991
They can't pay me for two months.

36
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,669
But they said...
And this will interest you.

37
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,758
Because I'm like you.
I said,

38
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,391
"That's scandalous! You can't do that.

39
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,069
"France has strict laws
protecting writers."

40
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,316
I was very, very angry.

41
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,153
What is of interest here?

42
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,357
Well, they said,

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,873
since they couldn't pay me
in a timely fashion,

44
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,673
when they do pay me,

45
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,077
they'll take a "late penalty"
into account.

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,192
Meaning? I don't understand.

47
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,554
Since they're late,
they'll pay me more.

48
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,994
How much more?

49
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,436
I think they said, "Much, much more."

50
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
So my job is to play a merry tune.

51
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,989
We typically need writers like you
for personalities

52
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,271
who are writing their memoirs

53
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,676
and can't put two words together.

54
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,632
Can you do that?

55
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,669
Ghostwriting?

56
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,118
Yes... no... that's...

57
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,517
Sure, I can be a ghostwriter.

58
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,630
I think...

59
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,592
I preferred to work there.

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,110
I can ghostwrite for anyone.

61
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,798
I love fiction
when it's connected to reality...

62
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,791
There was a huge amount
of work there...

63
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,917
So that's the job!
Know what I mean?

64
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,350
Now I'm working
all over the place.

65
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,757
Plum has a roundness, a warmth,

66
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,913
a certain femininity, yet elegance...

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,475
Some guys like hot dog or freestyle.

68
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,557
So you need different gear.

69
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,353
Hardware's always been reliable.

70
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,437
OS X makes the difference.

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,280
- You mean the equipment?
- No, the ride.

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,279
It's chic, not la-di-da.
Hip, yet cool.

73
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,916
- For me, you gotta go freestyle.
- That's color!

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,431
Doesn't that kill the trees?

75
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,195
So...

76
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,710
Do you trim them several times a year?

77
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,716
- What do you think?
- Yes? No?

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,036
I don't know. I have no idea.

79
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,390
Do grapes grow in winter?

80
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,478
You've been busting my balls
for an hour.

81
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,638
I'm a Parisian,
I don't know this plant shit.

82
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,472
I'm like you,
I got a boring shit job.

83
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,957
I don't give a fuck.
If my questions are stupid,

84
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,037
don't answer and I'll take off!

85
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,992
A little on edge, are we?

86
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,239
Sorry. I haven't slept,

87
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,669
I'm having a shitty day.

88
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,359
Yeah, I'm on edge.

89
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,195
- You Parisians!
- Stop! Enough!

90
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,515
Laurent!

91
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,674
Stop! That side's fine.
The façade's clear!

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,795
- When's your shit due?
- In two weeks.

93
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,311
People seem to think
I'm good at love stories.

94
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,957
We're doing a special "love series"
by young writers this summer.

95
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,514
Oh, I'd love to.

96
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,631
So it's gone pretty well this year.
I even got a TVscript to write.

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,153
Sort of the ultimate!

98
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,476
We read your story with great interest.

99
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,358
It has enormous quality,
but a few scenes

100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,755
did make us flinch.

101
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,632
More than flinch, even.

102
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,635
Scene 57.

103
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,678
Why doesn't John Edward kiss Odile
during the thunderstorm?

104
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,996
Yes, why? We want them to kiss.

105
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,759
I want them to kiss.

106
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,918
I don't know.
I didn't want to be too cliché.

107
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,794
We so expect it, it's more interesting
if they don't kiss.

108
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,356
But why deprive the audience
of that pleasure?

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,439
It airs over the holidays.

110
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,474
It's a marvelous gift to our viewers.
Don't be afraid of clichés.

111
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,589
I more than agree.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,594
It's a sequel.
Wooded Bliss was a huge hit.

113
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,873
The audience is clamoring for
Love Passion in Venice. Go for it.

114
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,837
Everyone's dying to see how John Edward
and Odile finally fall in love.

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,356
John Edward's handsome,
Odile's beautiful,

116
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,598
they're in Venice,
the most beautiful city in the world!

117
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,359
Let yourself go, Xavier!

118
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,232
We all love postcards.

119
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,034
We all love sunsets.
Why deny us that?

120
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,232
Put them in gondolas!

121
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,871
I must sell Wooded Bliss.

122
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,599
But why, John Edward?

123
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,195
Why?

124
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,669
I'm getting a divorce.

125
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,639
Does your wife know?

126
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,949
Yes.

127
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,673
I've told her everything.

128
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,836
But that's marvelous.

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,955
Ridiculous!

130
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,549
Yes, marvelous...

131
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,916
- It's not ridiculous.
- Come on...

132
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,874
You hate love stories.
Lots of people love them.

133
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,593
It's not ridiculous to them.

134
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,393
So, you're doing the sequel?

135
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,316
I love you.

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,079
Well, I hope it pays well.

137
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,715
It pays better than my articles.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,672
So it's adios to your book?

139
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,076
I can't do everything at once.

140
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,509
Did you like it, Lucas?

141
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,233
I liked it a lot.

142
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,756
Maybe it's not what I dreamed of.

143
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,432
But it's a stepping-stone.
I'm learning a ton.

144
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,319
But who can that be?

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,469
Are you expecting anyone?

146
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,954
I wrote a book, L'Auberge Espagnole,
5 years ago.

147
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,994
I haven't found a publisher,
but I still have hope.

148
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,395
Barbara, what does this mean?

149
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,639
I knew I'd find you here.

150
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,589
So, she's the one!

151
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,273
You disappoint me.
I thought she'd at least be...

152
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,871
Yes.

153
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,275
Yes, who? Yes, what?
Can't you say who you are?

154
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,074
Everyone else does, why can't you?

155
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,590
What do you want me to say?
"It's your mommy?"

156
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,269
Everyone else does.
Why can't you?

157
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,034
Gimme a break!
You want me to be like everyone else.

158
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,150
It's grampa...

159
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,350
Hold on.

160
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,598
I was sure you'd forget.

161
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,150
Hi, it's Martine.

162
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,589
I'm on the other line.

163
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,676
Quick!

164
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,189
Okay, go ahead.

165
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,630
- About tonight...
- Oh, happy birthday.

166
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,319
You didn't forget?

167
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,555
You done?

168
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,718
Mom, hold on. It's Martine.
It's her birthday.

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,434
Wish her happy birthday for me.

170
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,677
My mother says, "Happy birthday."

171
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,916
- Tell her "thanks."
- What time tonight?

172
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,518
- He expects you for dinner tonight.
- Hold on, mom. Not you.

173
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,552
I don't know, nine.

174
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,909
That works.

175
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,229
I gotta go.

176
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,396
Xavier!

177
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,033
Hold on. Not you, mom.

178
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,716
Give me...

179
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,315
The code.

180
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,273
My new door code is 20B 10.

181
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,952
Okay, I've really gotta go...

182
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,671
Mom, hold on!

183
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,471
- Hi, Mrs. Lopez.
- You have to pick up your mail.

184
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,876
It's been piling up for a week.

185
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,511
Can I borrow a DVD?

186
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,233
You done yet?

187
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,957
I caught you off guard the other day,
and now I'm a little off guard...

188
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,116
Coming, mom.

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,749
I'll stop back later.

190
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,910
All clear? Can I talk now?

191
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,315
Is it my turn?

192
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,716
You've got grampa tonight.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,750
I'll be there!

194
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,316
My neighbor, Mr. Boubaker,

195
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,319
is the most uninteresting guy on earth.

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,635
Hey...

197
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,235
You know what?

198
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,272
The Big Bang theory doesn't work.

199
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,712
They said on the radio this morning
it may not be true.

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,638
Well, no one knows for sure.

201
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,989
If he only knew.

202
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,078
When I write a story,
I always think of Mr. Boubaker.

203
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,909
I try to imagine the scene
with "Mr. Average Guy."

204
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,830
That's him! "Mr. Average Guy."

205
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,749
It's rare to meet one.
There aren't that many in real life.

206
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,792
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

207
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,437
- But who can it be?
- I don't know.

208
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,755
Oh, Barbara, what does this mean?

209
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,792
I thought I'd find you here.

210
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,949
So, she's the one.

211
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,315
You disappoint me.

212
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,078
I thought she'd at least be...

213
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,595
She'd be what?

214
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,598
Yeah, she'd be what?

215
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,469
Excuse me.

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,599
What's your girlfriend like?

217
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,598
It's not for my girlfriend.

218
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,393
I don't have a girlfriend.

219
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,433
What's this girl
who's not your girlfriend like?

220
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,671
She's a little shorter than you.

221
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,155
She has smaller... I mean...

222
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,676
I think she's size one or two.

223
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,269
It depends. Is she thinner than I am?

224
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,519
Is she like that girl?

225
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,556
No.

226
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,956
She's more like her.

227
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,879
But not as ugly.

228
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,913
Take the two.

229
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,512
Your girlfriend can always exchange it.

230
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,433
The register's over there.

231
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,269
By the way,
I've been a bachelor for a year.

232
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,994
I love your hair.

233
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,319
I prefer that you leave.

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,309
Really?

235
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,474
I'm sorry, I'm very modest.

236
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,519
Look, I've gotta run.

237
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,872
Okay, I'm going!

238
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,276
I wasn't chasing you out.

239
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,233
Don't sweat it. I'm outta here!

240
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,758
That was great. I had a blast.
Thanks a lot.

241
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,398
Why are you talking like that?

242
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,711
Because I'm a big jerk.

243
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,469
So...

244
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,595
I just wanted to say
I'm a bachelor...

245
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,916
Bye.

246
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,753
Not to be too insistent...
this really isn't for my girlfriend.

247
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,638
It's no biggie. Who cares?

248
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,070
I don't have a girlfriend.

249
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,271
It's for my ex. For her birthday.

250
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,313
I'll give you my number.

251
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,555
For...?

252
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,829
I don't know.

253
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,635
If the dress doesn't fit,
you can call me.

254
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,074
No, I don't know.

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,193
I've always dreamed of doing that
but I never dared.

256
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,789
With you, I thought I should dare.

257
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,029
Take it, 'cause I feel like a jerk.

258
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,909
I'll jot it down.

259
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,159
But you have to call tonight.
Or you never will.

260
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,830
There.

261
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,230
I don't know.

262
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,475
Yes, yes!

263
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,632
You've got nothing to lose.

264
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,638
If I were you, I'd call me.

265
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,674
I also wrote an article for snowb...

266
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,593
for a magazine about winter sports.

267
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,799
What about your novel?

268
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,149
Yeah.

269
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,157
I'm trying, but it's not easy.

270
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,512
At least these little jobs

271
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,791
help me pay the rent.

272
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,519
This is temporary.

273
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,199
Be careful.

274
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,870
Sometimes these temporary things
can last a long time.

275
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,716
Meaning?

276
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,189
Don't forget to write important things.

277
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,709
You're good at that. You always were.

278
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,590
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

279
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,989
I'll tell Aïcha.

280
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,155
So, little Xavier,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?

281
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,395
Uh, yeah...

282
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,230
Well, yeah, that's right...

283
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,720
I'm a size one. You know that!

284
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,429
You think I'm fat.

285
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,676
It's okay. I can exchange it.

286
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,673
I never wear dresses.

287
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,349
Why do you girls have
such a problem with dresses?

288
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,039
First, I'm not "girls."

289
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,357
I wear pants.
It's more practical on a bike.

290
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,232
Anyway, thank you very much.

291
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,829
It's...

292
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,552
No, it's pretty. Really.

293
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,798
Now you'll say I'm a pain.

294
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,189
You're a pain.

295
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,234
No, thanks.

296
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,475
Really?

297
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,631
By the way...

298
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,436
there's the Social Forum.

299
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,234
It's in Porto Alegre, in Brazil.

300
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,399
I can't miss that.

301
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,949
Could you maybe...?

302
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,716
I can take care of Lucas.

303
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,717
Does he ever see his father?

304
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,111
I'd rather not discuss it.

305
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,309
It's that bad?

306
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,270
Yeah.

307
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,075
You with anyone?

308
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,515
No.

309
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,392
- You?
- No.

310
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,913
Hello, thirties!

311
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,475
Kassia?

312
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,996
Oh, yeah!

313
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,629
How are you?

314
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,037
I'm glad you called.
Sure I know who you are!

315
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,519
No, no bother at all.

316
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,559
What are you doing?

317
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,595
Good morning.

318
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,233
More coffee?

319
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,431
No, I really have to go.

320
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,472
I just wanted to say...

321
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,469
What?

322
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,795
It's stupid. I just wanted to say...

323
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,479
I never do that.

324
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,109
We'll talk later?

325
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,235
You in love?

326
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,358
Something's going on.

327
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,955
I really like black girls.

328
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,994
You like anything with a pussy!

329
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,749
Why'd you say that?

330
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,873
You cruise every chick on the street.

331
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,189
But me, I don't get the time of day!

332
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,550
- Stop!
- Stop what?

333
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,036
I'm really embarrassed to ask,
but I'm in deep shit.

334
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,314
Thomas got dumped by his girlfriend.

335
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,870
He's taking the apartment back.

336
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,234
Can I stay with you or...?

337
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,959
No problem, Xavier.

338
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,639
- Oh, really?
- What?

339
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,150
He moves in
and you don't even ask me?

340
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,671
No! You piss me off.
All you do is give me shit!

341
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,474
It's my place
and I don't need your permission

342
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,159
to invite a friend over.

343
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,316
If it's not the moment...

344
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,431
Fine.

345
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,835
Carol!

346
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,429
I'm really mortified. I hope...

347
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,388
No, it's fine.

348
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,159
It's just fine.

349
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,558
Cool. When are you coming?

350
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,275
Xavier?

351
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,788
You're here already!

352
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,150
Cool! All moved in?

353
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,316
Yeah.

354
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,835
Great.

355
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,834
I won't bother you guys. I've got work.

356
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,792
No sweat. We broke up.

357
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,355
We're both bachelors now, buddy.

358
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,834
- Great!
- Cool, huh?

359
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,599
- Great!
- How about a beer?

360
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,069
Come on in.

361
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,588
I'm impressed.

362
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,270
You like it?

363
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,108
It's really nice!

364
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,429
There's Xavier.

365
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,400
- I think you met.
- Oh, right.

366
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,874
I remember.

367
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,549
Well, I'm...

368
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,475
I'll show you around.

369
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,670
It's really nice.

370
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,154
Well, it's not...

371
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,793
Did you decorate it?

372
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,838
Come, see the bedroom.

373
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,633
Right over here.

374
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,359
Make yourself at home.

375
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,999
Careful, it'll fall.

376
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,995
See them, Lucas?

377
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,230
That doesn't hurt the trees.
It makes them stronger.

378
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,313
Take my number.
I'll stop by and we can discuss it.

379
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,511
- That's so nice.
- Not at all.

380
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,869
06...

381
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,789
Come on!

382
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,439
Thank you!

383
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,038
That's so nice.
I didn't know what to do.

384
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,390
You have to take care of flowers!

385
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,794
It's crazy!
People think nature just grows.

386
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,150
We humans have to nurture it.

387
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,712
And euphorbia...
People always over-water them.

388
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,720
Even once a week is too much.

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,796
I'll stop by.

390
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,080
Not only does she hook up
with this guy, "Mr. Plane Tree,"

391
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,237
then she sends me up shit creek
without a paddle.

392
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,234
Two seconds.

393
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,478
So, that was the day
she left for Brazil.

394
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,395
As if my life
wasn't already a mess.

395
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,035
"Happy to have finally found her prince,
she agreed to marry him.

396
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,876
"The wedding went on for a week,

397
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,594
"and all the kingdom was invited.

398
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,789
"They had a beautiful castle

399
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,832
"and lived happily ever after."

400
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,234
Go to sleep now, Lucas.
Wanna go pee-pee?

401
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,591
Don't you wanna go pee-pee first?

402
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,711
Hasn't mommy found her prince yet?

403
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,515
Well, I don't really know.

404
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,276
- Has she mentioned it?
- No.

405
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,034
Then I guess
she hasn't found him. But...

406
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,158
she's beautiful, she's intelligent...

407
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,476
If he knew
how much I'd loved his mother.

408
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,551
I guess Martine hasn't told him.

409
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,118
How do you explain that?

410
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,199
I've been with seven guys, uh...
seven princes.

411
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,155
I've lived in different castles.

412
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,000
Xavier was the fourth prince.

413
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,033
At the moment,

414
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,949
I've got a bunch of princes going.

415
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,559
I don't know... I hesitate.

416
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,876
Last week, I met one at a club.

417
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,918
Like a ball, a great ball.

418
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,999
I really like him.

419
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,231
He doesn't have a huge castle
but he's got a big motorcycle.

420
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,273
You'd like that.

421
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,472
It's complicated...

422
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,075
Even if things go well,
it's still a little too soon to...

423
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,877
to know if there'll be a wedding.

424
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,509
And then

425
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,154
some people

426
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,438
in the kingdom say,

427
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,831
if he's the one,
they won't come to the wedding.

428
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,592
Don't cry, mommy.

429
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,918
Mommy!

430
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,756
What's the matter?

431
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,953
- Don't you want your apple?
- No.

432
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,355
There's some left!

433
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,429
You don't want anymore.

434
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,919
Look who's here!

435
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,435
It's mommy!

436
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,109
My sweetie pie!

437
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,635
You okay?

438
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,069
Hi.

439
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,755
Tudo bem?

440
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,594
He was really sick.
He's gotta go to bed.

441
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,835
Really?

442
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,914
I'll put him to bed. I'm wiped out.

443
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,638
So, what happened?

444
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,029
The doctor came because I was sick.

445
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,275
Really?

446
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,713
So how was Porto Alegre?

447
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,877
It was great!

448
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,230
There were 216 countries there!

449
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,229
Every continent!
Chili, Mali, Montenegro...

450
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,873
Tibet!

451
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,115
It was so moving just to be there.

452
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,676
It really makes you feel
connected to the planet.

453
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,679
Did you all agree
to save a doomed world?

454
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,309
Hold on!

455
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,111
Give me shit if you want to, but...

456
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,957
globalization
isn't only generating progress.

457
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,756
We have to unite to fight against
disasters that could become inevitable.

458
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,111
You've got the schpeel down.

459
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,079
What's your problem?

460
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,117
While you're saving the world,
I take care of your kid,

461
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,277
I haven't slept in three nights
and I...

462
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,073
You what?

463
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,352
You've done zip with your life.

464
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,436
Me?

465
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,070
With those sappy stories of yours?

466
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,238
You lull silly schoolgirls
into dreamland.

467
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,715
"They kiss before the sunset..."

468
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,076
Bullshit.

469
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,954
But what do they dream about?
Pieces of shit.

470
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,109
You know what?
Your work is a load of crap.

471
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,152
It's been crap for two years.

472
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,870
And I know you're better than that.

473
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,639
Wait a minute, I...

474
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,112
You don't give a shit.
You get your lousy two bits,

475
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,595
you're nice and cozy with that.

476
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,073
So you make fun of people who move,
who fight against pollution,

477
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,875
against exclusion, against violence.

478
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,912
Against real things in the real world!

479
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,111
It's easy for you to laugh at that.

480
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,675
That's for sure!

481
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,348
I don't laugh.

482
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,755
You're a parasite.

483
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,156
- I'm a what?
- A parasite.

484
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,998
Happy as a clam,

485
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,589
telling insipid love stories.

486
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,313
That's how it should be!

487
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,989
Don't change a thing.

488
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,599
That seems to satisfy you.

489
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,995
Xavier...

490
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,039
Hi, it's me.

491
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,354
I'm sorry.

492
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,159
I'm sorry. Really.

493
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,759
And thanks for Lucas.

494
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,632
What's wrong, John Edward?

495
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,750
Nothing.

496
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,191
Yes, there is.
I can see something's wrong.

497
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,759
I have a terrible secret.

498
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,675
What do you mean?

499
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,080
The company's bankrupt.
I haven't a cent.

500
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,998
The bank called, I'm drowning.

501
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,835
But how?

502
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,317
Venice. It was your dream,
I couldn't let you down.

503
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,313
I have a terrible secret.

504
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,715
What do you mean?

505
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,032
I'm having an affair with Sarah.

506
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,751
How could you do that to me?

507
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,999
My mother's ill,
your dad sold the company

508
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,793
and I've had a car accident.

509
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,276
That's awful!

510
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,359
I have a twin brother, John Sebastian.

511
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,959
- We look exactly alike.
- And...?

512
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,999
I'm not me, Odile.

513
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,556
I'm the twin.

514
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,155
What does that mean?

515
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,949
I don't know.

516
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,839
- Wanna go?
- Maybe.

517
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,949
You okay?

518
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,477
How can I write a love story?

519
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,430
I know nothing about love.

520
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,556
I'm a self-centered egotist.

521
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,197
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

522
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,919
Careful! Hold me tight.

523
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,838
I've got you. Wait!

524
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,193
Let's go. Be careful.

525
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,033
- You okay?
- Fine.

526
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,511
Watch it here. We have to stop.

527
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,514
We have to wait for the second light.

528
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,518
- Okay.
- Careful!

529
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,674
It's dangerous.

530
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,639
By the way,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?

531
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,839
- I forgot!
- What do you mean? It's important.

532
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,030
Yeah, I know.

533
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,877
"When do I get to meet
your fiancée?"

534
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,312
I don't know why but
that question started to obsess me.

535
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,670
I had to find the right girl fast,

536
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,279
before he died.

537
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,315
Hello, Kassia?

538
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,999
Oh, I'm sorry.

539
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,793
Really?
When's she due back from Senegal?

540
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,919
Really?

541
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,952
No big deal. It's Xavier.

542
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,673
Thanks. Bye.

543
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,074
What is it?

544
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,032
Can you come here a sec?

545
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,309
Coming.

546
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,434
So, I...

547
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,392
You okay? Have a good day?

548
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,354
- Great.
- What's up?

549
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,999
I have a huge favor to ask.

550
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,431
Something you'll hate.
But you absolutely have to say yes.

551
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,596
What?

552
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,952
Somewhere in your closet,
do you have a dress?

553
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,389
A dress?

554
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,114
Never mind, it'll never work.

555
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,916
- It'll be a nightmare.
- I don't have a dress.

556
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,152
- What would I do with a dress?
- I'm sorry.

557
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,309
Stay calm. Don't freak out
and say, "I'm a dyke!"

558
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,636
Don't make it worse. I'm here!

559
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,750
Just a warning.

560
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,554
I'm already
a hair's breath from walking.

561
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,068
This is ridiculous.

562
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,475
Look at this thing.

563
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,796
Shall I go get them, darling?

564
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,394
No, we can go later...
Good evening!

565
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,954
After dinner.

566
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,835
But that's so very kind of you,
my dear.

567
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,756
Or we can blow off the whole thing.

568
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,714
It's so, so pretty here.

569
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,513
Don't talk like that.

570
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,155
- Quit fucking around!
- Isn't that what you want?

571
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,874
Stop! Concentrate.

572
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,594
Quit it!
I'm ringing the bell.

573
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,596
Go ahead.

574
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,872
What are you doing? I'm not ready!

575
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,876
Hello.

576
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,428
Hi, grampa.

577
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,073
Hello, sir.

578
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,079
I'm so happy to meet you. Come in!

579
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,713
Isabelle, grampa.

580
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,958
Delighted! Fuck!

581
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,992
- Careful!
- Sorry. Fuck.

582
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,190
Hello, my boy.

583
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,789
Follow me.

584
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,991
I'm so happy to meet you.

585
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,872
Me too. Really!

586
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,951
It's so, so, so pretty.

587
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,515
Isn't it?

588
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,710
Stop!

589
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,516
Want to know how old I am?

590
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,559
I'm 98. I've seen three wars.

591
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,072
That's incredible!
Extraordinary!

592
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,515
I was born in 1906.

593
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,598
But I won't bore you with all that.

594
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,917
Can you imagine
hearing my life story?

595
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,714
That'd take hours...

596
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,478
Let's talk about you, miss.

597
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,469
I'm so happy
my grandson has such a pretty fiancée!

598
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,279
Oh, no...

599
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,957
Oh, yes, I insist, very pretty.

600
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,912
Thank you, that's very kind of you.

601
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,351
So, tell me,
what do you do for a living?

602
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,878
Well...

603
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,315
So...

604
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,319
I work for a television station,

605
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,194
where I'm a financial journalist.

606
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,756
Well, what does that mean?

607
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,396
It means I work in the financial world.

608
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,155
I gather tidbits of information
on financial markets, stock options,

609
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,317
what's bought, what's sold.

610
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,910
Because traders
- people who work in the market -

611
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,953
need an enormous amount
of info... rmation

612
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,673
on an enormous number...

613
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,275
of things.

614
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,957
Who's interested in all that?

615
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,039
Lots and lots of people.

616
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,233
There are 450 assets management
firms in Paris alone.

617
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,795
It's a very competitive sector.

618
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,878
You gotta kick the other guy
in the balls.

619
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,879
Things move fast,
tons of money's at stake.

620
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,876
Once, I got a tip that
Asian markets were about to collapse.

621
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,230
I had to react like that!

622
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,751
For a trader,
that's an explosive situation.

623
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,314
You gotta be on the ball.

624
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,070
That info has gigantic repercussions
on the planet.

625
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,909
What?

626
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,949
I can't do this.

627
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,754
One hour. We're gonna eat. Please.

628
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,638
- Let's go.
- One little hour.

629
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,074
Now I see why you slipped away.

630
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,710
Dinner's ready.

631
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,150
Let's go to the table.

632
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,198
- Go ahead.
- No, you first.

633
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,269
Come on.

634
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,955
Water?

635
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,834
I feel dirty...

636
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,236
just pretending to be so clean.

637
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,797
Xavier,
the woman you want doesn't exist.

638
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,193
You've gotta grow up.
You want a princess or...

639
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,357
worse, a TV soap heroine!

640
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,558
Stop dreaming!
Princesses only exist in fairytales.

641
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,436
That was bullshit.

642
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,319
Why stop dreaming?

643
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,795
You wanna go out?

644
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,275
Yeah! Because now...

645
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,110
But this time I decide what we do.

646
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,558
I want her so, so pretty.

647
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,470
I'll think I'm king of the world.
No, thanks.

648
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,955
You're having fun!

649
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,876
Xavier's a cute little dish.

650
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,349
You're having fun!

651
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,429
You piggies!

652
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,192
- You okay?
- Yeah, great.

653
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,398
- She'll be beautiful!
- When'll my wife be ready?

654
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,389
Gimme a break.

655
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,277
That's better, isn't it?

656
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,959
Okay, I got it.

657
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,589
Shake your ass!

658
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,279
It suits him!

659
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,272
Have you met my wife?

660
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,230
Telephone.

661
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,794
Is this yours, cupcake?

662
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,519
Yeah, that's mine.

663
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,993
Hello? Xavier?

664
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,277
My pet...

665
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,754
No, that's Isabelle.

666
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,910
You okay?

667
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,955
Yeah. Why?

668
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,634
I don't know, you sound funny.

669
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,795
It's just...
Lucas' father just picked him up.

670
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,189
That's great.

671
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,551
He's sleeping over tonight and...

672
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,358
That's a good thing.

673
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,676
My wife's always on the phone.

674
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,596
That may be her lover.

675
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,959
And I'm all alone.

676
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,590
Who's calling you at this hour?

677
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,153
Your son shouldn't just see women.

678
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,912
Yeah, it's great.

679
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,835
But...

680
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,753
It's just that...

681
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,549
Can I come over?

682
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,359
Yeah, come over.

683
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,433
No, come over.

684
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,073
No bother at all.

685
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,155
Hi.

686
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,474
- You're wearing makeup?
- Really?

687
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,671
Yes, you are. It looks nice.

688
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,756
I see you girls are having fun.

689
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,868
So what's the matter?

690
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,511
- Martine, you okay?
- Hi.

691
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,789
How are you?

692
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,799
Good to see you. Come in.

693
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,035
Come on in.

694
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,154
It's really funny.
I just got Martine Goes Camping.

695
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,271
I didn't have that one.

696
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,838
Anyway, it's not easy.

697
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,834
We must seem like
uptight straight people.

698
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,879
That may be true.

699
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,834
I think that's a bad idea.

700
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,348
Just for tonight.

701
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,277
It's really not a good idea.

702
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,118
You are uptight, after all.

703
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,270
I'm not uptight. I just don't want to.

704
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,152
It's a question of wanting to.

705
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,831
I adore you, but I don't wanna
sleep with you. And neither do you.

706
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,512
I am a pain in the ass.

707
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,119
No, you're not.

708
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,879
I'll never find a guy.

709
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,758
You're right, I'm annoying.

710
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,153
I broke up with Bruno.

711
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,199
Did I mention him?

712
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,829
Sorry, they change so fast,
I can't keep track.

713
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,315
I don't get it. Since you,
I just don't meet guys who...

714
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,069
I don't know.

715
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,873
You expect too much.

716
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,557
You're looking for an ideal guy
who doesn't exist.

717
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,637
You're a big girl now, Martine.

718
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,513
Stop dreaming of "Mr. Perfect."

719
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,949
Do something!

720
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,955
Come on.

721
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,911
Let's go to my room.

722
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,077
Why are you crying?

723
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,270
Okay, you are a pain,
but you're beautiful, intelligent...

724
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,597
Lots of guys are crazy about you.

725
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,077
I don't give a shit about that.

726
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,632
What if you were a ball-breaker,
ugly, stupid

727
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,033
and no one was hot for you?
You're far from that.

728
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,151
What guys are crazy about me?

729
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,469
I don't know...

730
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,919
Patrick. He said you drive him wild.

731
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,713
Really? Patrick said that?

732
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,597
- He said, "Martine drives me wild?"
- Yes!

733
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,952
You seem surprised. There's something
attractive about you, after all.

734
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,155
Okay! You say it like...

735
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,912
Can I sleep with you tonight?

736
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,715
Please.

737
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,429
If you want to.

738
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,990
Shit!

739
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,069
Morning!

740
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,553
Thank you. I'm happy I stayed with you.

741
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,072
Yeah, but you can't stay.
I'm expecting a girl... friend.

742
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,273
It's no big deal.

743
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,913
Just tell her the truth.

744
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,792
We're old friends and we didn't fuck.

745
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,149
Yeah, sure.

746
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,194
She's your girlfriend?

747
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,795
Yeah.

748
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,358
- You have a girlfriend?
- No, not really.

749
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,356
Is she your girlfriend or not?

750
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,279
I don't have a girlfriend,
I have girlfriends.

751
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,118
Do you have a girlfriend or not?

752
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,755
I don't have one, I have lots.
Is that clear?

753
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,349
Oh! I forgot how you were.

754
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,512
Flip out on your own time!

755
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,472
I'm outta here.

756
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,911
Well, yeah.
She's on her way. It'll be a mess.

757
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,432
I have a life. Last night,
you didn't give me a chance to explain

758
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,870
that I had to juggle things
this morning.

759
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,150
Bye.

760
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,594
I'm sorry.
I was afraid you'd run into her.

761
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,199
I understand.

762
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,430
Fuck!

763
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,436
- Who is she?
- No one.

764
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,994
I'm no one?

765
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,873
I'm no one?

766
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,275
You have your life, I have mine.
No problem!

767
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,279
But you'll always be someone to me.
Always.

768
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,959
In anyone's presence.

769
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,189
- Who is she?
- No...

770
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,232
My ex, Martine.

771
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,509
Not so "ex".

772
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,910
She is my ex. It's over. Come in.

773
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,269
One in, one out...

774
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,717
That doesn't bother you at all.

775
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,355
You don't understand.

776
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,279
You just line 'em up.
You don't give a fuck.

777
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,154
Exactly.
If you don't like it, take a hike.

778
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,111
What?

779
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,550
Yeah! You're all fucking,
stupid bitches!

780
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,958
You got that? Now get lost!

781
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,715
Asshole.

782
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,191
Yeah, I'm an asshole!

783
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,598
You can't talk to women like that.
Asshole!

784
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,111
Who is she? I'm a what?

785
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,436
Stop! Calm down. You...

786
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,755
I what?

787
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,794
She can't talk to me like that.
You parade your sluts through here...

788
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,349
Fuck, Xavier!

789
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,393
It's not easy for a woman my age
to find a good man.

790
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,511
A good man's hard to find.

791
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,872
Yeah, I know.

792
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,509
I want you to meet him.
But no comments!

793
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,309
Chill out, ma! You're not 15.

794
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,316
I know what it's like not to find
your soul mate right away.

795
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,477
Don't worry, I've been briefed.

796
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,830
Still, we humans are a funny race.

797
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,712
Did you know that
a hippopotamus chooses one mate

798
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,036
and they stay together for life?

799
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,349
Did you know that?

800
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,436
No.

801
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,713
Isn't that marvelous?

802
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,789
This is it?

803
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,959
- He lives here?
- Yeah.

804
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,231
- You, too?
- For three months now.

805
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,078
Okay, I get it.

806
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,510
- You get what?
- Why he's a good man.

807
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,234
- Stop!
- I see why you're with him.

808
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,590
No comments. You promised.

809
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,438
- Are you freaking out?
- No.

810
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,956
Yes, you are.

811
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,276
You'll make me freak out for real.

812
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,437
We used to cut the world in two.

813
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,429
Capitalists, Marxists; exploiters,
exploited; the Right, the Left.

814
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,630
That worked pretty well.

815
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,032
Those oppositions don't work anymore.

816
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,316
Today, one world strips women bare,
another veils them.

817
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,996
That's the real opposition today.
In our image of women.

818
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,159
Yeah, that's true.

819
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,077
So I finally finished a new draft.

820
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,238
But France TV
had a little surprise for me.

821
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,033
They said that
an Australian satellite "bouquet"...

822
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,639
Or was it German?

823
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,118
TS6 is a silent partner of PassionTV,
through Eurosat 2000.

824
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,956
Yeah, that's it.

825
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,028
It was some sort of"bouquet"buy-out
by God knows who.

826
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,710
Anyway, Love Passion in Venice
was now a BBC 2 co-production.

827
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,638
So the script had to be in English.

828
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,876
Oh, really?

829
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,193
Their BBC counterparts are currently

830
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,917
putting together a pool
of screenwriters. And so, that's that.

831
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,076
Sorry. We know how much you've
invested in Love Passion in Venice.

832
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,519
He said, "Those are
the vagaries of globalization."

833
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,951
You're a victim of globalization.

834
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,679
That made me feel better.

835
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,355
Hold on, I speak English.

836
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,915
Meaning?

837
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,034
You think you can write in English?

838
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,272
Of course. I've even written
screenplays in English.

839
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,636
Can we submit them
to our co-producers?

840
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,870
Yes.

841
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,037
Well, that's a bit complicated...

842
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,758
I wrote them when I was in Barcelona...

843
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,273
I think the publisher's production arm
may have gone bankrupt.

844
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,032
Hello, Paris!

845
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,871
I'm a Parisian!

846
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,520
Gimme some escargot and red wine!

847
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,309
Do you speak French?

848
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,959
Wanna sleep with me?

849
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,392
Hi. I was talking about the lights.

850
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,873
I have to work a little longer.
Just a bit.

851
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,749
I need...

852
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,749
the light.

853
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,996
To work. Like that.

854
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,079
Like the sun.

855
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,156
On stage.

856
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,228
Thank you very much.

857
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,910
I'll just be a little while.
My name is Natasha.

858
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,998
Thank you, William.

859
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,555
Bye.

860
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,155
So, there it is.

861
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,829
A love story is above all a story.

862
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,229
It was good?

863
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,029
Thank you.

864
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,874
You liked it?

865
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,153
In what way?

866
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,360
You liked the way I danced?

867
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,069
You liked it. Okay. Thanks.

868
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,235
Bye.

869
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,714
Natasha!

870
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,673
Do you remember me?

871
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,513
Yes, I remember.

872
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,397
A year ago, when you got on that bus,

873
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,915
you gave me this little piece of paper.

874
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,632
I decided to learn Russian

875
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,195
just so I could speak to you.

876
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,318
I've dreamed of this moment.

877
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,870
I'm staying at the Moskva Hotel.

878
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,475
This time,

879
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,354
I'll give you a little piece of paper.

880
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,395
I apologize if this is... weird.

881
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,759
Call me.

882
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,232
If you want to.

883
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,870
Okay.

884
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,950
We proposed your English screenwriter.

885
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,628
They know her well.

886
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,874
They agreed.
You can leave for London anytime.

887
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,070
All travel and expenses
will be reimbursed.

888
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,548
Great!

889
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,192
We certainly owe you that.

890
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,394
Wendy was always like a sister to me,

891
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,993
like a mirror image.

892
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,518
I realized I wasn't
the only one who screwed up.

893
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,952
Wendy's great. She must've really
been in love to get to this state.

894
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,359
How'd she ever wind up
with a guy like that?

895
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,156
How can so many sincere moments,
one after the other,

896
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,078
lead to such misery?

897
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,268
Who'd want that?

898
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,638
I don't remember
how we finally got started.

899
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,079
After breakfast, we'd work for hours.

900
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,398
When we'd had it,
we'd go next door for a bite.

901
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,750
Where have you been all this time?

902
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,115
Coming.

903
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,109
We went to bed late.

904
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,915
Even after work,
we couldn't stop talking.

905
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,439
Hello, Mr. Rousseau?

906
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,438
It's Michel Hermann. Hello.

907
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,879
Tell me, does the name Celia Shelburn
mean anything to you?

908
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,673
Celia Shelburn? Of course!

909
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,635
Really? I only heard of her last week.

910
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,114
She's 24
and she's going to write her memoirs.

911
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,798
She's got lots to tell,
so you've got lots to write.

912
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,031
So I had to rush back to Paris

913
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,754
to start my new job
with Celia Shelburn.

914
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,558
Anyway, it's 46B28.

915
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,156
I have red wine, Diet Coke.

916
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,669
I love...

917
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,913
It was funny.

918
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,869
We can speak French, if you prefer.
I speak French, too.

919
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,549
You speak French? Okay. Fine.

920
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,790
By 18, I'd toured the world
several times.

921
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,789
Really?

922
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,278
It's such a drag to be so famous.

923
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,712
Yeah, I imagine.

924
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,317
Do you see the boats pass by at night?

925
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,433
Yeah, it's beautiful. I love that.

926
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,191
I've always dreamed of seeing that.

927
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,632
Celia, I've gotta go!

928
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,749
I lost track of time!

929
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,474
Every morning, she had a cardboard
croissant from the Pakistani deli.

930
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,876
I told her
those things were disgusting.

931
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,549
But she said she really liked...

932
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,398
French breakfasts.

933
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,514
I, on the other hand, always
habituate myself to local customs.

934
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,438
So it was bacon and eggs for me.

935
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,553
My idea had been
to take a little stroll,

936
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,149
to show her Paris.

937
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,915
As time went on,

938
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,396
I sensed we didn't want to separate.

939
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,598
We didn't want just a little stroll.

940
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,031
We wanted a much longer stroll.

941
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,637
At one moment, I don't know why,

942
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,356
I don't know how, this happened...

943
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,509
I felt her hand say...

944
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,431
"Really? Are you sure?"

945
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,194
And my hand said,
"I'm sure.

946
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,877
"I want to
and I sense you do, too."

947
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,229
She squeezed my hand even tighter.
She wanted to.

948
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,192
It's wild how strong
these stupid moments can be.

949
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,072
Those 12 seconds

950
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,238
will be etched
deep inside you forever.

951
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,679
In the movies,
most love stories end there.

952
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,394
It's better
not to show what comes next.

953
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,035
But that's the interesting part.

954
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,431
- Stay!
- Let me go!

955
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,755
No! Stay!

956
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,708
Let me go!

957
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,479
What the fuck are you doing?

958
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,315
Neus!

959
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,709
Fuck you!

960
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,230
Neus! I don't believe it!

961
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,949
What are you doing? Come back!

962
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,239
Where are you going?

963
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,594
It was like we had to go through that.

964
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,998
Like going through all that wacky shit
reassured us somehow.

965
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,872
It proved we were in love.

966
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,475
You know, I feel a little weird
working with you.

967
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,795
Why?

968
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,516
Well, a month ago you were a stranger
and now...

969
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,272
I tell you my life story...

970
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,312
You're gonna write it.

971
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,000
You've become my mirror.

972
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,915
I hope you don't find me
too superficial.

973
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,633
Not at all.

974
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,949
You're a spoiled child
but you have a strong personality.

975
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,229
You think so?

976
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,637
You're a beautiful person.

977
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,836
Your dream's about to come true.

978
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,990
The next morning,
everything had changed.

979
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,590
Even my scooter wasn't the same.

980
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:56,716
Get out!

981
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,590
Get the fuck out!

982
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,314
Wendy and I decided
to visit William in Saint Petersburg.

983
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:20,391
Beginning a relationship
is like going on a trip.

984
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,352
And going far away
can show how close you can be.

985
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:04,153
William took us to the Komunolka
where he and Natasha lived.

986
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,477
A communal apartment
occupied by several families.

987
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,034
Hello.

988
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,834
This is my sister Wendy. And Xavier.

989
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,036
Please, come in.

990
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,673
Come on, Natasha!

991
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,596
This is my sister, Wendy.
Xavier.

992
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,912
Oh! Hi!

993
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,957
Can't you put some pants on?

994
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,672
Oleg, this is my fiancé's family.

995
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,678
You could make an effort.

996
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,191
Well, tell your fiancé...

997
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,029
Must you walk around in your skivvies?

998
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,519
It's my house. If I feel like
wearing skivvies, I'll wear skivvies.

999
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,313
With or without English people.

1000
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,632
Make them some tea.
And thanks a bunch, Oleg.

1001
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,592
I love you, too, darling.

1002
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:43,311
I'm sorry that you're seeing
the place like this.

1003
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,832
Times are changing.
I'm about to buy the whole apartment.

1004
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,395
It'll be great
when it's just for our family.

1005
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,308
- Won't it?
- Sure.

1006
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,078
This is
"the street of ideal proportions."

1007
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,193
The height of the buildings
is equal to the width of the street.

1008
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,516
And the length is 250 meters.

1009
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,951
Moscow? You're in Moscow?

1010
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,068
I don't know...

1011
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:33,633
No! I didn't say that.
It's not far. Why not?

1012
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,109
Two days?

1013
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,075
I don't know if I can.
Of course I want to.

1014
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,119
Yeah, great.

1015
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:41,393
Any guy with a normal constitution
would have run after her.

1016
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,309
Me, I didn't move.

1017
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,270
Or, rather, it's the train that moved.

1018
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,949
I just let it.

1019
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,190
I'm happy to see you.

1020
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,676
I was all alone in Moscow.

1021
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,518
I was so bored.

1022
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,394
Then I remembered
you were in Russia too.

1023
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,353
I thought, "That's too dumb.
We've got to see each other!"

1024
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,396
I'm so happy you came.
You're really a great guy.

1025
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,636
Yes, you are.

1026
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,389
1,500.

1027
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,031
She was just so beautiful.

1028
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,069
Celia is the stuff
that dreams are made of.

1029
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,920
So beautiful, she's almost not real.

1030
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,914
It'd be incredible to spend your life
with a woman like that.

1031
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,515
Please!

1032
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,116
Andrej!

1033
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,913
Take out the champagne!

1034
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:46,871
I felt the sub-woofer
calmly pounding away.

1035
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,080
After all, that's what a boom box
is supposed to do.

1036
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,395
That's what it does.

1037
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,358
We must like that low tone.

1038
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,998
We all want to vibrate.

1039
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,796
Celia is the female equivalent
of"the street of ideal proportions."

1040
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:21,750
We're not on earth long, so
that's the street we want to live on.

1041
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,712
I could've spent hours,
gazing at a girl like that.

1042
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,032
Just watching her live, walk,

1043
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,160
lulled by the swing of her skirt,

1044
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,356
inebriated by the fabric
sliding against her body.

1045
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:55,592
I could have lived on that
an entire lifetime.

1046
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,517
But can you live like that?

1047
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:05,590
They were right, I had to stop
dreaming and get back to real life.

1048
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,108
Hey, bitch!

1049
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,234
This street of yours...
Wanna know something?

1050
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,519
It's ugly!

1051
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,154
I've left Wendy three messages.

1052
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,349
Why is she avoiding me?

1053
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:19,269
Relax.
She'll call back sooner or later.

1054
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,872
She's got her family,
her brother's wedding. She's busy.

1055
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,509
Yeah, ma?

1056
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,676
I know, you told me two days ago.

1057
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,869
I've got another call.
I'll call you back.

1058
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,758
What's all this shit about love?

1059
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,873
How do we get so nuts?

1060
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:50,151
The time we waste!

1061
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,477
When you're alone, you cry,
"Will I find her?" When you're not,

1062
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,229
"Does she love me
as much as I love her?

1063
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:59,557
"Can we love more than one person
in a lifetime?

1064
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,319
"Why do we split up?"

1065
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,875
All these fucking questions!

1066
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,515
Yet you can't say we're uninformed.

1067
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,917
We read love stories,
fairy tales, novels,

1068
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,589
we watch movies. Love, love, love...

1069
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,359
You could just call her back.

1070
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,279
Dear William and Natalia,

1071
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,709
I'm pleased

1072
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:23,273
to welcome you
to our wedding palace.

1073
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:25,437
Before registering your marriage,

1074
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,792
I must ask

1075
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,231
if your wish to marry

1076
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,954
is mutual, sincere and free.

1077
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:37,115
I ask the groom to respond.

1078
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,433
I ask the bride.

1079
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:42,789
Yes.

1080
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:49,589
Still, this "till death do us part"
masquerade is pretty insane.

1081
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:53,277
You can't help being moved.
You can't help believing it.

1082
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:57,348
"The most beautiful day of my life."
"For better or for worse..."

1083
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:21,078
The photo album!
We'll have that for life.

1084
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,588
It's a day to remember.

1085
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,670
The tombstone of our love
that lives on for eternity.

1086
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,835
It's awful,
even I can't swallow it anymore.

1087
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:04,390
Gorko!

1088
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,798
I wish you happiness, my children.

1089
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:44,797
I raise my glass to William

1090
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:48,038
and his new family.

1091
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:59,349
Cheers!

1092
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:16,240
I miss you so much in Barcelona.

1093
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,033
I love you all.

1094
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,715
Cheers!

1095
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,112
Everybody, dance!

1096
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,035
On your feet, everybody!

1097
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:06,749
Let's light a fire under this party!

1098
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,310
Do I look like the farandole type?

1099
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,591
Who cares? It's Saint Pete's!

1100
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,515
Come on!

1101
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,635
What the fuck do you care? Come on!

1102
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:46,750
You okay?

1103
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:44,833
Why are you crying?

1104
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,269
Are you okay?

1105
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,873
Everything's fine.

1106
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:08,913
What's the matter?

1107
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:37,035
Voilà! That's me...

1108
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,959
I'm almost thirty. Still alone.

1109
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:43,917
Same damn face...
Can't change a thing.

1110
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,515
Me. Screwed up old me.

1111
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,757
No, that's too stupid.

1112
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,598
Don't do that.

1113
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,078
If I think about all the girls

1114
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:49,318
I've known
or slept with or just desired,

1115
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,515
they're like a bunch of Russian dolls.

1116
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:58,111
We spend our lives playing the game,
dying to know who'll be the last.

1117
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,472
The teeny-tiny one,
hidden inside all the others.

1118
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:05,436
You can't get to her right away.
You have to follow the progression.

1119
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:10,631
You have to open them, one by one,
wondering, "Is she the last?"

1120
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,199
Shit, I didn't finish!

1121
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,555
Well, it's no big deal...

1122
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,834
I'll finish the story later.

1123
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,312
Wait, I'll help you.

1124
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,669
I finished!

1125
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,799
Super bueno!

1126
