00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,992
Bingo!

2
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,517
Fucking hell.

3
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,557
Fucking hell.

4
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

5
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,238
If you wanna get 'em out of here.

6
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
- I can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

7
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,629
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...

8
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,479
I know who you are.
I know what you think...

9
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,235
If you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

10
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,348
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

11
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,750
- Infected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

12
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,673
Infected with what?

13
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,357
Rage.

14
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,037
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

15
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,394
No! No! No!

16
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,198
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

17
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,793
We'll get you out of here.

18
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,351
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

19
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,829
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

20
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,839
Get it off! Help me!

21
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,036
Get it off! Get it off!

22
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,592
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

23
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,750
Oh, my God!

24
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,992
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

25
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,913
Oh, God...

26
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,873
Hello?

27
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,193
Hello?

28
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,511
Hello!

29
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,554
Hello?

30
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,233
Hello!

31
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,591
Hello?

32
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,271
Hello?

33
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,031
Father?

34
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,191
Father, are you OK?

35
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,800
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

36
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,350
Shouldn't have done that.

37
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,557
Shit!

38
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,276
Over here!

39
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,270
- Over here!
- Come on!

40
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,595
Go, go, go!

41
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,675
Keep going!

42
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,513
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

43
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,788
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

44
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,194
Let's go! Let's go!

45
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,430
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

46
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,791
Come on!

47
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,751
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

48
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,751
The giraffe falls over.

49
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,834
The man goes to leave and the barman says
"Oi! You can't leave that lying there."

50
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,799
He says "No, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe".

51
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,873
He's completely humourless.

52
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,758
You two should get on like a house on fire.

53
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,191
So who are you?

54
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,191
You're from the hospital.

55
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,636
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

56
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,950
I'm a bicycle courier.

57
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,195
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

58
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,875
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm...

59
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,791
I'm hallucinating or I'm...

60
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,755
What's your name?

61
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,831
Jim.

62
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,040
I'm Mark. This is Selena.

63
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,872
OK, Jim.

64
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,314
I've got some bad news.

65
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,396
It started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

66
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,473
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

67
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,959
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

68
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,556
It was in the street outside.
It was coming through your windows.

69
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,392
It was a virus.

70
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,198
An infection.

71
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,999
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

72
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,435
It was the blood.

73
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,909
There was something in the blood.

74
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,075
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

75
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,958
The infection was everywhere.

76
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,429
The army blockades were overrun.

77
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,514
And that's when the exodus started.

78
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,479
The day before broadcasting stopped,

79
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,075
there were reports of Infection
in Paris and New York.

80
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,158
We didn't hear anything more after that.

81
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,833
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

82
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,275
Of course there's a government!

83
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,273
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

84
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,478
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

85
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,838
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

86
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,433
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

87
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,231
Where's your family?

88
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,076
They're dead. Like Selena's.

89
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,196
Yours will be dead too.

90
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,914
Look, I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it. OK?

91
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,468
You'll go and come back, yeah?

92
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,510
- You won't.
- Yes!

93
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,478
No one ever comes back.

94
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,791
So lesson one.

95
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,872
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

96
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,190
Lesson two.

97
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,193
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

98
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,116
We'll take you tomorrow.

99
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,636
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

100
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,039
Eat.

101
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,757
If you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

102
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,152
- If there's anyone...
- I understand.

103
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,231
- Anyone...
- I understand!

104
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,759
OK.

105
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,114
Jim...

106
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,194
Wait!

107
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,188
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

108
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,589
I'm not grateful.

109
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,711
My...

110
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,712
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

111
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,360
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

112
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,235
I remember my dad had all this cash,

113
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,517
even though cash was completely useless.

114
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,992
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

115
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,516
Crowd was surging.

116
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,550
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.

117
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,870
I remember the ground was soft.

118
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,958
I looked down
and I was standing on all these people.

119
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,828
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

120
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,708
Somewhere in the crowd
there were Infected. It spread fast.

121
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,997
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

122
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,518
Climb over more people.
So I did that. I climbed.

123
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,875
And I got up on top of this kiosk.

124
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,835
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

125
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,629
Then I saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

126
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,597
My dad.

127
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,791
His face...

128
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,074
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

129
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,109
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

130
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,399
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

131
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,677
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer.

132
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,671
Jim.

133
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,991
- You're back.
- Yeah.

134
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,111
- How was it?
- Fine.

135
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,355
Give me a drink of that, will ya?

136
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,431
- It's empty.
- Ha!

137
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,870
Here.

138
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,871
I'll start working on them, then.

139
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,151
Mark! Mark!

140
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,956
Selena! Help!

141
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,711
It's clear.

142
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,793
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

143
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,996
And his daughter. From four doors down.

144
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,038
- Were you bitten?
- No.

145
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,918
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

146
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,711
No.

147
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,392
Mark?

148
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,358
Wait...

149
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,436
Get that cleaned off.

150
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,231
Do you have any clothes here?

151
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,117
Um... I... Yes.

152
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,715
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

153
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,315
More Infected will be coming.
They always do.

154
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,798
How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?

155
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,634
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. It was on you.

156
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,874
I didn't know he was infected.
He knew. I could see it in his face.

157
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,192
If someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

158
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,195
It might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.

159
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,479
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

160
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,599
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

161
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,958
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world or just fall in love and fuck?

162
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,429
Plans are pointless.

163
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,988
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

164
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,113
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

165
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,191
What's that?

166
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,031
Let's go.

167
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,312
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

168
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,358
Stop talking. It's a long way up.

169
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,910
Do you need a break?

170
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,991
- You?
- No.

171
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,551
Now I do need a break.

172
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,352
What's up?

173
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,351
Nothin'.

174
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,914
I got a headache.

175
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,433
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

176
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,594
- Why didn't you say something before?
- I didn't think you'd give a shit.

177
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,833
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

178
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,956
So you're crashing.

179
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,190
There isn't a lot we can do about that

180
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,149
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

181
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,435
Pepsi or Lilt?

182
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,551
Do you have any Tango?

183
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,552
Actually,
I did have a can of Tango somewhere.

184
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,870
Quiet! That's an Infected.

185
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,552
Oh no, they're in. Move!

186
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,954
Wait up, Selena!

187
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,751
Wait for me, please!

188
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,876
Please, Selena! Please!

189
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,190
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

190
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,191
- Run!
- Wait!

191
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,394
Please! For fuck's sake!

192
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,110
- Selena!

193
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,991
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

194
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,071
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,996
Open the door!

196
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,873
Open the door!

197
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,789
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

198
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,279
What?

199
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,638
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

200
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,915
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

201
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,715
Go in. Go in!

202
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,355
So, I'm Frank, anyway.

203
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,158
Jim.

204
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,918
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

205
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,195
This is my daughter Hannah.

206
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,430
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

207
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,791
Come on.

208
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,397
So...

209
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,311
This is great. Just great.

210
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,755
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.

211
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,752
Why don't you all sit down and...

212
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,673
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

213
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,149
We've got Mum's creme de menthe.

214
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,834
Great. Creme de menthe.

215
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,514
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

216
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,955
Get comfortable.

217
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,558
- Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.

218
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,393
Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.

219
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,869
Top cupboard.

220
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,554
So this is your place?

221
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,432
It's nice.

222
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,149
There.

223
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,198
I know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

224
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,952
Cheers.

225
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,591
You OK in there, Jim?

226
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,750
Yeah.

227
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:43,198
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

228
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,950
You'll have to use the bucket.

229
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,754
Have to empty it each morning.

230
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,355
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

231
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,078
It's fine.

232
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,152
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

233
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,035
We have a spare room.

234
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,268
In there.

235
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,237
Are you and Selena...?

236
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,192
No. No, no, no.

237
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,872
Um...

238
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,235
I'll take the living room. It's fine.

239
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,117
Right.

240
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,951
No, I mean, yeah.

241
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,871
So, um...

242
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,758
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

243
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,279
Very spruce.

244
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,279
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

245
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,989
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

246
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,799
Probably need us more than we need them.

247
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,350
I think they're good people.

248
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,913
- Good people?
- Yeah.

249
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,111
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

250
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,795
- Because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.

251
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,711
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

252
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,992
I wouldn't.

253
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,470
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

254
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,869
I'm gonna get some sleep.

255
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,077
Selena...

256
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,997
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.

257
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,634
And I know I'd be dead already
if I hadn't met you.

258
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,633
Sure.

259
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,233
No, look...

260
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,511
I mean, thank you.

261
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,630
And I mean, sure.

262
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,393
Goodnight, Jim.

263
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,471
Goodnight.

264
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,511
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

265
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,559
I thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

266
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,712
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

267
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,518
You drink it,

268
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,318
it evaporates,

269
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,391
turns stagnant.

270
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,671
They're all empty.

271
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,431
Hasn't rained in ten days.

272
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,593
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

273
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,275
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.

274
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,551
You'd never think it.

275
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,273
Needing rain so badly.

276
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,189
Not in fucking England!

277
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,672
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

278
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,835
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

279
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,311
Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.

280
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,278
if you can hear this, you're not alone.

281
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,672
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.

282
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,876
We are soldiers and we are armed.

283
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,111
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

284
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,591
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,

285
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,956
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

286
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,794
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now it just repeats.

287
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,155
- It's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

288
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,038
But this is where it's telling us to go.

289
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,190
Just there.

290
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,236
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

291
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,958
"We"?

292
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,716
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.

293
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,837
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's OK. It's the truth.

294
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,309
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

295
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,188
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it.

296
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,918
But with other people...

297
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,118
If it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

298
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,556
- It's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to Infection...

299
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,758
There is no answer!
It's already done all the damage it can!

300
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,559
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

301
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,553
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

302
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,755
Or die here.

303
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,312
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

304
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,557
We need each other.

305
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,714
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

306
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,391
So we have to try and get there.

307
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,993
Get there how?

308
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,555
Just so you know,
I don't take cheques or credit cards.

309
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,838
- What do you think?
- It's the most direct route.

310
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,948
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

311
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,270
Let's just get it done.

312
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,750
No, no.

313
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,229
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

314
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,311
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.

315
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,598
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

316
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,478
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

317
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,710
Hold on!

318
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,317
Dad!

319
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,439
Fuck!

320
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,989
The world's worst place to get a flat.

321
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,277
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.

322
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,750
I've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

323
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,150
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

324
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,231
Hear what?

325
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,075
Right, I've done it.

326
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,999
Dad?

327
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,678
- Jesus Christ!
-

328
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,239
Fucking rats!

329
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,828
They're running from the Infected.

330
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,751
Move it!

331
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,958
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

332
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,157
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

333
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,837
Lift, lift!

334
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,275
- Don't look at them! Don't look!
- I can see them! They're coming!

335
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,228
Come on, Hannah!

336
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,629
Almost.

337
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,518
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.

338
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,680
Three, two, one,

339
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,398
drop it!

340
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,715
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

341
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,995
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

342
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,791
Whoo!

343
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,391
Goodbye, you fuckers!

344
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,235
Frank, stop the cab.

345
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,475
Let's shop.

346
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,113
You...

347
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,313
You...

348
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,155
You...

349
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,708
Anybody seen any buns?

350
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,473
Hmm. Irradiated.

351
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,516
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

352
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,352
I think you can eat that raw.

353
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,237
Decaffeinated coffee...

354
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,311
Put that back.

355
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,630
Can't just take any crap.

356
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,032
If I never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

357
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,000
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

358
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,030
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

359
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,837
Warm but not aggressive.

360
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,276
- Peaty aftertaste.

361
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,917
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

362
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,518
Either we do this now or we're walking.

363
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,231
Not you.

364
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,635
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

365
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,711
You heard.

366
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,191
Where are you going?

367
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,549
We've got enough food, Jim.

368
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,870
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

369
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,160
Like going on holidays
with your aunt!

370
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,115
Oh, Jesus.

371
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,359
Hello?

372
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,318
I hate you!

373
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,111
Find anything?

374
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,953
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

375
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,031
OK, we're done here.

376
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,957
OK, Hannah.

377
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,632
Easy. Brake!

378
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,711
Brake, brake!

379
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,231
Out.

380
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,072
Mmmm! Oh my God!

381
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,678
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.

382
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,153
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

383
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,311
What did you say?

384
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,073
The raisins. They're so moist.

385
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,631
Look over here.

386
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,232
Like a family.

387
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,675
Do you think they're infected?

388
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,071
No.

389
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,994
They're doing just fine.

390
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,511
Come on. Let's eat!

391
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,874
Know what I was thinking?

392
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,509
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

393
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,593
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

394
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,275
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

395
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,717
Um.... that's what you were thinking.

396
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,597
No.

397
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,995
I was thinking I was wrong.

398
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,191
About what?

399
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,831
All the death.

400
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,391
All this shit.

401
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,272
It doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

402
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,910
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

403
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,036
Cheeky monkey!

404
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,950
I was wrong when I said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

405
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,829
See, that's what I was thinking.

406
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,912
Was it?

407
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,195
Mm. You stole my thought.

408
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,997
Sorry.

409
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,717
That's OK.

410
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,791
You can keep it.

411
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,714
It's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

412
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,594
I can't sleep.

413
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,194
Me neither.

414
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,555
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

415
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,631
Outside like this.

416
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,789
I think we're safe enough.

417
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,440
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

418
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,509
Yeah, I noticed that.

419
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,033
Hey, Selena...

420
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,111
What? What is it?

421
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,356
How'd you get to sleep?

422
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,269
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

423
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,478
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.

424
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,994
Oh, great. Valium.

425
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,548
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

426
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,189
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

427
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,430
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

428
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,476
Can I, Dad?

429
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,471
I don't think so, sweetheart.

430
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,993
Please?

431
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,431
- No.
- I can't sleep.

432
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,994
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

433
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,874
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

434
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,997
Night-night.

435
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,274
You're a big softie, Frank.

436
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,517
Frank?

437
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,591
Hannah?

438
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,477
Frank?

439
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,871
Hello? Hello!

440
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,074
Hello!

441
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,549
Hello! Hello!

442
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,311
Shh...

443
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,313
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

444
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,951
Thanks, Dad.

445
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,268
Come on, sleepyhead.

446
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,791
Come on, Babe Ruth.

447
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,677
Hurry up.

448
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,716
- Did I miss breakfast?
- You'll sleep through anything.

449
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,590
- Did you have a fry-up?
- We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!

450
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,472
Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,

451
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,518
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

452
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,431
You must find us. Please!

453
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,556
Salvation is here.

454
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,552
The answer to Infection is here.

455
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,271
Must be Manchester.

456
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,631
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

457
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,630
No fire crews to put it out.

458
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,668
42nd blockade.

459
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,990
This is it.

460
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,074
I don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

461
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,152
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No!

462
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,350
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

463
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,591
Nothing.

464
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,511
I can't believe it.

465
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,477
Frank...

466
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,717
Frank!

467
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,432
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

468
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,909
Go fucking where?!

469
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,510
Get out of it.

470
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,871
Get out of it!

471
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,428
Dad, are you all right?

472
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,080
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

473
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,554
Sorry I lost my temper.

474
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,676
Hannah...

475
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,593
I love you very much.

476
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,591
- What?
- Keep away from me.

477
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,910
Stay where you are.

478
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,798
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

479
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,269
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

480
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,352
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

481
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,439
What's wrong? Dad!

482
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,869
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

483
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,474
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

484
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,836
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

485
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,148
Kill him!

486
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,475
Stay away from him!

487
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,989
Keep away from the body!

488
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,437
Dad?

489
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,480
Three survivors. One male, two female.

490
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,757
I repeat, one male, two female.

491
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,308
ETA, 15.

492
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,755
Put the kettle on.

493
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,149
I'm Major Henry West.

494
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,998
- Welcome.
- Jim.

495
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,991
Hello, Jim.

496
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,752
Hello.

497
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:19,596
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

498
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,989
So you can all have a shower.

499
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,277
You look like you need one. Please.

500
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,394
It ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

501
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,476
Run him over!

502
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,753
How is she doing?

503
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,877
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

504
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,829
It's all fucked.

505
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,831
What do you mean?

506
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,116
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

507
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,191
Hey, don't do that.

508
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:24,590
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.

509
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,434
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.

510
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,989
I want her to be OK.

511
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,590
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

512
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,353
It was OK for them and it was OK for us.

513
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,869
Now it's all just fucked.

514
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,759
So you heard our broadcast?

515
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,196
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

516
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:26,150
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

517
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,473
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to Infection.

518
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,711
Yeah.

519
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,112
As I said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

520
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,278
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

521
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,352
The fire drove hundreds of Infected
out of Manchester.

522
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,398
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

523
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,594
But don't worry.

524
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,069
You're quite safe here.

525
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:05,672
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

526
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,148
High perimeter wall which helps.

527
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,313
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

528
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,871
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

529
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,710
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

530
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,109
The belly of the house. The heart.

531
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,228
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

532
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,311
The kitchen.

533
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,436
Here you are. I'll swap you.

534
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,592
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

535
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,559
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

536
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,915
Jones, our resident tin opener.

537
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,878
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

538
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,471
I can't wait.

539
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,830
And lastly, meet Mailer.

540
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,357
Mailer, Jim.

541
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,476
Jim, Mailer.

542
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,194
Got infected two days ago.

543
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,149
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

544
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,591
Keeping him alive?

545
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,399
The idea was to learn something
about Infection.

546
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,671
Have him teach me.

547
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,071
And has he?

548
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,230
In a way.

549
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,436
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

550
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,590
Farm crops,

551
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,240
raise livestock.

552
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,629
He's telling me he's futureless.

553
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,754
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the Infected take to starve to death.

554
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,235
You'll have to wait and see

555
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,470
Hope it's chips, it's chips

556
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,028
We hope it's chips, it's chips

557
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,549
Hat.

558
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,029
So, what have we here?

559
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,991
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

560
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,199
- Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!

561
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,635
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

562
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,792
Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast

563
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,872
but this omelette will do just as well.

564
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,749
- To new friends.
- New friends.

565
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,554
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

566
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,916
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

567
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,797
Get rid of it.

568
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,515
Doris, you twat.

569
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,273
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?

570
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:08,313
I can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

571
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,757
What a fucking disappointment.
I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.

572
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,957
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

573
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,759
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

574
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,719
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

575
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,952
- You don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.

576
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,032
If you look at the whole life of the planet,

577
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,951
we...

578
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,999
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

579
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,075
So if the infection wipes us all out,

580
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,235
that is a return to normality.

581
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,958
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

582
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,157
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

583
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,834
Our spiritual guru.

584
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,914
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

585
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,559
This is what I've seen
in the four weeks since Infection.

586
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,154
People killing people.

587
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:13,597
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before
Infection, the four weeks before that...

588
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,913
As far back as I care to remember,
people killing people.

589
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,470
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

590
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,273
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.

591
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,033
You must eat, Hannah.

592
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,237
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.

593
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,112
He's one of the people you're talking about.

594
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,996
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

595
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,910
Move!

596
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,195
Move! Move! Move!

597
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,711
Enemy in front!

598
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,589
Mick, I fucking got one!

599
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,150
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

600
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,475
Fucking hell! He bounced!

601
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,073
Cease fire!

602
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,355
I ain't never seen that in my life!

603
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,000
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!

604
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,718
- Clear.
- Clear.

605
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,869
Yeah, yeah, clear.

606
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,031
Oh, hello!

607
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,473
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

608
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,676
Cos you got me to protect you now.

609
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:36,474
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

610
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,959
Fuck you!

611
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,110
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

612
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,111
How about right now?

613
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,557
Mitchell!

614
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,392
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

615
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,154
Sergeant Farrell!

616
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,712
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

617
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,110
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

618
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,231
Slow down.

619
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,073
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

620
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,754
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

621
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,988
The rest of you, go with him.

622
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,871
My apologies.

623
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,152
Drink?

624
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,400
Look, we're grateful, OK?

625
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,519
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

626
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,079
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

627
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:54,109
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

628
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,072
I killed... I killed a boy.

629
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,231
A child?

630
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,551
Yes.

631
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,836
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

632
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,037
Survival.

633
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,311
I understand.

634
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,989
I promised them women.

635
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,871
What?

636
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,589
Eight days ago I found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

637
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,236
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

638
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,073
What could I say to him?

639
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:57,154
We fight off the Infected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

640
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,715
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

641
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:07,670
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio
broadcasting and I promised them women.

642
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,115
Because women mean a future.

643
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,791
Selena! Hannah!

644
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,238
- What is it?
- We have to go.

645
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,311
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

646
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,116
Come on!

647
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,077
We get in the car and we go!

648
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,757
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

649
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,957
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

650
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,634
I'm not gonna let you keep them here!

651
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,551
You can't do this!

652
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,235
Right, get him!

653
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,230
I want to give you a chance.

654
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,356
You can be with us.

655
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,115
But I can't let them go.

656
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,988
OK, Jim? OK.

657
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,471
Him too.

658
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,679
Smithers says
"Women and semen don't mix."

659
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,558
And Mr Burns says
"We all know what you think, Smithers."

660
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,438
And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.

661
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,990
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

662
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,312
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!

663
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,551
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

664
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:01,112
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!

665
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,999
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

666
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,312
Just imagine, just think about it.

667
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,515
How could Infection cross the oceans?

668
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,718
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? It can be stopped.

669
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,394
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

670
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,314
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

671
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,597
Think! Actually think about it.

672
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,876
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

673
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,871
They quarantined us.

674
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:44,478
"There is no Infection.
It's just people killing people." He's insane!

675
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,275
Time to go.

676
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,591
Quarantine?

677
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,112
- Please...
- Believe me, I'm not interested.

678
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:38,075
You see, I'm gonna have the black one.
And I'm gonna make her squirm.

679
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,914
Mitchell, I swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

680
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,638
Move.

681
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,517
Come on, move! Get up!

682
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,591
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

683
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,159
Get up!

684
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,390
Move your fucking arse!

685
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,836
Come on then,
you fucking pansies. Do me first.

686
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,309
No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.

687
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,312
- So you're gonna stick me?
- Shoot 'em!

688
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,960
- Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!

689
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,952
Is that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

690
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,871
- I'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

691
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,270
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

692
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,557
I'm gonna enjoy this.

693
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,988
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

694
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:48,073
- You wanna shoot me? I'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

695
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,999
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

696
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,472
- Jones, move it!
- I can see him! I can see him!

697
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,551
Where are you?

698
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,671
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

699
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,469
Oh no. We're fucked.

700
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,033
We're fucked!

701
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,439
Relax.

702
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,830
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

703
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,559
And no shooter.

704
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,914
He's dead.

705
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:08,068
The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.

706
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,596
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

707
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,114
which she certainly has no use for.

708
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,832
You can't do it to Hannah.

709
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,469
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

710
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,551
Yes, sir.

711
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,791
No...

712
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,791
Ladies...

713
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,113
- It's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

714
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,397
- I thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

715
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,038
Selena!

716
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,111
Whoa, whoa, relax!

717
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,673
Selena!

718
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,435
Selena! Selena!

719
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,359
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

720
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:06,709
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

721
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,793
If you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

722
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,595
It's just polite.

723
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,754
Yeah, all right.

724
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,512
All right.

725
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,353
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

726
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,268
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.

727
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,430
Are you trying to kill me?

728
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,676
No, sweetheart.

729
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,194
I'm making you not care. OK?

730
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,590
What you doing?!

731
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,349
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

732
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,589
Move!

733
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,240
Stay here and put the dresses on.

734
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,799
Let's go! Go!

735
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,308
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

736
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,960
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

737
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,231
Davis?

738
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,272
Fuck it!

739
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,917
- What was that?
- Lightning.

740
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,791
I heard something.

741
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,315
It sounded like a Claymore to me.

742
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,108
All right, I'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

743
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,677
Girls,

744
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,274
keep an eye on him, will ya?

745
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,829
Those pills,

746
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,309
I think they're having an effect.

747
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,789
I can feel them. And...

748
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,155
I don't feel sleepy.

749
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,231
But...

750
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,389
They've been a long time.

751
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,993
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

752
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,678
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

753
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,671
Is that the way it works?

754
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,751
Shut up.

755
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,993
I don't think they are coming back.
I think they've been killed.

756
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,548
- I said shut up!
- Hannah...

757
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,071
They're dead.

758
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,469
And you're gonna be next.

759
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,595
- Get up!
- Whoa!

760
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,152
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

761
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,959
Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.

762
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,191
Get him off me!

763
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,555
Get him off me!

764
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,191
It's Jones! It's Jones!

765
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:00,433
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

766
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,311
Don't just stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

767
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,311
You two, in there! Move!

768
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,757
Come on, then!

769
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,673
What the fuck you gonna do now?

770
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,556
Come on up!

771
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,078
Col!

772
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,755
- Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
- Hannah!

773
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,876
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah!

774
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,191
Sorry...

775
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,351
- Sir...
- Shh.

776
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,871
Shh.

777
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,191
Hannah?

778
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,951
Hannah?

779
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,473
Selena?

780
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,358
I haven't got any bullets.
I haven't got any fucking bullets!

781
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,200
Don't fucking leave me!

782
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,152
Come on!

783
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,996
Move!

784
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,594
Move! Move!

785
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:05,756
It's just you and me now, darlin'.
But don't worry, I'll get you out of here.

786
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,118
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place
somewhere. Just you and me.

787
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,430
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?

788
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,549
That was longer than a heartbeat.

789
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,271
Jim?

790
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,630
Listen. Listen. It's not all fucked.

791
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,549
We're gonna be OK. It's not all fucked.

792
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,837
- I've got to explain something.
- Shut up.

793
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,755
It's gonna be OK.

794
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,436
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.

795
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,511
But I thought he was biting you.

796
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,160
I was kissing her. Are you stoned?

797
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,310
- It's a long story.

798
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,436
We have to get out of here. Come on!

799
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,111
Come on! Move!

800
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,910
You killed all my boys.

801
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,592
Wait...

802
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,113
Hannah!

803
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,758
Hannah? Hannah!

804
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,476
Hannah!

805
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,473
Get in.

806
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,398
They're locked.

01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,789
The gates are locked!

808
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,311
Fucking do it!

809
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,029
Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe!

810
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,155
Not the curtains as well.

811
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,480
You looked all right in this, you know.

812
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,073
It's coming!

813
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,150

- Yeah!

814
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:38,437
- I can't hear anything!

815
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,832
Go.

816
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:34,438
Do you think he saw us this time?
