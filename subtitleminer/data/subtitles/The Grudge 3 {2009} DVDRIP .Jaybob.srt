1
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:26,362
Please, don't leave me in here.

2
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:29,506
Jake, I promise I won't be long.

3
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,700
She'll kill me before you get back.

4
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,044
You're very safe here.

5
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:39,342
All right? Nobody's gonna harm you.

6
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,146
We're only locking the door

7
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,814
because we're worried
you might try and leave again.

8
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:47,324
I left because she was in here.

9
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:52,529
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

10
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,064
I promise you, Jake,

11
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:58,935
I would never let
anything bad happen to you.

12
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:05,736
Jake, I'm not trying to punish you,

13
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:09,804
but I have to be sure that you're safe
while I tend to other patients.

14
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,879
You see that camera up there?

15
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,688
Someone will be watching you
the whole time.

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,723
That won't stop her.

17
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:29,664
You have got to get some rest.

18
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:35,904
She killed my whole family.
She's gonna kill me.

19
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,603
- She's gonna kill me.
- Hey, easy.

20
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:41,974
Please. Please don't leave.

21
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,208
I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:47,752
Nobody should have to go through
what you've been through.

23
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:50,248
It doesn't matter.

24
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:55,117
I'm already dead.

25
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:02,193
I'll be back as soon as I can.

26
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:08,332
No. No.

27
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,390
She's here.

28
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,996
No. She's here! Let me out! She's here!

29
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:42,398
Dr. Sullivan, you'd better get down there.

30
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,459
Another nightmare?

31
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,265
Sorry to wake you.

32
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,465
It's that same dream again?

33
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,476
Go back to sleep.

34
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,846
It was left on my desk to shame me.

35
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:25,273
It never stops.

36
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:29,479
"BIZARRE DEATH FOR
AMERICAN TRAGEDY SURVIVOR"

37
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:34,157
We'll move. We can leave Tokyo if you want.

38
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:38,223
It's not just about what happened today.

39
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:41,526
What makes you sure this is part of it?

40
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:46,434
If you follow it from the beginning,
it's all connected,

41
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:49,902
and now it's in Chicago.

42
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:53,836
This happened in Chicago?
Then it has nothing to do with us.

43
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:56,171
Yes, it does.

44
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,050
I can't hide from this anymore.

45
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:02,686
Naoko, you're upset. People are talking.

46
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,748
Let them talk.

47
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:08,485
I told you,
it's not about what happened at the office.

48
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:11,896
Naoko! Naoko!

49
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,396
I understand your feelings,

50
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:19,163
but it's out of your control.

51
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:23,133
People are dying.

52
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:26,575
There's nothing you can do about it.

53
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:33,980
There is. There is!

54
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,611
Wait, hey. What about me?

55
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:43,779
Watch out for the fire alarm.

56
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:47,321
There's a closet wall, too.
Where're your keys?

57
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:06,506
- How many have we done it in?
- A lot.

58
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,987
You do know the only reason I'm dating you

59
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,821
is 'cause you have the keys
to a whole apartment building, right?

60
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:26,356
I don't have the keys to anything.
My brother does.

61
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,228
You know the only reason I'm dating you

62
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,564
is 'cause I need a fashion model
for my designs.

63
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,833
You know I'm cool with that.
You can dress me up.

64
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,670
I'm really happy we're doing this together.

65
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:42,736
Yeah. New York's gonna be awesome.
They have no idea what's about to hit them.

66
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:46,306
- Wait till you see what's about to hit you.
- Nice.

67
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:50,480
What?

68
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:58,356
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

69
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:00,328
What apartment is this?

70
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:03,864
Fuck, this is where that family...

71
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:12,066
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

72
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:30,684
- Rose, why so many dolls?
- It's a going away party.

73
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:32,627
- For who?
- Lisa.

74
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:37,631
Rose?

75
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:42,998
- Is it time for your medicine?
- No, I'm okay.

76
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:49,811
I'm letting Lisa take two of my dolls
with her on the trip.

77
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,509
- Are you?
- They wanna see the world.

78
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:56,384
And what about you, Rose?
Do you want to see the world?

79
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,888
I'm gonna when Lisa gets famous.

80
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:07,526
Hey. Hey, just put it out of your mind, Lis.

81
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:10,726
Okay? Forget about it.
We're out of here soon enough.

82
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,428
Yeah, but I knew them.

83
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:17,338
I know you did, but it's the past,
and the past can't hurt you.

84
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:19,535
Okay?

85
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:24,607
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

86
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,350
There she is.

87
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,584
Lisa!

88
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,854
Hi, Rose.

89
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:40,398
- Hey, Gretchen. Where's Max?
- Right behind you.

90
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:43,934
- Thanks for watching her, Gretchen.
- Always a pleasure.

91
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:47,430
Rose is an angel.

92
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:48,868
How's the painting going?

93
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:53,741
Well, the arthritis makes it hard.
I use more ointment than paint these days.

94
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:55,005
- Bye, Rose.
- Bye.

95
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:56,740
- Have a good party.
- I will.

96
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:58,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

97
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:02,719
You're late.
I had to ask Gretchen to look after Rose.

98
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:05,187
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

99
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:07,884
- What?
- Cough them up.

100
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:11,328
We just needed a little privacy.

101
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,659
You're leaving town with the guy.
Can't it wait?

102
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:14,857
Wait, where are you going?

103
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:17,992
Well, now that I've got the keys,
I can do some things that need to get done.

104
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,400
Okay.

105
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,532
Oh, no.

106
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:44,022
- What's with Max today?
- He doesn't like people moving.

107
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:46,393
He doesn't like people moving out.

108
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:51,600
- Do boys like Mr. Potato Head?
- I guess.

109
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,848
Come back in, Rose.

110
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:16,422
I left him a toy.

111
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:18,655
- Who?
- The boy.

112
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:21,197
- What boy?
- I think he's new.

113
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,699
No, there's no new boys here.

114
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,870
- Where are you going?
- Can't leave a toy in the hall, Rose.

115
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,874
- Max'll have a fit.
- It's for the boy.

116
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,078
Where did you put it?

117
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:40,083
A toy'll make him feel better.

118
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:58,099
Well, I guess these belong to you.

119
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:01,934
Yeah. I really wish
I could convince you guys to stay.

120
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,372
- We're gonna miss you around here.
- Well, it's best for Brenda.

121
00:17:04,476 --> 00:17:07,934
She's been having a rough time
since that family died.

122
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,444
A change of scene might help.

123
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,414
Well, if there's ever anything I can do
to help out,

124
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:18,012
a landlord recommendation
or anything at all, you know who to call.

125
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,421
Tell Lisa and Rose we said bye.

126
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:28,791
Mr. Praski, I didn't know you were
coming by. I was just seeing...

127
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,629
Two more tenants off.

128
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,464
Yeah, they were good ones.

129
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,403
- Reporters still hassling you?
- No, sir. I've been keeping them out.

130
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:37,065
Good, good.

131
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:40,042
Max, there's something we gotta talk about.

132
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:43,842
I've been riding the contractors
like you said. I'll push them harder.

133
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:47,475
I've been thinking. Maybe it's time
to bring in a management company.

134
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:52,022
Someone to help put things back on track.
It's nothing personal.

135
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:54,591
I've got some prospects lined up.

136
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,819
- And there's a woman coming by.
- Yeah?

137
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:59,863
Yeah, I mean,
she sounds really eager to rent.

138
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,761
Don't let her get away, Max.

139
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:04,357
We got money flowing
in the wrong direction.

140
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,477
"You are charming
and wise beyond your years."

141
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,375
That's a compliment, not a fortune.

142
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:22,919
What's yours say?

143
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:29,258
Tell you what, I'll set up your bed
while you take a bath.

144
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,918
How's that sound?

145
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,167
You used to love taking a bath.

146
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:42,231
Half the water ended up on the floor.

147
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:48,044
I'll get a towel.
God knows where the mover put the box.

148
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:38,856
Brenda!

149
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,862
Brenda!

150
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:18,795
- How do I look?
- Like a crazy guy.

151
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:22,896
Everything changes today, Rose.
I can feel it. Can you feel it?

152
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,634
I don't feel it.

153
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,577
Come on, don't say that.
You have to think positive.

154
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,805
Okay.

155
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:32,746
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

156
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,580
Atta girl. Wish me luck.

157
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,313
Good luck!

158
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,386
- You must be Naoko.
- Naoko.

159
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:50,160
Naoko, sorry. I'm Max.
Glad you made it okay.

160
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:53,032
- I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.
- No.

161
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:56,664
- Good then. Shall we get started?
- Yes.

162
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:57,900
Okay.

163
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,505
There is an elevator right there,

164
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:08,381
but it's old and most tenants
just use the stairs.

165
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,249
More communal.

166
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:15,486
Yeah, sorry about the mess.
We're in a transitional phase,

167
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,928
as you can see. 303 is down here.

168
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:25,568
Now this'll all be fresh paint
before you know it. It should be really nice

169
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,538
before you know it.
Really nice. Sorry about the mess.

170
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:32,974
You know, you're lucky. This is
the first floor to get the makeover treatment.

171
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:36,535
The owner's sinking a lot into restoration.
Every detail.

172
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:38,081
Here we are.

173
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,480
Okay.

174
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:50,951
Now, as you can see, sizeable living room,

175
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:52,654
bright open plan.

176
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:58,361
In here, we've got the dining room,
kitchen, and even a little sun room there.

177
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:04,264
- Do you live here, as well?
- Me and the girls. Two sisters.

178
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:07,837
So I'll be right downstairs
if you need anything.

179
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:13,116
- How many others in the building?
- It's a quiet building.

180
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:16,278
There's hardly a peep out of anyone.

181
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,986
Now, there are three bedrooms,
if you wanna follow me.

182
00:22:33,805 --> 00:22:34,829
Hi.

183
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,509
- May I?
- No, you may not.

184
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,441
You need to learn to share.

185
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:44,913
Guys, this is Naoko, potential neighbor.

186
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:46,779
Just grabbing an application.

187
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:51,253
Welcome, potential neighbor.
I'm Lisa, and this is Rose.

188
00:22:51,723 --> 00:22:53,554
Rose. Like the flower.

189
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:56,854
If you see stuff for Rose sitting outside,
bring it in, okay?

190
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,394
Okay, sorry.

191
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:03,766
- So, where are you moving from?
- I'm from Tokyo.

192
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:06,359
- Here you go.
- You have a lovely family.

193
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:07,665
Thanks.

194
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,287
- I need that?
- No, ma'am.

195
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,886
The doctor just wanted to make sure
I could read the instructions.

196
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:04,393
It's okay.

197
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:07,623
The kids wear these at the hospital
all the time.

198
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:13,059
Can I breathe underwater with that?

199
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:15,834
You need a scuba tank for that.

200
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,033
I could go in a shark cage.

201
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:23,275
You could, but I'd be careful.
Sharks have a taste for little girls.

202
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:29,285
Look, I'm just gonna put this in the closet,
and we're never gonna talk about it again.

203
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,718
Come here.

204
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:35,918
Things'll get better. I promise.

205
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:38,556
Not always.

206
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:42,256
- What do you mean?
- Things don't always get better.

207
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:45,028
Like for those people, the ones that died.

208
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:49,131
That's different. Entirely different.

209
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:55,805
Do you miss them?

210
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:00,947
I miss every tenant that leaves.

211
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,883
We take care of everyone here
in our own way.

212
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,482
You take their money.

213
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:12,429
That's part of our way.

214
00:25:13,297 --> 00:25:15,162
Come here, shark bait.

215
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:30,070
Showed Rose the oxygen thing.
She wanted to go scuba diving.

216
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:34,510
- You tell her it was just a precaution?
- Yeah.

217
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:40,422
- So, New York's a crazy place.
- Well, so is Chicago, right?

218
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:43,319
I just worry, you know.

219
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:44,985
I'm gonna be fine.

220
00:25:45,096 --> 00:25:47,621
Yeah, but aren't there fashion jobs here?

221
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:50,200
It's not about the job. It's the internship.

222
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,269
If I could swing a scholarship from this,

223
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,066
then we can use the rest of my college fund
to pay for Rose's medical bills.

224
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:58,300
- I don't know.
- I'm just trying to help.

225
00:25:58,743 --> 00:26:01,610
Look, if you wanna help,
you could stay here.

226
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:04,272
Okay, put off the internship.

227
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:06,441
Go when things are stable.

228
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:10,048
Max, my being here
isn't gonna change anything.

229
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:12,122
We need you, Lisa.

230
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:14,191
Now is all that matters.

231
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:19,493
Rose is getting worse.
Okay, the building is going to hell.

232
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:21,993
I may lose my job.

233
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:25,593
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,967
Would it have made a difference?

235
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:43,815
Aunt Diane's been floating the offer
for us to move in.

236
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:46,754
- With her five cats?
- It's more like eight.

237
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:52,255
And I know we joke,
but it's now becoming our only option here.

238
00:26:52,363 --> 00:26:54,126
Rose hates it there.

239
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,935
I can't do this alone.

240
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:08,406
If things work out, I could make us stable.

241
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,343
Rose has her check up,

242
00:27:16,454 --> 00:27:19,890
and then I'm taking her to the park
to feed the ducks.

243
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:23,422
You can meet us there later if you like.

244
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:10,593
Hello?

245
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:15,364
Hello.

246
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:20,542
We don't allow reporters in here.

247
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:24,239
I'm not a reporter.
I have permission from the manager.

248
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,509
The manager's my brother.

249
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:29,643
You must be Lisa. I'm Dr. Sullivan.

250
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:32,245
The boy who lived here
was a patient of mine.

251
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:33,482
Jake.

252
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:37,393
- How is he?
- I'm sorry, I thought...

253
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:40,820
Jake passed away.

254
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:43,593
What? How?

255
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:49,030
Actually, we're not quite sure,
to be honest with you.

256
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:57,973
He said a lot of things
about the night that his family died.

257
00:29:58,315 --> 00:30:01,546
So I guess I just wanted
to come and see for myself.

258
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:05,717
Are there any other boys living
in this building?

259
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,119
No, Jake was it.

260
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,617
Why?

261
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:14,191
He talked about a boy, seeing a boy here.

262
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,533
He was terrified of him.

263
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:19,830
My sister saw a boy recently.

264
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:21,427
Here?

265
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:23,933
Maybe I could talk with her?

266
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:28,536
She isn't really a fan of doctors
to tell you the truth.

267
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,808
So, Jake...

268
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:35,943
How long ago?

269
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:37,520
Not long.

270
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:40,988
The service is tomorrow. At Lakemore.

271
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,956
Hey, there you are.

272
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,029
This was the last place I thought you'd be.

273
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,563
Andy.

274
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:50,361
- How you doing?
- Andy.

275
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,230
This is Dr. Sullivan.

276
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:56,071
Hi.

277
00:30:56,907 --> 00:31:00,638
Hey, if you're thinking of renting, this is a...
You know, it's a good place.

278
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:04,339
- Good people.
- She was Jake's doctor, Andy. He died.

279
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,780
Shit.

280
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:10,352
I'm sorry.

281
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:13,522
- I thought you were just here...
- It was nice meeting you.

282
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,251
Nice to meet you.

283
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:22,464
- You ass.
- How was I supposed to know?

284
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,835
Anyway, I thought that kid survived
that whole thing.

285
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,434
- What happened to him?
- She didn't say.

286
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:31,804
- I don't want to think about it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:31:32,443 --> 00:31:34,877
I've got some time before work.

288
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:37,539
- You are unbelievable.
- What?

289
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:40,977
Not on this floor.

290
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:43,649
Then... Then where?

291
00:31:45,356 --> 00:31:48,189
There's an empty on four,
but I'd have to go sneak the keys.

292
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:52,422
Okay, so grab the keys,
and I'll meet you on four.

293
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:56,058
Fine.

294
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,633
Okay.

295
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:16,549
Busted.

296
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,323
Rose, will you go to your room
for me, please?

297
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:29,666
Lisa, we talked about this.
I can't watch Rose and you.

298
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:32,565
- I don't need to be watched.
- Of course not.

299
00:32:32,937 --> 00:32:35,804
Come on, Max, give me a break.

300
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:39,735
I'll give you a break
when you start acting like an adult.

301
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,042
Fine. Whatever.

302
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:45,445
I won't be your problem
much longer anyway.

303
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,451
Is that how you see it?
Or is it that we won't be your problem?

304
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,079
Oh, my God.

305
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,678
You scared the shit out of me.

306
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:29,717
What are you doing up there?

307
00:33:58,655 --> 00:34:01,556
Hey, you coming up or what?

308
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,101
You could have come inside.

309
00:37:32,202 --> 00:37:34,534
I didn't really feel comfortable.

310
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:38,597
Well, I've always found funerals
more for closure than comfort.

311
00:37:39,243 --> 00:37:41,234
Hey, there's something I wanted to ask you.

312
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,279
Yeah, sure, what is it?

313
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:46,913
The boy that Jake talked about.

314
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,379
- Did he ever describe him?
- Why? Did your sister see him again?

315
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:55,617
No. Actually, I think I might have.

316
00:37:57,995 --> 00:38:00,088
Why was he so afraid of him?

317
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:04,625
I never fully understood.

318
00:38:05,102 --> 00:38:07,798
The boy played a role
in the alternate theory Jake created

319
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:10,873
in order to deal with the death of his family.

320
00:38:14,478 --> 00:38:17,242
There's something at my office
that I'd like you to see.

321
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:20,214
It may help answer questions for both of us.

322
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:24,379
And I can drive you back home if you like.

323
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:28,615
- Okay.
- Okay, good. I'm just right here.

324
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,579
And now you can go around there.

325
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,719
There you go.

326
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,919
You shouldn't be up there.

327
00:39:07,698 --> 00:39:10,360
You should be down here
doing your homework.

328
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:42,656
Max.

329
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,626
Rose?

330
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:50,433
Rose? Come here. It's all right.

331
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,968
Hang on.

332
00:39:57,914 --> 00:39:59,313
Hang on, Rose.

333
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:10,952
Hang on. I got you. I got you, babe.
Okay, here we go. Come on.

334
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:18,925
The woman's name is Kayako Saeki,

335
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:22,027
and the father is Takeo,
and the boy is Toshio.

336
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:25,967
That's him. That's the boy.

337
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:31,073
Maybe they knew Jake from somewhere?

338
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,843
Did they say anything?
Did you talk to them?

339
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:37,286
They're dead.

340
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:40,782
Dead?

341
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,217
It happened in Japan.

342
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:45,760
Years ago.

343
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:49,897
Father murdered his wife and son
before hanging himself.

344
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:57,233
Did you know a girl named Allison Fleming
who lived in your building,

345
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,534
the one who went missing?

346
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:01,577
Not really. She was always away at school.

347
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,643
Jake thought she brought
something back with her,

348
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:08,183
something dark that changed her.

349
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:12,049
Allison visited the house
where the Saeki family died.

350
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:17,516
I wanna show you something.

351
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:24,264
This is footage
from my very first session with Jake.

352
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,427
At the time,
his stepmother was the primary suspect.

353
00:41:27,537 --> 00:41:31,268
My job was to evaluate his mental condition.

354
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,203
<i>I'm not making it up.</i>

355
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:36,302
<i>I don't believe you, Jake.</i>

356
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:37,903
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

357
00:41:39,182 --> 00:41:41,878
<i>You see her when no one else is around.</i>

358
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,785
<i>She's real.</i>

359
00:41:44,888 --> 00:41:46,685
<i>Well, I don't see her.</i>

360
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:50,282
<i>- She's real.</i>
<i>- Describe her again.</i>

361
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:59,399
<i>She... She has black hair,</i>
<i>and it hangs over her face.</i>

362
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:08,007
<i>All over, on her body, there's...</i>

363
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,242
<i>There's blood.</i>

364
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:17,184
<i>There's blood all over her body?</i>

365
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:21,181
<i>And it's like she's dead.</i>

366
00:42:24,694 --> 00:42:28,721
I reasoned he'd witnessed
his stepmother kill his sister and father.

367
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:32,532
Unable to cope with what he saw,

368
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:36,538
he invented these gruesome ideations
of a boy and a woman

369
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,038
in order to disassociate himself
from the truth.

370
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,134
But I saw the boy myself.

371
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,638
Yeah, I was wrong.

372
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:50,444
Unimaginably wrong.

373
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:57,656
You never told me how he died.

374
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:03,162
Our surveillance system shows him
reacting to a hallucination.

375
00:43:04,634 --> 00:43:09,128
Only somehow that hallucination
broke nearly every bone in his body.

376
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:27,614
Max?

377
00:43:28,825 --> 00:43:31,487
- Where have you been?
- I was with Andy.

378
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:33,692
Rose was in the hospital.

379
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:35,059
What?

380
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:37,230
Oh, my God.

381
00:43:38,468 --> 00:43:39,662
Why?

382
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:43,964
Doctor said she overexerted herself.

383
00:43:44,107 --> 00:43:46,234
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

384
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,209
She was playing.

385
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:52,043
I told you she's getting worse.

386
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:54,683
Yeah, but I thought the new medicine
was supposed to help...

387
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:56,513
It's not enough.

388
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,680
She may have to start wearing
the oxygen thing.

389
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:05,184
I guess I'll keep you updated
when you're gone.

390
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:08,355
I'll be calling. Every day.

391
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:11,657
It's better than nothing.

392
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:14,937
Why don't you tuck her in?

393
00:44:15,038 --> 00:44:17,336
Make the most of your last day?

394
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,375
Hey, Rose. How you doing?

395
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:34,851
- Don't stop.
- I know.

396
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,722
Until you're asleep.

397
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:50,033
I love you. You know that?

398
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:21,526
Rose? Rose, what's wrong?

399
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:24,031
- What is it, Rose?
- The boy, he's here.

400
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:25,897
- Where?
- In my room.

401
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:34,401
No.

402
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:37,103
No.

403
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:48,090
There's nothing there.

404
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:53,719
You wanna sleep in my room tonight?

405
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:55,657
Okay.

406
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,000
Ben! Ben, open the door!

407
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:21,133
Ben, help me! Open the door, please!

408
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:25,874
Ben! Please, help me! Help me, Ben!

409
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:39,327
Can I go play in the snow
when we get there?

410
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:41,556
Sorry, the snow's all gone.

411
00:49:41,998 --> 00:49:44,933
Let's get you buttoned up, though. Let's go.

412
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:52,464
Hi. Naoko, right?

413
00:49:53,643 --> 00:49:56,077
I was wondering if we could talk.

414
00:49:56,813 --> 00:50:00,579
Yeah, we were just about to go to the park
if you want to come.

415
00:50:00,717 --> 00:50:03,481
- Yes, I would like that.
- Okay.

416
00:50:09,058 --> 00:50:12,027
It's easy sometimes to forget
how sick she is.

417
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:16,194
I understand. On the outside, she is okay,

418
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:20,268
but on the inside, things are getting worse.

419
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:27,500
It may sound strange
but a place can get sick the same way.

420
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:30,502
I don't follow.

421
00:50:32,582 --> 00:50:35,244
I know what happened in your building.

422
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,785
Guess you changed your mind
about moving in?

423
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:40,913
No.

424
00:50:41,024 --> 00:50:44,460
What happened in your building
is the reason I'm here.

425
00:51:22,365 --> 00:51:23,423
Shit.

426
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:30,137
In Japan, there is another place,
sick because of what happened inside.

427
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:32,797
What happened?

428
00:51:33,543 --> 00:51:38,037
A husband killed his wife and only child,
then himself.

429
00:51:39,482 --> 00:51:43,077
An evil started with their deaths
but has spread.

430
00:51:43,886 --> 00:51:48,346
Now it gathers here in your building.

431
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,352
- Can I go play on the swings?
- Yeah, go ahead.

432
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:00,200
Who are you?

433
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:03,872
The woman who was killed,

434
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:07,871
she was my sister, Kayako.

435
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:09,264
Kayako and I had a difficult life.

436
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,807
<i>Our mother was an</i> itako,
<i>someone who can commune with the dead.</i>

437
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:23,448
<i>From the time we were very young,</i>
<i>our mother taught us the old ways.</i>

438
00:53:24,587 --> 00:53:26,987
For me it was frightening.

439
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:31,918
<i>For my sister, it was a nightmare.</i>

440
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:36,623
<i>Those possessed came to my mother</i>
<i>to be healed.</i>

441
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:42,664
<i>My mother took the evil from them</i>
<i>and fed the spirits to Kayako.</i>

442
00:53:44,006 --> 00:53:45,598
<i>It silenced them,</i>

443
00:53:46,275 --> 00:53:48,709
but my sister was changed forever.

444
00:54:08,965 --> 00:54:11,957
Gretchen? Got a spill out here.

445
00:54:18,107 --> 00:54:19,369
Gretchen?

446
00:54:41,364 --> 00:54:42,592
Gretchen?

447
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,437
Gretchen?

448
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:13,224
When my sister was killed, a <i>ju-on</i> was born.

449
00:55:15,097 --> 00:55:17,930
In English, it is something like a curse.

450
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:22,126
- And now you think the curse is here?
- I am sure of it.

451
00:55:22,872 --> 00:55:25,170
Well, then why would you come here?

452
00:55:25,274 --> 00:55:28,072
- To put an end to it.
- How?

453
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:32,805
A simple ceremony in the place
where the curse was reborn.

454
00:55:33,516 --> 00:55:35,040
The boy's home.

455
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:39,317
But I cannot do it alone. I need you.

456
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:43,048
You and Rose.

457
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:48,324
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
for what you've been through. I am.

458
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:50,262
And I believe that you want to help,

459
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:53,699
but this ceremony or whatever,
we can't be a part of it.

460
00:55:53,803 --> 00:55:57,000
If the curse is not stopped,
more people will die.

461
00:55:57,106 --> 00:55:59,438
- You must understand.
- I'm sorry.

462
00:56:03,646 --> 00:56:06,843
Come on, Rose. Time to go. Let's go.

463
00:56:13,356 --> 00:56:16,189
Let's go home now. Get some lunch, yeah?

464
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:19,854
- Max. Hey, we need to talk.
- Get Rose out of here.

465
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:21,930
- Why? What's going on?
- Just do it.

466
00:56:22,031 --> 00:56:23,089
Okay.

467
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:35,877
What happened?

468
00:56:39,749 --> 00:56:40,977
Max.

469
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:44,610
Are you okay?

470
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,050
Look, I think we might
need to get out of here.

471
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:54,086
I talked with Naoko today.

472
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,130
- Wait, you talked to Naoko?
- Yeah.

473
00:56:57,733 --> 00:57:00,099
She thinks we might be in danger.

474
00:57:01,337 --> 00:57:02,736
That's nice.

475
00:57:03,572 --> 00:57:05,403
She doesn't have time
to sign her credit application

476
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,738
but she's got time to tell you
that we're in danger?

477
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:11,438
Are you even listening to me?
I'm saying that I'm worried.

478
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:15,075
What have you got to be worried about?

479
00:57:15,284 --> 00:57:18,811
You're out of here soon.
It's not your problem now, is it?

480
00:57:25,828 --> 00:57:28,126
<i>Miss Saeki is not answering in her room.</i>

481
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,256
<i>We'll leave a message for her</i>
<i>at the front desk.</i>

482
00:57:47,183 --> 00:57:51,051
- This is what you wanted.
- Yeah, I did. I do.

483
00:57:52,188 --> 00:57:54,679
Do you want to tell me what changed?

484
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,891
- Andy...
- You said it yourself, Lisa.

485
00:57:57,993 --> 00:58:01,622
If things work out in New York,
it's only gonna help Rose.

486
00:58:02,164 --> 00:58:04,860
- It's just with...
- What? Gretchen dying?

487
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:06,595
Yeah.

488
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:10,331
- Yeah. She was a nice lady.
- You don't think it's strange?

489
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,104
What? All those people dying?

490
00:58:14,009 --> 00:58:16,409
Yeah, it's a tragedy. But...

491
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:21,541
You can't let it stop you from living.

492
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:24,681
I mean, it's over.

493
00:58:24,787 --> 00:58:27,551
- I'm not so sure that's true.
- Thanks.

494
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:37,798
Look, the thing with that kid,
it's creepy, yeah.

495
00:58:38,868 --> 00:58:41,701
Scary? Okay, maybe.

496
00:58:42,972 --> 00:58:46,772
- But real? No way.
- You don't know that.

497
00:58:48,143 --> 00:58:50,338
You're just seeing connections
you want to see.

498
00:58:50,446 --> 00:58:53,074
It all leads back to those murders in Japan.
It's all connected.

499
00:58:53,182 --> 00:58:56,549
- Lisa, like, please.
- You're not even listening to me.

500
00:58:57,453 --> 00:59:00,616
You know what?
You're just anxious about leaving.

501
00:59:01,323 --> 00:59:03,348
All right? And I get that.

502
00:59:04,393 --> 00:59:07,089
Hey, we're doing this together, though.

503
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:12,731
I'm not going to New York, Andy.

504
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:18,105
I'm sorry, but my family needs me.

505
00:59:21,777 --> 00:59:23,972
- What? Just like that?
- Sorry.

506
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,317
Okay. Okay.

507
00:59:32,955 --> 00:59:36,789
If you're not going, I'm not going.

508
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,094
There's no reason for you to stay.

509
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,401
How could you say that?

510
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:56,270
Lisa, the reason I'm staying is
the same reason why I was going.

511
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,972
You.

512
01:00:51,934 --> 01:00:53,299
Where's Max?

513
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:58,030
- Rose, where is he?
- He said he had to work.

514
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:00,906
He left you here alone?

515
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:04,411
When is he coming back?

516
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:08,277
Have you eaten anything?

517
01:01:08,384 --> 01:01:10,409
I'm gonna make you something to eat.
How does that sound?

518
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:11,611
Okay.

519
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:17,149
- Can you believe this?
- Do you want me to stay here?

520
01:01:17,259 --> 01:01:18,658
I can just call in sick.

521
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:21,229
It's not like they're expecting me to work
on my last day anyway.

522
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,355
No, it's okay. You should go.

523
01:01:23,465 --> 01:01:26,832
I mean, if we're not going to New York,
you might as well keep your job.

524
01:01:26,935 --> 01:01:30,098
Anyway, I'm here.
I'm gonna make her some dinner.

525
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:32,704
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

526
01:01:33,442 --> 01:01:36,741
Okay. I'll give you a call when I'm off work.

527
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,945
I love you.

528
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,388
I love you, too.

529
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:03,929
Bye.

530
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:08,471
See you.

531
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:12,705
Okay.

532
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:28,053
Hey.

533
01:02:34,603 --> 01:02:35,661
Hey.

534
01:02:55,657 --> 01:02:56,715
Fuck.

535
01:03:42,137 --> 01:03:44,435
You don't have to pick that stuff up
by yourself.

536
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,977
I'll get somebody in here to clean it out
when things get back to normal.

537
01:03:53,081 --> 01:03:56,073
I've been over this, trying to make it work,

538
01:03:56,185 --> 01:03:58,278
but I gotta switch things up.

539
01:03:59,721 --> 01:04:02,588
I'm going with
the management company option.

540
01:04:03,492 --> 01:04:05,892
They start the first of the month.

541
01:04:09,198 --> 01:04:10,995
You can stay, of course,

542
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:14,000
but you gotta pay rent like everybody else.

543
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,503
Might be temporary. Who knows?

544
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:20,404
What am I supposed to do now, Mr. Praski?

545
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:25,178
- How am I gonna take care of my family?
- Listen, business is business, kid.

546
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,681
Then fuck business, and fuck you.

547
01:04:28,951 --> 01:04:32,978
Look, you don't gotta like the news, kid,
you just gotta take it.

548
01:04:42,764 --> 01:04:45,062
It didn't have to be like this.

549
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:46,043
Where were you last night?

550
01:06:47,422 --> 01:06:50,448
Manual labor. It's a bitch.

551
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:52,888
You left Rose alone.

552
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:57,757
- She can't be alone ever.
- I know that.

553
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,497
But I don't have Gretchen
to count on anymore, now, do I?

554
01:07:02,604 --> 01:07:06,438
Listen, things are happening
and I think we should leave.

555
01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:09,903
You're always making plans now,
aren't you?

556
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:11,707
I don't understand.

557
01:07:11,947 --> 01:07:14,973
People are dying
and you're acting like nothing is happening.

558
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:19,543
How do you want me to act, Lisa?
Gretchen was old. Old people die.

559
01:07:20,422 --> 01:07:22,652
Is that what you said to Rose?

560
01:07:23,558 --> 01:07:27,619
I have been saddled with Rose
since Mom and Dad died. Not you, me.

561
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,264
She is not your problem!

562
01:07:31,366 --> 01:07:33,266
What is wrong with you?

563
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:36,159
Not a goddamn thing, that's what.

564
01:07:36,538 --> 01:07:38,005
I'm young, healthy.

565
01:07:38,106 --> 01:07:41,507
I got all the time in the world
since I was just fired.

566
01:07:42,377 --> 01:07:44,311
Yeah, what, are you surprised?

567
01:07:44,413 --> 01:07:46,540
Surprised that I couldn't manage
a full-time job

568
01:07:46,648 --> 01:07:48,912
while raising a chronically sick 8-year-old?

569
01:07:49,017 --> 01:07:50,882
You should have said something.

570
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:55,218
Gee, I wish I had. Wait, I did,

571
01:07:55,323 --> 01:07:59,316
but you were too busy fucking Andy all over
the goddamn building to listen to me.

572
01:07:59,428 --> 01:08:02,955
Max, please, can we just all go?
I mean, if we don't have to be here.

573
01:08:03,065 --> 01:08:08,128
We're not going anywhere, sis.
But you, maybe it's time you go.

574
01:08:09,204 --> 01:08:12,469
Max, what are you talking about?
What are you doing?

575
01:08:12,574 --> 01:08:13,973
Max!

576
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:18,177
Stop. Max! What are you doing?

577
01:08:18,814 --> 01:08:23,012
Max! Stop! Let me in! You can't lock me out!

578
01:08:23,118 --> 01:08:27,452
No, Max. You can't lock me out. Stop.

579
01:08:56,518 --> 01:08:59,146
- What's going on?
- Go to your room.

580
01:09:00,388 --> 01:09:04,882
- Where's Lisa?
- Go to your fucking room.

581
01:09:31,586 --> 01:09:34,817
<i>- Cademan Clinic.</i>
- Dr. Sullivan, please?

582
01:09:35,323 --> 01:09:38,759
<i>- She's not available.</i>
- Can I leave a message for her?

583
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:42,428
<i>I'm sorry, but there's been an incident</i>
<i>here at the clinic.</i>

584
01:09:42,531 --> 01:09:45,056
- Excuse me?
<i>- Dr. Sullivan...</i>

585
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:49,027
<i>- Dr. Sullivan has passed away.</i>
- What?

586
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:54,604
<i>Dr. Sullivan is dead.</i>

587
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:35,912
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

588
01:10:46,928 --> 01:10:48,452
We'll leave, then.

589
01:10:48,563 --> 01:10:52,693
We'll leave. I'll go get Max and Rose
and we won't come back.

590
01:10:52,801 --> 01:10:55,998
It's too late. It is a part of you now

591
01:10:57,572 --> 01:10:59,597
and only a matter of time.

592
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,177
Before I die?

593
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,884
And Rose? Max?

594
01:11:13,054 --> 01:11:14,351
Everyone.

595
01:11:19,728 --> 01:11:22,094
Your sister, where is she?

596
01:11:24,065 --> 01:11:25,589
She's with Max.

597
01:11:28,336 --> 01:11:30,736
You said he was angry, aggressive.

598
01:11:32,574 --> 01:11:36,032
He was. I mean, he is.

599
01:11:37,846 --> 01:11:40,041
You cannot leave her with him.

600
01:11:41,116 --> 01:11:43,107
Max would never hurt Rose.

601
01:11:43,585 --> 01:11:47,817
A great fury is at work.
It has hold over your brother.

602
01:11:48,423 --> 01:11:51,187
I don't believe that. He loves her.

603
01:11:52,761 --> 01:11:54,820
Max may not be Max anymore.

604
01:11:57,966 --> 01:12:01,732
I can help Rose but I need her to be with us.

605
01:12:04,506 --> 01:12:06,599
He'll never let that happen.

606
01:12:07,242 --> 01:12:09,938
Then we cannot let that decision be his.

607
01:12:11,713 --> 01:12:12,805
Okay.

608
01:12:20,789 --> 01:12:22,586
All right, wait here.

609
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:42,768
Rose.

610
01:12:47,015 --> 01:12:48,744
Rose. Come on.

611
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:12,131
Come.

612
01:13:27,956 --> 01:13:30,015
Rose. Come.

613
01:13:48,877 --> 01:13:50,538
Okay. Now what?

614
01:13:52,313 --> 01:13:53,541
It's time.

615
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:05,950
No matter what you hear,

616
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:12,767
no matter what you see,

617
01:14:18,139 --> 01:14:20,039
you must not interfere.

618
01:14:33,388 --> 01:14:37,085
It's okay, Rose. It's like a prayer.
I'm right here.

619
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,505
What was that?

620
01:15:52,767 --> 01:15:53,927
The blood of my sister.

621
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:01,169
- What are you doing?
- She needs to drink.

622
01:16:01,776 --> 01:16:03,539
- Drink what?
- Please, it won't hurt.

623
01:16:03,645 --> 01:16:07,638
- You didn't say anything about this.
- We are running out of time.

624
01:16:08,483 --> 01:16:10,610
The curse must be contained.

625
01:16:25,967 --> 01:16:28,265
Please, Rose, you can end it.

626
01:16:28,369 --> 01:16:31,566
- You can make the bad go away.
- Come on, Rose. Let's go.

627
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,534
Come on.

628
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:36,868
Max.

629
01:17:12,814 --> 01:17:14,714
Please, don't do this.

630
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:25,989
You have to understand.
There has been so much death.

631
01:17:33,835 --> 01:17:36,065
Max, no.

632
01:17:37,171 --> 01:17:40,766
Hurting me won't help.
I mean no harm to Rose.

633
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,942
The curse is doing this to you.

634
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:26,903
Leave us alone.

635
01:20:01,883 --> 01:20:03,942
Come on, Rose. What is it?

636
01:20:18,966 --> 01:20:24,131
No, no, no, no, no.

637
01:21:29,837 --> 01:21:30,929
Rose.

638
01:21:35,743 --> 01:21:38,576
Rose? Rose?

639
01:21:39,914 --> 01:21:43,645
Oh, God, Rose, what did you do?
What did you do?

640
01:21:45,686 --> 01:21:47,085
Okay, come on.

641
01:21:52,026 --> 01:21:53,084
Max.

642
01:22:01,602 --> 01:22:02,830
Oh, God.

643
01:22:04,071 --> 01:22:05,538
No, Max.

644
01:22:10,845 --> 01:22:11,903
Max.

645
01:22:27,028 --> 01:22:30,555
Rose needs help, okay?
You have to help her, please.

646
01:22:31,732 --> 01:22:32,790
Max!

647
01:22:35,002 --> 01:22:38,267
Please. Max, please, we need you!

648
01:22:41,943 --> 01:22:43,968
Come on, Rose. Help me out.

649
01:23:01,629 --> 01:23:03,358
Stay with me, Rose.

650
01:23:13,941 --> 01:23:16,808
Rose, stay with me. Please.

651
01:23:24,318 --> 01:23:28,220
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe, Rose.

652
01:23:31,826 --> 01:23:33,555
Are you okay?

653
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:39,928
Okay. Okay. All right.

654
01:23:40,835 --> 01:23:42,359
Are you okay?

655
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:51,971
It's gonna be okay now, all right?
It's gonna be okay.

656
01:24:41,562 --> 01:24:42,529
What the...

657
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:08,645
No. No.

658
01:25:15,362 --> 01:25:18,923
Max? Rose, I have to go.

659
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,761
Here, this is gonna be here
if you need it, all right?

660
01:25:21,869 --> 01:25:25,999
But just rest. You're okay now.
Just rest, all right? I'll be back.

661
01:25:44,191 --> 01:25:45,249
Max?

662
01:26:21,495 --> 01:26:24,658
We're gonna ride together in the ambulance.
Okay?

663
01:26:25,766 --> 01:26:29,429
- I'll be with you the whole time.
- I'm scared.

664
01:26:32,339 --> 01:26:34,307
I'm not gonna leave you.

665
01:26:35,442 --> 01:26:39,606
Everything's gonna be okay.
Nothing can hurt us anymore.

666
01:26:41,515 --> 01:26:42,846
All right?

667
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,947
As long as we stay together,

668
01:26:50,491 --> 01:26:52,721
everything will be all right.

669
01:26:55,029 --> 01:26:58,863
Okay? We just gotta stick together.
