1
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Luis.

2
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, bring that back here!

3
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,300
Hey, Frank!
Frank, over here!

4
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Frank, over here!

5
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
- Looking for this, Frank?
- Very funny.

6
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,800
The dean's waiting for you guys
back in your room.

7
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,700
A pleasure knowing you.

8
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
These two gentlemen are
deputy United States marshals.

9
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,600
They wish to have a word
with you, Mr. Donoghue.

10
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,000
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,600
Let us have the room.

12
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
Close the door behind you.

13
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,400
It's just a precaution
we're taking...

14
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,300
with everyone involved
in the Enrique Cali case.

15
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,800
Especially with your father
since he's presiding in the case.

16
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,100
My father's been a federal judge
since I was five years old.

17
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,100
- What's he saying?
- You saw what happened.

18
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,400
They're talking about Phil's dad.

19
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,100
- He's a judge, right?
- Yeah.

20
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,100
It was on all three networks.

21
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,300
The boys are not allowed
to have TVs in their rooms.

22
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,500
Luis Cali, his son...

23
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,100
is passionately devoted
to his father.

24
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,900
He took over the Palace ofJustice down
there trying to get his father back.

25
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
The judge and two others
were killed.

26
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,900
- Is he in trouble?
- No.

27
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,600
- Something about Colombia.
- Good coffee.

28
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,100
Now, you know why they have to
take these precautions.

29
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Your whole family will be put
in a very safe place.

30
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They're taking him out today.

31
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,900
Where?

32
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,900
We can't tell you that, son, but it
will be a secure military installation.

33
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,600
You gentlemen may as well come in,
help your roommate pack.

34
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,100
- See you soon.
- We look forward to having you back.

35
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,300
- Thanks, sir. You too.
- All right.

36
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
- Billy.
- See you later, Phil. Rock 'n' roll.

37
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
Were you off campus yesterday?

38
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm on probation, sir.
I'm not allowed off campus.

39
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right. I forgot.

40
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,400
You know, somebody spray painted
the sheriff's car yesterday.

41
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,000
- Wrote the word "rejects" all over it.
- No kidding.

42
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,400
All right, you got away
with it this time.

43
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,600
But just remember,
I'm always gonna be watching you.

44
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,900
<i>Lights out, boys.</i>

45
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,900
<i>Eat shit, Mr. Peterson.!</i>

46
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,200
There go the dean
and the headmaster.

47
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't go, man.
This paper's due in the morning.

48
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Come on. They're ready.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

49
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,500
Come on! Let's go.

50
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Billy, this is your homework.

51
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,500
That's good. That's good.
Come on. Let's go.

52
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,600
<i>Take it easy, man.
You're gonna break the window.</i>

53
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,000
<i>Am not.</i>

54
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,800
- Shut up, Snuffy!
- Blow me.

55
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,900
Watch your head, man.

56
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,800
- That's like a spinal injury, man.
- Quiet.

57
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,900
I know you're mad, brother.

58
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Nice hole, Billy.

59
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,500
Speaking of holes, anyone
have a sister? Call her up.

60
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
- I saw Joey's mom at the mall.
- You saw his mom?

61
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,500
With his sisters.

62
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
You guys better
leave my mom out of this.

63
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,200
- I love my mom.
- And you can, too, for 12 bucks.

64
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
As long as you're not talking
about my mother, everybody's cool.

65
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,400
Make yourselves comfortable.
The bar is open.

66
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,800
- Mr. Trotta, why don't you tend the bar?
- Mouthwash?

67
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,400
Yes, mouthwash. Or maybe not.

68
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,600
What's the deal, Billy?
You trying to tell me my breath stinks?

69
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,000
I wasn't saying your breath stinks.
Why do you take everything personally?

70
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,300
I don't think smoking when you
have asthma is such a good idea.

71
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
- Smoking isn't such a good idea, period.
- Gentlemen.

72
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,600
- Here's to Mr. Donoghue.
- Yes, to Phil.

73
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,400
- May he get laid while on the outside.
- Amen.

74
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,300
- This better not be mouthwash.
- Trust me.

75
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,900
"Trust me." Asshole.
This is mouthwash.

76
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
- No, it's not.
- Tastes like mouthwash. What is it?

77
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Four parts 100 proof vodka...

78
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
two parts peppermint schnapps
for that mouthwash flavor...

79
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,900
and one part creme de menthe
to make it green.

80
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,800
You're a sick man.
I hope you know that.

81
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,300
That's the beauty of this concept.
It looks, smells, tastes like mouthwash.

82
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,100
We can keep liquor in plain sight
in our dorm rooms, right?

83
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,000
The best part, I sold 8 bottles
of this stuff for 35 bucks apiece.

84
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,200
We are rich.

85
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,700
You is a genius.
A lunatic, but a genius.

86
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Mix me up another shot.
I'll work on the entertainment.

87
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,100
This stuff is great. It's opening up
my lungs, making me breathe easier.

88
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,800
- It's making you fart easier too.
- I didn't fart.

89
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,800
The first rule
of prep school etiquette:

90
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,100
When you're in a basement
with no windows, don't fart.

91
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,100
No, the first rule is to pretend you're
asleep when your roommate's beating off.

92
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
No, the first rule is to wait...

93
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,600
until your roommate falls asleep
before beating off.

94
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,400
Was that a remark
directed at me, roommate?

95
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,400
- You choke your chicken. It's yours.
- You slap your monkey all the time.

96
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,900
I can't sleep at night.

97
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,000
Speaking of beating off.

98
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,600
I'll do the talking.

99
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,000
<i>This is Jennifer.
What's your name?</i>

100
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,000
Steve.

101
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,900
<i>Well, hello, Steve.</i>

102
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,100
<i>Oh, I like that name.
Tell me what you look like.</i>

103
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Well, I got blond hair...

104
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,700
and I wear an earring
in my left ear.

105
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
About five-nine, 150 pounds.

106
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,100
Did I mention I'm black?

107
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,400
<i>Sounds very sexy, Steve.</i>

108
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,300
<i>Oh, I like long, blond hair
on a black man.</i>

109
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,600
<i>Oh, I also got long, blonde hair.</i>

110
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
<i>I'm not black,
but I'm very, very tanned.</i>

111
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>I'm wearing black lace bra and panties
that look really hot against my skin.</i>

112
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,300
<i>Would you like me
to take my bra off?</i>

113
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,500
Yes.

114
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Yes, please.

115
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
<i>My nipples are dark red.</i>

116
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,300
<i>Oh, very big, very hard.</i>

117
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,800
<i>I'm rubbing my breasts.</i>

118
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,800
<i>Oh, it feels so good.</i>

119
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
<i>Steve, I'm running my hands
down over my body now.</i>

120
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,800
<i>Slipping my thumbs
inside my panties.</i>

121
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Slip 'em in. Slip 'em in.

122
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,600
<i>I'm completely naked except for
black stockings and high heels.</i>

123
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,500
<i>Would you like me to
leave them on or take them off?</i>

124
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,400
Take them off. Now.

125
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,600
On. On. On. Leave them on.

126
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,400
Why don't you go ahead
and leave them on?

127
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,200
<i>Steve, oh, you're so wicked.</i>

128
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,200
<i>I like it.</i>

129
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,400
She likes that.

130
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,500
<i>It's so soft, so big.</i>

131
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
<i>Oh, I just wanna touch it.</i>

132
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
<i>You want me to touch it,
don't you, Steve?</i>

133
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,800
Yes.
By all means, touch it.

134
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,400
- "Oh, Steve. Oh, my God.!"
- Touch it, baby, touch it.

135
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,500
- Outstanding!
- "Oh, Steve."

136
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,800
Hide it. Everybody move.

137
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,800
Mr. Tepper.

138
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,300
Why am I not surprised?

139
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
This is ingenious.

140
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
Thanks.

141
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,200
What's this?

142
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,400
- Mouthwash?
- Oh, come on, Mr. Tepper.

143
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,400
You expect me to believe you crawled
to the basement just to drink mouthwash?

144
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm trying to fight plaque.

145
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,900
Gingivitis. Tartar buildup.
I got a little...

146
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,100
- Are you alone down here?
- Yes, sir.

147
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,700
- Where's your roommate?
- Up in his room, I guess.

148
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,100
- Shit.
- Watch your mouth.

149
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,600
Come on out, Mr. Bradberry.

150
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,200
You too, Mr. Trotta.
May as well come out.

151
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
He was bluffing.

152
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

153
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,000
Mr. Giles and Mr. Montoya,
come out now.

154
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,400
Or I'll place a guard on this basement,
have a bed check of the entire school.

155
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,400
Gentlemen, I want to see
you all in my office...

156
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,200
at 9:00 a.m. Sharp
tomorrow morning.

157
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,000
Go to your rooms now.
Move!

158
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,900
Not you, Billy.

159
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,200
This...

160
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
You know, this is
really, really ingenious.

161
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,400
No, noth...
Just put the little...

162
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,700
- Where'd you get this stuff?
- Radio Shack.

163
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
Really? Was it expensive?

164
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,800
No, no, I picked it up on sale.

165
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
On sale. Good. Here.

166
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
- Break it.
- What?

167
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Throw it on the floor.
Smash it.

168
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,900
Use your foot.

169
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Come on, come on. Use your foot.
Make believe it's my foot. Smash it.

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,400
That's enough.

171
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,000
Let's go.

172
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
This is the U.S. Border Patrol!

173
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,300
You think you're the first kid
to put liquor in mouthwash bottles?

174
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,000
You think you're the first kid
to put liquor in mouthwash bottles?

175
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,000
It was done in my day.

176
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,400
I might have even done it myself.

177
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Mr. Kouf, Mr. Greenwalt.

178
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,700
Mr. Tepper here sold you a bottle
of mouthwash with vodka in it?

179
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,100
You will not be punished if you
give it to me in five seconds.

180
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,800
Good. Good night.

181
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,500
Who's next?

182
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,000
If you're gonna kick me out, do it.
Don't make me look like a narc.

183
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,800
If we expelled you, that'd make
four prep schools in four years.

184
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,800
<i>You trying for the "Guinness"
Book of Records?</i>

185
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
No, sir.

186
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Should we try this one?

187
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,700
How 'bout this one?

188
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,200
This one?

189
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
Yes.

190
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,100
Mr. Burg, Mr. Zarpas.

191
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,800
Billy Tepper sold you
a bottle of vodka.

192
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,700
You have until the count of three
to hand it out here.

193
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,400
One, two...

194
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Good. Good night.

195
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,300
Where to next?

196
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
You made your point.
I can't fake you out.

197
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,600
Fine. I admit it.
Don't put me through this anymore.

198
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm sorry, but I will not have
alcohol in my dormitories.

199
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Then I'll get it.
I'll bring it to you.

200
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,100
- How many more are there?
- Eight.

201
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,800
- You better not lie to me.
- Eight.

202
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,200
I believe you.
I'll be in my apartment.

203
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,600
You have ten minutes.

204
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,900
Do you think
we should expel you?

205
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,600
Do whatever you want. I'm not about
to beg to stay in this school.

206
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,600
If we threw you out, would you live
with your mother or your father?

207
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,900
I don't exactly have a burning desire
to live with either one of them.

208
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,400
Then what's behind this perverse desire
to risk getting thrown out of school?

209
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,400
You think I set out to get caught?

210
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,600
I don't think you do it
purely for fun.

211
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,200
I was having loads of fun
until you came along.

212
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,000
- Should I pack or what?
- Shut up and sit down.

213
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,300
Stop acting like such a tough guy.
It doesn't impress me.

214
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm not going to expel you.

215
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
Three schools have done that...

216
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,500
and it's obviously done nothing
for your character.

217
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,700
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, sir.

218
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm gonna do much worse.

219
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,100
I am going to keep you here
until you graduate.

220
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
It will probably take years
at this rate.

221
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,400
I might wear you out before then.

222
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,400
Don't you worry about
wearing me out.

223
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,600
I'm gonna wear you out.

224
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Well?

225
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,500
He wanted to know why
I have such a bad attitude.

226
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Did he kick you out?

227
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,500
No.

228
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,400
He put me on pots and pans
for the rest of the semester.

229
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,600
Could be worse.

230
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,500
He could have smashed my kneecaps
with a ball-peen hammer.

231
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,900
God, that fucker.
That asshole!

232
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,100
Get up. Get up!
We gotta strike back.

233
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,400
We have to do something
epic tonight...

234
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
or else I'm gonna look like
a douche bag to the entire school.

235
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,000
You were born looking
like a douche bag.

236
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Come on, Joey. Get dressed!

237
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,500
I don't want to, man. I want to
go to sleep, dream aboutJennifer.

238
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,700
Later.

239
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,600
It was fucking humiliating, man.

240
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Okay.

241
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,100
See, they're up for it.

242
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,300
- You know me. I'm always up for it.
- Good.

243
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,000
What am I up for tonight?

244
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.

245
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,600
- Fire hoses.
- That's been done.

246
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,400
Cherry bombs in the toilets.

247
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,500
It's too destructive. That would let
the dean know he got under our skin.

248
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,600
No, it's gotta be
cooler than that.

249
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,800
It's gotta be something witty,
something elegant.

250
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,400
Why don't you think about it
while I take a nap?

251
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,700
I got it. I got it. Come on.

252
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,600
You'll love this.

253
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Come in.

254
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,000
Sir, Dr. Gould would like
to see you right away in the quad.

255
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,600
Check it out.
It's the headmaster's furniture.

256
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,100
Try not to laugh.

257
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm trying.

258
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,100
I mean, just look at this.

259
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,000
The blotter, the pen,
the teacup on my desk.

260
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,300
Everything just
as I left it last night.

261
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,300
You know what
I'd really like to do?

262
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,800
That's to work out here all day.

263
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't suppose that would be
too good for discipline, would it?

264
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,200
- I'm afraid not.
- Yes.

265
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,700
- Any idea who did it?
- Very good idea.

266
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,500
Don't be too hard on them.

267
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,700
It's much better than fire hoses in the
chapel or cherry bombs in the toilet.

268
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,700
- You!
- Yo, Billy!

269
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,200
And you.

270
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,700
And you two.

271
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,100
You gentlemen have the honor
of returning this furniture...

272
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,100
back to its original place.

273
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,500
Pick up that banana.

274
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
Are there any objections?

275
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,600
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

276
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Yeah, sounds cool.

277
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,900
Hey, taste test. Well?

278
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,600
- Hi. Can I help you?
- How you doin'?

279
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,900
We don't want to hurt anybody.
Get in the truck.

280
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,300
Get down!

281
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,800
Stay on the floor where you are
until we tell you to move.

282
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,800
Don't get up.
Don't do anything.

283
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,900
Is that clear?

284
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,000
Stop! No! Don't hurt him!

285
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,600
They're looking for Donoghue.

286
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,000
You can threaten me
as much as you like.

287
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,700
The fact remains that officers from
the United States Marshal's Service...

288
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,000
took young Donoghue
out of school yesterday...

289
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,400
and they did not say
where they were taking him.

290
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,600
I have been under
a lot of strain lately...

291
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,500
and I don't have
a lot of patience.

292
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,500
If you're lying and he's here,
I will find him.

293
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,400
I'll kill you.

294
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
He's not here.

295
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,300
According to this,
you're telling the truth.

296
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,100
If you continue to do that,
you have nothing to fear from me.

297
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,300
These young men
have done nothing to you.

298
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
I realize that.

299
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,300
How could this happen? We pay a fortune
for this kind of information!

300
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,600
We were in transit.
They couldn't get to us.

301
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
But we might not have a problem.

302
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,600
I think you better
take a look at these.

303
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
<i>Anderson, Robert.</i>

304
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,900
- Anderson, Robert!
- Here.

305
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,500
Your father is president
of the Tex-Peet Oil Company.

306
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,900
Yes, sir.

307
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,000
Bradberry, Jonathan.

308
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Your father is Stephen Bradberry?

309
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
Chairman of the First
Empire Bank of New York?

310
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
Yes.

311
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,300
And vice chairman
of the Republican party?

312
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
Yes.

313
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,200
- Giles, Henry the third.
- Yes.

314
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,600
Come here, Giles.

315
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,000
Your father is Representative
Henry Giles Jr.?

316
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,200
Yes.

317
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,600
Chairman of
the Armed Services Committee.

318
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes, sir.

319
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,000
Trotta, Joseph.

320
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,800
Your father is Albert Trotta
of New York City.

321
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,500
Yes.

322
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
The Albert Trotta?

323
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,600
What's the matter?
Not proud of your father.

324
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
No.

325
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,400
- Montoya, Ricardo.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,600
Your father is senior partner
atJohnson, Montoya and Epps?

327
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,800
Yes, sir.

328
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,200
And past president of
the California Bar Association.

329
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,200
Yes, sir.

330
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,400
So tell me, Ricardo.
Are you a Mexican?

331
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,800
Mexican-American.

332
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,300
Do you speak Spanish?

333
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,900
No, not really.

334
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,800
No, wait!

335
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,600
"Wait" what?
You don't speak Spanish.

336
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,200
I'm sorry.
I do speak a little Spanish.

337
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,200
Hey, don't!
Hey, don't do that!

338
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,800
Come on, man.

339
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes, he is.

340
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,100
Tell your friend he's lucky
I didn't shoot him.

341
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,500
What's your name?

342
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,200
- William Tepper.
- William Tepper.

343
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,800
What does your father do,
William?

344
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,700
He's a contractor.

345
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,500
He owns the third largest
construction company in the world.

346
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,400
Yeah, he's a contractor.

347
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,000
You're not afraid?

348
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,800
- Yes, I'm afraid.
- Good.

349
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,700
Don't fuck with me.

350
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,800
You're right, Jack.
We don't need Donoghue.

351
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,300
We can play with this.

352
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,600
I want the slick little bastard
that spray painted my car!

353
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,400
Otherwise...

354
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm gonna arrest any of them damn
rejects that show their face in town!

355
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,100
I don't think so.

356
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,000
- Take a look at this.
- Mouthwash.

357
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,200
No. It's vodka.

358
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,400
- One-hundred proof vodka.
- So?

359
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,900
So you got an uncle that owns
that liquor store down the street.

360
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,600
- Wait just a damn minute.
- You wait just a damn minute, Sheriff.

361
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
We're gonna make ourselves
a little deal here.

362
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,700
You're gonna forget about
who spray painted your car...

363
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,600
- Sheriff!
- Listen, if you think...

364
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,200
Somebody's been shot
out at the Regis School!

365
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,100
Come on, Dean.

366
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
It's Frank Ingram.

367
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,600
- What's going on up at the school?
- We don't know.

368
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,200
We get fired on
if we try to get past the gate.

369
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,700
You two get your shotguns, get in the
back seat of my car, stay out of sight.

370
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,200
You don't want to do that. You want to
call the state police or the FBI.

371
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,800
Don't tell me what to do.

372
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,700
I'll call them myself.

373
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,600
Now hear this up at the school.

374
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,600
<i>This is the King's County sheriff.</i>

375
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,000
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

376
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,500
<i>I'm coming up to talk to you.</i>

377
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,800
<i>I'm alone and unarmed.</i>

378
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,700
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

379
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,600
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

380
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,500
Sheriff, Deputy Assistant
Director Otis Brown.

381
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,700
How you doin'?

382
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Sheriff has agreed to
our assuming jurisdiction.

383
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,800
I've been briefed on the plane.
What's your assessment?

384
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,500
There's an unknown number of terrorists
with.50-caliber machine guns...

385
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,700
and antitank rockets.

386
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,900
There's about three miles
of perimeter around the campus...

387
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,900
and their weapons
can sweep the whole area.

388
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,600
We've got to get assistance
from the military.

389
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,600
I'll try to get it.

390
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,000
- No communication from the school?
- None.

391
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,600
Your father's well?

392
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,800
He's tired of being in prison.
He's ready to go home.

393
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,800
- I'm glad you could get here so quickly.
- My pleasure, Otis.

394
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,200
I have troops in observation positions
around the perimeter of the school...

395
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,100
and an assault force at a staging area
five minutes away.

396
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,900
Now, my orders are to assist you
with observation and surveillance...

397
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,500
and plan a joint assault
with your people.

398
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,900
That's it, Otis.

399
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,300
Anything else would require
specific orders from the president.

400
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I understand.
Let's hope we never need to ask.

401
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,900
Is it armed?

402
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,200
It is now.

403
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Oh, man!

404
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,800
This is disgusting. They expect us
to eat this? This is dog vomit.

405
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,400
The school is taken over by terrorists,
and I'm still on pots and pans.

406
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,400
Stop now.
Please come outside.

407
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,200
<i>Anyone who leaves
this building will be shot.</i>

408
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,400
<i>We will take a head count now
and again in the morning.</i>

409
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,300
If one person is missing...

410
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,000
five of you will be executed.

411
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,100
If two are missing,
ten will be shot.

412
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,700
And so on.

413
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,000
Tomorrow we will begin
a head count every hour...

414
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,400
on the hour.

415
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
If all goes well...

416
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,900
you will be allowed
out into the quad.

417
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,400
But every hour on the hour...

418
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,100
you must be in this room
to be counted.

419
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,000
Is that understood?

420
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,000
Second.

421
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,000
You have seen these orange wires running
throughout this building and outside.

422
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,900
These are wired to explosives.

423
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
If any one of these wires is cut...

424
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,700
the explosives
will go off automatically.

425
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,000
If any of the individual explosives
are tampered with...

426
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,400
they will explode!

427
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,700
So...

428
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,900
don't touch the wires.

429
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,300
Don't touch the explosives.

430
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Ninety-two.

431
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,300
- All right, all right.
- Just do what they say.

432
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,400
- Are you okay? Are you all right?
- What are you doing?

433
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,300
Ow. Man, stop.

434
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,700
Well, we managed
to stay together anyway.

435
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,600
Yeah, that's my ambition in life...
to die with you guys.

436
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,300
You're the kid they call Yogurt,
right? This is your room?

437
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
I'm Derek, and he's Ted,
and yes, this is our room.

438
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,900
Not anymore.

439
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Ah, here we go.

440
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,000
- Put that down!
- I guess some things never change.

441
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,200
You have any sleeping bags,
any blankets?

442
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,500
Do you got any food here,
candy bars?

443
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,800
- Do you have any more magazines?
- No!

444
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,600
- This your plane, Yogurt?
- Yeah, I made it.

445
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,500
You understand all this
remote control stuff?

446
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,000
I do.

447
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,300
The thing the leader's got wrapped
around his wrist... think it'll work?

448
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,500
- Yeah.
- We're well and truly fucked.

449
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
They can't rescue us.
We'd all get killed.

450
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,000
- Then they'll pay the ransom.
- Maybe.

451
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,600
We're gonna do something, right?

452
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,100
We can't just sit by and let
these bastards fuck with our lives.

453
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,700
- Do we have a choice?
- Yes.

454
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
Guys?

455
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,000
Could we change the subject?

456
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,700
I'd like to go to bed
without wetting my pants.

457
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,500
This is FBI Deputy
Assistant Director Otis Brown.

458
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Who am I speaking to?

459
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,900
<i>This is Dr. Robert Gould,
"the head"..."headmaster."</i>

460
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,400
<i>Look, all the boys are here.</i>

461
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,200
<i>They're all alive and in good health.
They're frightened, of course.</i>

462
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,100
- Tell them about the explosives.
- What?

463
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,600
Explosives.

464
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,700
There are explosives
all over the campus.

465
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,800
He says that if the wires are cut,
they'll blow up.

466
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,400
And he has
a remote control device...

467
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,600
attached by tape
to the back of his hand.

468
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,600
He says he can blow the school up
by pressing a button.

469
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,800
It is true.

470
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
And I will not hesitate.

471
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,900
If you attack the school, my men will
begin shooting students until you stop.

472
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,200
<i>But ifby some miracle,
you kill all of my men...</i>

473
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,000
whatever happens, I will still
have time to press the button...

474
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,600
and every one of us will die.

475
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,200
<i>I am releasing the faculty.</i>

476
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,000
<i>One of them will be carrying
a complete list of my demands.</i>

477
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,600
These are nonnegotiable.

478
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,100
If you do not produce
my father unharmed...

479
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,700
I will begin executing
the hostages.

480
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,400
<i>I'm sure by now you have discovered
who these students are...</i>

481
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,800
<i>and who their parents are.</i>

482
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,900
"Rejects."
I assume the students did this.

483
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,400
Yes.

484
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Over half the student body consists of
boys expelled from other prep schools.

485
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,400
- Hence the nickname.
- I see.

486
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,200
No, you don't see.

487
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,100
My boys, many of them have
a real problem with authority.

488
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,000
There's no telling what they might do
in a situation like this.

489
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,800
That could damn well
get 'em killed.

490
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,100
Exactly.

491
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,800
There's one boy in particular.

492
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,000
Here they come.

493
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,100
There's a body.

494
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,800
I think it's Jesse Miller...

495
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,300
the chemistry teacher.

496
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,800
<i>Do you think it's true
about the explosives?</i>

497
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,700
<i>Would he be willing to blow himself up
along with everyone else?</i>

498
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,400
<i>I think he'd be willing to do anything
ifhe doesn't get his father back.</i>

499
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,800
<i>Anything.</i>

500
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,400
Can't sleep, huh?

501
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
Nope.

502
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah, me neither.

503
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
None of us can sleep,
especially with you two yapping.

504
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,400
Billy, we gotta do something.

505
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Yeah, we can be cool
and wait to be rescued.

506
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,200
Anybody know Morse code?

507
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,100
With that light and a mirror,
we could send signals back and forth.

508
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,900
No, Billy!
Nobody knows Morse code.

509
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,800
For Christ's sakes.

510
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,600
Well, we got the perfect number
for poker.

511
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,200
Anybody got a deck of cards?

512
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,000
You can't smoke in the dorms.

513
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,600
What are they gonna do,
kick me out?

514
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,500
Shut up, you guys.

515
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,500
Hey, Joey, shut the door.
Shut the door.

516
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
There's one of them
at the end of the hall.

517
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,400
Yeah?

518
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,800
So we make some noise
and we get him in here.

519
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,000
And then we jump him.

520
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Then what?

521
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,100
Billy, he's got
a fuckin' machine gun.

522
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,900
With a fucking machine gun,
we could shred these fuckers!

523
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,300
This machine gun stuff
must run in Mafia families.

524
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,600
You son of a bitch!

525
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,900
- Come on, man.
- That was a joke, okay?

526
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm your friend.
I can call you a wop if I want to.

527
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,800
Quiet.

528
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,500
- They're crazy.
- Kiss and make up.

529
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,100
I'm sorry.

530
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Just don't call me a wop.

531
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,700
Sure. Is it okay
if I call you an asshole?

532
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,800
Sure. Asshole, dickhead.
Whatever.

533
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Fuck face.

534
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,100
All right, enough of this
machine gun stuff, Joey.

535
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,400
Oh, okay, Mom.

536
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
You think of a better idea.

537
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,000
- You wanna know what we should do?
- No.

538
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,400
We need to find out everything
about these guys who are holding us.

539
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,200
How many there are, what kind of guns
they have, all that stuff.

540
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,800
Then we need to get that information
to the outside world.

541
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,000
Then they can get in
and rescue us.

542
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,400
It's a very cool idea.
Let's do it.

543
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,200
That sounds like a lot of effort
for a group of underachievers.

544
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,000
The difference is, if the dean
catches you, he doesn't kill you.

545
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,200
- Are you with me or not?
- What do you...

546
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,100
Of course we're with you, man.

547
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,400
But if you get us shot,
we're gonna be pissed.

548
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,600
Parents of hostages held at the Regis
School have been arriving all day...

549
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,100
and are being urged by FBI officials
to stay at a local motel.

550
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,900
We'll try and talk with some
of the parents. Excuse me.

551
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,200
Jerry, come on, man.

552
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,100
Bring that back.

553
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:27,200
Now, gentlemen, this object
I'm holding here is called...

554
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,800
Some of you may have seen one
of these before. It's called a book.

555
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,100
You may have seen one
on television.

556
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,100
Fellas, the ball's over here.
Thank you very much.

557
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,400
Don't pay any attention to them.

558
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,400
Sooner or later,
they'll all be gone.

559
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,000
Oh, yes, but this book...

560
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,800
will be important... forever.

561
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,700
Guard.

562
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,000
Gube, heard you brought a breakfast tray
up to the lookouts in West Hall.

563
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,900
- Yeah.
- What room were they in?

564
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,800
- They were in the infirmary.
- How many?

565
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,500
- Two.
- What kind of stuff do they have?

566
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
What do you mean? What stuff?

567
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,800
- Guns, grenades. That kind of stuff.
- They had tons of it.

568
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,900
All kinds. A big machine gun.

569
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,800
Wait a minute. I'm not gonna get
in trouble for this, am I?

570
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,200
- Don't be a wuss.
- Describe the machine gun.

571
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,300
Why don't you send your troops in there
and shoot the sons of bitches?

572
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,700
You are crazy. Just shut up.

573
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,100
Did you realize that the head
of the New Jersey Mafia...

574
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,200
is here in this room?

575
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,200
I see him.

576
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,100
Knowing that...

577
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,100
you let him send his son
to your school?

578
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,000
Of course.

579
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,800
It's not the boy's fault
who his father is.

580
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,700
...the FBI advises parents
to pay the ransom.

581
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,000
Why don't you just
give the guy what he wants?

582
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,800
In the first place,
the FBI has no such policy.

583
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,300
But beyond that,
your sons haven't been kidnapped.

584
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,400
They're being held hostage
by a gang of terrorists.

585
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,000
As we know,
it's United States policy...

586
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,600
not to accede
to terrorist demands.

587
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,400
That policy
is gonna have to change.

588
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,200
We'll go to the White House
if we have to!

589
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,600
My family isn't rich. We don't
have influence at the White House.

590
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
My son is on a full scholarship
to the school.

591
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,100
- So is mine.
- We should talk to the press.

592
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,700
Why should our kids suffer
alongside the rich kids?

593
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,000
Nobody should go to the White House.

594
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,100
Nobody should talk to the press.

595
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,000
I know how much
of a strain this is...

596
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,200
but you could be putting your sons
in even greater danger.

597
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,400
So please,
let the experts handle this.

598
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,100
<i>80, 81, 82...</i>

599
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,800
<i>83, 84, 85...</i>

600
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,700
86, 87...

601
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,200
88, 89...

602
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,700
90, 91, 92.

603
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,100
Back outside now, please.

604
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,900
<i>Beyond saying there is an adequate
number, I'm not prepared to comment.</i>

605
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,300
<i>Are the hostages safe
at this time?</i>

606
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,200
<i>The hostages are obviously
in a very dangerous situation...</i>

607
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,700
<i>and will be so
until they are released.</i>

608
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,900
Everybody's accounted for.

609
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,500
<i>Are negotiations in progress
now with the terrorists?</i>

610
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,300
<i>This administration has never
waivered from the policy...</i>

611
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,700
<i>that the United States must never
give in to the demands of terrorists.</i>

612
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,000
<i>To do so would only
encourage more hostage taking.</i>

613
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, we'll see.

614
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,000
- Hey, man, I'm supposed to...
- We know.

615
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
- Be careful, man.
- You bet.

616
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,400
I'm supposed to take this
to your guys upstairs.

617
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,600
Lunch.

618
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,400
Enjoy.

619
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,300
We got two guards
in the bell tower...

620
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,300
two more in the attic
of Fisher Hall.

621
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,800
There's two in the infirmary
and two more on the roof of West Hall.

622
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,700
That's eight.

623
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,000
Three in the quad makes 11,
and the leader in the office is 12.

624
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,500
His name is Luis Cali.

625
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,500
And the three guys in the quad...
that's Jorge, Ruiz and Carlos.

626
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,400
That's right.
You speak Spanish.

627
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Don't forget the American guy
with the glasses.

628
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,200
- That makes 13.
- This man.

629
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,900
You know Vinny?

630
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:47,400
The FBI's crawling all over me.
I didn't even wanna use a pay phone.

631
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,400
- You seen the news?
- Yeah, of course.

632
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,100
This Enrique Cali...
the old man who's in prison...

633
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,000
We've done business with him.

634
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,400
I know the Bars brothers
are in with him very big.

635
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,100
- So is Dino Frenetti and his boy Micky.
- All right.

636
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,000
I want you to
reach out to them fast.

637
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,700
Tell them to get to the old man
and explain about my son.

638
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,400
All right.
It's done, right away.

639
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,200
The kid hates me.

640
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,800
Albert, hey, hey.

641
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,300
Kids are kids.
They go through a stage.

642
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,600
They're ashamed of us.
Hey, it's just a phase.

643
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,700
No, it's different with Joey.
He really hates me.

644
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,200
But what can I do?

645
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,200
I love him
and I want him out of there.

646
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,600
- It's done. Right away, okay?
- Go ahead.

647
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,000
<i>Billy, we've got enough to do
without you thinking up more ideas.</i>

648
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,800
<i>Excuse me. I'm having
a private conversation with Yogurt.</i>

649
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,700
This is the chip that sends
radio signals to the plane?

650
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,600
Right.

651
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,400
And it's the same kind of chip that
he's got in the garage door opener...

652
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,200
the thing wrapped around his wrist,
the one that controls the explosives?

653
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,200
Well, it should be.
I mean, all chips aren't standardized.

654
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,600
Then if we could somehow
switch these chips...

655
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,600
then we'd control the bombs and he would
control the plane with his wrist deal.

656
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,400
- Right.
- Don't be ridiculous.

657
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,400
First, the guy's got the remote control
tied around his wrist all the time.

658
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,000
- How you gonna get it?
- I think he has a point.

659
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,000
He could be knocked out.

660
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,200
No way you could knock him out without
giving him time to press the button.

661
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,700
- And his men would shoot you if you did.
- Maybe.

662
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,100
Even if you could get it,
why switch the chips?

663
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,400
You can just take the thing
and flush it down the toilet.

664
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,000
We're getting the information out.
I guess we're doing all we can do.

665
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,600
- What do you think of this?
- Is it legible?

666
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,500
Only if you know
how to read.

667
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,000
I told you the searchlight
would be important.

668
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,900
That's great, Joey.
"If you know how to read."

669
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,200
Of course,
the reverse is also true.

670
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,700
What the hell do you mean,
"the reverse is also true"?

671
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,100
What I mean is if you
take the other chip...

672
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,500
the receiving chip
out of the plane...

673
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,800
then you can replace it with the
receiving chip from the detonator.

674
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh, yeah,
that's wonderful.

675
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,100
Now all we have to do is get Cali
out of the headmaster's office...

676
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,400
which he hardly ever leaves,
sneak past the guard...

677
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,300
switch the chips
without setting off the bombs...

678
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
and then get out
without being seen.

679
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,900
That's right.
That's it exactly.

680
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,800
I was attempting to be sarcastic.

681
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,700
You shouldn't have been.
You should have been writing it down.

682
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,200
Stop it, Billy.
You're beginning to scare me.

683
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,300
84, 85, 86, 87, 88...

684
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,200
89, 90, 91, 92.

685
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,400
Take 'em out.

686
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,200
You may go outside now.
I'd like to see the sophomore class...

687
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,700
by the bench, please.

688
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,500
Over here, man. Come on.

689
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,900
You got till exactly 45 minutes
past the hour to get back to the trees.

690
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,600
- That's the big hand on the little nine.
- I'll be there.

691
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,800
- Wait until they look the other way.
- Okay.

692
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,300
- Ready?
- Ready.

693
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,800
- Watch yourself, man.
- Kick the ball!

694
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,600
All right.

695
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,900
Roosevelt represented
a profoundly different view...

696
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,100
of the role
of the federal government.

697
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,000
- Start it up.
- All right. Looks good to me.

698
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,300
All right, pick it up.
Get it ready.

699
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,400
Let her go.

700
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,700
A view that troubled
the government...

701
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,500
in economic life...

702
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,900
You really can fly it,
huh, Derek?

703
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,400
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, dear.

704
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,900
Be on the alert.

705
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,000
Shut it down now.

706
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,800
Man, come on!

707
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,400
Hands on your head!

708
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,300
Great.
Look, I'm from the school.

709
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,700
Here's the information you need
about the people holding us.

710
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,100
Be careful with it.
We're all fine so far.

711
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,900
- Nice outfit. I gotta run.
- You gotta wait for the boss.

712
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,500
I got to get back before
somebody knows I'm gone!

713
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,000
Kid, I'm sorry, but you're not
going anywhere until we check you out.

714
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,200
You have a student
named Tepper?

715
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,500
Yes. Billy Tepper. I've been
waiting for something from him.

716
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,200
- Just keep him there.
- What's he done?

717
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,500
There's a helicopter
on the pad outside.

718
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,800
If he is one of your boys,
go get him and bring him back here.

719
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,000
Roosevelt, by using the radio...

720
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,800
was able to speak
to the American people...

721
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,300
This is coffee.

722
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,400
Even if you are who you say you are, we
cannot let you go back. They'd kill you.

723
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,200
That's my problem. I can make it.
I've gotta go right now.

724
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,200
You gotta get me
out of here, sir.

725
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,000
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

726
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,500
- You know this kid?
- Of course.

727
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,400
They're gonna shoot five kids
if I don't go back.

728
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,800
- They'll shoot you if you do go back.
- I can make it.

729
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:01,400
You know I can't lie to you. You gotta
know I'm telling you the truth.

730
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,600
I believe you.
Let him go.

731
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,000
I cannot accept
that responsibility.

732
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Let him go.

733
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,800
Get him! Stop the kid
before he gets himself killed.

734
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,200
Any second now.

735
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,400
Where the hell is he?

736
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,400
He'll be here.
He'll be here.

737
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,600
Oh, geez!

738
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,000
He's got a minute.

739
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,200
Oh, shit!

740
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,400
Please, God.

741
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,900
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

742
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,900
- What do we do?
- We wait.

743
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,300
Damn! It's already
too late, man.

744
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,000
<i>71, 72, 73...</i>

745
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,000
<i>74, 75, 76, 77...</i>

746
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,900
<i>78, 79, 80, 81...</i>

747
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,800
"82, 83, 84, 85, 86"...

748
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
"82, 83, 84, 85, 86"...

749
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,800
Get back in line!
I already counted you.

750
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,600
87, 88, 89, 90, 91.

751
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,400
- It's still 91.
- Count them again.

752
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,700
Okay.

753
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,800
"One, two, three, four, five"...

754
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,200
<i>86, 87, 88...</i>

755
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,500
89, 90, 91.

756
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,400
We got one boy missing.

757
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,500
I told you what would happen
if one of you escaped.

758
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,700
Did you think I was kidding?

759
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,000
You first.

760
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,800
Let's go.
Face against the wall. Come on.

761
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,200
You too.

762
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,800
You!

763
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,100
You! Get over there!

764
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,000
And you. Run.

765
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,200
Run.

766
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,500
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

767
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,700
I was in the shower.
I didn't hear the bell ring.

768
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,200
He's wet.

769
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,000
- I'm sorry.
- So he is.

770
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
- Come with me. Come with me.
- I'm sorry.

771
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,700
Okay, let's go.
Get back in line. It's all over.

772
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,200
Come on! Go!

773
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,200
Okay, let's go.
Come on. Come on. Go.

774
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,400
My father sent me to a school
that looked a lot like this one.

775
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,600
A military academy
in Pennsylvania.

776
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,200
Perhaps you've heard of it...
the Armitage School?

777
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,100
Yeah, I think so.

778
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,700
You really have no sense
of discipline, do you?

779
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,600
Look, I'm sorry
about the shower thing. I promise...

780
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,600
Oh, shit.

781
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,600
- This is how I learned discipline...
- Oh, shit.

782
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,100
And believe you me...

783
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,900
I learned.

784
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,800
This basement the kid is talking about,
it's not on the plans.

785
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,700
It exists.
I've been in it.

786
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,300
There used to be a building
right here behind where the kitchen is.

787
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,200
That's a subbasement
in that building.

788
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,600
- There's no building above it then.
- That's right.

789
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,600
So if the hostages were
in the basement...

790
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,000
and the buildings blew up,
they'd probably survive.

791
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,300
That building was built in 1881.

792
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,800
They built to last back in those days.
What about the explosives?

793
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:30,600
It's interesting what the kid
says about switching the chips.

794
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,600
- Could it work?
- It's very possible.

795
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,100
I wouldn't wanna take the responsibility
for letting the kid try this...

796
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,600
but it could work.

797
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,000
Take it easy.
It's over.

798
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,100
Washington has authorized me
to make a deal.

799
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,500
What are we giving them?

800
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,100
Whatever it takes
to get the hostages free.

801
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,500
We have a shot
at a successful assault here.

802
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,700
We know the location
of every terrorist.

803
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,300
The kid can get the other students
out of the line of fire.

804
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,300
What kid? This kid has been
kicked out of two schools.

805
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
- No, three schools.
- Three schools.

806
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,100
Come on.
All of this is unreliable.

807
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,800
That's not really true. I may not rely
on Billy getting to class on time...

808
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,500
but I would rely on this.

809
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,200
- Why?
- Because he's got guts. He's a leader.

810
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,600
You can see that
he's thought this thing through.

811
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,800
Now, if Billy says he can do it,
I gotta believe he can.

812
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,400
If everything goes perfect...

813
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,100
could we guarantee no casualties
among the hostages?

814
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,600
Guarantee?
No, of course not.

815
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,600
Then our orders are to cut a deal.

816
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,100
That's unacceptable.

817
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,400
The demands in my letter
must be followed exactly.

818
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,300
I'll have to go back
to my superiors.

819
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,700
- We'll need time to discuss this.
- "I understand."

820
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,100
In recognition of
your willingness to negotiate...

821
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,400
the execution scheduled
for 5:00 p.m. Today will be postponed.

822
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,200
<i>However, if we have not concluded
a deal by 5:00 p.m. Tomorrow...</i>

823
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,100
there will be no further delays.

824
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,400
We won.

825
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:51,000
We just got a message
from Albert Trotta.

826
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,800
Trotta's kid, Joey,
goes to the Regis School.

827
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,900
He, naturally, wants him out.

828
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,700
And he'd be a good guy
to have owe us a favor.

829
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,900
Give me something to write with.

830
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,600
Give this message to my son.

831
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,000
They're receiving another message.

832
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,300
It's the headmaster.

833
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,800
How you feeling?

834
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,100
Okay.

835
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,400
Come to my office,
will you, Mr. Trotta?

836
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,200
- They want to see you.
- Why?

837
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,400
I don't think they mean you any harm.
I'll go with you.

838
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,900
- It's all right.
- Okay.

839
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,000
We're letting you go.

840
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,800
- What?
- You're free to go.

841
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,600
These men will take you
to the main entrance.

842
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,000
All you have to do
is walk down the driveway.

843
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,300
Why me?

844
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,200
Because we respect your father.

845
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,600
Fuck my father...

846
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,800
and fuck you.

847
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,600
I'm not going anywhere
without my friends.

848
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,800
Oh, yes, you are.

849
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,100
Don't fight him!
Just go!

850
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,600
Let go of me!

851
01:12:59,100 --> 01:12:59,200
Okay, okay, all right.

852
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,400
Okay, okay, all right.

853
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,700
I'm going. I'm going.

854
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,300
Let me go!

855
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,100
Let me go!

856
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,700
Oh, you fucker!

857
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,700
- You son of a bitch!
- Okay!

858
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,800
Inside, let's go.

859
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,600
Please wait there.

860
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,500
It is very important
that you explain to them...

861
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,400
that we did not want
to kill this boy.

862
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,600
We were releasing him,
in fact.

863
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,200
But he suddenly attacked my men
and they were forced to shoot him.

864
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,400
I would like to see the headmaster
and the other students, please.

865
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,600
Not possible.

866
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,000
Then release the headmaster
and take me instead.

867
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,800
It is very important
that you tell them...

868
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,900
we did not intend
to kill this boy.

869
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,400
It was an accident.

870
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,100
It wouldn't have happened if you
hadn't come here in the first place.

871
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,500
It wouldn't have happened if the US
government hadn't kidnapped my father!

872
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,200
Now, we will leave as soon
as my father is returned to me.

873
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,600
You tell them that.

874
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:02,400
You tell them that this one was
an accident, but the next one won't be.

875
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,300
They're gonna hunt you down,
you know that, don't you?

876
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,900
They'll eventually find you,
and then they will kill you.

877
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,500
You Americans always say that...

878
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,000
but you never actually do it.

879
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,700
God, I am sorry.

880
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,200
It's a lie...
this stuff about an accident.

881
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,100
- I don't believe it.
- Well, it's what they claim.

882
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,500
How does a kid have an accident
that gets him shot with a machine gun?

883
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,800
I don't know.

884
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,500
These people are grown-ups...

885
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,400
not like my son.

886
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,800
It's time they found out
there's no such thing as an accident.

887
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,800
<i>The president has waived
posse comitatus...</i>

888
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,300
and we have orders to proceed
with the assault as planned.

889
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,000
Our assault teams are to move out
to the helicopters and stand by.

890
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Cut the power to the campus and
jam everything... radio, TV, microwave.

891
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,500
- I want an absolute and total blackout.
- What's going on?

892
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,000
Yesterday your boy Billy Tepper suddenly
appeared on our side of the wire.

893
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,000
How'd he do that?

894
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,700
There's an old storm drain on
the east edge of the campus right there.

895
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,800
It's got bars on it, but the boys
always manage to get through.

896
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,600
- What's happening?
- Could you show our explosives expert...

897
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,500
how to get through that drain?

898
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,400
Of course.
What's happening?

899
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
Enrique Cali
was just murdered in prison.

900
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:58,300
When Luis Cali finds out about his
father's death, he'll kill hostages.

901
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,700
He could very well blow up the school.
We've got no choice. We have to go in.

902
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,600
<i>"We're doing eve"ryt"hing we can,"
but I gotta tell you...</i>

903
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:10,400
<i>the casualties could be high unless
your boy does what he says he can do.</i>

904
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,000
- "He'll try."
- "He better."

905
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,000
- Billy, wake up.
- I'm awake.

906
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,400
That's the signal. They're going
to attack and they want our help.

907
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,800
They're crazy. What do they think
we can do? We'll get everybody killed.

908
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,300
- This was your idea.
- It's too late to back out now.

909
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,200
- No, it isn't.
- They're depending on us.

910
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,400
They'll stop depending on us
when we don't answer them.

911
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:48,800
You asshole!
Give me that!

912
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,000
Get off me!

913
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,200
Maybe it was a mistake
to follow your plan...

914
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,500
but we did
because you wanted us to.

915
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,500
Now it's too late to back out.
We can't back out and neither can you.

916
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,600
I've been a major fuckup my whole life.
I'll get you all killed.

917
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,400
Come on, man.

918
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,000
I'm sorry.
The cuts on your back.

919
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,300
Forget about the cuts. That's the least
of our problems right now.

920
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,400
Your plan is just as good now as it was
yesterday when we thought it was great.

921
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,700
- We were wrong yesterday.
- Stop this, Billy! You got us into it.

922
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,600
- You gotta get us out.
- Say, "Do it forJoey," and I'll puke.

923
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,400
We don't have to tell you why.
You know why.

924
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,500
You're fucking morons.

925
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,600
You know that, don't you?
You're fucking morons.

926
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,600
That's why we hang
with you, Billy.

927
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,900
- We're really gonna do this?
- You bet.

928
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,600
All right, we got a lot of work
to do, especially you.

929
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,500
Me?

930
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,800
Are you there?
What are you trying to do?

931
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,800
You see, there's been a power failure
affecting the whole county.

932
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,800
- They're working on it.
- "I see."

933
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,500
You have exactly
one hour to fix the power.

934
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,700
Then I kill one hostage
every 15 minutes until it's back on.

935
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,500
All right now, just relax.
Try and act natural.

936
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,500
The next guy comes out of the bathroom,
you two go, all right?

937
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,800
When you come out of the storm drain,
stay to the right as you go up the hill.

938
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,200
You'll be under cover until
you get to this point right here.

939
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,200
It would be a lot easier
if I went along with you.

940
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,400
I'm sorry, sir.
We can't let you do that.

941
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,000
We'll be fine with the map.

942
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,800
Hey, you guys all set?

943
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,600
If there's any problem,
just turn off the water.

944
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,000
Come on.

945
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,800
You sure this goes
to the headmaster's office?

946
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,200
How do you think I broke in
to get the headmaster's furniture out?

947
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,500
How do you think I got
the algebra final?

948
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,000
Geez Louise, Yogurt, you'd think we were
going to defuse a bomb or something.

949
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,300
It was a joke, Yogurt.
Lighten up.

950
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,100
Hey, man, are you okay?

951
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,800
Get his medicine!

952
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,700
Come on, quick.
Out of the way.

953
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,400
- All right, now what?
- You see that box?

954
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,200
Yeah.

955
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,100
No, no, no!
That's the detonator.

956
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:46,000
Don't touch that box. The other box...
the blue box with the light on it.

957
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:49,400
That's the remote control receiver.
Take the casing off.

958
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,400
Do any of your men have medical
training? This boy's very sick.

959
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,400
What now?

960
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,400
All right, all right,
very, very carefully...

961
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,000
take the red chip out
of the receiver.

962
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,400
Okay.

963
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,800
- There is no red chip.
- There must be.

964
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,300
Well, I'm sorry, there isn't.

965
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,600
There's a blue chip the same size as
the red chip, but there's no red chip.

966
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,000
That must be it then.

967
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,600
Well, is it or isn't it?

968
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,700
I don't know.

969
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,300
This boy has a history of medical
problems. You can see how sick he is.

970
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,300
You must call an ambulance.

971
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,600
Okay, it should just
slide in now.

972
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,400
Oh, shit!

973
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,500
Watch out.
I'm coming up.

974
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,200
Damn it.
I can't just wait here.

975
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,500
Prepare to engage targets.

976
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,500
Confirm target acquisition.

977
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,600
Targets are up.
Fire.

978
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,100
He's got a history of asthma.

979
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,500
- I'm feeling a little better, sir.
- Good, good.

980
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,000
It's not gonna work.
They jammed the radios.

981
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,400
Okay, Jack.

982
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,200
Shh. Listen.

983
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Do you hear water running?

984
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,200
Yes.

985
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,400
Oh, good. I thought
we were in trouble. Move.

986
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,000
There. Now that
wasn't so hard, was it?

987
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,000
I got him. I got him.
I got him!

988
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,300
Hit him, Yogurt!

989
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,500
Come on, Yogurt.
Hit him!

990
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,900
Forget it.
We're jamming the radios.

991
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,400
Help me get to the headmaster's office...
to the detonator.

992
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,600
Let's go.

993
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,800
Are you supposed to be here?

994
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,700
Yeah, I'm on pots and pans.

995
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,200
"Pozanpans?"
What is "pozanpans?"

996
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:32,700
No, pots and pans.

997
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,200
When they wanna give a kid a terrible
punishment, they give him pots and pans.

998
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:40,400
I have to wash this shit
after every meal.

999
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,000
- Pots and pans.
- Yeah, pots and pans.

1000
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,600
Come on! Let's go!
Everybody in the kitchen!

1001
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:43,800
Everybody in the kitchen!
Move, move!

1002
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,100
Come on, come on!
Move! Move, move, move, move!

1003
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,400
Go.

1004
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,500
Hurry it up! Get in here.

1005
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,600
Get up!

1006
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:03,400
Hold your fire.
He's got a hostage!

1007
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,300
Wait.

1008
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,700
Oh, God.

1009
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,800
I'm sorry.

1010
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,600
Don't.

1011
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,000
What'll happen if he
pulls out the wires?

1012
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,100
The bombs will go off.
Shoot him.

1013
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,800
Are you all right?

1014
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,500
Yeah.

1015
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,200
I'm sorry I was such
an asshole to you.

1016
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:08,000
I mean, now that you saved
my life and everything.

1017
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,900
It's okay.

1018
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,800
- I never took it personally.
- Good.

1019
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:17,400
Hey, congratulations.
You came through.

1020
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,400
You just might graduate
in this lifetime.

1021
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,300
Does that mean
I'm off pots and pans?

1022
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,300
Oh, no. You don't think you're
gonna get off that easy, do you?

1023
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,800
Huh?

1024
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,300
Hey, have you guys
seen Billy?

1025
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,400
Hey, have you seen Billy?

1026
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,900
- Where could he be?
- Hey! Hey! Here's an ambulance.

1027
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,200
Is Billy Tepper in there?

1028
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,300
He's not in there.

1029
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,300
No one's seen Billy?

1030
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:10,500
- Where is he, man?
- Hey! Hey!

1031
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:21,500
