1
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,089
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,685
This train, originating from
New York's Grand Central Station...

3
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,696
is back in service.

4
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,289
Next stop will be
New Canaan, Connecticut.

5
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,268
<i>New Canaan, Connecticut,
next stop. </i>

6
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,017
<i>In issue number 141 ofThe Fantastic Four...</i>

7
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,317
<i>published in November 1973... </i>

8
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,588
<i>Reed Richards has to use
his antimatter weapon on his own son... </i>

9
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,631
<i>who Annihilus has turned into
a human atom bomb. </i>

10
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,326
<i>It was a typical predicament
for the Fantastic Four... </i>

11
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,302
<i>because they weren't
like other superheroes. </i>

12
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,304
<i>They were more like a family... </i>

13
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,341
<i>and the more power they had,
the more harm they could do to each other... </i>

14
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,434
<i>without even knowing it. </i>

15
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,945
<i>That was the meaning
ofThe Fantastic Four...</i>

16
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,983
<i>that a family is like
your own personal antimatter. </i>

17
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,852
<i>Your family is the void you emerge from
and the place you return to when you die. </i>

18
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,191
<i>And that's the paradox... </i>

19
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,193
<i>the closer you're drawn back in... </i>

20
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,422
<i>the deeper into the void you go. </i>

21
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,090
<i>The dilemma that Dostoyevsky... </i>

22
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,091
<i>claims here to have discovered... </i>

23
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:58,289
<i>goes to the very core
of Christianity's relationship... </i>

24
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,161
to the modern world.

25
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,234
But it is a dilemma that...
Yes, Libbets?

26
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:07,739
<i>What Dostoyevsky is saying here
is that to be a Christian is to choose... </i>

27
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,741
because you have to choose
of your own choice.

28
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,006
<i>And since you can't choose to do good
because that'd be too rational... </i>

29
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,206
you have to choose to do bad.

30
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,511
It's existential.

31
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,110
<i>Thank you, Libbets.
That's a very compelling summary. </i>

32
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,452
<i>But, of course,
existentialism, as you said... </i>

33
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,094
Libbets? Hey.

34
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,860
Dostoyevsky.
I'm also really a fan.

35
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,265
<i>And, uh, what you were saying,
you know... </i>

36
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,032
<i>Have you ever read The Idiot? </i>

37
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,039
<i>The Idiot? </i>

38
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,872
<i>If you liked Notes from Underground,
you'll love The Idiot.</i>

39
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,879
Great. Thanks for the tip.

40
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,085
<i>The Idiot. </i>

41
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,184
<i>- I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
- Oh, come on. </i>

42
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,282
She's a poor little rich girl.
Check out the jeans and fur look.

43
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,123
And get a load of this.

44
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,562
Her mom, stepdad and stepsisters are going
to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break...

45
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,566
and they didn't invite her.

46
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,637
- How do you know this shit?
- They did it last year too.

47
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,228
It's, like, traditional or something.

48
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,967
They've got this humongoid place
in New York City...

49
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,203
and she just holes up there
with a wad of cash.

50
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,213
You think Francis is gonna
beat me to the punch here?

51
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,547
Since he sleeps with every girl
you ever show an interest in...

52
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:30,554
why don't you just keep
your Libbets fixation a secret from him?

53
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,023
<i>You already told him.</i>

54
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,425
I hope you changed the water
in that bong from last night.

55
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:46,369
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture
of amaretto and brandy...

56
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,134
blended for just the exact
chemical interaction...

57
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,473
with the last
of our precious Thai stick.

58
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,020
- Waste not, Master Hood! That was 20 for the bag!

59
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,585
I been thinking, Francis.

60
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:14,257
You know, you are one
drug-addled, elitist freak.

61
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,267
<i>And when the revolution comes... </i>

62
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,599
<i>I do not want to be
lined up with you and shot... </i>

63
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,231
because you are fucking ripe
for political reeducation.

64
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,401
<i>- You know? Like in the fields.
- Let me enlighten you about something here.</i>

65
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:30,244
You and I exist on two opposite sides
of a great existential divide...

66
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,749
that being your pathetic virginity
on the one hand...

67
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,117
<i>and my astonishing number
of sexual conquests on the other. </i>

68
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,452
<i>- You are simply jealous.</i>

69
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,822
<i>Hood. Telephone. </i>

70
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,828
And remember, with your erogenous zones
lubricated as such with the mighty herb...

71
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,832
beware out there, because you drone on
like a motherfucker when you're stoned.

72
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,902
Flame on, asshole.

73
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,671
- Hello?
- Paul?

74
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,340
- Oh. Hi, Dad.
- Hey, guy.

75
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,440
How's it going?
Everything all right up there?

76
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,985
- Yeah. Everything's good.
- Well, good.

77
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:12,751
Uh, well, I'm just confirming, uh,
you'll be on the 4:40 on Wednesday, right?

78
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,793
I'm gonna come Thursday.

79
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,022
Well, you can't come on Thursday, Paul,
because Thursday's already Thanksgiving.

80
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,496
<i>But a record which
would only be disclosed... </i>

81
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
<i>Well, that's the whole point
of the holidays, Raul. </i>

82
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,369
So you and your sister
can mope around the house...

83
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,769
and your mother and I
can wait on you hand and foot...

84
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,342
while the two of you
occasionally grunt for more food...

85
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,536
from behind the hair in your faces.

86
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,445
- Believe it or not, we actually, uh, enjoy it.
- Okay, okay, Dad.

87
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,144
<i>- Good. Thanks, guy. Hang on a second.
- First, the investigation
should be thorough. </i>

88
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,221
Wendy, you want to say hi
to your brother?

89
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,347
<i>- And second, that if there were
any military involvement...
- Wendy, come on!</i>

90
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,859
<i>we should get the facts out first. </i>

91
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,361
<i>As I said at my August 29
press conference last... </i>

92
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,093
- Charles.
- Charles, have you been keeping out of my shit?

93
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,466
Have you refrained from entering
the sacred precincts of my room?

94
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,438
I haven't touched your sh... stuff.

95
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,032
- Are you watching this?
- Watching what?

96
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,601
Nixon, doofus. It's incredible.
He should be shot.

97
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,614
Hey. Drop the political
assassination stuff, please.

98
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:15,210
He's a liar. Dean told him on March 21
about Kalmbach and Hunt...

99
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,653
all about the payoffs
to the Watergate burglars.

100
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,351
So you tell me where
the so-called Dean Report is.

101
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,656
- But you can't because it doesn't exist.
- All right. The defense rests.

102
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,093
- You want another?
- No, thank you.

103
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,333
- We should be off.
- Got you.

104
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,964
<i>And the only person knows
that when the March 2 4th tape... </i>

105
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,942
Charles? Charles, calm down.
I wasn't in on it.

106
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,310
It's gonna sink, and the entire country
will fall into anarchy.

107
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,316
- And the Symbionese Liberation Army...
- Dinner's on the counter.

108
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,353
We'll be at the Carvers'.
You know the number.

109
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,287
- Paul, hi!
- Hi.

110
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,381
Hi. Is there, uh,
anything special you want?

111
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,620
Any particular kind of food or snack
or anything we can stock up on?

112
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,526
- Nope.
- No? You're all right?

113
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,099
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah? Okay. All right.

114
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,725
We'll see you next week. I love you.

115
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,736
Um...
Me too.

116
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,897
All right. Bye-bye.

117
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,703
- All right, Wendy. We'll see you later.
- Asleep by 10:00.

118
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,710
I mean it, young lady.

119
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,406
As a matter of fact, uh,
I have a practice...

120
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,482
whenever I'm not too tired at night...

121
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,949
<i>- Of dictating my own recollections of the day.</i>

122
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,920
I think that, perhaps, will be the more
accurate record of history in the end.

123
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,963
The dog jumps up on the barstool,
and he says, "Okay."

124
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,897
<i>It was a benefit
for the A.C.L.U. or something. </i>

125
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,901
Harry Reems himself was there.

126
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,801
<i>The man with the...
from Deep Throat.</i>

127
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,465
- The very one.
- Classic.

128
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,169
<i>Something about
a First Amendment defense fund.
- Ted took me to see it. </i>

129
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,108
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Oh, Ted, how romantic.</i>

130
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,078
<i>- Hmm.</i>

131
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,809
- I have to admit the movie
didn't do much for me.
- That's nice, son.

132
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:56,115
But being in that theater, surrounded by all
those horny, young college boys and perverts...

133
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,520
<i>- I mean, there was something in the air.
- Oh!</i>

134
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,990
- Oh, I'm sorry! Jesus!
- It's okay, sweetie.

135
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,493
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. No problemo, Mikey.

136
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,689
<i>- Don't worry about it.
- It's okay, Mikey. No problem. </i>

137
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,596
<i>Rut the wine down.
Just leave the wine on the table. </i>

138
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,431
<i>- Go ahead on in the kitchen.
- It's fine. It's fine. </i>

139
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,768
<i>- Nice save, Mikey.
- Sandy, help your brother, okay? </i>

140
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,774
<i>It's just... It's nothing. </i>

141
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,312
It's fine. Thanks.

142
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,881
<i>- You need help with that?
- We changed our couples group. </i>

143
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,007
<i>Now we're in some geriatric group. </i>

144
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,678
<i>Though I must admit
there are a couple oflookers. </i>

145
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,655
But you two are still
sticking it out with Dr. Pasmier?

146
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,056
Oh, actually, Ben decided that...
Well, I mean we both decided...

147
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,755
<i>I just... I just don't see
what the appeal is. </i>

148
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,423
I mean, like Ted said,
people go in there...

149
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,058
<i>and they just get themselves
all worked up, and, uh... </i>

150
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,831
<i>That's the point.
Then they go home and make up. </i>

151
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,838
But Elena and l, we don't...

152
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,170
we don't go in for
those sort of histrionics.

153
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,904
<i>About the only big fight
we've had in years... </i>

154
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,344
was about whether or not
to go back into couples therapy.

155
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,179
<i>- It appears you won.</i>

156
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,690
- Oh, please don't.
- It's not a bother.

157
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,029
<i>- I insist.</i>

158
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,831
Don't touch them.

159
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,099
Oh.

160
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,937
<i>- It's really quite all right.</i>

161
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,508
Of course.

162
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,950
<i>And to think,
they met at a key party, of all things. </i>

163
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,026
- A key party?

164
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,062
Oh, you know, it's a California thing.

165
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:48,361
<i>That scuzzy husband ofhers dragged her kicking
and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. </i>

166
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,402
You know, the men put
their car keys in a bowl...

167
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,632
and at the end of the evening,
the women line up and fish them out.

168
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,436
<i>And whoever's they've got,
they go home with. </i>

169
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,343
<i>Anyhow, that's how she met this Rod person,
or whatever his name is. </i>

170
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,109
<i>He's left his wife,
she's packing for California... </i>

171
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,275
and Irwin is devastated.

172
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,786
- It's so ironic.
- Ironic?

173
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,117
<i>Well...
Yes, ironic. </i>

174
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,126
His name's Rod.

175
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,105
No, come on.
He's like a big, infected whitehead.

176
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,106
<i>- I would never.</i>

177
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,176
Shit. It's my parents.

178
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,641
<i>He's so gross. </i>

179
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:41,118
My drumstick was still frozen
when you, you know, cut inside there.

180
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,088
- Probably gonna get whatever that disease...

181
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,158
I knew it. Watch this.

182
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,291
<i>- Dad, stop itl
- Get to sleep, young lady. I mean it.</i>

183
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,297
Fascist.

184
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,671
If I were a fascist, I would have
sent you to one of those Southern
military academies a long time ago.

185
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,210
Now get to bed!

186
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,580
Hey.

187
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,680
Hey, kiddo.

188
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,692
Sleep well, huh?

189
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,694
Good night, Dad.

190
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,530
Ben.

191
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,951
...reduce its cash position...

192
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,021
especially during this period
of inflation.

193
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,604
- Elena? Elena Hood, am I right?
- Yes?

194
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,442
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards.
You came by and checked out the congregation
a couple of times last year.

195
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,416
Oh, yes. It was, um...
I ended up...

196
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,284
Oh, uh, no need to make excuses.
We're not for everyone, I know.

197
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,054
But, um, I did think for a time
that you might be someone who...

198
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,962
Well, what I mean is that you didn't seem to
think what we were trying to do is laughable...

199
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,590
like some of your fellow citizens
around hereabouts.

200
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,896
No. No, l-I didn't think it
laughable at all. I...

201
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,963
Perhaps you find in books
what I try to find in people.

202
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,739
That sounds vaguely like an insult.

203
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,214
Oh. My, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way at all. Um...

204
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,047
Perhaps I meant it simply
as a... a provocation.

205
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,583
<i>She's a total Young Republican. </i>

206
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,490
She said that you licked Dave Brewster's
weenie in the third floor bathroom.

207
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,860
She's lying. I wouldn't touch
Dave Brewster's dick if you paid me.

208
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,991
It's probably crawling with V.D.
from when he stuck it in her.

209
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,366
<i>- Which he did.</i>

210
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,634
<i>Well, Donna said that her brother
and all his stupid friends were talking... </i>

211
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,904
<i>Come onl</i>

212
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,674
<i>Go on out. Come onl</i>

213
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,289
<i>- Aw, manl</i>

214
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,159
<i>Stonerl</i>

215
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,236
<i>- Come on. Let's play ball.
- Get it, get it!</i>

216
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,899
<i>I suppose my reluctance
was the group aspect of it. </i>

217
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,204
I've never been much of a joiner.

218
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,337
Although I still consider myself
a somewhat religious person.

219
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,916
Well, l, of course, flatter myself
that our church is not exactly...

220
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,542
what most people would call
"organized religion."

221
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,747
At times, it's the disorganization
that's liberating.

222
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:15,190
Of course, I've begun to minister much more in
what one might call therapeutic environments...

223
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,194
in small groups and couples...

224
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,196
and, uh, one-on-one.

225
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,890
My daughter.

226
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,247
I haven't been on a bike for years.

227
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,646
When was the last time
you rode a bike?

228
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,948
They say you never forget.

229
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,839
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hey, Sandy.

230
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,409
- Mikey was looking for you.
- Oh, yeah? Okay.

231
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,410
See ya.

232
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,301
Want some gum?

233
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,737
- Devil Dog?
- Chewing.

234
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,702
Did you tell Sandy?

235
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,779
Tell Sandy what?

236
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,979
You didn't tell him either, did you?

237
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:04,578
<i>We were golfing. You know, golfing to me
is something I'm supposed to enjoy. </i>

238
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,885
And I was on
the goddamn golf team in college...

239
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,051
so it's something
one would assume I do well.

240
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,788
I used to do well.

241
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,057
But basically, these days,
golfing for me...

242
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,599
is like hoeing or plowing.

243
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,498
It's like farming.

244
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,971
And George Clair has obviously, in the mere
two years since he's been with the firm...

245
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,840
he has obviously been taking
secret lessons with a golf pro.

246
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,572
And I bet the entirety
of his disposable income...

247
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,583
has been dedicated
to humiliating me on the golf course.

248
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,415
And the guy talks nonstop...

249
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,183
throughout the entirety
of the miserable 18 holes...

250
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,283
- Ben.
- On topics that are the supposed domain
of my department.

251
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,022
- Ben.
- Yeah?

252
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,030
You're boring me.

253
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,567
I have a husband.

254
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,797
I don't particularly feel
the need for another.

255
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,644
You have a point there.
That's a very good point.

256
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,373
We're having an affair. Right.

257
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,472
An explicitly sexual relationship.

258
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,245
Your needs, my needs.
You're absolutely right.

259
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,412
You'd better get dressed.
The boys will be home soon.

260
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,149
Gotcha.

261
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,364
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Wendy.

262
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,936
It's funny. When I was in town,
I saw you on your bike.

263
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,335
- With Mikey?
- Who?

264
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,340
- Nobody.
- Mikey Carver?

265
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,410
Oh, we were just riding around.

266
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,113
Well, you looked very free
when I saw you.

267
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:14,242
As if I were seeing my own memories
of being a girl.

268
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,956
There was something internal about it.

269
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,925
Mom?

270
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,121
- Are you okay?
- Of course, Wendy. I'm sorry.

271
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,199
You must think I'm ripe
to be checked into Silver Meadows.

272
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,031
<i>- You're not a psycho.
- People at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.</i>

273
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,504
I know. They're rich drug addicts
and celebrities.

274
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,744
They need the money at school
for my band uniform.

275
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:45,110
I thought you quit the band.
I never hear you practice anymore.

276
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,344
Yeah, well,
I don't really need to practice.

277
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,684
I just play a few notes anyway,
so I figured I'd just stay in.

278
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,827
Well, um, I'm sure your father and I would
love to hear what you're playing these days.

279
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,328
Maybe after dinner?

280
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:22,683
The Halfords have invited us
again this year.

281
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,755
<i>You want to go? </i>

282
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,053
- Hmm. What do you think?
- Well, it's a neighborhood tradition.

283
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,521
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go to bed.

284
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,088
- So early?
- Mmm. Rough day. Good night.

285
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,259
Is that a new aftershave?

286
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,338
Uh, yeah. Uh, Musk or something.

287
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,929
- You like it?
- Mmm.

288
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,143
- Good night.
- Good night.

289
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,196
<i>- Hey, Mikey?
- Yeah. </i>

290
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,164
- Geometry?
- Sure. Anything but this English.

291
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,229
How come you're so good at math,
but not at English?

292
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,036
I'm not good at math.
Just good at geometry.

293
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,742
It's, like, you know,
when they say "two squared"...

294
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,110
you think it means
"two times two equals four"?

295
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,615
But really, they really mean a square.

296
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:30,176
It's really space.
It's not numbers. It's space.

297
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,519
And it's perfect space,
but only in your head...

298
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,719
'cause you can't draw a perfect square
in the material world.

299
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,355
But in your mind,
you can have perfect space.

300
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,092
You know?

301
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,866
Yeah.

302
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,599
But I just need some help
with my homework.

303
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,445
Hey, guys. I'm back.

304
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,450
You were gone?

305
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,086
Yeah, Mikey. Yup.

306
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,388
I was in Houston working on
some great new ideas about silicon.

307
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,428
<i>Comes from sand. </i>

308
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,191
It's a semiconductor.

309
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,267
So how you guys doin'?
How's school?

310
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,997
Um, I don't know.

311
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,835
Okay, I guess.

312
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,410
Mmm.

313
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,411
All right.

314
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,538
Good trip?

315
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,540
You bet.

316
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,438
- Jim.
- Oh.

317
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,176
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

318
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,516
Hell, we gotta trade this thing in
for a normal bed.

319
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,590
Just be careful.

320
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,925
Okay.

321
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,595
Have you noticed anything
with Mikey lately?

322
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,697
The kid seemed
a little out of it tonight, huh?

323
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:30,104
Tonight? Mikey's been out of it
since he was born.

324
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,614
Guess the kid takes after me, huh?

325
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,762
"Molecules.

326
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,663
"Because of molecules, we are connected
to the outside world from our bodies.

327
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,565

because when you smell a smell...

328
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,570
"it's not really a smell.

329
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,904
"It's part of the object
that has come off of it... molecules.

330
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,172
"So when you smell something bad,
it's like, in a way, you're eating it.

331
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,406
<i>"This is why you should not
really smell things... </i>

332
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,609
<i>"in the same way you don't eat
everything in the world around you... </i>

333
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,415
"because, as a smell,
it gets inside of you.

334
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:21,424
"So the next time you go to the bathroom
after someone else has been there...

335
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,053
<i>remember what kind of molecules
you are, in fact, eating. "</i>

Mrs. Hood. Mrs. Hood.
Did you forget something?

337
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:26,372
- No. What?
- Uh, why don't we just come on in here?

338
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,011
I think maybe you forgot something.

339
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,160
<i>To find yourself
in the Negative Zone... </i>

340
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,994
<i>as the Fantastic Four often do... </i>

341
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,864
<i>means that all everyday assumptions
are inverted. </i>

342
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,665
<i>Even the Invisible Girl herself
becomes visible... </i>

343
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,639
<i>and so she loses
the last semblance ofher power. </i>

344
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,447
<i>It seems to me that everyone exists
partially on a Negative Zone level... </i>

345
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,481
<i>some people more than others. </i>

346

work out the way they should. </i>

348

about the Negative Zone that tempts them... </i>

349
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,685
<i>and they end up going in,

Sandy!
You idiotic little dope!

351
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,437
You could blow yourself fucking sky-high
with this demented crap!

352
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,508
Hey.

353
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,781
Hey.

354
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,121
I'll take this.

355
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,353
You're not gonna tell Dad, are you?

356
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,798
Would it matter?

357
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,196
What's this?

358
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,668
You know, it's the whip.

359
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,332
The one Uncle Frank got me
from Mexico.

360
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,638
It's not packed with explosives, is it?

361
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,513
No.

362
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,548
Play with the whip.

363
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,987
You turned them all down,
didn't you?

364
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,853
Well, I didn't love them.

365
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,427
<i>And isn't it a fact
that you turned them down... </i>

366
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,723
<i>because these men wanted a home? </i>

367
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,321
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hi, Mrs. Carver.

368
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,698
Mikey, have you heard the explosions
coming from the backyard?

369
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,771
<i>Sir, I want children very much. </i>

370
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,807
- I don't know.
- Do you know what your brother's been up to?

371
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,900
<i>- ... was because you thought...
- I don't know.</i>

372
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,378
<i>he had a secret intention
not to want children? </i>

373
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,416
<i>That's not true I want... No, sir. </i>

374
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,543
I want children very much,
and so does Bill.

375
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,394
<i>In the past you would go to a gynecologist... </i>

376
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,761
<i>to find out why
you couldn't have children. </i>

377
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,527
<i>Yeah, I went to a doctor. </i>

378
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,035
<i>- What's the name of the doctor?
- Dr. Morris. </i>

379
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:37,233
Then when that happened, you went
to another doctor and got a prescription.

380
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,309
- Isn't that true?
- No, sir, that is not true.

381
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,675
- Excuse me. Don't you kids have homework?
- Thanksgiving break.

382
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,876
Madam, if you deny that, we have
a witness in the courtroom, another druggist.

383
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,282
Take a look for yourself.
You're under oath.

384
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,049
All right! I did! Is it a crime?

385
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,785
No wonder the police can't find out
how the gang is transporting the stuff.

386
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,293
They're using milk trucks.

387
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,704
<i>They're leaving.
Return the scanner and follow the truck. </i>

388
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,445
Oh. After you.

389
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,449
Well, you can...

390
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:24,009
Hey, Sandy, what were you blowing up out there?
Your mom seemed pretty P.O. 'd.

391
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,682
- All my model planes.
- The ones you built?

392
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,316
Yeah.
They were getting old.

393
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,987
They couldn't fly anyhow.

394
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,758
I'm gonna get a radio-controlled airplane
for Christmas.

395
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:39,963
I'm gonna stuff it full of M-80s and fly it
into Mrs. Burgess's class and blow it up.

396
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,208
Well, I have to go to the bathroom.

397
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,680
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

398
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,852
<i>This place is loaded with electronic bugs. </i>

399
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,586
<i>- It can't be transmitted.
- No, that would tell them that we're here. </i>

400
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,751
What do you want?
What do you want?

401
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,258
Get out of here!

402
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,158
<i>Get outl</i>

403
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,334
Wendy.

404
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,569
A person's body is his temple.

405
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,771
<i>This body is your first
and last possession. </i>

406
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,280
Now, as your own parents
have probably told you...

407
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,011
in adolescence
our bodies tend to betray us...

408
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,749
and that's why in Samoa
and other developing nations...

409
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
adolescents are sent out
into the woods unarmed...

410
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,523
and they don't come back
till they've learned a thing or two.

411
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,427
Do you understand?

412
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,705
I don't ever wanna see you.

413
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,779
Then why'd you come after me?

414
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,595
<i>Elena? Can you give me a hand here? </i>

415
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,062
Oh!

416
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,607
I'm trying to get this turkey
defrosted before tomorrow.

417
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,608
There. Got it?

418
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,610
Can you take this?

419
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,612
Ohh!

420
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,807
- Sorry.

421
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,325
Here.

422
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,794
You all right there?

423
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,799
Oh, sure. I'm...

424
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,068
Um, did you remember
to pick up the cranberry sauce?

425
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,078
Uh, yes. Yes.

426
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,911
Because you like it
on your turkey sandwiches.

427
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,451
I do.

428
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,248
I'm...

429
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,050
Are... Are you...

430
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,647
I... I think l, uh...

431
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,821
- Elena, you know...
- Ben.

432
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,832
- I've been thinking...
- Ben, maybe no talking right now.

433
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,402
If you start talking,
you're going to...

434
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,423
Going to pick up Paul at the station.
You wanna come?

435
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,585
- No.
- What you been up to?

436
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,663
Nothing.

437
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,589
Your trip okay?

438
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,772
So, how's school treating you?

439
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,969
It's good.

440
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,876
- Classes?
- Fine.

441
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,472
- Grades?
- All right.

442
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,645
Anyone special? You know...

443
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,723
Uh-uh.

444
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,758
Well, it's good to see you.

445
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,261
We miss you around the house and all.

446
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,821
But this, uh... this... this St. Peter's,
it's top of the line, eh?

447
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,902
Oh, yeah.

448
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:18,341
You know, Paul, I was thinking,
this may be as good a time as any to...

449
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,545
have a little talk...

450
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,948
about, um...

451
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,617
- Well...
- About...

452
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:36,023
Uh, well, the whole gamut.
Uh, the facts of life, uh...

453
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:41,325
'Cause I tell you, there's things happening
that, uh, you're probably old enough to digest.

454
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,992
"Things."

455
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,601
Well...

456
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,696
things that happen between a...

457
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,372
<i>Well, um... </i>

458
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,606
on the self-abuse front...

459
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,615
And this is important.

460
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,618
Uh, I don't think it's advisable
to do it in the shower.

461
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,620
It wastes water and electricity...

462
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,714
and because we all expect you
to be doing it there in any case.

463
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,953
<i>And, uh, not on, uh... onto the linen. </i>

464
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,029
<i>Well, uh, anyway... </i>

465
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,123
if you're worried about anything at all,
just feel free to ask and, uh...

466
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,202
we'll look it up.

467
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,739
Dad, you know I'm 16.

468
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,038
Well, all the more reason
to be having this little heart-to-heart.

469
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,384
<i>- Uh...
- Hi</i>

470
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,515
Paul, uh, I was wondering, um...

471
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,526
could you do me a favor
and pretend I never said any of that?

472
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,755
- Sure, Dad.
- Thanks.

473
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,898
- Hi!
- Hello.

474
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,968
How are you?

475
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,576
- Hello, Charles.

476
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,646
Greetings, Charles.

477
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:11,015
How are the parental units
functioning these days?

478
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,854
<i>Dad's doing his Up with Reople routine.
Mom really hasn't been saying much. </i>

479
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,418
I don't know.
Dad seems a little weird. You know? Nervous?

480
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,931
Yeah, well, wait till Mom
finally opens her mouth.

481
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,061
Do you think they're headed
for, like, the dustbin of history?

482
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,140
Divorce court?

483
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,544
Well, they dropped out of
their couples' group therapy thing.

484
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,806
Is that good or bad?

485
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,312
May I operate
the telephonic apparatus?

486
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,445
Why don't you use
the one downstairs?

487
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,616
I'm calling an individual, Charles,
in New York...

488
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,524
confirming a social outing
for Friday night.

489
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,790
Can I come?

490
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:57,094
It's a one-on-one kinda date thing.

491
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,601
- With who?
- Her name's Libbets.

492
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,001
Libbets?
What kind of a name is Libbets?

493
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:05,166
- Is that my record?

494
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,175
- Yeah, but...

495
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,246
<i>You have messed with my shit, Charles. </i>

496
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:52,487
Well, it's great
that we can all be together.

497
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,524
<i>And this Thanksgiving
no yelling, no hysteria... </i>

498
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,060
especially with your grandpa
not here...

499
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,494
although we miss him.

500
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,498
So let's do it right.
Wendy, why don't you say grace?

501
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,330
<i>You used to love to say grace.
Remember? </i>

502
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,702
Dear Lord, thank you
for this Thanksgiving holiday...

503
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,580
<i>and for all the material possessions
that we have and enjoy... </i>

504
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,381
and for letting us white people
kill all the Indians and steal their tribal lands...

505
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,888
- And stuff ourselves like pigs...
- Okay. Okay.

506
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,924
even though children in Asia
are being napalmed...

507
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,994
Jesus! Enough! All right!

508
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,522
- Paul, roll?
- Thank you.

509
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,601
- Can I have the gravy?
- Uh-huh.

510
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,138
Thank you.

511
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,080
Thanks.

512
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,082
Are you having one?

513
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,152
In a bit.

514
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,468
You know, I think Elena
might suspect something.

515
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,843
Maybe it's all for the better.
You know?

516
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,778
Yesterday at dinner she...

517
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,940
Well, she didn't say anything.

518
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,812
Has she acted funny to you?

519
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,819
I mean, have you noticed anything?

520
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,549
<i>- Have I noticed anything?
- Mmm.</i>

521
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,557
I'm not married to her, Benjamin, you are.

522
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,719
I think you've probably a better vantage point
from which to observe her.

523
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,662
Yeah, but, uh, I've been
working a lot lately and...

524
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,703
No, that's not it. I...

525
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:52,469
I guess maybe we're just
on the verge of... saying something.

526
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,736
Saying something to each other.

527
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,815
On the verge.

528
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,886
I'll be back.

529
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,283
- Hmm?
- Birth control.

530
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,527
Right. Gotcha.

531
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,569
[Exhales]

532
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,287
Janey?

533
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,509
No one's here.

534
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,948
I mean, we could just watch TV.

535
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,351
Maybe we can mess around.

536
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,650
You know?
Only if you want to.

537
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,860
I don't know.

538
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,653
Why did you, with Sandy?

539
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:29,664
I don't know.

540
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,734
Do you like him?

541
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,070
He worships you.

542
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,140
What's that?

543
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,575
- Oh, wow!
- Wendy.

544
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,482
I won't take my pants off.

545
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,519
I'll touch it,
but that's as far as it goes.

546
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,749
<i>- When Worlds Collide.
- What?</i>

547
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,718
<i>4:30 movie.
When Worlds Collide. </i>

548
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,415
What the hell are you kids
doing down here?

549
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,754
What do you think we're doing, Dad?

550
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,521
What do I think?

551
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,189
I think you're probably...
touching each other.

552
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,995
I think, uh, you're touching
that reckless jerk-off, for God's sake...

553
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,832
<i>and I think he's trying
to get into your slacksl</i>

554
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,771
I think at 14 years of age
you're getting ready to give up your girlhood.

555
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,570
- Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood.
- Don't you direct a single word at me, Mikey.

556
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,577
I don't wanna hear it.

557
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:26,171
<i>I'll be discussing this matter
with your parents very soon. </i>

558
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,046
Young lady.

559
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,881
- Talking to me, Dad?
- Who else would I be talking to?

560
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,955
And take that thing off!

561
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,785
Then forget all the stern dad stuff.

562
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:42,695
I'm not interested in your smart remarks
right now, young lady.

563
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:46,428
<i>Let's go. Right nowl
You and I can discuss it on the walk home. </i>

564
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,726
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it.

565
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,728
I really don't care that much.

566
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,230
I'm just not sure
he's right for you, is all.

567
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,461
- Huh?

568
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,003
It's just, you develop a sense...

569
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,096
when you're older...

570
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,643
if things are gonna work out
or if they won't.

571
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,304
And sometimes it's...

572
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,381
not worth the mess.

573
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,611
Your toes cold?

574
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,428
Come on. I'll carry you.

575
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,559
Hey, should I dress
for the Halfords now, or...

576
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,561
- Give me your...
- It's up to you.

577
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,564
I'd like to go early
and leave pretty soon after that.

578
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,566
I get you loud and clear.

579
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,898
- Hey, you look nice.
- Thanks.

580
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,062
So, where have you two been?

581
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,164
You'll never guess where I found her.

582
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,505
You found her?

583
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,512
In the basement atJaney and Jim's...

584
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,809
with that weirdo Mikey.

585
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,214
Not even a TV on.

586
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,050
And they're on the floor,
and he's got his trousers undone...

587
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,852
though, thank goodness,
she was still dressed.

588
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,621
Well, I really let him have it.

589
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,026
And Wendy came home peacefully.

590
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,031
So, what were you doing
in the Carvers' basement anyway?

591
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:00,694
I was just dropping off a coffee cup.
Jim left it last time he was over.

592
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:03,705
It was on the dash of the car.
You were, you know, reading.

593
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,901
- I just wanted to catch some air.
- Oh, right, right. The mustache coffee cup.

594
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,104
- The one that was sitting on the dash.
- Yeah. That one.

595
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,181
That one.

596
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,233
- See ya!
- Stay out of trouble.

597
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,566
- You'll be on the 10:30 train?
- 11:30.

598
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,108
- Paul.
- Oh, let the guy have some fun.

599
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:42,770
<i>What's the name of this girl
with the fancy New York address? </i>

600
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,272
Libbets. Libbets Casey.

601
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,783
Libbets?
What sort of name is Libbets?

602
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,252
Just get a taxi home from the station tonight.
It's supposed to storm.

603
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,051
Okay. Bye.

604
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,126
Bye.

605
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,455
World's inquiry on Thursday.

606
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,923
And that ends tonight's coverage
of the Watergate affair.

607
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,926
- In other news outside...

608
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,156
A few light snow showers
which quickly turn to light rain...

609
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,257
unless that rain comes down
even harder tonight...

610
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,268
<i>accompanied by
rapidlly decreasing temperatures... </i>

611
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,930
<i>getting down to around freezing
by midnight. </i>

612
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,939
Drivers in particular, beware.

613
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,601
It's gonna get awfully icy
on those roads.

614
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,612
<i>- We have a severe weather warning...
- What's for dessert?</i>

615
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,615
- See for yourself.
- No advice from the experts, eh?

616
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:57,209
<i>Flood warnings for parts of
Southern Connecticut and theJersey shore. </i>

617
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,686
<i>- Let's go to our weather map now...</i>

618
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,689
<i>for the grim details. </i>

619
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,454
<i>A line of showers now located across
central New Jersey is sweeping our way... </i>

620
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,360
<i>and is expected to arrive
in our area within the hour. </i>

621
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,637
Look, uh...

622
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,707
Don't start.

623
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,908
- Do you... Do you... Do you think I...
- I have no idea.

624
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,745
Well, what's on your mind?
I mean, you...

625
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,514
It wouldn't make for a pleasant evening,
if that's what you're after.

626
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,589
I don't want to talk about it.

627
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,590
Stupid mustache cup.

628
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,186
- What do you mean?
- Don't be dim.

629
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,932
I know you think I'm so dense.
You think I'm so dense...

630
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:47,264
that now you want to be seen with your
dense wife at the cocktail party.

631
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,533
<i>And you want me to shake hands with
your friends and make conversation... </i>

632
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,201
<i>and you're not going to accord me
the respect of talking honestly about this. </i>

633
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,177
You don't really know
what this feels like.

634
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,775
I didn't...

635
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,388
Technically,
it's not what you're thinking, Elena.

636
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,256
Please have the decency to at least
not tell me what I'm thinking.

637
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,475
Oh, Ben! Elena!
Wonderful.

638
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,748
- Wonderful. Come in.
- Thank you. Great to see ya.

639
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:16,622
- Ooh, I just got lipstick...
- That's all right.

640
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,025
- Good to see you too.
- Ah.

641
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:21,619
Would you care to play?

642
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:24,256
<i>New this year. </i>

643
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,927
It's strictly volunteer, of course.

644
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,540
You can put your coats
in the library if you like.

645
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:37,542
Oh, damn.
Um, I've left the, um...

646
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:38,978
- Oh, you've...
- In the car.

647
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,947
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah. </i>

648
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,847
Oh. Right.

649
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,649
<i>We'll, um... We'll be right back. </i>

650
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,849
Okay.

651
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,756
Oh, Rob.
The, uh, stuffed tomatoes.

652
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,538
This just isn't
the best moment for this.

653
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,809
- I know. I know.

654
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,649
- I had no idea.
- That this was going to be a key party?

655
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:23,624
Yeah. Well, if we'd understood, uh,
we could've invented some sort of excuse.

656
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,160
A key party.

657
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,260
Did you see how stuffed
that bowl was already?

658
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,703
Well?

659
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:42,240
I think we're here,
and we don't have to stay. We, uh...

660
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:46,611
ought simply to put in an appearance,
and then we can head home.

661
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,343
You have some marker.

662
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,478
That's what I think.

663
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,217
If you wanna know the truth,
you have some marker.

664
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,387
And you're gonna put it on
the house keys so thatJaney can find it.

665
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,192
Then when I get back to the house,
I'm gonna find the two of you in there...

666
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,564
and Wendy will be able to hear you,
and Paul will be back and he'll hear you.

667
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,830
- And I'll catch you. That's what I think.
- Elena.

668
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,636
It's not what you think.
It's not some big plot.

669
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,172
Honestly, l-I...

670
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,683
I don't feel good about it.

671
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,094
<i>I just... </i>

672
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,965
I don't know.

673
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,898
Well, I'm really pleased
to hear a confession.

674
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:46,567
Elena, you're just getting
wound up to get wound up.

675
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,745
Let's just go to this fiasco.

676
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,942
If that's what you want.
Let's just go on in.

677
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,576
I'd rather talk
to anyone else but you.

678
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,386
My dear, he wrote her out of the will,
and now her attorneys are, um...

679
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,489
<i>- This has been goin' on for years... Her attorneys...
- Oh, Dot. </i>

680
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,488
- Ben.
- Hey, Jack.

681
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,490
- How you doin'? You're soaked.
- Good to see ya.

682
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:39,186
- Well...
- Hell of a night out there.
You know my wife, Ronnie.

683
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,661
- Yeah, nice to see you. I'm just gonna go...
- Hey, Benjie.

684
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,698
- Hey, Mark. How you doin'?
- Good to see you.

685
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,860
Great to see you.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

686
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,903
Excuse me.
Hey, Maude. How are you?

687
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,439
- Well, well, well. Ben.
- Pierce, how you doin'?

688
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,840
- Did I see Elena?
- Uh, she's here, yeah. Just gonna get a drink.

689
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,344
- Excuse me.
- Benjie.

690
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:03,013
Clair. George Clair. What the hell
brings you to New Canaan?

691
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,679
Well, it's the funniest thing.

692
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,688
I've been talking
to some investors...

693
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,782
little, uh, outside venture,
you understand, between you and me...

694
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,488
- Oh.
- About a scheme to manufacture
a new Styrofoam packaging.

695
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,327
These little, um, uh...
these peanut-like pieces...

696
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:20,027
really keep an item free
from trauma during shipping.

697
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,866
It's miraculous.
Anyway, it turns out...

698
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:26,066
that the genius behind the whole project
is your neighbor, Jim Carver.

699
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,075
How about that?

700
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:32,548
Well, isn't that
a one-in-a-million coincidence?

701
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:35,515
<i>A real dreamer, ourJim Carver, eh? </i>

702
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:40,146
Darn right. Listen, I'm gonna make
a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.

703
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,884
Right. See you, uh,
bright and early Monday a.m.

704
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,392
Say, uh, where's the wife?

705
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:49,431
Uh, in Rhode Island with her folks.
I'm a free agent tonight.

706
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,704
How are you?

707
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,379
Oh, geez, Benjie.
Well, here you are.

708
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,458
Damn right.
Where the hell were you?

709
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,687
What are you talking about?

710
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,890
Don't bullshit me around, Janey.

711
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,058
Jesus Christ.

712
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:28,797
I waited around for more than half an hour
in nothing but my boxer shorts and...

713
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,499
- Ben, Janey.
- Oh, hi, Dorothy, Ted.

714
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:35,338
What's all that about?
I mean, what the hell happened?

715
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:38,902
A prior engagement overcame me.

716
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,342
- What?
- Listen, Benjamin Hood...

717
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:46,046
I have obligations that precede your...

718
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,055
from before you showed up.

719
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,991
I mean, one or two good-natured
encounters... that doesn't mean I'm...

720
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,495
I'm not just some toy for you.

721
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,294
When I remembered some chores
I wanted to get done before the party...

722
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,302
I just did them, that's all.

723
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,964
'Cause I wanted to get them done
before I saw Jimmy.

724
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:06,974
Jimmy?

725
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,636
Jimmy?
I'm not sure how to take this.

726
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,940
What do you mean, Jimmy?
I thought you and your husband...

727
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:15,381
How you take it isn't all
that interesting to me, Benjamin.

728
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,385
I'm sorry.

729
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,853
I just can't believe
you could be so...

730
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:43,301
<i>Now approaching
our final stop, Grand Central Station. </i>

731
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:46,074
<i>Grand Central Station. </i>

732
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,810
Excellent.
We were waiting.

733
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,850
We?

734
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:02,286
<i>You ought to read this, Hood.
Nixon, our leader. </i>

735
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,559
All ye need know about
the travails of life.

736
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,534
- Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
- Francis.

737
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,298
You're gonna leave the seeds in there?
In the binding like that?

738
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:15,207
- All will be revealed, baby.
- May look like just ordinary rain,
but don't be deceived, Dan.

739
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,245
When this falls to the ground,
it's turning immediately...

740
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,246
to the hard, slick and slippery stuff...

741
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,248
<i>Significant sleet and rain. </i>

742
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,580
Major.

743
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:26,746
Hey there, you young knight.
Can you, uh, check on the mead?

744
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,723
Can you sally forth and
secure us some more mead?

745
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:34,285
- Huh?
- Moisture. Moisture.

746
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,803
Fuck.

747
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,100
<i>Maybe put something on my jacket. </i>

748
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,107
<i>Yeah. </i>

749
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:50,872
<i>Frankie opens his with his teeth. </i>

750

Hey, that's a sellable skill.

751
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:57,047
Hell on the fillings.

752
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:02,882
<i>Oh, man. Everything's gonna freeze,
you know? Big freeze. </i>

Yeah. Paul, are you
gonna get home okay?

754
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,896

755

01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,850
Reverend Edwards.

759
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,952
Perhaps you might find it
in your heart to call me Philip.

760
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:45,599
<i>- You're here. I'm a bit surprised.</i>

761
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:50,331
Sometimes the shepherd needs
the company of the sheep.

762
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:56,503
I'm going to try hard not to
understand the implications of that.

763
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,215
<i>- Forgive me.</i>

764
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,664
I hope those weren't my keys.

765
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,320
Eureka.

766
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,797
Valium. Seconal.

767
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,800
Paregoric?

768
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,040
Francis Davenport IV, tonight...

769
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,635
you sleep the sleep of the just.

770
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,388
And whence has yon
virginal maiden absconded?

771
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,982
Oh, into one of the other 20 or so
bathrooms they got in this place.

772
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,086
Check it out.
Not for the faint of heart.

773
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,257
Pharmaceuticals!
You are a god.

774
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:28,166
Oh, yeah, yeah.
One for you... and one for me.

775
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,272
<i>No candy for me? </i>

776
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:40,940
Groovy. Young master of the revels,
a treat for our hostess.

777
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:45,814
Um... Well, uh, I don't... I don't...

778
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,389
- What is it?
- Come on, Paulie. Share the wealth.

779
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,949
- I mean, you copped 'em
from her mom's stash anyway.
- Let's see.

780
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:56,395
Libbets, you really shouldn't mix
and match. You know, with the beer.

781
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,091
I'm gonna put 'em back.

782
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:04,369
Oh, far out, Paulie. Hey, look,
these expired, like, five months ago.

783
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,839
Think they're better aged?

784
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:10,139
- Maybe you should just have a half.

785
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,646
Thanks for the advice, dad.

786
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,716
<i>All right. </i>

787
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,626
- Benjie.
- Hey.

788
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,726
Feelin' no pain.

789
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:39,636
The Indian saying goes,
"Pain is merely an opinion."

790
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,375
Hey, check it out.
Maria Conrad brought her son.

791
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:53,920
I wish some of the gang
had brought their daughters.

792
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:07,029
- Thank you, Brian.

793
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:17,468
- Hood residence.
- Your parents at that party?

794
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,980
Yeah. Yours?

795
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:23,483
You get in trouble?

796
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:26,054
I don't know.
I can't really tell yet.

797
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,147
Sorry if I got you into trouble.

798
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,725
Yeah.

799
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:33,386
- People start pollution.
- I'm gonna check out the ice storm.

800
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:36,555
- People can stop it.
- Wanna come?

801
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,532
<i>Maybe. I don't know. </i>

802
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,441
Where are you going?

803
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:23,807
- Out.
- It's freezing.

804
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,641
Yeah.

805
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,943
Then why are you going?

806
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,884
When it freezes, I guess that means
the molecules are not moving.

807
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,046
So when you breathe,
there's nothing in the air...

808
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:36,056
you know, to breathe into your body.

809
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,991
The molecules have stopped.

810
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:41,585
It's clean.

811
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:04,241
When you're asking yourself
this question, "What is 'is'?" and...

812
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:08,312
Oh, wait. This is the... the... the training
where they don't let you go to the bathroom.

813
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,688
That was the hard part, but I did it.

814
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,660
- The foot.

815
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:16,230
<i>The foot. </i>

816
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,664
Toe clipper man.

817
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:31,345
I guess he's just really exhausted
from, you know, tests and stuff.

818
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,218
Yeah.

819
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:43,687
- You know, Libbets...

820
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,760
I really feel...

821
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,723
you know, like,
a real connection to you.

822
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,766
Yeah.

823
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,734
- You don't even know me really.
- Sure I do.

824
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:58,830
Like, your aura that you give off.

825
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,210
My what?

826
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:07,077
It's, like, very positive.

827
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,150
And, um...

828
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:13,416
I feel a real...

829
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:16,218
special feeling for you.

830
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:20,193
I have a special feeling
for you too...

831
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,698
'cause l-I do...

832
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,267
Special.

833
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,770
- You do?
- Yeah.

834
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:34,104
To me, you're just like a...

835
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,737
I feel for you
like you're my o-own...

836
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,917
You're just like a...

837
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,287
- Brother.
- Brother.

838
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:56,187
- Yeah, you're not alone with that line.
- I do.

839
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,834
You are.

840
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,360
Right. That's cool.

841
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:06,874
Um...

842
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,502
So, how about we take
a bath together?

843
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:21,322
You're funny.

844
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,914
- A bath.

845
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,824
Like... Like a brother and sister.

846
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,372
Oh, man.

847
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,001
<i>- I'm so wasted.</i>

848
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,335
Hello?

849
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,895
Wendy?

850
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,431
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.

851
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,962
What are you doing?

852
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,664
I just thought I'd stop by.

853
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,536
Mike's out.

854
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,735
<i>I think he went to Silver Meadow... </i>

855
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,903
to see if you were
hanging around there.

856
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,914
Yeah.

857
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,253
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

858
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:36,051
- Good night.

859
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,956
Okay, everyone. We have
a little business to attend to now.

860
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:44,863
So, everyone who'd like to stay,
please gather in the living room.

861
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,333
- Knock, knock.

862
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:53,599
All right. Everybody, I've got the bowl.

863
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,177
<i>We're gonna start now,
so nobody go anywhere. </i>

864
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,838
<i>I'm talking to you, Fred. </i>

865
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,541
<i>- Oh, my... Ohl
- No, no. </i>

866
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,160
You ready to go?

867
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,798
We're not going anywhere.

868
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,833
<i>Ohl</i>

869
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,666
<i>Don't go anywhere. </i>

870
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,609
<i>Mark? Mark, where'd you go? </i>

871
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:24,530
Check this out. He's supposed
to say all sorts of stuff...

872
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,794
but he's kind of malfunctioned.

873
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:31,003
Mayday! Mayday!
Get this message back to base!

874
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:34,701
Same thing, again and again.

875
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,177
<i>It's gonna get a lot
colder tonight, I predict. </i>

876
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,305
Maybe even a blackout.

877
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,316
<i>Maydayl Maydayl

878
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,352
<i>Do you have candles in your house? </i>

879
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:49,083
<i>I know where the candles are. </i>

880
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,092
And I know where every
emergency exit is on this floor.

881
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:00,490
This knot's called
a hangman's noose.

882
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,539
Let's hang him.

883
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,550
He's dead.

884
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:24,182
If it wasn't raining, we could
take him outside and blow him up.

885
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:28,592
He wouldn't blow up.
He'd just get all mangled or twisted.

886
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:47,547
Well, looks like someone
got to its private parts before us.

887
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,913
Communist Vietcong.

888
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:53,283
<i>He left it in the jungle. </i>

889
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:04,058
Can I get in your bed...
with you?

890
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:26,246
Well?

891
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:31,356
<i>- What shall the order be?</i>

892
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:39,522
Alphabetical?
In order of appearance?

893
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:43,934
- Golf handicap.

894
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,099
<i>Lowest handicap does the honors. </i>

895
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:50,838
<i>That'd be Benjie. </i>

896
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,176
<i>Ladies, isn't this really up to you? </i>

897
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,649
<i>It's up to one of us. </i>

898
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,151
Oh, hell, I'll go first.

899
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:05,886
All right, all right.

900
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,656
<i>That's it. </i>

901
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:13,666
<i>And the winner is? </i>

902
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,431
<i>Have fun. Have fun. </i>

903
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,503
<i>- Go get her, killer.
- This is great. </i>

<i>- Okay, here goes.
- Drive carefully. </i>

907
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:35,354
Okay, Pammy.

908
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,514
Want a drink?

909
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:03,675
- Vodka?
- You never tasted the stuff?

910
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,301
Try again.

911
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,807
Feels warm.

912
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:30,036
One more shot?

913
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:45,124
Under the covers?

914
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:05,305
<i>- Get 'em off.</i>

915
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:35,036
Have you ever had
a nocturnal emission?

916
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,134
Huh?

917
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,975
It's when you wake up
and you find this pool of sticky stuff...

918
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,641
like after a sexy dream.

919
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:49,152
They haven't told you
about this stuff yet?

920
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:52,886
On what planet are you living on?

921
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,959
I love you.

922
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:06,106
That's nice.

923
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,141
Are you drunk?

924
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,969
I don't know.

925
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,048
How do I know?

926
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,845
I don't know either.

927
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:20,284
You spin around
when you lie down, I think.

928
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,458
I don't think I'm spinning.

929
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,277
<i>- How did you guess?</i>

930
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:34,513
<i>- Good night, George.
- Let's go.</i>

931
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:37,989
Gentlemen, good night.

932
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:39,491
- Good night, George.
- Ladies, good night.

933
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:41,653
<i>- Good night.
- Sleep well, George. </i>

934
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:47,727
Oh, my own husband.
Isn't that against the rules?

935
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:50,531
- Try again.
- No.

936
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:52,833
- No, no, that's...
- No, thanks.

937
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:56,900
- That's fine.
- Come on, honey. That was too easy.

938
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,241
<i>Getting down to the wire. </i>

939
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:25,771
Hey.

940
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:30,037
No, no, no.

941
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:32,044
<i>Benl</i>

942
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:35,578
<i>- Whoa, whoa. You okay?
- God, you scared me.</i>

943
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:37,742
<i>He's okay. </i>

944
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:44,224
He'll be okay.
Come on.

945
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,225
<i>You okay? </i>

946
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,295
<i>Ben? </i>

947
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:53,023
Sorry.

948
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:56,262
Sorry.

949
01:27:56,371 --> 01:28:00,034
l, uh... Maybe, uh, the bathroom?

950
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,041
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- It's right down the hall. </i>

951
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:04,111
<i>- Up we go.
- Mm-hmm. </i>

952
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:06,180
Hang on.

953
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,667
Hold the train!

954
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,238
- Hold it!

955
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,493
- Watch your step.
- Mm-hmm.

956
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:02,232
Well, I have to say I don't have
much faith that my car keys...

957
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,305
are still in that bowl.

958
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:11,004
It doesn't seem very safe
leaving your car keys laying around.

959
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,550
Let me.

960
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:32,066
Thanks, but...

961
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:35,703
Oh, I don't think so.

962
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:39,440
It's been kind of
a discouraging evening.

963
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:44,502
Well, you couldn't have hoped for
much better when you came up the walk.

964
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,880
Somehow it seemed different in
my imagination when I thought about it.

965
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,012
Actually, I didn't
think about it at all really.

966
01:29:56,357 --> 01:29:58,552
You want some coffee or something?

967
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,602
Elena...

968
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,839
the fact that we're neighbors...

969
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,908
close friends...

970
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:18,377
well, it makes all this
seem a little strange...

971
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,447
don't you think?

972
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:27,547
My husband is probably
passed out in the bathroom.

973
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,623
Or at least he wishes he were.

974
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:35,823
I've been married to him for 17 years, and
I have no intention of going in there to get him.

975
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:40,965
So, what I'm proposing is that...

976
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:43,866
since your wife went off with a boy
and since you are here alone...

977
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:46,064
I'm proposing that you and I
do what makes sense.

978
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:48,642
Stay warm, pass some time.
That's all.

979
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:53,340
Now don't make me feel
as if I'm being too forward.

980
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,678
- If you don't...
- What the hey. Let's go for a drive.

981
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:58,651
Okay.

982
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:06,050
- Whoa!
- Oh, Jim! Hold on to me. Hold on.

983
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:15,828
Maybe we shouldn't be driving.

984
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:19,270
We're gonna go for a drive.
I think we should go for a drive.

985
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,219
Thanks.

986
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:41,388
- We're gonna have to defrost this thing for a while.

987
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,983
Do these seats go back?

988
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:55,525
Oh!

989
01:32:57,838 --> 01:33:00,136
Oh, God.

990
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,412
That was awful.

991
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:09,079
Really awful.
I'm so sorry, Elena.

992
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:28,535
Um, look.

993
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:30,570
Can you wait here a sec?

994
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:34,636
<i>l, uh... I need to tidy up. </i>

995
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:39,441
Uh, just a minute. I'll, uh...
I'll be right back. Will you wait?

996
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:41,538
Of course.

997
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:13,146
Elena.

998
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,593
Ben, I've got a ride home.

999
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:31,890
Maybe you should sleep this one off
on the couch here.

1000
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:36,459
- I'll drive you.
- No. No, Ben. No.

1001
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,538
You're in no condition to drive.

1002
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,676
We'll talk in the morning, okay?

1003
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:46,178
You get some sleep
on the couch out there?

1004
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,945
I'll try.

1005
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:53,020
We'll talk in the morning.

1006
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:56,423
We'll talk in the morning.

1007
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:31,056
Shit!

1008
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:36,257
<i>- Jim, stop it. Stop itl
- Easy does it. Easy.</i>

1009
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:44,866
Are you okay?

1010
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:47,940
Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right.

1011
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:14,277
Whoo!

1012
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:58,359
Oh, no.

1013
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:03,862
<i>When you think about it... </i>

1014
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:08,526
<i>it's not easy to keep from
just wandering out oflife. </i>

1015
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:12,799
<i>It's like someone's always leaving
the door open to the next world... </i>

1016
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:16,342
<i>and if you aren't paying attention,
you could just walk through it... </i>

1017
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:19,105
<i>and then you've died. </i>

1018
01:40:19,213 --> 01:40:23,013
<i>That's why in your dreams it's like
you're standing in that doorway... </i>

1019
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:26,712
<i>and the dying people
and the newborn people pass by you... </i>

1020
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:30,756
<i>and brush up against you as they come in
and out of the world during the night. </i>

1021
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:34,556
<i>You get spun around,
and in the morning... </i>

1022
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:37,755
<i>it takes a while to find
your way back into the world. </i>

1023
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:42,936
Yeah.

1024
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:52,045
Phone's out.

1025
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:56,616
Hope the pipes...

1026
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:02,077
- Oh, wow.

1027
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:05,921
- Why don't you put on some dry socks.

1028
01:41:06,026 --> 01:41:11,828
Uh, and there are some, uh, rain boots
in the guest closet back there.

1029
01:41:11,932 --> 01:41:14,230
- Last room downstairs.
- Thanks.

1030
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,119
Get dressed.

1031
01:43:56,797 --> 01:43:59,561
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:04,899
This train, originating from New York's
Grand Central Station, is back in service.

1033
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:07,735
Next stop will be
New Canaan, Connecticut.

1034
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:10,275
New Canaan, Connecticut, next stop.

1035
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:44,037
<i>Jim! Janey!</i>

1036
01:44:53,387 --> 01:44:55,355
<i>Ben. </i>

1037
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:10,402
<i>Jim, he was just... </i>

1038
01:45:11,505 --> 01:45:13,769
<i>up in Silver Lane. </i>

1039
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:16,809
<i>I think a power line... </i>

1040
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:10,163
Mikey.

1041
01:46:34,654 --> 01:46:36,622
<i>Oh, Mikey. </i>

1042
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,668
Ben.
