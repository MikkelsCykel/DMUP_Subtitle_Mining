1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:34,394
Once, not long ago,
in deepest Africa,

2
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,230
a great rain forest,

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,368
a wild, magical land,
barely touched by humankind.

4
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,921
It's a special day in the dark
heart of this forest.

5
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,648
There's a new life,

6
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,853
a precious baby boy named Oscar.

7
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,821
What's so special
about this little guy?

8
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,323
Well, something truly amazing
will transform his life.

9
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,194
And that's what our
story is all about.

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,815
Beneath this rain forest canopy

11
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,952
is a world that you or I
may never set eyes on.

12
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,624
It's a world with few people,

13
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:15,600
but still, it's full of drama,
sadness, and joy.

14
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,585
About three months have passed

15
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,189
since little Oscar brought
light into his mother's life.

16
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,593
Isha couldn't be happier
with her new baby boy.

17
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,735
Oscar's world revolves around Mom,

18
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,507
but there are 35 other chimpanzees
in his group

19
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,775
that make a kind of extended family,

20
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,443
and they're never far away.

21
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,552
Perhaps one day Oscar will become

22
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,490
an old-timer like Grandpa,

23
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,085
who will turn 50 this year.

24
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,028
But there are other kids, too.

25
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,693
They'll become Oscar's playmates.

26
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,429
It's a rich society,

27
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,733
but in the heart of the jungle.

28
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,314
Now, Oscar won't be
in his prime until he's over 20,

29
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,259
but one day, he'll look like this big guy.

30
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,628
This is Freddy,
and he's large and in charge.

31
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,928
His white beard shows his years

32
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,992
of wisdom and experience.

33
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,637
Right now, Freddy is untouchable.

34
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,472
And like most alpha males,

35
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,910
he couldn't care less
about the young upstarts

36
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,881
who would just love
to take over his job someday.

37
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,958
Yeah, yeah. Seen it all before.

38
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,762
You need brains
to make a living in this forest.

39
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,829
The jungle toolbox can help,

40
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,740
but only if you're bright
enough to use it.

41
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,143
Sometimes it just takes
a little home-schooling

42
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,846
available from your friends and family.

43
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,487
See? Like this.

44
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,488
Right there.

45
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,627
Even Rufus catches on, eventually.

46
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,893
There you go. Bugs on a stick.

47
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,602
It's finally time for Oscar
to leave his mother's side.

48
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,522
For Isha 's little boy,
this is independence day,

49
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,687
and independence
comes one step at a time.

50
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,020
Well, that's enough
independence for one day.

51
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:18,503
Oscar's forest home is a prime
piece of chimpanzee real estate

52
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:22,632
that appears rich and lush,
but it's a hard place to make a living.

53
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,338
The jungle itself is a living,
breathing thing

54
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,437
that doesn't want to be eaten.

55
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,631
Finding food here is a full-time job

56
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,435
that involves the whole family,

57
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,100
including Oscar.

58
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,939
Now that he's grown up a little,

59
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,445
he can start to explore on his own.

60
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,684
But he's not above
catching a lift when he can.

61
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,187
Really, why walk
when you can hitch a ride?

62
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,322
Keep it moving, Mom.

63
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,423
Freddy leads the search for breakfast.

64
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,191
It helps to have someone who
knows where they're going,

65
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,727
especially when the restaurant
is never in the same place.

66
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,475
Today the diner isn't even
in the same neighborhood.

67
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,542
To find the fruit they'll need,

68
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,088
they will have to travel much further

69
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,180
and take a risk.

70
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,756
Freddy knows the only fruit
available now

71
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,529
is on the far side of their kingdom,

72
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,036
out of their safe zone.

73
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,473
This border has been
a battleground for generations.

74
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,383
Everyone is on maximum alert

75
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,952
and treads as quietly as possible.

76
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,290
Freddy is leading them close
to their greatest enemies.

77
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,068
This ridge marks the start of territory

78
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,734
owned by a group
of rival chimpanzees.

79
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,979
The forbidden fruit is finally in reach.

80
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,273
Shh, Oscar. Shh.

81
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,934
Freddy sees his team
are outnumbered two to one.

82
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,579
The enemy has a formidable leader,

83
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,849
Scar.

84
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,309
He and his team have had Freddy

85
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,548
in their sights for years.

86
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,759
Oscar clings to Isha.
They dare not make a move.

87
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,828
The rivals have caught their scent.

88
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,609
Oscar and the others
are in real danger.

89
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,392
Scar's drum is a threat.
For Isha, it's run or die.

90
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,109
Freddy leads the escape.

91
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,059
By running off Freddy's group,

92
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,561
their enemies have claimed
a small victory.

93
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,994
But that's just the beginning.

94
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,968
Scar and his troops are intent
on winning the war,

95
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,027
not just a single battle.

96
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,305
The prize,

97
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,642
a grove of nut trees
in the center of Freddy's land.

98
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,012
The grove is an oasis of food
in this difficult forest

99
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,611
and one that Scar's army
has to conquer

100
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,522
if they're going to survive and thrive.

101
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,036
Isha knows that Scar
is the greatest threat to little Oscar,

102
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,840
and the run-in
was too close for comfort.

103
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,745
She'll do everything possible
to keep her son safe.

104
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,325
Oscar will rely on his mother's
milk for a good while yet,

105
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,399
and to keep that milk flowing

106
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,634
Isha relies on the rich nuts
in Freddy's kingdom.

107
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,109
The magnificent nut groves,
so sought-after by Scar,

108
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,553
thrive here because of the rich soil,

109
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,749
and another magic ingredient,

110
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,787
life-giving water.

111
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,901
Beneath the waterfall,
in the heart of Freddy's territory,

112
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,598
the nuts are coming into season

113
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,164
and it's time for a feast.

114
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,383
They're delicious, nutritious,
and you can't eat just one.

115
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,094
It seems impossible to have too many.

116
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,097
But how do you carry them
without a bag?

117
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,965
You've got to be creative.

118
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,040
Hmm. Put them over in this hand.

119
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,473
Anybody watching this?

120
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,613
The ripest nuts can be sniffed out.

121
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,241
But these are also
the hardest to break into.

122
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:00,156
They require the right tool
for the right job.

123
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,208
It looks easier than it is,

124
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,734
and the technique takes these
guys many years to master.

125
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,176
Yeah, here we go. Yum, yum.

126
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,755
Sometimes the best tool
for getting nuts isn't a tool at all.

127
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,859
Yup, it's good old Mom.

128
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,097
It's a pretty sweet deal.

129
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,703
But Mom will only help out
for a couple of years.

130
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,975
Then they'll have to take
a shot at it themselves.

131
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,044
Really, how hard can it be?

132
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,719
Oscar is in nut preschool.

133
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,192
There's something wrong
with this hammer.

134
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,355
It won't hit the nut!

135
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,863
Yup, definitely the hammer.

136
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,032
Of course. A bigger one!

137
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,054
This is defective!

138
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,157
They just don't make logs
like they used to.

139
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,470
All right. It has to be the nut.

140
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,421
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
They're using rocks?

141
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,822
No one said anything about rocks.

142
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,252
Oh, I get it.
They must be harder than wood.

143
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,538
Mr. Nut, meet Mr. Rock.

144
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,809
Come to Papa.

145
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,946
Yes! Okay, that's one.

146
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,021
Now Oscar's out of nuts.

147
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,930
He'll have to leave
his hammer to stock up.

148
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,861
Rookie mistake.

149
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,171
I had an eye on that kid all day.

150
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,399
What an idiot.

151
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,281
After all those nuts,

152
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,985
nobody's swinging through the trees.

153
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,620
Yes, it's time to rest and digest.

154
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,324
Even our boy Oscar's knocked out.

155
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,338
It can take hours
to sleep off a big meal,

156
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,104
but the jungle never rests.

157
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,864
In the heat of day,

158
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,837
the parents just want a few
minutes of peace and quiet,

159
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,203
but the kids have other ideas.

160
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,072
Especially Oscar.

161
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,807
Come on up, guys!

162
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,752
A million trees in this forest

163
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,855
and you have to play over me.

164
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:44,669
I'm sleeping. I am still sleeping!

165
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,706
Poor Isha. Just look at her.

166
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,841
She really does have
her hands full with Oscar,

167
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,078
but her patience
never seems to run out.

168
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,820
Oscar's one lucky young chimp.

169
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,506
Scar and his thugs
are a growing threat.

170
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,977
Food is still scarce in their territory.

171
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,314
If nothing changes,

172
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,822
they'll be forced to make
a move on the nut groves.

173
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,589
If they succeed,

174
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,889
Freddy and his group will be exiled

175
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,555
from their homeland forever.

176
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:20,329
The aging Scar is under
constant pressure from within.

177
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,800
The males in his team are so powerful

178
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,708
that any one of them could
challenge him as leader,

179
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,370
and he knows it.

180
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,253
Grooming helps hold
this volatile team together

181
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,289
and reminds everyone who's boss.

182
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,054
Without it, there would be anarchy.

183
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,840
This hierarchy may hold
in the short term,

184
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,176
but how long can Scar
count on his men?

185
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,048
Far to the west,

186
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,822
a special fruit has come into
season beneath the waterfall.

187
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,427
Sacoglottis.

188
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,931
Trying saying that three times fast.

189
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,666
Freddy knows the fruit is a real bonus,

190
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,232
so it's best to make the most of it.

191
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,145
Isha collects a private stash
for herself and Oscar.

192
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,196
Remember to wash your food
before eating it.

193
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,740
Once washed,
the fruit is chewed to a pulp

194
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,404
so all the goodness can be sucked out.

195
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,946
You can do it without teeth.
No wonder Grandpa likes them!

196
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,347
That's a good look.

197
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,252
Not a lot of family photos
with Grandpa.

198
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,615
Very appetizing.

199
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,051
When the fruit is sucked dry,

200
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,756
rinse and repeat.

201
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,624
Wow, that is some good Sacoglottis!

202
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:49,416
Finally, this is something Oscar can
eat without his mother's help.

203
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,185
But it's anyone's guess where
the next meal is coming from.

204
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,603
With the fruit running low,

205
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,071
Freddy's family resorts
to another source of food.

206
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,507
Like us, they eat fruits,
vegetables, and meat.

207
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,906
But their choice in meat is something
that just might surprise you.

208
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,571
Monkeys.

209
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,541
The males take up the hunt.

210
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,669
They split up.

211
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,639
Fanning out through the forest,

212
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,741
they take up their places.

213
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,578
Freddy is at center stage.

214
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,956
Oscar and Isha watch
from the sidelines.

215
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,002
These colobus monkeys
are being hunted.

216
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,673
Smaller and lighter
than the chimpanzees,

217
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,766
they can run on thinner branches,

218
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,835
and this makes the hunt
much more challenging.

219
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,882
Freddy holds back.

220
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,514
This operation requires planning,

221
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,650
and everyone has a role to play.

222
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,393
One by one,
they silently take their positions.

223
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,067
The monkeys still haven't seen them.

224
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,745
Now, the blockers move up.

225
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,263
They're supposed to be seen,

226
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,230
and take a position in clear view.

227
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,962
Another blocker.

228
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,064
Another escape route closed.

229
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,679
Freddy climbs carefully.

230
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,977
He must not be seen.

231
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,712
As ambusher,

232
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,884
Freddy will stay hidden
until he makes the grab.

233
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,330
Perfect.

234
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,705
Now, for the driver.

235
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:03,179
He'll push the monkeys
towards the ambusher.

236
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,261
Ready,

237
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,097
steady,

238
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,629
go!

239
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,342
They've got one!

240
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,557
Freddy takes the best for himself.

241
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,562
After the initial scramble,

242
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,066
the group settles in for the feast.

243
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:04,165
For Oscar, it's time to try to
win a seat at the adult table.

244
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,003
Shares get dished out first to those

245
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,070
that helped in the hunt
or as payback for favors.

246
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,173
But no matter how hard you try,

247
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,912
there's always someone
who feels shortchanged.

248
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,719
The females couldn't care less.

249
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,423
When it comes
to guarding meat from the guys,

250
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,466
girl power usually wins.

251
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,000
Back up, big boy.

252
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,950
It's always good to add
a little fiber to your diet,

253
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,247
so don't forget the side salad.

254
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,232
As usual, Oscar was last in line,

255
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,429
so he missed the main course.

256
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,332
He'll have to settle
for his mother's milk.

257
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,706
He may not be the most popular
little boy with everyone,

258
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:16,042
but his mother's love
is something he can count on.

259
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:29,119
With dusk approaching, leopards will
soon prowl the forest floor.

260
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,287
If Isha and Oscar want to sleep safely,

261
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,387
the only way is up.

262
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,945
Young, flexible branches
can be woven into a platform.

263
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,793
And leaves from the same tree
will do for bedding.

264
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,985
Now, that's comfort.

265
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,024
Like most kids, Oscar hates bedtime.

266
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,849
Finally, Isha 's little rascal hits the sack.

267
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,900
Even if the kids let you sleep,

268
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:29,435
there's a good chance
the neighbors will keep you awake.

269
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,849
Ah, please...

270
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,524
Are you kidding me?

271
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,959
You know, frogs are edible.

272
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,406
Here we go.

273
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,818
Isha and Oscar go downstairs
the exciting way.

274
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,309
Early morning, just after breakfast,

275
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:10,780
is the best time of day to strengthen
friendships with a little grooming.

276
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:23,388
The bonds between Freddy's team
are more important than ever.

277
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,831
The group is far smaller
than Scar's rival army

278
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,924
and teamwork is their best chance

279
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,562
of protecting the nut groves
for the next generation.

280
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,745
Oscar's future is in all their hands.

281
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,214
Far to the east,
just inside Freddy's territory,

282
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,293
a fig tree comes into fruit,

283
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,852
and is an instant hit with everyone.

284
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,625
Figs are a lifeline in the forest,

285
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,669
often fruiting when
there is nothing else to eat.

286
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,926
Scar's gang is mounting a raid.

287
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,498
They've wiped out the fruit
in their own territory

288
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,541
and have crossed the border
to satisfy their hunger.

289
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,171
All other animals scatter.

290
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:01,116
Even these figs
won't keep them fed for long.

291
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,387
This is just a stepping stone.

292
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,823
When the moment is right,

293
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,431
they will try to take over the real prize,

294
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,023
the nut groves.

295
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,399
Scar's raid on the eastern border

296
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,501
goes unnoticed by Freddy's group.

297
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,975
A new kind of nut is ripening
in the nut groves.

298
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,074
These are far tougher
than the last ones.

299
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,949
It's time to bring in
the heavy equipment,

300
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,315
power tools!

301
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,972
Success with these nuts
is all about the quality of your hammer.

302
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,143
You can steal someone else's
while they're off collecting nuts.

303
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,209
And Freddy is an expert at this.

304
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,380
But, man, is he tough on his tools.

305
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,721
These things are
a community resource,

306
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,990
so can you please
try not to break them?

307
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,474
Safety first!

308
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:29,172
So please keep hands and feet
clear of rocks at all times.

309
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:42,286
Chimps have gathered here
to crack nuts for over 4, 000 years.

310
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,622
Nut-cracking is
part of the group's cultural heritage

311
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,859
and is passed through the generations,

312
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,425
especially from mother to child.

313
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,602
Learning, for Oscar,
will be a slow process.

314
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,305
It will be years before he could
even lift a rock like this.

315
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,343
Day after day,
it takes a committed mom to teach him

316
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,851
how to make a living in the jungle.

317
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,520
It will be many years
before Isha 's son can fend for himself.

318
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,217
A gathering storm
excites Scar's forces.

319
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,891
For Freddy's gang,
the rain is less welcome.

320
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,026
Chimps just hate getting wet.

321
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,915
Oscar gets all the warmth
he can from Isha.

322
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,580
Scar and his gang.

323
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,891
The storm is cover for a raid.

324
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,049
This time, they've got them cornered.

325
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,001
Isha and Oscar are in trouble.

326
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,527
Scar's army was overwhelming.

327
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,763
Oscar's group is in disarray
and badly shaken.

328
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:39,349
In all the chaos,
Oscar lost contact with his mom.

329
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,852
Isha is nowhere to be seen.

330
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:15,622
Isha has been injured and separated
from the group by Scar's gang.

331
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,685
She will struggle to get back safely.

332
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,968
This is no forest
to be alone in after dark.

333
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,785
Several of Isha 's friends
have been lost to leopards,

334
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:47,483
often when they have strayed
from the safety of the group.

335
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,110
Isha will never return to her family

336
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,356
or her son.

337
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,169
Oscar doesn't know
about his mother's death

338
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,773
and he searches for her everywhere.

339
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,580
With every hour that slips by,
he becomes more desperate.

340
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,833
Oscar's growing body
needs constant food.

341
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:46,135
He tries to remember
what his mom did to make their living.

342
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,602
But nothing comes easily without her.

343
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,799
Hours turn into days.

344
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,063
Oscar must spend less time searching

345
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,769
and more time focusing on his survival.

346
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,543
Hunger drives Oscar to a bees' nest.

347
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:36,584
Honey is good food, but he's always
relied on his mom to collect it.

348
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:48,196
The honey's too deep for small arms to
reach, and the bees are not happy.

349
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,668
Oscar's loss will be Freddy's gain.

350
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,728
The boss takes the biggest
piece of honeycomb,

351
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,732
but there's enough left
for everyone else,

352
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,203
except the little boy who found it.

353
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,441
The forest seems an
increasingly hostile place

354
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,747
for a young, hungry chimpanzee.

355
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,251
The razor-sharp jaws
of these army ants

356
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,626
can strip a frog or a lizard
to the bone in minutes.

357
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:58,896
Is it really a good idea to eat
something that can eat you back?

358
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,814
Oscar is the first to get bitten.

359
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:15,283
Without a mother, he'll need to learn
fast from the older chimps.

360
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,919
All right, step one,

361
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,481
make a miniature fishing rod
from a nearby branch.

362
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:28,422
Step two, cast it in and wait for a bite.

363
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,830
And finally, step three, ants on a stick!

364
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,726
Eat and enjoy!

365
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,180
Boy! That is spicy.

366
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,788
It's ingenious!

367
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:55,950
They will bite your lips,

368
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,551
but at least the rest of you is safe.

369
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,063
Oscar keeps his distance.

370
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,111
Maybe it's safer
just to pick up tips for another time.

371
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,496
Oscar is losing weight quickly,

372
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,001
and with no one to groom him,

373
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,560
it's becoming harder to keep ticks

374
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,765
and other bugs from his skin.

375
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,238
It's time to accept the simple truth.

376
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,916
Isha isn't coming back.

377
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,316
Oscar has to find a new mother.

378
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:04,817
But sadly for him, most of the
females have kids of their own

379
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,125
and are unable to help.

380
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,132
Again and again, Oscar is rejected.

381
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,156
Even finding a friend seems hard.

382
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,676
It's hopeless.

383
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:10,153
Scar and his men may have
taken more than one life that day.

384
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,490
The enemy has returned.

385
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,159
They have eaten all the food
in their own territory

386
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:54,203
and are now stealing from Freddy's
land to sustain their number.

387
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,444
For Scar, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy.

388
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,148
There is a growing impatience
among Scar's army.

389
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,290
They want to take the nut groves,

390
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,124
and more than one of them
would like to be leader.

391
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,712
Oscar has tried everything,

392
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,655
but he is still alone.

393
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,633
There's only one chimp
he hasn't approached.

394
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,296
Freddy.

395
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,154
By following the leader,

396
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,486
Oscar will at least find the best food

397
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,855
and work out what's safe to eat.

398
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,093
Right now, survival is all that matters.

399
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,799
Freddy is not known for his tolerance,

400
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,003
but Oscar isn't a challenger.

401
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,544
This will be
a new experience for them both.

402
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,155
A gentle acceptance is more than
Oscar could have hoped for.

403
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,502
Being at Freddy's side

404
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:11,131
should allow him to pick up some
tips on food preparation.

405
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,214
Maybe the big guy's table manners

406
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,584
don't set the best example,

407
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,885
but who's going to tell him off

408
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,092
or pick a fight
with the friend sitting next to him?

409
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,180
As the days pass, Freddy and Oscar's

410
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,582
relationship begins to change.

411
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,151
Until something
extraordinary happens.

412
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,152
Freddy allows Oscar
to ride on his back

413
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,457
as usually only a mother would.

414
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,609
It's a sign of something truly incredible.

415
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,010
Freddy will adopt Oscar.

416
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:20,063
Just being led to these nuts
would not help Oscar,

417
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,498
but now Freddy steps up

418
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,837
and gives his new friend first pick
of every one he cracks,

419
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:28,070
just as his mother once did.

420
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,476
The bond between them is growing.

421
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:58,204
It's Oscar's best meal
since Isha vanished.

422
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,112
The group is waiting for their leader,

423
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,313
but Freddy has a new project.

424
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,392
The learning that stopped short
when Oscar was orphaned

425
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,124
is starting again.

426
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,929
He's with a wise and skilled
chimpanzee who has much to offer.

427
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,053
Forest school is back in session.

428
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:05,867
Everywhere Freddy goes,
Oscar follows.

429
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,248
And everything Freddy does,
Oscar copies.

430
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:26,955
Our little boy is
on the fast track to forest knowledge.

431
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,139
Freddy's world may be richer,
thanks to his new friend,

432
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:49,480
but his commitment to Oscar has left
him no time to patrol his borders.

433
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,082
The change has been noticed.

434
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:09,462
Scar and his gang have now
crossed over the ridge.

435
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:13,737
They would not usually get this deep
into Freddy's land without opposition

436
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,472
and they intend to take full advantage.

437
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:27,045
The troops need to refuel
before they push on.

438
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,016
The grand fig tree is being pillaged.

439
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,727
This is the food
that Freddy's group were relying on,

440
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,001
but Scar has no interest
in the needs of his enemies.

441
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:47,140
Encouraged by the lack
of resistance at the border,

442
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,407
the intruders are now
deep inside Freddy's land.

443
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,814
But there is growing dissent
in the ranks.

444
01:00:56,686 --> 01:01:00,213
The physical power of
this army is beyond question,

445
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,917
but the unity of a team can be fragile.

446
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,022
Scar needs to watch his back.

447
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,281
Freddy has become
completely devoted to Oscar.

448
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:31,777
The highest-ranking male
grooming the lowest.

449
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:35,356
It's an astonishing turn of events.

450
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,516
A few weeks ago, Oscar had nothing,

451
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,118
and now he is well fed
and completely adored,

452
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,696
and his savior is the last one
anyone could have expected.

453
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,835
The rivals are fed and rested.

454
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:08,949
Scar and his mob
are within reach of the nut groves.

455
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,082
The time for a full invasion has arrived.

456
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,456
Freddy grooms his allies.

457
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:01,899
He knows there is trouble approaching

458
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,566
and for the first time
in weeks, he appears nervous.

459
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:16,541
Friendships need investment,
and his attention has been elsewhere.

460
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,549
Oscar feels Freddy's focus
drift away from him.

461
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,689
Freddy must reassure his team
that he is still the boss

462
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,929
and has the strength
to unite them and lead them.

463
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,539
Oscar is confused.

464
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:47,379
He's lost one parent and
seems to be losing another.

465
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,677
The rivals are close.

466
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:32,188
Oscar and the group
sense that something is wrong.

467
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,006
Something catches Freddy's eye.

468
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:00,318
Scar attacks.

469
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,655
The final push has begun.

470
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,802
Freddy's team can't escape.

471
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,306
They have to fight.

472
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:30,614
But some of Scar's mob hold back.

473
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,016
Freddy leads the attack.

474
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,172
Freddy and Scar go head-to-head.

475
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,012
There can be only one victor.

476
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,546
Freddy's drum announces victory.

477
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,344
Scar will not be returning
anytime soon.

478
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:44,720
Teamwork has beaten brute force.

479
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,467
The group is now thriving,

480
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:38,172
unchallenged in their
ownership of the precious nut groves.

481
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,748
Cracking school continues,

482
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,219
but some students
never seem to catch on.

483
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:54,362
Grandpa has lived
to see Scar dealt a blow

484
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,728
from which he may never recover.

485
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:02,537
And Oscar is causing
as much trouble as ever,

486
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:06,068
but now he's fully
accepted by the group,

487
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,770
and seems to be
everyone's new friend.

488
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,980
Maybe quiet times are returning at last.

489
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,724
Oscar and Freddy
have been transformed

490
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,226
by the turmoil of the last few months.

491
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,824
For Oscar, the loss of his
mother could have meant the end.

492
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,130
Instead, it's a new beginning

493
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:36,365
with the most unlikely foster parent
in the forest.

494
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,472
And Freddy?

495
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,499
He's discovered a softer side

496
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:44,068
that must have been there all along.

497
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,622
Secure in Freddy's arms,

498
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,998
the future finally looks bright for Oscar.

499
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:58,374
When this big male decided
to carry this little orphan

500
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,472
and take care of him and give him food,

501
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,949
it literally took our breath away.

502
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,843
For sure, there's no doubt

503
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,946
he saved the life of the little one.

504
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,684
And that was really
very touching to see.

505
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,827
And when you see a
mother carrying its baby,

506
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,159
it's charming.

507
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:19,291
But when you see this huge,
King Kong-like figure

508
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,701
carrying this tiny, little,
male orphan around,

509
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:23,863
it was lovely.

510
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,502
Every single day
was an act of beauty

511
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,510
between the two of them.

512
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,910
And that's something
you can never forget.

513
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,375
Sometimes I imagine

514
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:37,942
the rest of the world waking up,

515
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,148
getting on busses,
or they may be getting on subways.

516
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,818
Our commute to work
is walking for an hour

517
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:47,054
through the jungle
to find chimpanzees.

518
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,121
Some of this stuff is just impenetrable

519
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,327
and really difficult to move through.

520
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:59,133
It really is a joy
to walk through this forest.

521
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,910
You see, it's not always that easy.

522
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,880
So, we're just walking...

523
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:16,017
They bite you
in the most remarkable places.

524
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,758
These sweat bees are driving me nuts.

525
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:22,319
Still, at least they're not honeybees.

526
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:26,095
Ahh! Ow! Ow! Ahh!

527
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,534
It's gotten intolerable.

528
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:32,596
I'm leaving.

529
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,432
Oh, my God. Ed!

530
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,271
If it bites you, you won't survive.

531
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,446
It's not a picnic, you know.

532
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:47,646
Yes!

533
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,725
There must be easier ways
to make a living,

534
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,522
but they're not as much fun.
