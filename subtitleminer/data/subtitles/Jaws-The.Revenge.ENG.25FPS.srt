00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,473
Stop that!

2
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,239
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.

3
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,114
Ow!
Serves you right.

4
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,517
Will you cut that out?
I can't help myself.

5
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,869
You're as sneaky
as your father was.

6
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,070
He was the tomato thief of all time.

7
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,588
- I know what you're doing.
- I'm hungry.

8
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,632
Let me finish dinner
before you eat it. Chop these.

9
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,512
Sorry, fellas.

10
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,315
Oh, Mom, tomorrow night we're going
with Tiffany to buy a Christmas tree.

11
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,113
OK, but a small one.
Watch your fingers.

12
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,276
No way, a big one. Ow! Shit!

13
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,154
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, it adds flavour.

14
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,829
- Hello?
- We don't want any.

15
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,108
Thea who?

16
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,516
I know it's Thea Brody.
How many grandkids do I have?

17
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,109
- 'I can call by myself.'
- I know. You're a big girl.

18
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,073
- 'I'm five now, Grandma.'
- I know you're five.

19
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,588
Hi, kiddo.
How're you doin' down there?

20
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,757
'I'm fine, Uncle Sean.
I'm taking swimming lessons.'

21
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,360
- 'She swims like a fish.'
- Michael!

22
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,356
- Hey, bro.
- The fish. Check it.

23
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,709
- No way! You check it.
- I'm on the phone.

24
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,799
- 'What's going on? '
- Your grandmother is a slave driver!

25
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,559
- Did you get the book?
- 'Yeah. Thanks! '

26
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,151
Ask the big doctor about his job.
Tough life, you Bahamian beach bum.

27
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,394
'I heard that.'

28
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,112
- He heard that.
- Good.

29
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,993
Hey, how come you get to leave early?

30
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,873
Cos my desk is closer to the door.

31
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,037
- A big one.
- No, your brother won't be here.

32
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,640
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Jim.

33
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,797
- Eggnog time Thursday night!
- We'll be there.

34
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,991
We are getting a big tree
for all the old ornaments...

35
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,477
- With stockings on the mantle...
- And cookies and beer for Santa.

36
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,752
All right! Tiffany, do you realise
what a madman you're marrying?

37
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,677
Yes, I do.

38
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,199
- I gotta check in.
- OK.

39
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,515
- See you. Love you.
- Bye. Me, too.

40
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,835
- Don't be late!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,677
That bad, huh?

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,872
We're out of decaf,
petty cash and requisition forms.

43
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,478
Anything to do before I go?

44
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,432
That man keeps calling
about his training film.

45
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,153
He won't believe
we don't have a SWAT team.

46
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,915
Good night, Polly!

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,916
Amity Police Department.

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,274
Hold it!

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,074
There's an old dock piling
in the channel.

50
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,795
Maybe it'll just keep on
drifting till it goes away?

51
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,549
- It's stuck on a channel marker.
- Good night, Polly.

52
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,753
Uh-huh. It... Hold it!

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,434
It has to be cleared
before the fishermen come back.

54
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,754
Where's Lenny?

55
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,957
Out to Ben Master's place.
Cow tipping.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,234
Cow tipping?

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,593
Says kids tip over his sleeping cows.
They're not givin' milk.

58
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,399
OK, I'll take care of it.

59
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,352
Deputy Brody will
take care of it personally.

60
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,914
Call home, tell 'em I'll be late.

61
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,430
- Uh-huh.
- Cow tipping!

62
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,995
# The first Noel

63
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,669
# The angels did say

64
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,269
# Was to certain poor shepherds

65
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,834
# In fields as they lay... #

66
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,190
- No, no, no, no! Hold it!

67
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,234
Hold it! Together, people!
Together, remember?

68
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,637
All right. Let's try it again.
Two, three.

69
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,871
Where the hell are the Wise Men?

70
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,831
Good luck, Harry.

71
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,599
I'm gonna need it with this bunch.

72
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,438
Sounds better than
when I was a shepherd.

73
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,199
Joseph,
where the hell is your robe?

74
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,038
You're supposed to be
in costume! Jesus!

75
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,355
I'm over here!

76
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,916
All right, clear quickly.
Ready, angels, and...

77
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,035
Very good, people. Very good.
And now, again, "Noel," everyone.

78
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,479
Oh, God!

79
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,436
Oh, God! Help!

80
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,191
Help me!

81
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,710
Oh, God! Help me!

82
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,631
His things.
I thought you'd want them.

83
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,557
Grandma! Grandma!

84
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,438
We're here!

85
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,229
Grandma?

86
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,677
- Mom?
- We're here.

87
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,030
Thea, get down here. Come on.

88
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,957
Anybody home?

89
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,720
Michael.

90
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,591
Where's Mom?

91
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,473
She's been out there for hours.

92
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,080
How's she doing?

93
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,754
We've just come from Tiffany's house.

94
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,633
Poor girl.
The doctors had to sedate her.

95
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,277
- Hello, Mrs Taft.
- Hi, sweetheart.

96
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,598
I didn't recognise you, Thea.
You're so grown up.

97
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,200
Uncle Sean is dead, you know.

98
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,028
- Will he ever come back?
- We'll talk about that more later.

99
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,752
Are you hungry?

100
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,155
I had a hamburger
on the plane.

101
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,716
We can do better than that.
How about a funny bone sandwich?

102
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,511
How was the aeroplane ride?
Good. I got two lollipops.

103
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,988
- It came for him.
- What?

104
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,430
It waited all this time,
and it came for him.

105
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,355
You guys must be starving.
I'll make some fettuccini.

106
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,710
I'm making dinner.
You should sit and relax.

107
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,718
Really, Ellen,
there's nothing left to do.

108
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,275
I want you to get out of the water.

109
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,548
What?

110
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,239
I want you to give up
that terrible job!

111
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,635
- You can't be serious.
- Damn right.

112
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,830
I'm just getting started.

113
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,237
- I don't want you near the water.
- Mom, you're upset.

114
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,431
I don't want my family
anywhere near the water again.

115
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,711
- Never!
- You can't believe that voodoo.

116
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,035
Sharks don't pick people to murder.

117
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,719
It picked out Sean.
It killed your father.

118
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,877
- Dad died from a heart attack.
- He died from fear.

119
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,229
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

120
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,915
There's never been a great white
where we live, ever.

121
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,679
It's warm water. They don't like it.

122
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,518
Your brother's dead.
Your father's dead.

123
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,595
It was a piece of wood!
It was a shitty piece of wood!

124
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,511
Michael!

125
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,559
He was just doing his job.

126
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,959
God, he could make me laugh
sometimes.

127
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,992
He was always taggin' after me
when we were kids.

128
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,395
He always wanted to do
what I was...

129
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,393
Hey, where are you going?

130
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,795
Nowhere!

131
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,031
"To everything
there is a season,

132
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,159
"and a time to every purpose
under heaven.

133
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,915
"A time to be born
and a time to die.

134
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,754
"A time to plant,

135
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,475
"and a time to pluck up
that which is planted.

136
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,511
"A time to kill and a time to heal.

137
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,669
'"A time to break down

138
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,996
'"A time to weep

139
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,194
"A time to mourn and a time to dance.

140
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,800
"A time to cast away stones

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,638
"and a time

142
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,910
"A time to embrace

143
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,431
"and a time
to refrain from embracing."

144
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,040
Hey, Tom, wait up!

145
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,751
Oh, you're gonna spoil her.

146
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,831
That's what grandmas are for.

147
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,598
Why don't you come down
to the islands with us?

148
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,915
- I... I can't do that.
- Come on, Mom.

149
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,793
- Get warm, spend time with Thea...
- Yes!

150
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,752
Come here, you.

151
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,315
Wanna know what I think?
I think it's a wonderful idea.

152
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,033
- Yes.
- Come on, at least consider it.

153
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,072
- Get away. You shouldn't be alone.
- Yes!

154
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,678
- Great!
- Yay!

155
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,712
- We can catch the 4.30 ferry.
- Today?

156
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,079
- Today.
- No, I can't.

157
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,314
Yes, you can.

158
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,192
- Swing me, swing me!
- OK, OK.

159
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,754
Oh, my back! I can't do this.

160
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,837
I'll take her.
Oh, my God, she's too heavy.

161
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,871
Help us, Daddy.

162
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,872
OK, here we go. Aeroplane ride.

163
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,079
I know.
I'm gonna throw you overboard.

164
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,038
Oh, look!

165
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,516
Oh, hey,
I always wanted to ride one of those.

166
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,028
No way.
Chicken.

167
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,312
Mom always said if God meant us
to ride parachutes for fun,

168
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,079
- we'd be born with tickets.
- I never said that.

169
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,038
Yes, you did. August 1977.

170
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,117
Where's the lady who brings the soda?

171
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,151
They had them on the big plane.

172
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,589
There's some coffee in the Thermos.

173
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,108
I'm too young for coffee.
Can I drive?

174
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,037
Thea!

175
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,959
Sometimes Dad puts me in his lap
and lets me steer the Jeep.

176
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,710
Sometimes I let interesting people
sit in my lap and steer the plane.

177
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,398
- Oh, really?
- Really.

178
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,839
- Hoagie?
- Yeah?

179
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,792
Jake says you'll have to fly the rest
of your life

180
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,876
to pay off what you lost at craps.

181
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,232
Good news travels fast.
I'll get it back next time.

182
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,477
How come it bumps up and down
when there's no road?

183
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,794
The wind does that.

184
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,510
You been to the Bahamas before?

185
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,154
- No.
- First time's the best.

186
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,192
Then you know too much
and nothing's the same.

187
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,589
What makes the plane go up and down?

188
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,269
Easy. You go like this,
and the houses get bigger.

189
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,238
Then you go like this,
and the houses get smaller.

190
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,272
- Do you wanna go for a ride?
- Yes!

191
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,310
# And so I'm offering
this simple phrase

192
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,751
# To kids from one to 92

193
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,236
# Although it's been said

194
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,953
# Many times, many ways

195
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,833
# Merry Christmas

196
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,715
# To you #

197
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,151
Kenny and Tamika are playing
on the dock. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

198
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,671
Everybody out!

199
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,237
- Come on.
- Kenny, Tamika! I'm back! I'm home!

200
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,953
Let me help you
with the bags there, Romeo.

201
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,878
- You can take the heavy ones.
- Thanks, buddy.

202
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,515
Grandma! Grandma!

203
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,710
Your room's in here.

204
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,718
Grandma, watch me! Grandma!

205
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,149
Thea! Get down from there!

206
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,192
- Grandma, watch me!
- Get down from there!

207
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,835
- Mommy lets me.
- It's too dangerous! Don't do that!

208
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,997
- Grandma, watch me!
- Come on, sweetheart.

209
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,076
But you always let me.

210
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,076
Not today. Come on, Thea.

211
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,998
The other kids are.

212
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,190
Daddy, why can't I?

213
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,791
Did you hear what I said?
Come inside the house right now!

214
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,038
- I don't want to. I wanna swing.
- Right now you have to unpack.

215
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,437
I didn't mean to start all this.
I feel like such a grandma.

216
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,677
Come on. I'll show you around.

217
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,518
No! No! Put me down!

218
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,632
- Will you stop making a scene?
- I wanna swing!

219
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,549
I'll be all right, Michael.

220
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,636
Good. So will I.

221
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,311
She calls it
"Tourist on the Loose".

222
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,148
The local government commissioned it
for the public beach.

223
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,875
- You forgot about the store.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

224
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,956
We need milk, bread...

225
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,315
There's a big unveiling ceremony.

226
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,511
- We need beer!
- OK, I'll be right there!

227
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,630
Pretty good, huh?

228
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,031
Yeah.

229
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,591
Grandma?

230
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,757
'Will you stop fartin' around?

231
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,917
'Michael, what the hell
you doin' down there, eh? '

232
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,793
Jake, stop bustin' my chops.

233
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,400
'Listen, you remember
what they look like?

234
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,113
'Hard on the outside,
chewy on the inside.

235
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,714
'Sometimes they come
with a little grime.

236
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,239
'Move your ass, man! '

237
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,396
Ah, bingo!

238
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,758
Good. How many you got?

239
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,713
Come on, Michael, talk to me.
Give me some numbers. How many?

240
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,234
- 'Leave me alone.'
- You're full of shit.

241
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,637
'You been down there all day,
nothin' to show but excuses.

242
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,638
'Michael,
you're taggin' the damn things.'

243
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,917
I gotta separate the ladies
from the gentlemen first.

244
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,318
No, man, don't. You move too slow.
You got two speeds - slow and slower.

245
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,033
Hold your water, Jake.
The females have eggs.

246
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,311
So we're gonna stop everything
and pass out cigars?

247
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,319
We're being paid to see
where they go, how they propagate.

248
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,115
If we had decent funding, I'd study
their motor systems, temperature...

249
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,551
We'd do a decent report for a change
and really give them something.

250
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,956
If you'd leave me alone,
I'd be able to do my work.

251
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,355
I know how to tag a damn conch.

252
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,278
- Your readings suck, man.
- The tags suck.

253
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,437
- No, it's I that made them.
- It's I that put 'em on.

254
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,313
- You put 'em on wrong.
- No, no, no! They leak!

255
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,555
A blind man could find more conch!

256
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,319
You can't find your ass
with both hands!

257
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,390
That's not fair! You go away, come
back a zombie, it's Christmas Eve.

258
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,000
- We're working overtime cos of YOU!
- Hey!

259
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,749
I'm sorry about your brother, man.

260
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,758
Well, just...
just take it easy, will ya?

261
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,512
Jake.

262
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,399
C'mon, Jake, don't...
I don't want...

263
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,274
- Oh! Put me down.
- I missed you, man!

264
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,279
And then he wrote dirty words
all over the garage.

265
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,630
He was... your daddy was five.
He was your age.

266
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,716
- I'm almost six.
- So is Jake.

267
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,351
Oh, look at that face.
OK, do the other one.

268
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,469
Now that's closer to the real truth.

269
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,479
Oh, you. This guy was always
getting into some sort of mischief.

270
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,476
I got no doubt about that.

271
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,115
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?
Did you ever spank him?

272
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,832
Sharp shirt, Jake.

273
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,997
Hey, may your sex life
be as busy as your shirt.

274
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,315
Why, thank you.

275
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,430
My tea set! I got my tea set!

276
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,277
Oh, let me see!

277
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,596
Every lovely lady
should have a tea set.

278
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,473
It has a teapot
and cups and saucers.

279
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,432
And a sugar bowl
and a creamer.

280
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,632
Can I put real tea in it?
Yes, real tea.

281
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,797
Can I make sandwiches?
Yes.

282
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,037
Thea, we forgot
the Christmas carols.

283
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,710
Carol from the grocery store?
Oh, will you stop it?

284
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,318
I miss him, Mom.

285
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,958
- I want you to change your work.
- Mom, please don't start that.

286
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,595
- You could teach or write...
- I'm not gonna quit now.

287
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,949
You're all I have left. I don't want
you working in the water.

288
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,956
Mom, what I do is perfectly safe.

289
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,277
At the moment,
we're collecting big snails.

290
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,391
Jake and I are scientists.
We're almost PhDs.

291
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,876
We know what we're doing.
There's nothing to worry about.

292
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,153
Oh, great.

293
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,157
And, well, we have to dig
the ditch really deep...

294
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,193
so the water'll go all the way
around and we can swim in it.

295
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,549
You're silly.

296
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,354
You know what? Let's pretend
this is Buckingham Palace.

297
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,552
And you'll be Princess Di,
and we'll have a parade with horses.

298
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,512
And you'll ride in a golden carriage,
and we'll...

299
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,950
And I can invite
Cinderella to the ball.

300
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,436
She'll come
in a golden carriage, too.

301
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,234
And we can have
cookies and punch and cake.

302
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,477
And I can invite
Prince Charlie and...

303
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,988
What's the name
of the other prince?

304
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,837
Grandma? Grandma?

305
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,359
What's wrong?

306
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,277
Nothing.

307
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,632
Oh, we better get this done
before the tide comes in.

308
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,830
It's not nice to be evasive.

309
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,270
My mother says that
to my father all the time.

310
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,238
Hello, you two!

311
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,793
Hello.

312
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,231
I don't know why I fish here.

313
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,955
I never catch anything.

314
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,312
There must be a sign underwater -
"beware, Hoagie's about".

315
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,148
- You drive the plane.
- Flies the plane.

316
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,192
Mostly, it's like driving.

317
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,151
What's that, an excavation?

318
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,351
We're building a sand castle,
and you're invited for tea.

319
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,550
You know why you got
no ambition?

320
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,953
- Why is that, Jake?
- Your Norman Rockwell life.

321
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,433
Norman Rockwell?

322
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,119
That's precisely
your problem, my friend.

323
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,628
You weren't exactly a deprived kid.

324
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,036
I don't buy that
roots-rock-reggae bullshit.

325
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,072
Cut that hair,
you're a three-piece suit.

326
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,079
The bottom line is we got three
months left of work and no money.

327
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,473
Spent it all on beer.

328
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,957
Bahamian Fisheries Department
is not exactly Fort Knox, my friend.

329
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,797
But, on the other hand,

330
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,389
Office of Naval Research,
they've got money.

331
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,351
No. Forget it.

332
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,516
What do you mean? Money is money.

333
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,236
- They put bombs on dolphins.
- What you talking about?

334
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,113
I know a guy who got money
from them to study eels.

335
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,754
It's hard to put a bomb
on an eel!

336
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,109
Who rattled your cage? Michael, man!

337
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,516
We're bustin' our bunghies
to get our degrees.

338
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,869
I'm tired of all this paradise shit.

339
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,115
It's getting on my last nerve, man.

340
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,355
William. Look at you, boy.

341
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,960
- What?
- A mental midget reading all day.

342
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,515
If mediocrity were fattening,
you'd all be whales.

343
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,073
Knock off that drummin'!

344
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,635
Look at you, boy.
What's wrong with you?

345
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,832
You think because you been to
university you're smart?

346
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,395
I don't know
why I've told you all this.

347
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,716
Sometimes talking
to a stranger is easier.

348
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,230
I can't explain it.
It's just something I feel.

349
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,272
I always listen to my feelings.

350
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,431
I think I'm going crazy.
Nightmares and...

351
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,471
Maybe it was an accident.

352
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,272
It was no accident.

353
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,151
I'm not saying you're wrong.

354
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,829
I'm just saying that maybe
there are other possibilities.

355
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,589
When it killed Sean, I knew
with certainty it had come for him.

356
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,437
I knew that!

357
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,993
I know it's coming.

358
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,069
I know it's coming.

359
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,269
What's it cost to ride on that plane?

360
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,437
The water's coming in!
The water's coming in!

361
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,313
Depends on where you want to go.

362
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,794
- Doesn't matter.
- Hurry!

363
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,037
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

364
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,914
Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Oh!

365
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,078
Take the wheel!
I'm sorry?

366
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,157
- Take the wheel.
- No, I can't.

367
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,509
- Sure, you can.
- I don't know how.

368
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,199
Nobody does till they learn.

369
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,153
What are you doing?

370
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,237
Better take the wheel
or we'll be swimming soon.

371
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,033
Whoa, take it easy!
Take it easy!

372
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,197
Hold her gently.
She'll damn near fly herself.

373
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,511
See? Just like driving a car.

374
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,471
Where do I pull off the road?

375
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,433
No, you're doing fine.
I'll keep you out of trouble.

376
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,313
- Relax.
- Where are we going?

377
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,272
One time, I was flying supplies
up the Amazon

378
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,311
when I came down in the jungle.

379
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,193
- You won't tell me?
- I was picked up by head-hunters,

380
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,753
and taken to their chief.

381
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,155
- You are impossible!
- He looked at me

382
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,111
and took me in his hut.

383
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,118
Inside his hut,
there was a long pole...

384
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,672
What is all this?

385
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,190
Just a little something
I arranged to cheer you up.

386
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,719
- No, really.
- What?

387
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,832
- Tell me, what is all this?
- A local festival.

388
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,111
It's called a junkanoo.

389
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,675
'I'm not hearing
anything up here, buddy.'

390
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,474
How many have you tagged, exactly?
How many?

391
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,718
Michael... stop busting my bunghie.

392
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,230
Yeah, it's OK for you,
but not for me, huh?

393
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,555
Have no fear, Jake is here.

394
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,478
I just struck the mother lode.
I'm counting.

395
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,399
'Watch yourself with
that fancy equipment, buddy.'

396
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,432
Such a live wire'll
make your hair stick up funny.

397
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,596
That's good, Michael. William?

398
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,870
Yeah, there's no hope for that boy.

399
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,310
Jake? Jake, that's a joke.

400
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,472
Holy shit!

401
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,190
We got a big fish down here, man.

402
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,515
Oh, yeah? How big?

403
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,188
- Jesus!
- Look out!

404
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,393
What's wrong?

405
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,439
Ellen?

406
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,392
Jesus Christ!

407
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,713
- Ellen, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine.

408
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,399
- No, you're not.
- I'm terrific.

409
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,834
Come on!

410
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,389
Give it up!

411
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,510
You can't keep doing this.

412
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,633
- I can't keep doing THIS.
- You promised me a drink.

413
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,037
Sharks come and go, Ellen.
People have nothing to do with it.

414
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,949
- A drink with an umbrella in it.
- Ellen, give it up.

415
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,036
Give it a kick in the arse.

416
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,036
Get on with your life.

417
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,631
I know what you've been through.

418
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,513
Don't worry.
The nightmares'll go away.

419
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,313
Give me my glasses, man.

420
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,830
Boy, I ain't never seen
nothin' so big. Never!

421
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,350
I was right next to Michael.
The thing went right past me!

422
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,198
Should've gone for you, Jake.
Why did it come up?

423
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,516
- What's it doing in warm water?
- What's the difference?

424
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,434
It's only a shark.
A big, big, beautiful shark.

425
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,278
And it's ours.
Don't say anything to anyone.

426
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,394
Fishermen would try to kill it.
Michael, we got us a great white.

427
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,590
Now we gonna do some real research.

428
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,428
Do me a favour, don't say
anything about this to my mom.

429
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,109
Hey, man, I didn't mean to,
you know, flap my lips, eh?

430
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,276
So...
So?

431
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,279
I said to him,
"Where's the disinfectant?"

432
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,350
He said, "I've left it in town."

433
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,119
So I said,
"What are we gonna do?"

434
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,436
So he says,
"I'll tell you what we'll do.

435
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,632
"Come back at lunchtime, all the
flies will be in the kitchen."

436
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,600
Come to bed.

437
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,756
He took her sightseeing.

438
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,313
Well, you work. I work.

439
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,194
She needs someone to help her
take her mind off things.

440
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,036
I'll help you take YOUR mind
off things, sailor.

441
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,551
It's soaking.

442
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,599
Thank you.

443
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,717
Good night.

444
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,871
Good night.

445
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,034
Louisa.

446
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,753
It's OK, Jake.
I'll check on the table.

447
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,434
- OK, everything rides.
-Ooh, it's Hoagie!

448
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,630
Hey, come on, I wanna see this.

449
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,750
Oh, that's Hoagie, all right.

450
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,674
Everything on the line.

451
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,757
- You're not betting it all?
- All or nothing at all.

452
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,678
- Here, do you want to throw for me?
- No!

453
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,870
Now get ready. Are you ready?

454
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,991
- I guess that's bad?
- Depends on your point of view.

455
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,998
Ooh, look at that. Come here.

456
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,878
Ooh, look at you. You look great!

457
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,633
It's on the house.

458
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,274
I knew there was a reason
I could afford this.

459
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,673
Thank you, Shirley!

460
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,998
My father used to say, "Jake,
you got two loves in your life -

461
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,634
"what you do and who you're with."

462
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,509
- Happy birthday, Louisa.
- Happy birthday!

463
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,632
- And a Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year!

464
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,513
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

465
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,028
Don't go weak in the knees
on me tonight, boy.

466
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,719
You're gonna need
all the strength you got.

467
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,830
I knew a one-armed piano player,

468
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,474
took two minutes
to play the Minute Waltz.

469
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,389
Watch how you talk.
Michael and I are about to be famous.

470
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,714
- Tell 'em.
- Jake!

471
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,910
No job talk. You promised.

472
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,110
You promised.

473
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,310
Right.

474
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,749
Would you risk
a dance with me, madam?

475
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,236
- You'll be sorry.
- So will you. I have two right feet.

476
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,510
That's good, I have two left.

477
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,073
Well, that's a set.

478
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,868
A little quiet tonight.

479
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,354
- New Year's blues?
- No, not at all.

480
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,472
Come on. It's my party.

481
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,911
He's just Michael, he's startin' to
count them damn conch in his sleep.

482
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,634
Excuse me.

483
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,670
- Mind if I cut in?
- Please.

484
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,870
The world would be a better place

485
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,434
if more sons danced
with their mothers.

486
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,748
Michael, stop pouting.

487
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,510
You look like you did when you were
six and didn't get what you wanted.

488
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,472
I like him. I enjoy his company.

489
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,638
Yeah. I don't like him
chasing around after you.

490
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,910
I don't trust him.

491
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,436
He's not chasing.
You are being ridiculous.

492
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,278
I've been a pain in the ass
and I'm sorry.

493
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,914
I'm not gonna bother you
about your work.

494
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,349
- You're not a pain.
- Let me finish.

495
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,908
I've been rehearsing this all day.

496
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,470
Sean's death almost killed me.
I'll never get over it,

497
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,671
but I refuse to let myself
be run by an obsession.

498
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,837
I can't keep on believing
it was intentional.

499
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,952
I finally figured it out.

500
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,956
Good.

501
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,638
That's it, "good"?

502
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,513
I thought you'd break out
the champagne.

503
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,869
No, I-I-I'm pleased.

504
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,674
Come on. Show your mother
what a good dancer you are.

505
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,310
Where is everybody?

506
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,476
Down here!

507
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,195
- Where is Clarence and William?
- I gave them the day off.

508
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,276
What for? We got a job to finish.

509
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,629
Why are you making a transmitter?

510
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,875
It's all part of the master plan.

511
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,115
We're gonna test it out right now.

512
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,438
We're gonna learn about
its motor systems, its heart rate.

513
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,553
We're going to study
a magnificent animal

514
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,160
no one knows that much about.

515
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,352
As the sun sets, we bid a
fond farewell to the family of conch.

516
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,868
What the hell
are you talking about?

517
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,311
We wrap it up and hand it in.
Why is your heart stronger than mine?

518
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,432
We don't write up anything
till we're finished.

519
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,550
When I was a boy, my father said,

520
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,036
"Never do anything today
you can put off till tomorrow."

521
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,315
Them conch gonna be there tomorrow.

522
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,670
- When we got the grant, it said...
- No, when I got the grant.

523
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,678
- OK, when I signed on, I...
- When I invited you.

524
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,797
- We got the grant together.
- When we got it together.

525
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,356
We got three months' work left
on this. We can't write a report.

526
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,672
Michael, we got a rare bird here.
You know that, huh?

527
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,190
Great white don't come down
to the Bahamas, never.

528
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,515
Do we let an opportunity
just swim away?

529
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,357
My name's on the report.

530
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,712
A half-assed job, I don't get
my doctorate and neither do you.

531
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,036
I thought we were planning
a rosy future together.

532
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,798
So did I.

533
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,870
Hey! Hey!

534
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,911
Michael?

535
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,394
Anybody home in there at all?

536
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,637
You better beam down to Earth
with the rest of us.

537
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,753
If that shark's still in the water,
it won't be there forever.

538
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,792
It's gonna figure out
the water's too warm.

539
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:32,358
Look at me and tell me you don't want
to study that fish as much as I do.

540
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,552
Michael? Huh?
This is what we trained for.

541
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,717
This is what we studied
them damn books for.

542
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,593
Remember,
my name goes on that report, too.

543
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,632
It's as important to me
as it is to you, right?

544
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,353
All right,
you like them damn snails?

545
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,671
All right, all right,
I'll make you a deal. Listen.

546
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,598
We study that shark,
just for a few days,

547
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,108
and it's back
to your lovely snails.

548
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,072
Now that's fair, man. That's fair.

549
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,237
Come on, indulge me with it, eh?

550
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,388
I don't know shit about electronics.

551
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,829
Boy, you don't know shit
about anything.

552
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,030
It's time you learned.

553
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,038
I'll teach you how to wear your hair,
how to dance.

554
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,355
How to box. Come on, follow me.

555
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,516
Get your butt down here, man.

556
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,839
This is the third time
you've forgotten to take it out.

557
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,350
- I got a lot on my mind.
- You can't remember when they come?

558
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,197
My brain is shrinking...

559
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,312
Don't give me that
preoccupied scientist crap.

560
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,635
I'm getting ready
for a big event!

561
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,752
I thought artists worked
with their subconscious.

562
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,234
How come it's my responsibility?

563
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,838
Because.

564
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,675
Oh. OK, now I understand.
All you had to do was explain it.

565
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,829
I take out the garbage... because.

566
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,269
I'm glad we
got that straightened out.

567
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,039
We don't have anything
straightened out.

568
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,715
You're uptight about something.

569
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,077
What's wrong?

570
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,749
Why should there be anything wrong?
I'm enjoying my day off,

571
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,430
my wife starts yelling at me
about the garbage.

572
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,032
What are we arguing about?

573
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,877
I don't know. I...

574
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,516
I don't know.

575
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,198
Hey.

576
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,914
- No fair, I'm not armed.
- Then don't come any closer.

577
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,795
- Turn it off. Off.
- No. I have work.

578
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,358
I've always wanted to make love
to an angry welder.

579
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,075
I've dreamed of nothing else
since I was a small boy.

580
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,189
- Shut the door.
- Uh-huh. Later.

581
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,073
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Michael!

582
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,792
Shut the door!

583
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,913
You sure you've
done this before?

584
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,999
Oh, yeah. Lots of times.
Trust your Uncle Jake, eh?

585
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,395
It's always worked, huh?

586
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,954
Well, uh... thus far.

587
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,509
OK, take me out.

588
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,711
Little more.

589
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,155
There it is! Comin'! It's comin'!

590
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,831
- You remember how to pull rope, eh?
- Yeah.

591
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,914
Yes! You got him, man!

592
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,996
Ah! Now would be a good time!

593
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,275
Did you see that, man?

594
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,237
Let's try to follow it.

595
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,671
Now we're gonna see if Uncle Jake's
equipment's really working for us.

596
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,397
Michael!

597
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,753
- Our little island agrees with you.
- I have my own little island.

598
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,509
But it's so cold in the winter.
I tried winter once.

599
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,757
Here we are. Burlington, Vermont.

600
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,792
I flew a run to New York. Oh!

601
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,435
I have a bone in my left foot
that hasn't thawed yet.

602
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,268
- When I was a small boy...
- Not hard to imagine, by the way.

603
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,959
...I dreamed of always being warm.

604
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,753
What do you want?
Whatever we had last time.

605
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,432
Two Bahama Mamas, please.

606
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,950
- Stay. I'll take time off.
- You always take time off.

607
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,639
I like to travel.
I'll nick the plane again.

608
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,229
- Won't you get in trouble?
- Not if he doesn't find out.

609
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,637
It's just a hop down to the
Caribbean. We'll spend a few days.

610
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,592
There must be a lot of ladies
who'd be glad to go.

611
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,312
Yeah, there are, but...

612
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,478
I've grown tired
of one-way conversations.

613
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,873
I have an irresistible
urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.

614
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,148
Why?

615
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,510
Because it would not
occur to you why.

616
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,152
Blushing suits you.

617
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,115
- Lord... I'm sorry.
- It's nothing to be sorry about.

618
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,312
No, this whole thing...
The whole idea is preposterous.

619
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,476
I don't think so.

620
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,871
- You sure you don't need glasses?
- I'm a pilot.

621
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,876
My vision is perfect.

622
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,715
What are we getting?
Nine knots.

623
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,955
Shit! We should be keeping up.

624
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,231
- You sure the throttle's open?
- Wide open.

625
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,035
Come on, you overgrown goldfish!
Come to Uncle Jake.

626
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,793
- How long have you known Hoagie?
- What?

627
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,558
How long have you known Hoagie?

628
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,955
- What's he got to do with it?
- How long?

629
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,389
Since he got here.
Bring it to starboard!

630
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,479
When did he get here?

631
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,476
- Who?
- Hoagie!

632
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,988
Christ!
One day he was just here, that's all.

633
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,350
What do you know about him?

634
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,473
He's after my mother.

635
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,672
- What's so funny?
- He's not good enough for her, eh?

636
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,439
I agree. I'd send her home right now.

637
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,755
Bring her about,
we're going the wrong way.

638
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,270
I mean, some of these pilots
are flying drugs down here.

639
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,790
- He's always going off somewhere.
- Bring her about, now!

640
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,594
- I am!
- Hurry, man, we're losin' him!

641
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,949
- You must know something.
- Christ!

642
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,276
He likes gambling,
he likes women, don't bother me!

643
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,629
- He flies charter...
- Damn! We lost him!

644
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,631
Maybe your gear crapped out.

645
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,275
Maybe you crapped out,
flappin' your lips about Hoagie.

646
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,959
Maybe he's gone.

647
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,319
All right, Mr Fish.

648
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,920
We'll come back and find you
tomorrow.

649
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,956
All he did was kiss me!

650
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,794
- Well, that's a beginning.
- A beginning of what?

651
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,308
To whatever happens next.

652
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,191
Oh.

653
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,233
I used to think I could handle these
situations once I was grown up,

654
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,714
but I don't even know
if he's serious.

655
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,230
Mmm, give it some time, Ellen.
See what happens.

656
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,716
Well, part of me wanted to
go off with him.

657
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,352
I couldn't.

658
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,635
I don't know why he wants me.

659
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,318
Maybe he's got good taste.

660
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,272
He hasn't spent
much time with a woman like you.

661
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,438
I don't know what he thinks.
Or what I think. This is so silly!

662
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,869
I feel too old to be in this thing.

663
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,276
I hope not. I am counting on
a long, happy sex life.

664
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,552
You said it wasn't polite
to interrupt people.

665
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,398
Yes, I did.

666
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,876
- It's time for tea, Grandma.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

667
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,434
I didn't.
I put everything in my room.

668
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,516
My teddy bear's joining us.

669
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,318
Michael?

670
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,512
Michael, what is it?

671
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,876
Nothing, just a stupid dream.

672
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,111
Hmm.

673
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,314
Time for bed, peanut.

674
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,954
- Oh, no!
- Yep. Daddy's got homework.

675
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,389
- But you let me last night.
- Yeah, yeah.

676
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,590
Mommy's waiting to read a story.

677
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,639
- Good night, sweetheart!
- Good night.

678
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,797
Night. Let's put up our feet
and shoot the breeze,

679
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,149
or whatever it is beer drinkers do.

680
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,953
I, uh, I got to put
together this report, Ma.

681
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,276
Jake says don't do today
what you can put off tomorrow.

682
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,834
Yeah, Jake's got a lot of those.

683
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,793
I'm leaving in a few days.
I don't want to go with you unhappy.

684
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,159
I'm not unhappy.

685
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,237
I saw you and Thea.
You looked just like your father.

686
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,590
Do you remember when
you guys used to imitate him?

687
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,916
Mom, I gotta get this finished, OK?

688
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,555
- I worry about you.
- There's nothing to worry about.

689
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,477
I'm your mother. It's my job.

690
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,069
Just cos you're a man
doesn't mean I've retired.

691
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,033
I've worked on MY smile.
It's... it's your turn.

692
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,914
That's better.

693
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,277
'Blump, blump! Blump, blump!

694
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,471
- 'Blump, blump! Blump, blump! '
- Jake, knock it off!

695
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,069
Blump, blump. OK,
just don't try to renege on our deal.

696
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,510
Half a day on the snails,
then a half a day on the shark.

697
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,997
You got 17 more minutes, then we're
gonna go look for that shark.

698
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,511
It's a big ocean. We could
spend the rest of our lives looking.

699
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,198
'We're gonna find him.'

700
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,710
'I got about a half a dozen.
I'll tag 'em and be right up.

701
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,716
'You, uh, hearin' anything? '

702
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,072
Nothin' at all. Just another cool,
calm, tickly day in the Bahamas.

703
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,033
Just stay within a quarter mile.
I got a three-mile monitor radius.

704
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,437
Within three miles, there's plenty of
time to beam your ugly ass up.

705
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,794
Michael, I got him.

706
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,196
'He's comin' towards you.
You better get out now.'

707
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,549
All right, I'm comin', I'm comin'.

708
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,473
Shit!

709
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,796
Jake!

710
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,392
Jake!

711
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,192
Michael! Michael!

712
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,831
'Michael! '

713
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,433
Michael, what's goin' on?
Michael, can you hear me?

714
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,471
'Michael! Michael, can you hear me? '

715
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,631
Michael!

716
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,153
Son of a bitch! Oh, shit!

717
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,679
Jesus Christ!

718
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,439
Ah!

719
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,676
Uh!

720
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,877
It's over there!

721
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,435
Shit! Get the bang sticks,
we're goin' down.

722
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,040
- They're no good.
- Get another one!

723
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,113
Come on, come on! Michael!

724
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,277
- Get him up! Watch his arm!
- Lay him down gently!

725
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,710
We need a tourniquet
to stop his bleeding.

726
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,354
- Try this!
- Get the wet suit off.

727
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,630
Keep cool, don't worry.

728
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,468
Michael, how are you?
I think he may be in shock.

729
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,397
Clarence, move it!

730
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,913
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what you doin', man?

731
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,555
No one goes in the water
till we know where that fish is.

732
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,273
You fall off the horse,
you get right back on.

733
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,437
Hell, what kind of bullcrap
you talkin'? Huh?

734
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,632
- Anybody's in the water, it's me.
- Jake, I'm gonna go down.

735
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,515
All right, so what about Carla's gig?
It's almost time, man.

736
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,838
Michael, I can't just let you
go back down.

737
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,958
I'm scared shitless.

738
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,436
What the hell do I do
if I can't go back in that water?

739
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,753
All right, be careful.

740
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,949
Clarence, get up on that shack.
Give us some lookout.

741
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,312
- I hope he knows what he's doing.
- He's doin' what he's got to do.

742
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,073
Jake, are you gettin'
anything on the shark?

743
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,989
No, everything's cool.

744
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,396
I'm thinkin' about yesterday.
It's probably a mistake.

745
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,149
- He was hungry. You look tasty.
- But how come only me?

746
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,591
- Maybe he just like white meat.
- You're a funny guy, Jake.

747
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,519
Jesus!

748
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,312
It is about art
that I wish to speak today.

749
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,876
The raw material of art
surrounds us all,

750
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,072
catching in the net that each
and every one of us casts

751
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,475
into the current of life.

752
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,196
- But it takes the art...
- Where the hell are they?

753
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,958
They'll be here.

754
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,150
- Can I go on the banana boat?
- Shh!

755
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,397
Margaret's going.
She's with her mother.

756
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,749
- OK.
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

757
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,519
- Thea, you be careful.
- I will, I will!

758
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,632
- Thea!
- It's OK. Banana boats are fun.

759
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,798
Oh, we should be so lucky.
I wish we were out with her playin'.

760
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,070
Margaret, wait for me!

761
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,511
"Get to the point, man,"
as my wife now says.

762
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:54,112
OK. Well, in short, art is grease
for the wheel of life.

763
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:00,269
Today we are privileged
to dedicate a work of art.

764
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,992
Carla Brody,

765
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,795
an artist of growing reputation,

766
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:12,949
was commissioned to express
our way of life in permanent form...

767
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,549
to show the world what we all know
right here on this beach:

768
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,433
That it is better in the Bahamas.

769
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:27,359
- Absolutely.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Carla Brody!

770
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,154
Thank you, Commissioner Witherspoon,
Mrs Witherspoon.

771
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,192
Thea!

772
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,153
Oh, my God!

773
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,828
Thea!

774
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,632
Stop! Come back! Bring her back!

775
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,034
Oh, my God!

776
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,953
Stop! Thea! Thea!

777
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,274
Thea!

778
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,470
Somebody do something!

779
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,468
Thea!

780
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,679
Oh, no! My God!

781
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,476
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Thea!

782
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,789
Somebody get a doctor!
Get a doctor now!

783
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,717
Quickly!

784
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,917
- I'm sorry I missed you.
- Where have you been?

785
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,951
What's the matter? What happened?

786
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,036
Thea was attacked by a shark.

787
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,991
Oh, my God.

788
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,918
The doctor said she should be OK.
She's in shock.

789
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,635
Sweetheart? Sweetheart?

790
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,592
I'm so sorry.
I should've known. Jesus.

791
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,511
Should've known what?

792
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,560
- We tried to keep track of him.
- Of...

793
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,477
The shark.

794
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,080
- You knew?
- Yeah. Thought it went away.

795
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,078
- Came after me.
- She could've been killed. You knew?

796
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,157
And you didn't tell us?
You let your mother think...

797
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,394
Where is she?

798
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,079
- How could you do that?
- Where's my mother?

799
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,588
- Where's my mother?
- Why didn't you tell us?

800
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,030
- Where's Jake?
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

801
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,757
Michael!

802
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,599
Jake!

803
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,074
- Jake!
- What?

804
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,475
Come on! I need you! Hurry up!

805
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,513
Hoagie! Did you see our boat?

806
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,393
- I just got here.
- My mother took it.

807
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,228
- I hope she's a good sailor.
- A shark attacked Thea.

808
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,271
She went after the damn thing.

809
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,670
- She's gone after it?
- Yeah, we gotta stop her.

810
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,474
In that?
Lt'll take all day in that bathtub.

811
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,555
Got a better idea?

812
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,838
I'll radio her position.

813
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,031
The rescue boats will pick her up,
so don't worry.

814
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,229
She'll be fine.

815
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,238
She'll never find that bloody shark.
We couldn't.

816
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,352
It'll find her.
What do you mean?

817
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,073
She said it was coming.

818
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,317
- What do you mean?
- What do you know?

819
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,636
She thinks the shark
that killed Martin and Sean

820
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,272
is following the family.

821
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,551
Hey, he's not talkin'
about our shark, eh?

822
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,478
What do you do when
you're not flying people?

823
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,393
I deliver laundry.

824
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,991
Hold on. What's that?
Let's have a look.

825
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,559
Oh.

826
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,709
It's a big ocean out there.

827
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,514
Can't this thing go any faster?

828
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,552
Any faster, this thing'll be
a flying Cuisinart

829
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,591
and we'll be diced into oblivion.

830
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,909
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch.

831
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,400
There she is.
That's her right there.

832
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,352
Is that what I think it is?

833
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,635
- Mom...
- Hold on!

834
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,592
Oh!

835
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,515
'Thomas, you there?
This is Zero-Papa-Alpha here.'

836
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,710
'Hoagie, where are you? '

837
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,072
12 miles southeast of Emerald Key.
Look for Neptune's Folly.'

838
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,435
I need two boats fast and somebody
who can kill a shark - a big one.

839
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,552
'What're you doing? '
Practising landing.

840
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,989
Hang on to your socks, lads.

841
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,600
Wait! You sure you know
how to do this?

842
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,189
Of course not!
What kind of pilot do you think I am?

843
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,637
- Christ!
- Hell, not half bad.

844
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,591
Get out, I'll keep it busy.

845
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,633
No, it'll come for the plane's
electromagnetic impulse.

846
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,240
Get the bloody hell out!

847
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,474
Michael!

848
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,798
Damn passengers! You're all the same.
Complain, complain...

849
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,353
Oh, shit!

850
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,755
Hoagie!

851
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,433
Hoagie! Hoagie!

852
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,352
Why'd you come out here?

853
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,072
Why'd you come out here?

854
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,270
- Why did you bring him?
- Mom, Mom!

855
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,118
- Why'd you take the boat?
- It kept coming!

856
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,516
- Didn't you realise?
- There was nothing else to do.

857
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,797
- You shouldn't have done it.
- I tried to tell you.

858
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,229
I tried.

859
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,638
Hey!
Give me a hand, for Christ's sake!

860
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,638
- Hoagie!
- How the hell did you do that, man?

861
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,478
- It wasn't easy, believe me.
- Get him up.

862
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,716
You all right, man?

863
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,991
- Oh! Bloody hell.
- Get it started!

864
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,998
- The breath on that thing!
- You are alive!

865
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,474
Let's get out of here,
Ellen Brody. Oh!

866
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,795
Good, this thing's still working.

867
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,155
That's your engine, pal.
I'll have a look.

868
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,955
Oh, shit, he's close, man.

869
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,117
- What is that sound?
- The shark's heartbeat.

870
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,869
Hoagie, try to finish.
Michael, gimme a hand, I got an idea.

871
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,833
We're taking water down here.
Ellen, start pumping here.

872
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,792
Ellen! Get the bilge pump!

873
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,231
Take the radio transmitter out
and hook it to the strobe.

874
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,716
- We gotta get the engine started!
- Just do it!

875
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,718
We're gonna feed that big boy
a meal he won't forget.

876
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,072
You better have something good going.
We've got a rotten hose.

877
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,396
There's a spare one.
What you wanna do with this?

878
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,468
I'm riggin' the receiver. We get it
inside that bastard and set it off.

879
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,479
I got it. We rig an antenna on this,
we can shock the hell out of him.

880
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,999
Right! You're learning.

881
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,759
He's getting closer!

882
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,430
They spend their lives looking for
food, they don't care what it is.

883
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,313
Maybe he's got indigestion.
He's eaten my plane!

884
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,396
It's not food he's after.

885
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,273
Michael, turn on your switch.
I need a test.

886
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,198
- Anybody tell you you're nuts?
- All the time.

887
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,198
If it responds
to external electrical impulse,

888
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,949
it might respond to one inside -
confuse him, drive him crazy.

889
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,639
OK, a test... Good.

890
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:33,189
You'd better get up here!
The heartbeat's stopped!

891
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,232
Shit.

892
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,795
Either he's gone
or your gear's crapped out again.

893
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:49,072
That's bull. My equipment
don't crap out. He'll be back.

894
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,793
Get me the boat hook.

895
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,436
Maybe he had a heart attack.
Humans are full of cholesterol.

896
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,550
- Give me that.
- Shit! Where is he?

897
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,512
Give me that line, Michael.
Right there.

898
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,993
There he is!

899
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,308
Ellen, try the engine.

900
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,949
Ellen! Try to start the engine!

901
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,592
Son of a bitch.
Let's get out of here.

902
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,679
No, it's too late, Hoagie.
Give me a hard port.

903
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,438
Right!

904
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:32,156
Here, give me that.
No! No time for that!

905
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,158
Jake! You can't go out there
without a line!

906
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,519
Keep it steady.
It's gonna come back!

907
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,317
Damn thing's disappeared. He's gone!

908
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,789
Jake!

909
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,951
We're taking too much water.
It'll stop the engine.

910
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,037
Ellen, take the wheel.
We've got to outrun it. Ellen!

911
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,115
- That thing gonna work?
- It'll work.

912
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,436
If Jake says so, it will.
This charge will drive it crazy.

913
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,872
Sweet Jesus,
we're headed straight for it!

914
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,309
Ellen, come about!

915
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,715
We're gonna hit it!
Hold on!

916
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,239
Hold on!

917
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,595
Smile, you son of a bitch!

918
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,189
- Michael!
- Come over here.

919
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,639
Michael!

920
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,319
It's all right! I'm OK!

921
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,477
Anybody there? Over here!

922
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,908
Jake!

923
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,079
Michael, you got a minute?

924
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,554
It's Jake!

925
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,276
Son of a bitch!

926
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,591
Jesus, Jake.

927
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,715
What took you so damn long, man?

928
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,149
What the hell are you doing alive?

929
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,909
I told you Uncle Jake's
equipment don't crap out, eh?

930
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,519
You're not going to do something
stupid like die on me, are you?

931
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,075
No, man. I'm way too mean for that.

932
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,032
So from now on,
we're going to study snails, eh?

933
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,672
Yeah.

934
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,589
Come to Amity this summer.

935
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,712
We'll be there.
You make sure they come.

936
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,354
I will.
I'll miss you, Grandma.

937
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,952
Get in, Ellen Brody.
You'll miss your plane.

938
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,468
- Goodbye, Grandma!
- OK.

939
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,835
- Be careful.
- OK. See ya.

940
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,275
- Take good care of Jake.
- I will.

941
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,280
You gonna be OK?

942
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,312
- Yeah.
- OK.

943
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,749
When I come back,
remind me to tell you about the time

944
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,030
I took a hundred nuns to Nairobi.

945
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,149
There they were,
100 nuns, playing guitars

946
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,113
and singing, "The hills are alive
with the sound of music."

947
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:37,789
Then suddenly,
one comes up to me and she says,

948
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,798
"There's smoke coming
from the engine."

949
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,593
But I never
took them seriously,

950
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,712
until they all started singing
"Nearer My God to Thee."

951
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:57,712
