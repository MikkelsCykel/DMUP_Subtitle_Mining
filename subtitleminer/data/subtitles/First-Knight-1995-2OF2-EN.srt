1
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:36,511
Taken? Taken where?

2
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:40,462
A boat, sire. From the north gate
into the forest.

3
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:45,105
l have scouts and dogs out already.
Give me a battalion of guards.

4
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:49,586
- Give me the men.
- No, that압 exactly what he wants.

5
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:53,747
- Take one brigade, now!
- Sire.

6
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:02,348
He앏l not harm her. sire.
She압 too vaIuable.

7
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:08,862
- He앏l try to trade her first.
- That압 what l앐 afraid of.

8
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:15,670
l앇 give my life for her.
But what if he asks for more?

9
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:59,585
Welcome to my palace ... My Lady.

10
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:12,903
l think we can release the lady
from her bonds.

11
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:18,229
lf she so wishes.

12
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:34,346
What압 this?
Your dress is torn. Ralph ...

13
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:39,269
l gave orders that the lady
was not to be harmed.

14
00:04:56,954 --> 00:05:00,742
Your dress is quite spoiled.

15
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,144
You ...

16
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:06,306
... almost ...

17
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:10,590
... a queen.

18
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:16,667
RaIph. Did you do this?

19
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:20,952
- Yes, My Prince.
- You see?

20
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:24,345
This is
what Arthur doesn앖 understand.

21
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:29,224
Men don앖 want brotherhood.
they want leadership.

22
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:41,070
Shall we?

23
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,711
This was once
the greatest castle ever built.

24
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:55,583
Now grass grows in the halls
where kings once feasted, -

25
00:05:55,754 --> 00:06:01,624
- and peasants cart away the walls
to make shelters for their pigs.

26
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,104
- Such is glory.
- What do you mean to do with me?

27
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:08,152
Keep you
till Arthur becomes reasonable.

28
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:13,149
He won앖 trade Leonesse for my life.
l앇 rather die. Arthur knows that.

29
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:16,545
Self-sacrifice is very easy.

30
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:22,710
But sacrificing someone you love
puts your convictions to the test.

31
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:28,665
l앐 sure Arthur will come round
to the merits of compromise.

32
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:53,552
This is called an oubliette.

33
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:58,310
That압 French
for a place of forgetting.

34
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:05,953
Your quarters, My Lady.
No gates, no bars, no locks.

35
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:11,186
Just walls of air.

36
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,065
You can come out!

37
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:13,829
l앐 unarmed and alone!

38
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:57,265
- Who are you?
- A messenger from the King.

39
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:02,871
- He came alone?
- Yes, My Prince.

40
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:10,513
- What is your message?
- ls Lady Guinevere unharmed?

41
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:14,428
She압 unharmed. l give you my word.

42
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:19,427
- l need to see it with my own eyes.
- My word isn앖 good enough?

43
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:24,270
l앐 a common man.
l don앖 have much use for words.

44
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:38,188
He does have a message.
Take him to the pit, then bring him back Here.

45
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:40,065
give me a chance to finish my food.

46
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:03,236
- You았e seen her. Let압 go.
- No.

47
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:09,716
- l still have a message to deliver.
- AlI right. We앏l drag you back.

48
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:31,236
Jump on! Jump!

49
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:49,513
Come on! Jump!

50
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:08,398
lf the water can get out,
so can we. Come on.

51
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:48,199
No! Hold on!

52
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,519
Shoot!

53
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,353
Why have we stopped?

54
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:28,437
- l앐 tired.
- Never.

55
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:31,959
You battle in your dreams.

56
00:13:55,203 --> 00:14:00,152
- What are you doing?
- You앏l see.

57
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:11,873
Now. drink.

58
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:20,763
Again.

59
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:37,355
- Where did you learn to do that?
- l lived most of my life outdoors.

60
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:42,713
Don앖 you have a home?

61
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:48,241
No. l don앖 have a home.
Not for a long time.

62
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:52,601
- That must be hard.
- Why must it be?

63
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:57,757
I앐 my own master.
l go where l please.

64
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:04,033
Why build a house
for the warlords to burn?

65
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,991
ls that how it happened?

66
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:15,679
God save you from such a day.

67
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:20,315
How old were you?

68
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,243
Mother!

69
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:35,193
Father!

70
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:52,872
lt was long ago.

71
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:05,319
- God save us all from such a day.
- He didn앖 save me.

72
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:10,437
- Ah. but he did.
- For what?

73
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,800
lt압 made you who you are.

74
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:17,592
A man who fears nothing and no one.

75
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:22,837
You can use that gift.
lf not, you might as welI have died.

76
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:27,155
You don앖 know how many times
l았e wished for that.

77
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,872
But you didn앖 die. You lived.

78
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:39,312
- Tell me what to do.
- Your life is your own.

79
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:42,759
l give it to you.

80
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:48,277
You forget l앐 to be married.

81
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:55,959
lf you could freely do as you
pleased, would you marry Arthur?

82
00:16:56,123 --> 00:17:00,355
- l am free. As free as you are.
- Prove it.

83
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:05,074
- How?
- Forget who you are.

84
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:10,556
Let all the world go away ...
and all the people in it, but us.

85
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:15,759
Do what you want to do.

86
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:20,598
Here. Now.

87
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:52,154
There she is!

88
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:35,519
Thank you, God.

89
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:24,036
Thank you.

90
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:40,480
Thank you. You can go.
You must have better things to do.

91
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:46,832
You have given me back my life.
l can at least give you your shirt.

92
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:51,155
- Tell me what you want. lt압 yours.
- l did what any man would do.

93
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:57,842
You risked your life for another.
There is no greater love.

94
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:04,359
You have deceived me.
But now ... l know the truth.

95
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:11,912
You care nothing for yourself.
No wealth, no home, no goal, -

96
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:16,281
-just the passionate spirit
that drives you on.

97
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:20,231
God uses people like you.

98
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:26,876
Because your heart is open,
you give all of yourself.

99
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:32,156
lf you knew me better,
you wouldn앖 say such things.

100
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:35,918
l take the good with the bad.

101
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:41,521
I can앖 love people in slices.
Now, no more protests.

102
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:45,232
Let me thank you in my own way.

103
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:56,394
They are welcoming you back.

104
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:05,277
We owe Lady Guinevere압 life
to one man.

105
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:10,962
Lancelot.

106
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:24,594
l believe he comes to Camelot
for a purpose, -

107
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:29,632
- even though
he doesn앖 know it himself.

108
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:35,241
What l앐 about to offer this man
is already his.

109
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:38,554
One seat stands empty.

110
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:45,598
- You앇 make him a knight, sire?
- l offer no life of priviIege.

111
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:51,793
lt압 a life of service.
lf you want it, it압 yours.

112
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:55,956
- We don앖 know anything about him.
- Perhaps we should discuss ...

113
00:21:56,123 --> 00:22:01,356
Enough! What do you say?
Will you join us?

114
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:04,401
My Lord, if l may speak?

115
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:10,714
l owe this man
more than anyone here.

116
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:14,353
He deserves any honour
you can give him.

117
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:20,200
But he doesn앖 belong in Camelot.
He압 a man who goes his way alone.

118
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:24,754
ln that freedom and solitude
is his strength.

119
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:30,679
lf you wish to honour him,
as l do, with alI my heart, -

120
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:34,119
- Iet압 honour him as he is.

121
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:42,471
Let him go, alone and free ...
and with our love.

122
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:48,921
Well ... Lancelot?

123
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:58,273
Lady Guinevere understands me well.

124
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,640
But here, among you, -

125
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:08,515
- l have found something
that l want more than freedom.

126
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:14,274
lt would break my heart
to leave you.

127
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,799
Bravo! Then you앏l join us?

128
00:23:18,883 --> 00:23:21,955
- Yes.
- Welcome.

129
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:26,435
This is only the beginning.
Go pass this night in prayer, -

130
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:32,041
- for tomorrow you앏l be born again,
into a new life.

131
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:58,152
- Why?
- You know why.

132
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:01,554
- Please leave Camelot.
- l want to be where you are.

133
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:06,843
You must not say such things to me.
Say nothing.

134
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:17,315
l will leave Camelot now.
if you come with me.

135
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:21,999
- No.
- Then tell me you don앖 love me.

136
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:30,591
l don앖 love you.

137
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:47,193
Arise. Sir Lancelot.

138
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:56,112
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death.

139
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:05,002
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death.

140
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:25,313
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death ...

141
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:32,880
l swear to love and serve Guinevere.
my true and rightful queen.

142
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:39,754
l swear to love and serve Guinevere.
and to protect her honour as my own.

143
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:46,762
Jacob ...

144
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:52,077
Forgive me, milady.
Black Malagant has taken Leonesse.

145
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:42,120
Leonesse ...

146
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:45,434
The gates are open.

147
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:50,918
- Make camp for the night.
- Where. sire?

148
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,232
There.

149
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:58,521
lt압 too exposed. sire.
We could never possibly defend it.

150
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:01,641
Sire.

151
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,435
Theyre not here.

152
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:09,881
There압 no one here!

153
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:20,441
Draw!

154
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:23,640
Loose!

155
00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:47,000
Charge!

156
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:06,433

- First battalion regrouped, sire.

162
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:51,759
- Theyre running. Do we follow?
- No. Let them go.

163
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:55,074
On to Leonesse!

164
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,997
Well done.

Your sword ... Sir Lancelot.

166
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,553
No!

167
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:50,361
No!

168
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:29,153
- Come out.
- Theyre alive.

169
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:38,517
Youre safe. Don앖 be afraid.

170
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:49,800
Were glad youre safe.

171
00:38:55,442 --> 00:38:58,434
There압 a step. Be careful.

172
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:21,717
God bless you, sir.

173
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:32,794
l앐 so old now ...

174
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:38,751
Can l go home now?

175
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:42,358
Can l go home now?

176
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:47,312
Yes.
Yes, you can go home now.

177
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:59,719
Bless you, milady.

178
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:49,279
Elise ...

179
00:41:05,842 --> 00:41:10,074
l았e come to say goodbye,
and wish you well.

180
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:16,633
lt압 been a long night.
You았e not slept.

181
00:41:19,282 --> 00:41:24,675
- Where will you go?
- Wherever the road leads.

182
00:41:26,162 --> 00:41:29,632
When shall we see you again?

183
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:35,201
l don앖 think l앏l be coming back.

184
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:40,000
Never?

185
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,472
Never.

186
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,079
I know what l must do now.

187
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:57,158
l never believed in anything before.
But l do believe in Camelot.

188
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:02,833
And l will serve it best by leaving.

189
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:10,678
Tell the King, l앏l always remember
that he saw the best in me.

190
00:42:12,682 --> 00:42:15,674
And what shall l tell myself?

191
00:42:17,282 --> 00:42:23,118
There was once a man who loved you
too much to change you.

192
00:42:24,882 --> 00:42:28,477
l앏l not forget him.

193
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:36,118
l sheltered under a tree
with him once ... in the rain.

194
00:42:47,362 --> 00:42:50,638
Lancelot ...

195
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:01,593
- My Queen.
- l owe you a kiss.

196
00:43:06,482 --> 00:43:09,679
l앐 asking you.

197
00:44:40,882 --> 00:44:45,034
Why?

198
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:49,353
Why?

199
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:04,995
The King asks for you, milady.

200
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:26,794
l ask you not to lie to me,
even if you think you앏l hurt me.

201
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:32,116
- Have you given yourself to him?
- No, My Lord.

202
00:45:37,162 --> 00:45:40,393
Do you love him?

203
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,433
Yes.

204
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:04,439
- How did l fail you?
- You았e never failed me, My Lord.

205
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:08,800
l saw your face as you kissed him.

206
00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:14,753
Love has many faces. l look on you
differentIy, but not with less love.

207
00:46:17,282 --> 00:46:20,638
When a woman loves tWo men.
she must choose betWeen them.

208
00:46:20,802 --> 00:46:25,956
- l choose you.
- Your will chooses me.

209
00:46:26,122 --> 00:46:31,913
- Your heart chooses him.
- My will is stronger than my heart.

210
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:38,351
Do you think l put so high a price
on my feelings? They앏I pass.

211
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:41,912
My will holds me
to my course through life.

212
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:47,156
As mine does me, and yet,
all l have to do is look at you -

213
00:46:47,322 --> 00:46:51,713
- and everything l ever believed in
fades to nothing.

214
00:46:52,682 --> 00:46:57,358
- All l want is your love.
- You have it.

215
00:46:58,522 --> 00:47:04,961
Do l? Then look on me
as you looked on him.

216
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:18,117
l gave one moment to Lancelot.

217
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:24,840
Yes, youre innocent.
But you love him!

218
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:31,876
Any more of this innocence
and l앏l go mad.

219
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:38,952
- l앏l do whatever you tell me to.
- l don앖 know what to think.

220
00:47:40,522 --> 00:47:44,037
l no longer see my way ahead.

221
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:54,399
Only fools dream of the one thing
they can앖 have.

222
00:47:56,802 --> 00:48:00,272
Forgive me.

223
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:05,151
What압 to forgive?

224
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:08,712
l dreamed the dream of you.

225
00:48:12,842 --> 00:48:16,232
lt was a sweet dream ...

226
00:48:17,922 --> 00:48:21,551
... while it lasted.

227
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:46,271
- Unlock the door.
- Sire.

228
00:48:51,522 --> 00:48:55,561
- My Lord?
- l앏l ask the questions.

229
00:48:58,842 --> 00:49:03,120
Did you come to Camelot
to betray me?

230
00:49:03,282 --> 00:49:08,356
- No, My Lord.
- You desired her. You pursued her.

231
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:11,912
- The Queen is innocent.
- lnnocent?

232
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:16,872
l saw her in your arms.
l trusted you, and you betrayed me.

233
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:22,639
- l never meant to hurt you.
- You leave me nothing! Nothing!

234
00:49:27,722 --> 00:49:32,750
You will be charged with treason.
Defend yourself in court.

235
00:49:32,922 --> 00:49:36,517
The law will judge you!

236
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:52,395
May God grant us the wisdom
to discover the right, -

237
00:49:52,562 --> 00:49:56,032
- and the strength
to make it endure.

238
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,955
Amen.

239
00:50:00,282 --> 00:50:05,310
l was mistaken in Lancelot.
As a man, l may forgive ...

240
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:08,872
As a king, l must see justice done.

241
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:13,593
There will be a trial tomorrow.
in the great square.

242
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:19,758
- ln the great square?
- Let압 settle the matter privately.

243
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:23,835
You think the honour of Camelot
is a private matter?

244
00:50:24,002 --> 00:50:27,756
Am l to hide in dark corners
as if l앐 ashamed?

245
00:50:27,922 --> 00:50:31,232
Open the gates.
l want everyone there.

246
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:38,001
Let every citizen see
that the law rules in Camelot.

247
00:50:41,082 --> 00:50:42,202
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse,
Queen of Camelot. -

248
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:45,558
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse,
Queen of Camelot. -

249
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:48,919
- and Lancelot.
Knight of the High Council, -

250
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:54,793
- are charged in their own persons,
and in collusion. -

251
00:50:54,962 --> 00:51:01,754
- with dishonour to the realm.
and violation of the King압 rights.

252
00:51:03,482 --> 00:51:07,873
These crimes constitute
an act of treason against Camelot, -

253
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:11,671
- and the penalty under law
is death.

254
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:22,953
- Sir Lancelot may speak.
- My words are for the King alone.

255
00:51:40,522 --> 00:51:45,960
My Lord.
The Queen is innocent.

256
00:51:47,962 --> 00:51:52,831
But if my life, or my death, -

257
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:58,030
- serves Camelot. Take it.

258
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,239
Do what you like with me.

259
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:16,113
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death.

260
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:49,515
ls it the King압 wish
that the Queen be questioned?

261
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:56,352
May God forgive me.

262
00:53:01,602 --> 00:53:05,720
Is it the King압 wish
that the Queen be questioned?

263
00:53:08,562 --> 00:53:12,441
- Who goes there?
- Who goes there?

264
00:53:12,602 --> 00:53:15,196
Guards!

265
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,956
Close the gates!

266
00:53:52,402 --> 00:53:55,394
Nobody move or Arthur dies!

267
00:53:55,562 --> 00:53:58,872
My men control the city gates.

268
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:03,877
On every roof,
l have men with burning torches!

269
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:08,558
l have only to lift my arm,
and your golden city burns to ashes.

270
00:54:08,722 --> 00:54:14,957
l am the law now!
You obeyed Arthur. Now, obey me.

271
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:19,039
My people are unarmed, Malagant.

272
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:23,480
lf it압 me you want,
here l am.

273
00:54:25,522 --> 00:54:31,791
Look at him! Look at the great
King Arthur of Camelot.

274
00:54:31,962 --> 00:54:34,874
He압 a man waking up from a dream.

275
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:40,435
The strong rule the weak!
That압 how your God made the world.

276
00:54:40,602 --> 00:54:45,835
He makes us strong only for a while,
so we can help each other.

277
00:54:46,002 --> 00:54:51,360
My God makes me strong
so I can live my life!

278
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:56,994
Arthur says, 얎Serve one another.얎
When will you live your own lives?

279
00:54:58,002 --> 00:55:03,076
This is the freedom l bring you!
Freedom from his tyrannical dream!

280
00:55:03,242 --> 00:55:08,521
Freedom from his tyrannical law!
Freedom from his tyrannical God!

281
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:15,756

to see you kneel before me here.

Kneel before me. or die.

283
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:32,836
Too proud, Arthur? Do you think
you serve your people better dead?

284
00:55:39,562 --> 00:55:43,919
l have no pride left in me.

285
00:55:53,122 --> 00:55:57,593
What l do now.
l do for my people, and for Camelot.

286
00:55:57,762 --> 00:56:01,232
And may they forgive me.

287
00:56:01,402 --> 00:56:06,715
This is my last act as your king.

288
00:56:06,882 --> 00:56:10,591
Do not be afraid.

289
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:16,759
All things change.

290
00:56:22,842 --> 00:56:27,393
