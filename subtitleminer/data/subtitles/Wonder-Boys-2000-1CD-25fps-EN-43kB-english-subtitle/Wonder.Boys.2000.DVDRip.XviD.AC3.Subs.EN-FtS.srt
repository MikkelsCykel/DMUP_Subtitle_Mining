1
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:41,062
A worried man
with a worried mind

2
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,221
No one in front of me
and nothing behind

3
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:47,021
There's a woman on my lap
and she's

4
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:48,940
Drinkin' champagne

5
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,500
Got white skin
got assassin's eyes

6
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,699
I'm looking up into
the sapphire-tinted skies

7
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:00,779
I'm well-dressed

8
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,818
Waitin' on the last train

9
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:10,658
Standing on the gallows
with my head in the noose

10
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:18,536
Any minute now I'm expecting
all hell to break loose

11
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:24,336
People are crazy
and times are strange

12
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,975
I'm locked in tight
I'm out of range

13
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,775
I used to care but

14
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:33,134
Things have changed

15
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,170
"The young girl...

16
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,090
sat perfectly
still in the confessional...

17
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,770
Listening to her father's boots
scrape like chalk...

18
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,929
on the ancient steps
of the church...

19
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,329
then grow faint,
then disappear altogether.

20
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,809
She could sense the priest
beyond the grate-"

21
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,008
On that
particular Friday afternoon...

22
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,488
Last February...

23
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:22,448
I was reading a story to
my advanced writer's workshop...

24
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:25,447
by one James Leer,
junior Lit major...

25
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:28,647
and sole inhabitant
of his own gloomy gulag.

26
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,807
"She bit the flesh of her lip...

27
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:33,446
closed her eyes, mute."

28
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,565
James' stories were
about as sunny as his disposition.

29
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,725
I was distracted.

30
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,765
Maybe it had something to do
with the fact...

31
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,764
that my wife
had left me that morning.

32
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:49,524
So. Anyone?

33
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,844
Maybe not.
Wives had left me before.

34
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:55,363
- Carrie.
- As usual, James' classmates...

35
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,563
aware of a writer's
inherent vulnerability...

36
00:02:57,643 --> 00:03:01,402
offered their sensitive,
gentle opinions.

37
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,282
I mean, Jesus,
what is it with you Catholics?

38
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:07,322
All right. All right.

39
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,721
Let's try to be
constructive here, shall we?

40
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:13,241
Howard, what about you?

41
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:15,161
I hated it.

42
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:17,360
His stories make me
want to kill myself.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
That's not exactly what I meant
by being constructive, Howard.

44
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,119
Yes, Hannah?

45
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,079
I think maybe we're
missing the point.

46
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,638
Hannah Green.

47
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,918
A talented writer who
rented a room in my house.

48
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,998
I knew her to be
insightful, kind...

49
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:39,997
and compulsively clad
in red cowboy boots.

50
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:42,517
I had, in fact, never once
seen her without them.

51
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,796
He respects us enough to forget us,
and... that takes courage.

52
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:50,636
Well put, Hannah. And a good note
to end on, I think.

53
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:54,195
Oh, don't forget about
WordFest this weekend.

54
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,835
And those of you who are
driving V.I.P.s...

55
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,235
to the
cocktail party this evening...

56
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,355
should have them
at the chancellor's house...

57
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:00,954
no later than 5:30.

58
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,714
Thank you for that.
Is he all right?

59
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:12,673
I think so.
How about you?

60
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,793
Me? Yeah. Why?

61
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,872
Just checking.

62
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:25,151
Turn off the light, please.

63
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,070
It felt good to be in the car.

64
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,829
Alone.
Where I could clear my head.

65
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,908
Tonight was
the opening of WordFest...

66
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,428
the university's annual
three-day "gabathon"...

67
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:49,308
for writers and wanna-bes.

68
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:53,067
My editor, Terry Crabtree,
was flying in for the event.

69
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:56,947
He alone had championed my
last novel, Arsonist's Daughter...

70
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:59,626
and its critical success
had put us both on the map.

71
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,786
But that was seven years ago...

72
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,666
and I still hadn't
finished my follow-up.

73
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:07,105
I knew Terry didn't give
a rat's ass about WordFest.

74
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:10,265
He was coming to town to get
a look at my long-overdue book.

75
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,664
I had to keep him at bay.

76
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,464
- Ah, Tripp.
- Crabtree, how are you, my friend?

77
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,503
- It's good to see you, Tripp.
- Let me help you with this.

78
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,703
Say hello to my new friend.

79
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,983
- Miss Antonia-
- Sloviak.

80
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,822
Nice to meet you.
This way.

81
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,262
I took the liberty of inviting
Antonia to tonight's festivities.

82
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:34,742
The more the merrier.

83
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,781
Terry was telling me
about you on the plane.

84
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,221
It was all so interesting.

85
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:40,181
I was just explaining how
a book comes to be published...

86
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,421
what you do as a writer,
what I do as an editor.

87
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:46,500
I sweat blood for five years,
and he corrects my spelling.

88
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,060
- That's exactly what he said.
- We know each other pretty well.

89
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,379
And actually,
it's seven years.

90
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,819
You know how many times I've
boarded an airplane just praying...

91
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,978
that some gal like her would be
sitting down beside me?

92
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:01,098
- She's a transvestite.
- You're stoned.

93
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:04,338
- She's still a transvestite.
- So, how's the book?

94
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,737
Uh, it's fine.
It's done.

95
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:11,457
Basically. I got a little tinkering
I've still got to do.

96
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,777
Great!

97
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:15,016
I was hoping I could get a look
at it sometime over the weekend.

98
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,656
It's gonna be a little tough. I'm
at a critical juncture right now.

99
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,816
I thought you were
just tinkering.

100
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:23,335
W- Well, I am, but I have little
details I've got to work on.

101
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,415
I'm not gonna pressure you.
I just got off the plane.

102
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:27,774
I mean, I get pressure.
You know? I get-

103
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:30,734
Know what I mean?

104
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:34,494
What the hell in the hootenanny
do you suppose that would be?

105
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:37,053
That would be a tuba.

106
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:43,452
You didn't actually
purchase this car, did you?

107
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:46,692
No, I got it from Jerry Nathan.
He owed me some money.

108
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,692
Ah! He owes God money.

109
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:51,171
Including my commission
on that faux novel of his.

110
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,651
That perfume you're wearing,
Antonia...

111
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,531
that wouldn't happen
to be Cristalle, would it?

112
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,811
Um, uh, yes, it is.

113
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:59,650
- How did you know?
- Lucky guess.

114
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,690
The WordFest kickoff party...

115
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,689
was always held at
Sara and Walter Gaskell's house.

116
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,489
She was the chancellor, which
meant she oversaw the university.

117
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,409
Her husband, Dr. Gaskell...

118
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:13,328
was the chairman
of the English Department...

119
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,808
which meant he oversaw me.

120
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,607
Isn't that a nice greenhouse?

121
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:24,087
It's Mrs. Gaskell's.
It's her hobby.

122
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,047
I thought you were
Mrs. Gaskell's hobby.

123
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,966
Piss off, will you, Crabs?
I lost a wife today.

124
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:34,085
You'll find another. She'll be
young, beautiful. They always are.

125
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,085
Oh, hello, everyone.
Terry, good to see you again.

126
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:44,124
Chancellor.
Don't you look ravishing.

127
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:49,203
- Oh, oh. Easy.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

128
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:50,203
It's these goddamn shoes.

129
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,123
I don't know how anyone
can walk in these things.

130
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:55,003
Practice.

131
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,162
- I don't believe we've met.
- Antonia Sloviak.

132
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,802
Poe.

133
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:03,322
Poe! Poe!

134
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:05,241
Poe, stop! Poe!

135
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:07,321
That wouldn't be
Walter's dog, would it?

136
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,361
- Poe!
- Who's he barking at now?

137
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,760
He's still barking at me.
He's blind.

138
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,160
Stop this.

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,080
Honestly.

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,279
Excuse me, I need to talk to you
for a second, Chancellor.

141
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,439
I need to talk to you too.

142
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,679
Maybe you could help me take these
coats to the upstairs guest room.

143
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,798
I'd be happy to if I knew where
the upstairs guest room was.

144
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:28,238
I could show you.

145
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,958
Terry.

146
00:08:30,998 --> 00:08:33,437
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
We'll make ourselves at home.

147
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,757
We'll let Poe show us around.
Thanks.

148
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,956
That's new, isn't it?

149
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,475
Yeah, Walter just
got it back from the framer.

150
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:52,915
You first.

151
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:56,714
- This morning-
- I'm pregnant.

152
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:04,273
I'm sure.

153
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:13,592
Well, that's-
That's very surprising.

154
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:18,511
Does Walter know that, uh-

155
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,911
I think Walter would find this
a little more than surprising.

156
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,149
Emily left me this morning.

157
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,229
She's left before.

158
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,628
She's left the room before,
but she's always come back.

159
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,108
So.

160
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,587
I guess we just divorce
our spouses, marry each other...

161
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:52,147
and have this baby, right?

162
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:54,067
Simple.

163
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,346
Yeah, right. Simple.

164
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,625
Is that Cristalle?

165
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,065
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, God.

166
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:10,504
I wear the same scent
as a transvestite.

167
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:12,464
She is a transvestite,
isn't she?

168
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:15,064
If she's not now,
Terry'll make sure she is...

169
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:17,023
by the end of the evening.

170
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:19,663
Has he asked you
about the book yet?

171
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,623
Yes.

172
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:23,583
And?

173
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:27,622
Are you gonna tell him?

174
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:32,661
No. Maybe. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

175
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:35,341
Me either.

176
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,261
DiMaggio's record...

177
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,180
for hits in consecutive games...

178
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,380
is probably the most impressive
feat in all of sports...

179
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,380
and in my opinion,
will never be broken.

180
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,179
- Come here, big guy.
- His condition's so sad.

181
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,419
Yes, but even blind,
he still gets around.

182
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,899
I don't drink normally...

183
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:55,418
but this was turning out to be
one fucked-up day.

184
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:59,578
And now I found myself in close
proximity to Sara's husband...

185
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,057
and his dog, Poe.

186
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,577
- Walter, I see you've met my friend.
- Oh, yes. She's charming.

187
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,977
Despite his much-vaunted
Harvard education...

188
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:10,616
Dr. Walter Gaskell didn't have
a clue about his wife and me.

189
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:13,376
Simply put, Di Maggio represented-
metaphorically speaking, of course-

190
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,295
the husband as slugger.

191
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:17,735
Poe had been
on to me since day one.

192
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,215
In fact, I personally believe...

193
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:24,614
that every woman in some way
desires to be Marilyn Monroe.

194
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:27,014
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

195
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:30,213
I've had a lot
of successes over the years.

196
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:33,533
Q. Q was rich.

197
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,493
Q was famous.

198
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,212
Q completed a novel
every 18 months.

199
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:40,132
I hated him.

200
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:42,372
...finest work vanished
in less than five.

201
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:45,091
So I find myself conflicted.

202
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,531
Ask him if he's conflicted
about his house in the Hamptons.

203
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:51,491
- Grady.
- Well, Professor.

204
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:52,770
Q. for your information...

205
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,650
Hannah already has
two stories published...

206
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,930
in The Paris Review, so you
better dust off your "A" material.

207
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,089
You didn't tell me
you were a writer.

208
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:03,569
You didn't ask.

209
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,529
How did you feel
about the adaptation?

210
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,488
I thought it was more literary
than cinematic.

211
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:08,728
Grady.

212
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:11,008
Douglas Triddley, Amherst.

213
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:12,208
I've had Arsonist's Daughter...

214
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:14,647
on my graduate-studies syllabus
three years running.

215
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:17,047
No wonder it's still in print.

216
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:20,407
Long time since
Arsonist's Daughter.

217
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,564
There you are.

218
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:45,843
I could have sworn I had a bottle
of 1975 Lafite Rothschild for Q.

219
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,803
Given that he's going to be
addressing 500 people...

220
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,283
in less than an hour-

221
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,962
- You want to keep Q happy.
- If he's happy, I'm happy.

222
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,159
James?

223
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,798
It's fake.
It was my mother's.

224
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:23,678
She won it in a penny arcade
in Baltimore...

225
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,678
when she went
to Catholic school.

226
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:29,437
Well, that's very convincing.

227
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,157
I used to shoot
these little paper caps...

228
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:34,557
but they don't make them anymore,
the caps.

229
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:38,156
It's just for good luck, you know?
Some people carry rabbit's feet.

230
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,596
You carry firearms.

231
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:46,235
No, thank you. I don't like
to lose control of my emotions.

232
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:50,714
I'm not supposed to be here,
in case you're wondering.

233
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:53,434
But the other night I was out
with Hannah at the movies...

234
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:57,833
and she asked me since she was
coming, so I ended up coming too.

235
00:13:57,913 --> 00:13:59,993
You and, uh, Hannah,
you're seeing each other?

236
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,913
- No! What gave you that idea?
- James, relax.

237
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,272
I'm not her father.
I just rent her a room.

238
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,152
She likes old movies like I do,
that's all.

239
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:10,872
- What's the movie you guys saw?
- Son of Fury...

240
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:13,231
with Tyrone Power
and Frances Farmer.

241
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,871
She went crazy,
Frances Farmer.

242
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:19,311
So did Gene Tierney.
She's in it too.

243
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,710
- Sounds like a good one.
- It wasn't bad.

244
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,149
You're not like
my other teachers, Prof. Tripp.

245
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,189
You're not like
my other students, James.

246
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,589
Look, James...

247
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:37,108
about this afternoon
in workshop, I'm sorry.

248
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,388
I think I let things
get a little out of hand.

249
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:40,388
They really hated it.

250
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:42,867
I think they hated it more
than any of the other ones.

251
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:44,547
- Well-
- Doesn't matter.

252
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,707
It only took me
an hour to write.

253
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:50,066
Really? That's remarkable.

254
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,506
I have trouble sleeping.

255
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,585
While I'm lying in bed,
I figure them out, the stories.

256
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:02,225
- You cold, James?
- Oh, a little.

257
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,624
Why don't we go inside?

258
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:06,544
It's colder in there.

259
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:09,504
I guess you're right.

260
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:12,503
Actually, I saw the greenhouse.

261
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,783
I thought I'd come outside and take
a look at it. It looks like heaven.

262
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:20,382
- Looks like heaven?
- I saw a movie once.

263
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,222
Part of it took place in heaven.
Everyone wore white.

264
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,701
Lived in crystal houses
like that.

265
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:30,141
I really should be going.

266
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:35,340
- Good-bye, Prof. Tripp.
- Hey, James.

267
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,780
James, don't go. No.

268
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,940
There's something
I want you to see.

269
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:45,139
- I'll miss my bus.
- It's worth it.

270
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,099
Trust me.

271
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,458
Let me help you with that.

272
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,977
Thank you, dear.
Thank you.

273
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:58,657
Come on.

274
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:04,336
Hey, you two.
James, are you riding with me?

275
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,896
- No, I'm going home-
- No, he's going with me.

276
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:11,015
Why don't you take Crabtree
and his friend? All right?

277
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:13,655
- All right.
- Where are they anyway?

278
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,975
Here we are.

279
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:19,854
Hmm. Well, hello there.

280
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:23,574
James, this is my editor,
Terry Crabtree.

281
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:24,614
James.

282
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,293
James'll know
about George Sanders.

283
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:28,493
- George Sanders?
- Mr. Crabtree was saying...

284
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:31,453
how George Sanders killed himself,
only he couldn't remember how.

285
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:35,772
Pills. April 25, 1972,
in a Costa Brava hotel room.

286
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:37,932
- How comprehensive of you.
- James is amazing.

287
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:41,451
He knows all the movie suicides.
Go ahead, James. Tell him.

288
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:44,051
- There are so many.
- Well, just a few. The big ones.

289
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:48,890
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72,
also pills.

290
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,330
Donald "Red" Barry,
shot himself in 1980.

291
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,570
Charles Boyer,
1978, pills again.

292
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,489
Charles Butterworth, 1946,
I think. In a car.

293
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:01,329
Supposedly, it was an accident,
but, you know, he was distraught.

294
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:05,528
Dorothy Dandridge, pills, 1965.
Albert Dekker, 1968.

295
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:06,528
He hung himself.

296
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,488
He wrote his suicide note
in lipstick on his stomach.

297
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,967
William Inge,
carbon monoxide, 1973.

298
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:13,287
Carole Landis, pills again.
I forget when.

299
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,127
George Reeves,
"Superman" on TV, shot himself.

300
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,966
Jean Seberg, pills,
of course, 1979.

301
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:22,046
Everett Sloane-
he was good-pills.

302
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:24,845
Margaret Sulla van, pills.
Lupe Velez, a lot of pills.

303
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:27,685
Gig Young, he shot himself
and his wife in 1978.

304
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:29,365
There are tons more.

305
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:32,124
- I haven't heard of half of them.
- You did them alphabetically.

306
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:34,124
It's just how my bra in works,
I guess.

307
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:35,284
Fascinating.

308
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:36,964
Come out with us
after the lecture.

309
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:38,963
There's this place
I always get Tripp to take me.

310
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:41,443
- Actually, I just want to go home.
- Don't be silly.

311
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:44,083
No one your age
just wants to go home.

312
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,762
Besides, faculty will be present.
Just consider it a field trip.

313
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,399
Is that really it?

314
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,919
That's really it.

315
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,518
The one she wore
on her wedding day.

316
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,638
So I'm told.

317
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,677
- Go ahead.
- Really?

318
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,597
Really.

319
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,035
She was small.

320
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:42,115
Most people don't know that.

321
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:46,514
The shoulders
are so small.

322
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,194
It looks so perfect.

323
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:56,513
I bet it's the only time
she wore it.

324
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,433
That day.

325
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:02,832
She must have felt so happy.

326
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:10,671
- Must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
- I guess.

327
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:13,031
He also never tells Sara
the truth...

328
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,630
about how much
he pays for these things.

329
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,670
You're really good friends
with the chancellor, aren't you?

330
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,989
Pretty good.

331
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,429
I'm friends
with her husband too.

332
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:30,428
I guess you must be if you know
the combination to his closet...

333
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:33,508
and he doesn't mind you being
in here in their bedroom.

334
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:37,547
Right.

335
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:49,066
Drive carefully.

336
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,785
Stick close
to me in case it gets slippery.

337
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:55,025
We better skedaddle.
James-

338
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:06,303
You all right, James?

339
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:10,383
Oh. I'm sorry,
Prof. Tripp.

340
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:15,182
Maybe it's...

341
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,222
seeing that jacket
that belonged to her.

342
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:24,141
It just looks
really lonely...

343
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,701
hanging there
in a closet.

344
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,900
Maybe I'm just
a little sad tonight.

345
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,219
I'm a little
sad tonight too, James.

346
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,939
You mean, with your wife
leaving you and all?

347
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:48,458
Hannah mentioned something
about it.

348
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:55,257
Yeah, well,
it's complicated, James.

349
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,377
I think we should go now.

350
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:31,092
Easy, easy.

351
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:34,651
He's a good boy, Poe.
Poe's a good boy. Easy, Poe.

352
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:37,731
Easy. Good dog.

353
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,690
Jesus Christ!
Get off!

354
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,207
Shit, James.

355
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,287
You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.

356
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,367
But I-
I had to, didn't I?

357
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:13,286
You could've
pulled him off me.

358
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:17,086
No, the dog was crazy, Prof. Tripp.
The dog was attacking you!

359
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:20,565
Calm down, James.
Don't freak out, all right?

360
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:27,044
Okay. All right.
Do you have a mirror?

361
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,964
It's the best way to see
if someone's still breathing.

362
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:32,564
The dog is dead, James.
Believe me.

363
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,563
I know a dead dog
when I see one.

364
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:41,442
- Oh, shit.
- What are we supposed to do now?

365
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,602
First, you're gonna give me
that little cap gun of yours.

366
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:49,561
Come on.

367
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:58,240
Prof. Tripp,
what are we gonna do with...

368
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
it?

369
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,679
I don't know.
I'm still trying to figure out...

370
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:06,159
how to tell the chancellor
that I murdered her husband's dog.

371
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:08,439
- You?
- Trust me, James.

372
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,239
When the family pet's
been assassinated...

373
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,998
the owner
does not want to hear...

374
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:14,038
that one of her students
was the triggerman.

375
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:16,838
Does she wanna hear
it was one of her professors?

376
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,157
I've got tenure.

377
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:25,916
Hang on.

378
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:36,355
It's still warm.

379
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:38,275
Let's try feet first.

380
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:51,553
Yuck! That is a big trunk.

381
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:53,833
It holds a tuba, a suitcase...

382
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,312
a dead dog and a garment bag
almost perfectly.

383
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:59,152
Yep. That's just what they
used to say in the ads.

384
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:01,192
Come on, Crabtree.
I know you're holding.

385
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:03,031
Whose tuba is that anyway?

386
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:05,591
- Miss Sloviak's.
- Can I ask you something about her?

387
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:08,831
- Yes, she is.
- So is your friend Crabtree-

388
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:10,750
Is he-Is he gay?

389
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,950
Most of the time he is, James.
Some of the time he isn't.

390
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,270
What do we have here?

391
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,189
This looks like-

392
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:21,229
That's our old friend
Mr. Codeine.

393
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:24,548
That should take the old pinch
out of the ankle. You want one?

394
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:28,788
- No, thanks. I'm fine without them.
- Right.

395
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,988
That's why you were standing
in the chancellor's backyard...

396
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,467
spinning that cap gun of yours.

397
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:35,707
You're fine. Yeah, you're just
as fit as a fucking fiddle.

398
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:51,105
I'm sorry, James.
I'm sorry I said that.

399
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:10,822
How about we try that again?

400
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,221
It is
a great pleasure to introduce...

401
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:19,581
best-selling author
Quentin Morewood...

402
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:22,701
known to his friends
simply as Q.

403
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:44,938
I... am a writer.

404
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:51,177
As a writer, you learn that
everyone you meet has a story.

405
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,616
Every bartender,
every taxi driver...

406
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:57,656
has an idea that would make
a great book.

407
00:25:57,736 --> 00:25:59,776
Presumably
each of you has an idea.

408
00:25:59,816 --> 00:26:02,535
But how do you get
from there to here?

409
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:05,455
What is the bridge from
the water's edge of inspiration...

410
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:08,054
to the far shore
of accomplishment?

411
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:22,732
Faith.

412
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:26,972
Faith that your story
is worth the telling.

413
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:31,211
Faith that you have
the wherewithal to tell it.

414
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:35,251
And faith that the carefully woven
structure that you create...

415
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:38,090
won't collapse beneath you.

416
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,770
And faith that when you
get to the other side...

417
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,690
there will be someone waiting...

418
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,929
who gives a damn
about the tale you have to tell.

419
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,369
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Like Whitman, I admit...

420
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,449
I worship at the shrine
of formal construction.

421
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:54,008
But like Conrad, I confess that
I have a secret sharer in my work.

422
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:57,488
My double, my other self.

423
00:26:57,568 --> 00:27:01,447
I am haunted by this
malignant, remorseless shadow-

424
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,604
Grady.

425
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:28,763
Grady.

426
00:27:31,603 --> 00:27:33,963
You had another one again,
didn't you?

427
00:27:35,563 --> 00:27:37,442
Is the thing-

428
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:40,802
Is it over?

429
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:44,121
Almost. Wanna sit up?

430
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,000
What's wrong?

431
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,600
Nothing, I just twisted-

432
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,439
Sara, there's something
I've gotta tell you.

433
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,399
Something hard.

434
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,078
Stand up then. I'm too old for all
this rolling around on the floor.

435
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:08,998
Give me a hand?

436
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,236
- Well, this evening-
- Don't.

437
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:24,156
I know what you're gonna say.

438
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:26,676
I don't think you do know
what I'm gonna say, Sara.

439
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:29,395
You love Emily. Of course you love
Emily. She's young, beautiful.

440
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,955
She's your wife.
You have to stay with her.

441
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:35,194
B- But I don't have a choice.
Emily left me.

442
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:39,674
She'll come back.
That's why I'm going to-

443
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:41,594
To not have this baby.

444
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:47,153
You're not gonna have it?

445
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:53,712
No, there's no way. I mean,
don't you think there's no way?

446
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:03,751
Well, I don't see any,
but I know what it means to you.

447
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:04,990
No, you don't.

448
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,310
And fuck you for saying you do,
for saying that there's no way.

449
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,870
Because there could
be a way, Grady.

450
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,109
They must be finishing.
We should go.

451
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:24,228
Whose gun is that?

452
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,987
A souvenir
from Baltimore.

453
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,987
It's heavy. Smells like-

454
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,067
- Gunpowder.
- Caps.

455
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,465
Pow.

456
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,464
You got me.

457
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:54,944
I love you, Grady.

458
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,782
The doors made so much noise.

459
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:08,422
It was so embarrassing.
They had to carry him out.

460
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:10,342
- Is he all right?
- He's fine. He's narrating.

461
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,661
They were going
to the men's room...

462
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:15,261
but would they
make it in time?

463
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:18,340
Terry Crabtree
and James Leer.

464
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,060
Leave it to you to make
that mistake. Wait here.

465
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:31,939
- I need a ride.
- I'm your man.

466
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:43,977
There's an explanation.

467
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:48,136
Couldn't he have just thrown
a shoe at the poor thing?

468
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:52,496
- Antonia, listen-
- Tony. Now that I'm home.

469
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:54,536
Tony...

470
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:58,455
I'm sorry tonight didn't work out
the way you'd hoped to with Terry.

471
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:00,495
Forget it.
Your friend is just...

472
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:03,214
I don't know,
into collecting weird tricks.

473
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,534
I think he'd
call it a habit.

474
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,174
I do get the feeling he's going
through the motions a little bit.

475
00:31:09,254 --> 00:31:11,573
You mean because his career
is ruined and all?

476
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,693
Is that what he told you?

477
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:17,132
He said he hasn't had a success
in over five years, and...

478
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:21,812
everyone in New York
thinks he's kind of a loser.

479
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:24,651
But he said he's sure
your book's so good that...

480
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,931
he'll be able to keep his job.

481
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,651
And you're not one of those writers
who has a success and then...

482
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:31,850
freezes up
and never has another one.

483
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,010
You can turn here.

484
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:45,649
Gotta go. I think I may
have to rescue James Leer.

485
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:48,008
You know, Grady, maybe...

486
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:50,248
you should think about
going home.

487
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:52,928
You look like you need
a little rescuing yourself.

488
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,247
- Hey, Grady.
- How are you?

489
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:20,004
Can I get a double Dickel
on the rocks, please?

490
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:21,004
I'm right over here.

491
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:23,124
Double Dickel.

492
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:27,883
- Is that just beer?
- Primarily.

493
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,923
Although I gather that the two
of you staged a little raid...

494
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:31,842
on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia.

495
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,922
So where is everybody?

496
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:36,002
Sara and Walter declined.
I guess they just wanted...

497
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,122
to go home and curl up
on the couch with Poe.

498
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,520
- Jesus, he's out.
- He has a book.

499
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,520
I know. He started it
in fall semester.

500
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,720
Finished it winter break.

501
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,159
So is he any good?

502
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:59,119
- No, not yet he isn't.
- Well, I'm gonna read it anyway.

503
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,718
Oh, Crabs, come on, will ya?

504
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:02,718
He's one of my students,
for Christ's sakes.

505
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:05,678
- Besides, I'm not sure if he's, uh-
- He is.

506
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:07,837
I'm sure. Take my word for it.
I see myself in him.

507
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:11,357
I'm sure you do, but it's a little
more complicated than that.

508
00:33:11,397 --> 00:33:13,277
Besides, he's a little
scattered right now.

509
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:15,236
He almost did something
really stupid tonight.

510
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:16,956
I don't think he needs
sexual confusion...

511
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,316
to mix up
the stew a little more.

512
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,676
On the contrary, I think
it might be just the ticket.

513
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:23,075
Double Dickel on the rocks.

514
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:25,035
"Oola"?

515
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:28,395
Thanks, Oola.

516
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:32,714
Cheers.

517
00:33:32,794 --> 00:33:35,394
Cheers.

518
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,673
Oh, my goodness.
Do you see what I see?

519
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:40,673
Look there.
Let's go. You first.

520
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:45,392
President of the James Brown
Hair Club for Men.

521
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,792
He's a boxer.
A flyweight.

522
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:50,632
No, no, he's a jockey.
His name is Curtis Hard apple.

523
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:51,672
Not Curtis.

524
00:33:51,712 --> 00:33:53,671
Okay then, Vernon.
Vernon Hardapple.

525
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:57,351
The scars are from a horse. He fell
during a race. He got trampled.

526
00:33:57,431 --> 00:33:58,551
He's addicted to painkillers.

527
00:33:58,631 --> 00:33:59,870
He can't even piss
standing up anymore.

528
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,870
- Lives with his mother.
- That's right.

529
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,550
And he's got
a younger brother who's a-

530
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,109
- Who's a groom named Claudelle.
- Yeah.

531
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:08,749
His mother blames Vernon
for Claudelle's death.

532
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:09,869
Great!

533
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,149
Because-
Because-

534
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:14,068
- Because-
- Because why?

535
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:18,868
He was killed when
a gangster named Freddy Nostrils...

536
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:21,827
tried to shoot
his favorite horse.

537
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:25,547
Claudelle
took the bullet himself.

538
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:29,426
Vernon, over there...

539
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,346
was in on the hit.

540
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,346
That was good.

541
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:38,345
Yeah, he heard
everything we said.

542
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:41,305
Come on, Teach.
I want you to dance with me.

543
00:34:41,385 --> 00:34:43,824
- No.
- Come on.

544
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:51,903
So I've been rereading
Arsonist's Daughter.

545
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:55,103
It's so beautiful, Grady.

546
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:57,383
It's so natural.

547
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:00,302
It's like all of your sentences
always existed, just...

548
00:35:00,342 --> 00:35:03,182
waiting for up there in style
heaven for you to fetch them down.

549
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:06,061
I thank you.

550
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:07,741
And I love the inscription
you wrote to me.

551
00:35:07,781 --> 00:35:11,381
Only I'm not quite
the downy innocent you think I am.

552
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:14,420
I hope that's not true.

553
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,100
We need all the downy
innocents we can get.

554
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,659
And it's time to go

555
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:25,419
I need your love so bad

556
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:29,498
What this boy could use
is a nice, tall Coca-Cola.

557
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:32,658
- Let me help.
- No, we got him.

558
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:35,217
- I'll meet you two at the car.
- Oh, I see.

559
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:37,297
All right. Well, give me
the keys to the trunk.

560
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:39,697
I gotta get my property
out of there.

561
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:42,337
The trunk's a little sticky,
Crabs. I gotta do it.

562
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,256
Whatever.

563
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,016
Professor... Tripp.

564
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:50,575
Hannah, when you get James
back to his apartment...

565
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,095
make sure he's all right
before you leave, okay?

566
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:55,575
I would if I knew
where I was taking him.

567
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:58,454
Are you telling me you don't
know where James lives?

568
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,974
Some apartment somewhere.
I've never seen it.

569
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:04,174
- That strikes me as very odd.
- James is odd.

570
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:06,693
I know his aunt lives in Sewickley
Heights. I dropped him there once.

571
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,373
Come to think of it,
it wasn't his aunt's house.

572
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,893
He said
she worked there or something.

573
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:13,092
- I don't remember.
- I need my knapsack.

574
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:15,212
What's he saying?

575
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:18,932
His bag. You know that ugly green
thing he's always carrying around?

576
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,851
He must've
left it inside.

577
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,811
Aw, shit. He left it at Thaw.
The auditorium.

578
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,571
- Knapsack!
- All right.

579
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,530
- Let him crash at my house.
- Where should I put him?

580
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,530
In the shape that he's in,
you could stand him up...

581
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,009
in the garage next to the snow
shovels, and he'd be all right.

582
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,688
Grady, if you
wanna talk later...

583
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:43,608
I'll be up.

584
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:53,047
Hey, guy! Tripp, the trunk.
You're killing me.

585
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,366
- I'm gonna get it!
- Killin' me!

586
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:04,645
- You drivin' this car?
- Excuse me?

587
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,085
This 1966 maroon
Ford Galaxy 500.

588
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:09,205
- You drivin' this car?
- This is my car.

589
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:12,484
- Bullshit! It's mine, motherfucker!
- I'm afraid you're mistaken.

590
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,564
- Bullshit!
- Who is that?

591
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:17,364
Oh, Vernon, go home
to your mother, will you?

592
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:20,963
- What are you lookin' at?
- I'm lookin' at you, fella.

593
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:24,363
Hit it, will you?
Come on, killjoy, go!

594
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:27,202
- Can we go now, den mother?
- What's with you?

595
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:28,482
I wonder.

596
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:29,922
Come on, Crabs.
The kid was comatose.

597
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:32,322
- Who started that?
- I was trying to calm him down.

598
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:34,441
Oh, yeah, you calmed him down,
Dr. Feelgood.

599
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:35,641
Grady!

600
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:38,441
- Hit the brakes!
- Stop the car!

601
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,440
- Stop! Hey!
- What's his problem?

602
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,120
- Back up!
- Get out of the car! Hey!

603
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,240
Go around, go around him.

604
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,759
- I'm stopping you!
- I don't think so!

605
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,559
Come back here!

606
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,238
- What's this?
- It's a one-way, guy.

607
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:03,157
Go, go, go!

608
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,877
Look out! He's back!

609
00:38:09,877 --> 00:38:13,276
- Now what?
- You owe him a book too?

610
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,756
You could always
drive over him.

611
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:27,874
What the hell
was that?

612
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:30,074
I just got
my hood jumped on.

613
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:44,352
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Where would we go?

614
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,630
Hold on a second.

615
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,349
Prof. Tripp.

616
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,868
I guess you're here
for the backpack.

617
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:15,148
It's Traxler.
Sam.

618
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:22,387
I saw the manuscript inside,
so when you showed up I figured-

619
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:30,386
The Love Parade. So it was true.

620
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:32,425
The little prick
had finished his book.

621
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:36,265
- Is it good?
- I don't know. It might be.

622
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:49,423
So there it was.

623
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:52,343
Somewhere in the night
a Manhattan book editor...

624
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,902
was prowling
the streets of Pittsburgh...

625
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:57,302
best-selling author
at his side...

626
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:59,502
dead dog in his trunk.

627
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:01,821
Say, Prof. Tripp.

628
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:05,101
Is all that stuff true
about Errol Flynn?

629
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:08,020
How he used to put paprika
on his dick...

630
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,020
to make it,
you know, like...

631
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,579
more stimulating
for the chick?

632
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,339
Christ, Traxler,
how the hell should I know?

633
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:23,058
You're reading his biography,
aren't you?

634
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:26,738
Oh.

635
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:32,777
No, it's true. He used to rub
all sorts of things on it.

636
00:40:32,817 --> 00:40:36,297
Salad dressing,
ground lamb.

637
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,536
Sick.

638
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:46,415
Whenever I wondered
what Sara saw in me...

639
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:48,775
and I wondered
more than once...

640
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:51,695
I always came back to the fact
that she loved to read.

641
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:54,454
She read everything,
every spare moment.

642
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:57,494
She was a junkie
for the printed word.

643
00:40:57,574 --> 00:40:59,414
And lucky for me...

644
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:01,733
I manufactured
her drug of choice.

645
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,493
Is that your wife?

646
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:08,052
No, my wife's out of town.

647
00:41:11,212 --> 00:41:13,612
What exactly
are we doing here...

648
00:41:13,692 --> 00:41:16,291
Prof. Tripp?

649
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:18,731
Taking the long way home.

650
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,889
- Take it easy, Prof. Tripp.
- Thanks for the ride.

651
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:22,554
I told myself...

652
00:43:22,594 --> 00:43:24,954
I needed to put
everything aside for the moment.

653
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:27,433
Emily, Sara,
the purloined jacket...

654
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:29,873
and the dead dog,
and work on my book.

655
00:43:29,913 --> 00:43:32,313
It was started out
as a small book.

656
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:41,072
Probably about,
oh, 250, 300 pages.

657
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,471
It had gotten
a little larger in scope.

658
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,349
And the ending,
it kept getting further away.

659
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:07,148
But the ending was there.
I knew it.

660
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:09,108
I could almost see it.

661
00:44:16,227 --> 00:44:20,386
James? I'm okay.

662
00:44:20,466 --> 00:44:22,426
I just lost my balance.

663
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:24,666
I put you on the floor.

664
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,185
Oh. Thank you.

665
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:32,385
I thought you might
swallow your tongue or something.

666
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,344
I guess you must
really miss her, huh?

667
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:40,344
Hmm? Oh, this. No.

668
00:44:40,384 --> 00:44:43,703
No, I just write in this.
This wasn't Emily's.

669
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:46,263
I guess there's
probably a story behind that.

670
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:50,102
There is,
but it's not very interesting.

671
00:44:54,302 --> 00:44:59,261
Is... all of that
single spaced?

672
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:01,181
I'm afraid so, yeah.

673
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:03,380
That's a really big book
you're writing.

674
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,060
Wow. Hannah always swore
you were working, but-

675
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,299
- But?
- Nothing.

676
00:45:10,379 --> 00:45:13,299
It's just-It's been a while
since Arsonist's Daughter...

677
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:16,619
and some people, some of the kids
in workshop thought...

678
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:20,298
- maybe you were-
- Washed up?

679
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:23,378
Blocked.

680
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:26,977
Well, I don't believe
in writer's block.

681
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,217
No kidding.

682
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:33,096
- You want me to get that?
- Please. Could you?

683
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:35,336
- Glasses.
- Thank you.

684
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:42,095
Hello?

685
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:50,414
- He didn't give his name.
- Who?

686
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:53,774
- The guy on the phone.
- Well, what did he want?

687
00:45:53,894 --> 00:45:55,893
He wanted to know
if a Grady Tripp lived here...

688
00:45:55,973 --> 00:46:00,253
and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford
Galaxy 500 with black interior.

689
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,572
- Well, what'd you tell him?
- Yes.

690
00:46:04,212 --> 00:46:07,652
- Oh, good, James.
- Well, I just thought maybe-

691
00:46:07,692 --> 00:46:09,611
Good morning, boys.

692
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:16,051
- Good morning, James.
- Good morning.

693
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:18,570
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

694
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,490
I'm gonna take a shower.

695
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:26,929
- Prof. Tripp?
- Hmm?

696
00:46:27,009 --> 00:46:28,969
How did I get here last night?

697
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:31,169
No one knows where you live,
James.

698
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:33,328
Hannah thought
you'd like my couch.

699
00:46:34,488 --> 00:46:37,448
And before that,
did I do anything?

700
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,007
I mean,
did I do anything bad?

701
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:44,767
Well, James, you did shoot the head
of the English Department's dog...

702
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:47,726
and steal his most prized
piece of memorabilia.

703
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:16,762
A w, shit.

704
00:47:16,802 --> 00:47:19,202
Do yourself a favor.
Hide.

705
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,121
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

706
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,640
- Prof. Tripp?
- That's right.

707
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,680
I understand
you attended an event...

708
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,879
at Sara and Walter Gaskell's
house last night.

709
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:39,719
What's this all about, anyway?

710
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:42,559
Somebody pulled a B&E
on Dr. Gaskell's closet...

711
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,479
and the dog's missing.

712
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,038
I was just wondering if you saw
someone who seemed suspicious.

713
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:51,198
I wouldn't say there was
anybody particularly suspicious.

714
00:47:51,278 --> 00:47:54,517
About this kid,
student of yours, Leer?

715
00:47:54,557 --> 00:47:56,317
James Leer? You wouldn't
happen to know...

716
00:47:56,397 --> 00:47:58,997
howl could get
in touch with him, would you?

717
00:48:00,116 --> 00:48:02,916
I think I have his number
on campus.

718
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:05,476
That's all right.
We'll find him.

719
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:08,315
- Morning.
- You have a good one.

720
00:48:13,115 --> 00:48:16,954
There you are.
I thought we were going to talk.

721
00:48:17,034 --> 00:48:19,034
- W-Well, I was-
- Prof. Tripp?

722
00:48:19,114 --> 00:48:21,953
I heard what he said.

723
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,873
What time's breakfast?

724
00:48:23,953 --> 00:48:26,833
- What do we do now?
- Just one minute. Hello?

725
00:48:26,913 --> 00:48:29,033
- Grady?
- Sara.

726
00:48:29,113 --> 00:48:32,672
Thank God you're there.
You won't believe what's happened.

727
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:35,472
Could you hold on
just a minute, honey?

728
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:43,711
May I ask you something,
Prof. Tripp?

729
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:46,950
- Sure, James.
- Where exactly are we going?

730
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,470
There's a few things
I've got to do today.

731
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,709
- See my wife-
- The one that left you?

732
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:54,709
Yes, that's the one-

733
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:58,589
Ow! Oh, shit!
Son of a bitch!

734
00:48:58,629 --> 00:49:00,828
Ooh, you're bleeding,
Prof. Tripp.

735
00:49:01,948 --> 00:49:04,068
No shit, James.

736
00:49:09,027 --> 00:49:11,707
So where exactly
do you live, James?

737
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:14,466
Apparently, not even
Hannah Green has a clue...

738
00:49:14,546 --> 00:49:17,426
as to the location
of your apartment.

739
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:19,826
I got kicked out.

740
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:23,825
Well, not exactly kicked out.
I was asked to leave.

741
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:25,745
I guess there's
probably a story there.

742
00:49:25,785 --> 00:49:29,464
There is, but it's
not very interesting.

743
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:31,384
So where are you staying?

744
00:49:31,424 --> 00:49:33,784
At the-

745
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:37,223
The, uh, bus station.

746
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:41,143
It's not so bad.
I know the night janitor...

747
00:49:41,183 --> 00:49:43,582
and there's a broken locker
I can put my stuff.

748
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:49,942
Jesus, James.
I mean, uh, for how long?

749
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:52,581
A couple of weeks.
That's why-

750
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:55,981
That's why I had the gun.
For protection.

751
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:59,220
- You should've told someone.
- Who?

752
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,140
I don't know. Me?

753
00:50:05,979 --> 00:50:09,659
James' story
was the stuff of bad fiction...

754
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:11,979
and under other circumstances,
I might've wondered...

755
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:15,698
where the page ended with him
and real life began.

756
00:50:15,738 --> 00:50:18,018
But I had other things
on my mind.

757
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:26,177
The Gaskell house looked deserted...

758
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,576
which figured since WordFest
was in full swing on campus.

759
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:29,856
What are we-

760
00:50:29,936 --> 00:50:34,016
You oughta ease off on that stuff,
James. It's pretty acidic.

761
00:50:34,096 --> 00:50:35,935
I can't help myself. I don't know
what's the matter with me.

762
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:39,535
James, you're hung over. What do
you think's the matter with you?

763
00:50:42,454 --> 00:50:44,974
I'll be right back.

764
00:50:50,653 --> 00:50:52,533
I knew I needed to have...

765
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:54,253
a heart-to-heart with Sara.

766
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:58,332
But until then,
I'd just make a little gesture.

767
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:05,371
Feeling guilty?

768
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:09,451
I can't believe you
hung up on me, you dick.

769
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:12,050
Sara, I am so sorry
about this morning.

770
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,010
There was a lot going on.

771
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,090
Walter's a basket case. Someone
stole Marilyn's jacket last night.

772
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,929
And Poe's missing.

773
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,849
- Oh, I heard.
- You heard? Ho w?

774
00:51:22,889 --> 00:51:26,408
I, uh-A 12-year-old policeman
came by my house this morning.

775
00:51:26,488 --> 00:51:29,328
Did you confess? Your fingerprints
were all over the bedroom.

776
00:51:29,448 --> 00:51:31,848
Really?
That was fast.

777
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:33,847
I'm joking. Hello!

778
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,327
Oh, right, right, right.

779
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:38,247
Look, about last night...

780
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,687
there's something I have
to talk to you about.

781
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:43,526
Okay.

782
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:47,646
Uh-I-

783
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:50,405
Well, I, um-

784
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,724
I want to be with you.

785
00:51:56,804 --> 00:52:00,084
Gee, Grady,
that sounded so heartfelt.

786
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:01,604
No, really, Sara, I do.

787
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:03,923
No, I believe
you want to be with me...

788
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:08,123
- but it's just not good enough.
- I know that.

789
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:10,403
- I know what's at stake here.
- No, I don't think you do.

790
00:52:10,443 --> 00:52:12,642
Besides, it doesn't matter.
I haven't decided yet.

791
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:17,282
- About the baby?
- That... and you.

792
00:52:17,362 --> 00:52:19,841
I'm not gonna
draw you a map, Grady.

793
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:22,881
Times like these, you have to do
your own navigating.

794
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,400
Why is your car over there?
And who's that sitting in it?

795
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,199
- James Leer.
- What's he doing here?

796
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,998
I'm sort of helping him
through some issues.

797
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:43,318
Isn't he lucky?

798
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:53,797
She seemed to take it pretty well.

799
00:52:53,877 --> 00:52:58,676
Yeah, yeah, well, the moment
didn't actually present itself.

800
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:03,435
You feel like
taking a ride, James?

801
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:05,475
Yes.

802
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:10,074
Humboldt County?

803
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:11,994
Maybe.

804
00:53:12,074 --> 00:53:15,554
My father, he gets it
from his doctor.

805
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:17,953
- Glaucoma?
- Colon cancer.

806
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:21,473
Jesus, James. Wow.

807
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:24,592
It's a bit of a scandal.
My parents live in a small town.

808
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:26,632
- Where's that?
- Carvel.

809
00:53:26,712 --> 00:53:30,112
- Carvel? Where's Carvel?
- Outside Scranton.

810
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:33,111
I've never heard of it.

811
00:53:33,191 --> 00:53:37,191
It's a hellhole. Three motels
and a mannequin factory.

812
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:39,150
My dad worked there
for 35 years.

813
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,230
Your father worked
in mannequin factory?

814
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,430
Seitz Plastics.
It's where he met my mom.

815
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,749
She was a fry cook
in the cafeteria.

816
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:50,589
Before that,
she'd been a dancer.

817
00:53:50,629 --> 00:53:53,029
What kind of dancer?

818
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:55,788
Whatever kind they
wanted her to be.

819
00:53:55,868 --> 00:53:59,268
Didn't you say that your mom
went to Catholic school?

820
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:03,387
When we fall, we fall hard.

821
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:05,947
I really love
to watch them roll

822
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:11,906
No longer riding
on the merry-go-round

823
00:54:11,986 --> 00:54:13,026
I thought you were the guy...

824
00:54:13,106 --> 00:54:14,906
that didn't like to lose
control of his emotions.

825
00:54:14,946 --> 00:54:18,025
Maybe I just needed
the moment to present itself.

826
00:54:18,105 --> 00:54:21,345
I just had to let it go

827
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:23,304
Mmm. Mmm!

828
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,544
Mmm. Mmm!

829
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,784
I had
come to the childhood home...

830
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,823
of my soon-to-be ex-wife
to set things straight...

831
00:54:30,903 --> 00:54:33,463
to say something that would
end things on the right note...

832
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,743
to make Emily
feel better about it all...

833
00:54:36,823 --> 00:54:40,182
or maybe to make me
feel better.

834
00:54:40,262 --> 00:54:43,862
Truthfully, I wasn't
really sure why I was there.

835
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:46,141
Someone jumped on your car
with their butt.

836
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:47,541
How can you tell?

837
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,821
Well, you can see
the outline of a butt.

838
00:54:49,901 --> 00:54:53,620
You want one?
They're incredible. Incredible.

839
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,660
Smoke the rest of that joint, James,
you can start chewing on the box.

840
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,779
- Hey, maybe she didn't come here.
- She came here.

841
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:04,379
We'll just wait.

842
00:55:04,459 --> 00:55:08,698
In the meantime, I'm gonna need you
to shimmy right through there.

843
00:55:10,378 --> 00:55:14,897
Relax, James. Emily hasn't used
her keys since she was 15 years old.

844
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:17,057
Besides, your hips aren't
much bigger than hers.

845
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:18,337
It's not that.

846
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:21,297
Just reminded me
of what's in the car.

847
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:26,736
In the trunk?

848
00:55:29,296 --> 00:55:31,495
Oh, right, right.

849
00:55:31,535 --> 00:55:34,135
Let's try not to think
about that, okay?

850
00:55:54,972 --> 00:55:56,892
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

851
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:00,811
Feels really good in here.

852
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:03,971
Yeah, I know.

853
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:05,931
It's the kind of house...

854
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:08,250
you like to wake up in
on Christmas morning.

855
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:15,369
I'll be right back.
Uh, make yourself at home.

856
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,489
I'm gonna make
a phone call.

857
00:56:23,808 --> 00:56:25,768
Ah.

858
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:31,207
Mmm.

859
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:43,046
There's no such thing
as a good influence, Mr. Gray.

860
00:56:43,126 --> 00:56:45,725
- All influence is immoral.
- Why?

861
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:47,965
Because the aim of life
is self-development...

862
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,325
to realize one's nature
perfectly.

863
00:56:50,405 --> 00:56:52,164
That's what we 're here for.

864
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:54,724
A man should live out his life
fully and completely...

865
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:57,924
give form to every feeling,
reality to every dream.

866
00:56:58,003 --> 00:57:00,723
Sitting there among her things...

867
00:57:00,803 --> 00:57:05,043
I was reminded I didn't
really know Emily at all.

868
00:57:05,123 --> 00:57:07,522
Even though we had lived
together as man and wife...

869
00:57:07,642 --> 00:57:10,802
it was when I left the house,
when I was with Sara...

870
00:57:10,882 --> 00:57:12,801
...that I felt like I was home.

871
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:15,041
- University.
- Chancellor, please.

872
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:17,081
There's only one way
to get rid of a temptation...

873
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:19,041
and that's to yield to it.

874
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:22,280
Resist it, and the soul
grows sick with longing...

875
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,200
for the things it has
forbidden to itself.

876
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,959
Thank you.

877
00:57:42,198 --> 00:57:44,517
- Hello?
- Sara? Hi, it's Grady.

878
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:47,517
- Where are you?
- Kinship.

879
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,716
Listen, Sara, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

880
00:57:49,796 --> 00:57:50,916
You're in Kinship.

881
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:52,716
Yes, but that's not
why I'm calling you.

882
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:54,876
- You're with Emily.
- What?

883
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:57,315
No, no, no. There's no one here.
I'm just, uh-

884
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:59,355
Doing a little dusting?

885
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,435
Good mornin'

886
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,395
We've danced
the whole night through

887
00:58:03,435 --> 00:58:05,834
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

888
00:58:05,954 --> 00:58:08,754
Good mornin'

889
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:11,833
Good mornin '
It's great to stay up late

890
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:12,953
Good mornin '

891
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:18,353
Sara, I am not here-I'm not here
to, uh, to reconcile with Emily.

892
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:20,192
It doesn't matter.

893
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:22,952
How you choose to live
your own life is your business.

894
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,592
To say good night
So good mornin '

895
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:27,231
Good mornin '

896
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:29,191
Sunbeams will soon
smile through

897
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:31,431
Sara, you don't understand.

898
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:34,750
Probably not, but I have
something to say.

899
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,110
And I want you
to listen carefully, Grady.

900
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,150
Yes.

901
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,709
I can't wait for you
because if I do...

902
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:45,629
I could end up
waiting forever, so...

903
00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:49,428
I'm going to make
this decision on my own.

904
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:51,908
Good-bye, Grady.

905
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,268
Makin' a comeback.

906
00:58:54,348 --> 00:58:56,827
Gee, it must be terrible
to be a has-been.

907
00:58:56,907 --> 00:59:00,187
Don't talk
like that. It scares me.

908
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:03,546
We gotta
work harder. Make a lotta dough.

909
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:09,626
Hello. Hi.

910
00:59:09,706 --> 00:59:12,545
- Ow.
- It's infected. I can clean it up.

911
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,465
But then you need to see someone
who knows what he's doing.

912
00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:17,425
Ho w would you like
some hot chocolate...

913
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:19,864
and fresh cookies to go with it?

914
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:23,224
- That sounds nice. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

915
00:59:24,424 --> 00:59:27,583
This is really good hot chocolate.

916
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:29,463
He's one of your students,
this boy?

917
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:32,183
Yeah, he's a good kid.

918
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,862
He's just a little messed up.

919
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:38,062
Oh, then I'm sure he'll be fine...
with the proper guidance.

920
00:59:38,102 --> 00:59:40,022
So, you're at
the university in Pittsburgh?

921
00:59:40,062 --> 00:59:43,381
I'm working in a steel
mill while I finish my first novel.

922
00:59:43,501 --> 00:59:45,341
So where's Emily, Hank?

923
00:59:45,421 --> 00:59:49,460
I don't know if I should
tell you that, Grady.

924
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,860
I don't wanna stalk her.
I just wanna-

925
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,100
I wanna tell her
that I'm sorry.

926
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,059
I'm not trying
to get her back.

927
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:58,739
Things haven't been
right with us for a while.

928
00:59:58,819 --> 01:00:02,578
Well, all I know is Emily felt
you weren't there for her...

929
01:00:02,658 --> 01:00:05,938
and she's felt that
for a long time, Grady.

930
01:00:06,058 --> 01:00:07,938
Right now, she's, uh-

931
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:10,817
She's in Philadelphia
visiting Linda Ashby.

932
01:00:12,537 --> 01:00:16,137
For Christ's sakes,
they went to Wellesley together.

933
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:18,416
Linda spent a week
at your house-

934
01:00:18,456 --> 01:00:21,296
- Oh, Linda! Oh, oh.
- Yes.

935
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:24,815
I haven't been sleeping
a whole lot lately...

936
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,855
and I got my editor in town.

937
01:00:26,935 --> 01:00:28,975
- I'm trying to finish my book.
- Ah, right.

938
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,215
The book.

939
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:36,654
I hope it's really good, Grady.

940
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:46,093
I'm having a really good time,
Prof. Tripp.

941
01:00:46,173 --> 01:00:51,052
I'm really happy for you,
James.

942
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:56,131
Do me a favor.
Lay off my dope.

943
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:59,851
That stuff's
not for amateurs.

944
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:02,290
You're mad at me,
aren't you?

945
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:05,610
You're mad because
I shot your girlfriend's dog.

946
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:08,010
It wasn't her dog.
It was her husband's.

947
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,529
Who said anything
about a girlfriend?

948
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:15,769
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't
shot my girlfriend's dog...

949
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:18,728
Even though Poe and I were not
exactly what you call simpatico...

950
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,288
that's no reason he should've
taken two in the chest.

951
01:01:21,368 --> 01:01:24,087
I don't know.

952
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:28,807
You just keep acting like
a goddamn spook all the time, James.

953
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:32,326
Well, I guess that explains why
all the kids in workshop hate me.

954
01:01:32,366 --> 01:01:35,806
All the kids in workshop
hate you because right now...

955
01:01:35,886 --> 01:01:38,645
you're ten times the writer
any one of them will ever be.

956
01:01:38,725 --> 01:01:40,525
My stuff stinks.

957
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:44,325
You said so yourself last night
to your friend Crabtree.

958
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:46,764
I didn't mean it like that.

959
01:01:46,884 --> 01:01:48,724
And what does it matter
what I think?

960
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:51,044
I mean, what does it matter
what anybody thinks?

961
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,443
Most people don't think,
James.

962
01:01:53,483 --> 01:01:55,843
And if they do,
it's not about writing.

963
01:01:57,083 --> 01:02:00,003
Books.
They don't mean anything.

964
01:02:00,123 --> 01:02:02,242
Not to anybody.

965
01:02:03,802 --> 01:02:05,642
Not anymore.

966
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,841
Arsonist's Daughter
meant something.

967
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:11,721
It meant something to me.

968
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:15,040
It's the reason
I came to school here.

969
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,960
To be taught by you.

970
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,759
It's one of the reasons
I wanted to become a writer.

971
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,319
Well, for that, James,
if nothing else...

972
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,038
I'm really sorry.

973
01:02:39,557 --> 01:02:42,477
- What are we doing?
- I'm gonna get you a nice meal...

974
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:45,636
a couple of cups of coffee,
then I'm taking you home.

975
01:02:45,716 --> 01:02:48,036
- Take me now.
- What?

976
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:50,436
- I'm not hungry.
- James, you gotta eat.

977
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:52,715
I'll get something
out of the vending machine.

978
01:02:52,795 --> 01:02:54,595
Vending machine?
What are you talking about?

979
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:57,995
At the bus station,
they have these cheese sandwiches.

980
01:02:58,115 --> 01:03:00,194
They're pretty good.
It's better if you take me now.

981
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,114
That way,
Carl won't get my spot.

982
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:05,954
Carl?

983
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:09,673
- Never mind.
- James, go get us a table, will ya?

984
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:12,633
I'm not letting the most
talented writer in my class...

985
01:03:12,673 --> 01:03:15,072
eat some week-old
cheese sandwich, okay?

986
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:19,072
I'm not letting him sleep
on some bench in a bus station.

987
01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:22,071
So go on inside. I'll-
I'll be there in a minute.

988
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:26,591
C- A-R-V-E-I.

989
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:30,430
Yes, I'm sure, ma'am.
It's outside of Scranton.

990
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,550
You have no listing.

991
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,989
Okay, well-

992
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:41,709
Lady, as we speak, I am looking at
a resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania.

993
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:43,628
I'm sure he'd be
pretty interested to learn...

994
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,628
that the good people
at Bell Atlantic...

995
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:47,868
have misplaced
his entire hometown.

996
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:50,148
It's not like
I'm making this up as we go-

997
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:55,547
Never mind.
It's my mistake.

998
01:04:19,224 --> 01:04:21,143
- You want a bite?
- No, thanks.

999
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,503
That's why you're having them,
your spells.

1000
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:27,023
Spells? Jesus, James...

1001
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,302
you make it sound like we're in
a Tennessee Williams play.

1002
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:31,822
I don't get spells.

1003
01:04:31,862 --> 01:04:33,742
What would you
call them then?

1004
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:37,101
I don't know. Um-
Episodes.

1005
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:40,581
Uh-huh. I just worry about you,
that's all.

1006
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,620
You just worry
about yourself, okay?

1007
01:04:49,939 --> 01:04:51,779
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

1008
01:04:51,859 --> 01:04:55,379
You just stay here and eat.
I'll be right back.

1009
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,138
Good evening.

1010
01:05:03,218 --> 01:05:05,177
- Prof. Tripp.
- Grady.

1011
01:05:05,257 --> 01:05:07,537
Fred Leer.
This is my wife Amanda.

1012
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:10,577
Well, looks like I dashed
a wonderful evening here.

1013
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,336
We were on our way to a benefit,
but as luck would have it...

1014
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:16,016
the club was on the way, so we
were able to put in an appearance.

1015
01:05:16,096 --> 01:05:18,776
I just thought it would be
good for James...

1016
01:05:18,856 --> 01:05:20,975
to be with his family
this weekend.

1017
01:05:21,015 --> 01:05:25,095
Oh, well-
Of course we can understand that.

1018
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:31,694
Right. Okay, I guess, uh,
I'll go get James.

1019
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:36,293
Um-

1020
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:40,173
I hope you don't find this forward,
Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask.

1021
01:05:40,213 --> 01:05:42,892
Did you ever go
to Catholic school?

1022
01:05:44,932 --> 01:05:47,332
Excuse me?

1023
01:05:47,372 --> 01:05:49,051
I'm not going with them.

1024
01:05:49,131 --> 01:05:51,051
Things are a little weird
for me right now, James.

1025
01:05:51,091 --> 01:05:52,971
Things are a little weird
for me right now too.

1026
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:55,491
I know, but I got my editor
in town, I gotta finish my book...

1027
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:57,130
and there's some
extenuating circumstances-

1028
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,810
I won't bother you.
I won't even talk to you.

1029
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,770
Like it or not, those people
out there are your parents.

1030
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:04,649
- They're not my parents.
- What?

1031
01:06:04,689 --> 01:06:06,969
They're my grandparents.
My parents are dead.

1032
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:13,288
James, the man is obviously
your father. You look just like him.

1033
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:16,968
There's a reason for that.

1034
01:06:17,048 --> 01:06:20,647
- Oh, get out of here.
- No. That's why she hates me.

1035
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:22,887
That's why she makes me
sleep in the basement.

1036
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:26,206
Crawl space. With the rats and
the cask of amontillado, right?

1037
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:27,926
It's true!
They treat me like a freak!

1038
01:06:28,006 --> 01:06:30,646
Well, you are a freak, James.
All right? Welcome to the club.

1039
01:06:30,726 --> 01:06:33,165
You don't understand.
You don't know what it's like.

1040
01:06:33,245 --> 01:06:34,365
You're right, I don't.

1041
01:06:34,445 --> 01:06:36,365
Don't expect me to feel sorry
for you, all right?

1042
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:38,485
Because I don't know
who you are.

1043
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,004
Let me ask you
something, James.

1044
01:06:42,084 --> 01:06:45,804
In the past 36 hours, have you
told me one thing that's true?

1045
01:06:45,844 --> 01:06:49,003
One thing that comes from you?

1046
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:53,163
I just wanted to stay with you
for a little while, that's all.

1047
01:06:59,562 --> 01:07:02,761
I'm a teacher, James.
I'm not a Holiday Inn.

1048
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:10,840
Thank you,
Prof. Tripp.

1049
01:07:28,998 --> 01:07:31,718
Old man
look at my life

1050
01:07:31,758 --> 01:07:35,717
I'm a lot like you were

1051
01:07:36,837 --> 01:07:39,397
Old man
look at my life

1052
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:42,196
I'm a lot like you were

1053
01:07:42,276 --> 01:07:44,116
Hey!

1054
01:07:44,196 --> 01:07:46,676
Hey.

1055
01:07:54,914 --> 01:07:57,954
Old man
look at my life

1056
01:07:58,034 --> 01:08:01,234
Twenty-four
and there's so much more

1057
01:08:01,314 --> 01:08:03,833
Live alone in a paradise

1058
01:08:03,873 --> 01:08:07,673
That makes me
think of two

1059
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:10,872
Love lost
Such a cost

1060
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:14,472
Give me things
that don't get lost

1061
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:17,271
Like a coin
that won't get tossed

1062
01:08:17,351 --> 01:08:20,351
Rolling home to you

1063
01:08:36,669 --> 01:08:39,028
Crabtree. Jesus.

1064
01:08:53,746 --> 01:08:55,706
Do you mind?

1065
01:08:57,146 --> 01:08:58,986
Grady!

1066
01:08:59,066 --> 01:09:03,145
- Hey.
- Uh, I know I shouldn't have...

1067
01:09:03,225 --> 01:09:06,385
but there it was just in the open,
and I couldn't resist.

1068
01:09:06,425 --> 01:09:08,784
No, no. I just can't believe
that I left it out like this.

1069
01:09:08,864 --> 01:09:10,224
Tripp, where are you?

1070
01:09:10,264 --> 01:09:13,144
Has Crabtree been in here?
Has he been snooping around?

1071
01:09:13,224 --> 01:09:14,824
I don't know. Maybe.
I don't think so.

1072
01:09:14,864 --> 01:09:16,263
Let's put this away.

1073
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:18,103
Tripp!

1074
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:20,023
- Oh, shit.
- No. Um-

1075
01:09:22,263 --> 01:09:25,502
Don't go. I've been
waiting all night for you.

1076
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:27,862
I'm really flattered, honey,
but this just isn't-

1077
01:09:27,942 --> 01:09:31,941
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting
a teacher-student conference?

1078
01:09:32,021 --> 01:09:34,101
No offense, Tripp. You're not
exactly the most attentive host.

1079
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:36,341
Well, you've been taking good care
of that, huh, Crabs?

1080
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:38,460
Sometimes
we have to improvise.

1081
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,660
Where the hell
have you been anyway?

1082
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,140
I took a drive
with James Leer.

1083
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,139
He popped the chancellor's dog,
didn't he?

1084
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:46,379
- What?
- Yeah.

1085
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:48,179
First the police thought
he just ran away...

1086
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:50,379
but this afternoon, Dr. Gaskell
found blood spots on the carpet.

1087
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:51,419
Oh, Jesus.

1088
01:09:51,499 --> 01:09:53,578
Most everyone figured it was
an intruder, but right off...

1089
01:09:53,618 --> 01:09:56,018
Terry said it sounded like something
James would be messed up in.

1090
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:59,218
Has anybody else come up
with this brilliant deduction?

1091
01:09:59,258 --> 01:10:01,297
Well, not yet, but they will.
It's just a matter of time.

1092
01:10:01,337 --> 01:10:03,057
Come on.
You don't even know James.

1093
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:04,417
Who does?

1094
01:10:04,497 --> 01:10:07,456
I do. I do now.

1095
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,576
I spent some time
with him...

1096
01:10:09,656 --> 01:10:11,656
and I read
something of his.

1097
01:10:11,736 --> 01:10:14,176
- His book? You read his book?
- Yes.

1098
01:10:14,216 --> 01:10:16,735
- Is it good?
- It's good. It's very, very good.

1099
01:10:16,775 --> 01:10:20,495
It's-It's true.

1100
01:10:20,535 --> 01:10:23,294
I knew it.
So where is he now?

1101
01:10:23,374 --> 01:10:25,334
I sent him home
with his parents.

1102
01:10:25,414 --> 01:10:28,214
What? What?
His parents?

1103
01:10:28,294 --> 01:10:30,893
- Mm-hmm.
- Why? Why did you do that for?

1104
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:32,813
Because under
the circumstances...

1105
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:35,693
I thought it was
the best thing for him, but...

1106
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:40,292
I'm beginning to think maybe
it was the best thing for me.

1107
01:10:42,092 --> 01:10:45,411
I just, uh-
I wasn't there for him.

1108
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:48,331
Imagine that.

1109
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,690
Hannah, don't you remember
where you took James that day?

1110
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,610
Was it his aunt's?

1111
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,730
- Yes.
- I told you. Sewickley Heights.

1112
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,650
- What was the address?
- Mm-hmm.

1113
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:59,889
I don't know. He had me
drop him on a corner.

1114
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:01,569
Call the university.
I'm sure they know his address.

1115
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:03,209
Little late to call Ad missions.

1116
01:11:03,249 --> 01:11:06,168
Is it a little late to call
the chancellor, hmm?

1117
01:11:06,248 --> 01:11:08,088
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Hmm?

1118
01:11:08,168 --> 01:11:10,048
God, you really have just made
an awful...

1119
01:11:10,088 --> 01:11:12,008
stinky little mess
of everything, haven't you?

1120
01:11:14,287 --> 01:11:16,967
Is that it?

1121
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:18,447
Do not even think about it.

1122
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:19,927
- Don't go near it.
- No, no, no.

1123
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:22,286
Never without your permission,
but that is a lot of book.

1124
01:11:22,326 --> 01:11:24,086
262 Baxter Drive.

1125
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,446
They're in the book.

1126
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:28,525
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive.

1127
01:11:28,645 --> 01:11:30,445
"The Love Parade. "

1128
01:11:30,485 --> 01:11:33,005
I got a feeling about this.
I feel this kid in my bones.

1129
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:35,564
Only in your bones.

1130
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:38,924
I've had this feeling before.

1131
01:11:38,964 --> 01:11:41,004
Remember?

1132
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:45,443
It's been a long time, but-

1133
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:48,523
How bad is it for you,
Crabs?

1134
01:11:48,563 --> 01:11:50,442
It's pretty bad.

1135
01:11:50,482 --> 01:11:52,362
They've had enough of me.

1136
01:11:52,402 --> 01:11:54,562
They look at me like
I don't work there anymore.

1137
01:11:56,362 --> 01:11:59,641
I guess I just don't fit
the new corporate profile.

1138
01:11:59,721 --> 01:12:02,481
- Which is?
- Uh, gosh-

1139
01:12:02,561 --> 01:12:04,401
Competence.

1140
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:07,960
Down on the high way

1141
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,880
Is a byway

1142
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,399
- All alone
- This is it.

1143
01:12:16,559 --> 01:12:18,039
I had no business...

1144
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:20,038
trudging up
to James Leer's parents' house...

1145
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:22,918
in the middle of the night, not
when all that really mattered...

1146
01:12:22,998 --> 01:12:25,078
was trying to
make things right with Sara.

1147
01:12:25,158 --> 01:12:28,317
But we had decided
to rescue James Leer.

1148
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:29,997
I wasn't quite sure from what...

1149
01:12:30,077 --> 01:12:32,117
because I was pretty much
convinced that everything...

1150
01:12:32,197 --> 01:12:35,036
that came out of James' mouth
was basically horseshit.

1151
01:12:35,076 --> 01:12:37,796
- Yikes.
- Must be two dozen windows.

1152
01:12:37,836 --> 01:12:39,716
How are we
supposed to find his?

1153
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:43,715
I told you. They keep him
chained in the basement.

1154
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:46,435
But maybe
that didn't really matter.

1155
01:12:46,515 --> 01:12:49,354
Sometimes people
just need to be rescued.

1156
01:12:55,794 --> 01:12:59,073
Unrequited love's a bore

1157
01:13:00,993 --> 01:13:02,833
- Rodgers and Hart?
- Yeah.

1158
01:13:02,913 --> 01:13:04,872
- James Leer.
- James Leer.

1159
01:13:26,749 --> 01:13:29,509
Hey. What are you guys
doing here?

1160
01:13:29,589 --> 01:13:32,429
Shh. We're springin' you, Jimmy.
Put on some clothes.

1161
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:39,708
Whoa. Well, I, uh-I love
what you've done with the place.

1162
01:13:39,788 --> 01:13:41,627
When's Captain Nemo
moving in?

1163
01:13:41,707 --> 01:13:45,067
I cannot believe that you
made fu n of my bathrobe.

1164
01:13:45,147 --> 01:13:47,227
The candelabras
are my great grandmother's.

1165
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:49,346
Please. Don't start with
the family history, all right?

1166
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,906
- I'll leave you right here.
- I just want you to know...

1167
01:13:52,026 --> 01:13:53,946
I heard everything-
the parents and grandparents...

1168
01:13:54,026 --> 01:13:55,865
and the whole
Chinatown thing.

1169
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:58,865
I believe you. That's why
we're here. Now go get dressed.

1170
01:13:58,905 --> 01:14:02,785
I mean, do you mind if I wear
this again, Prof. Tripp?

1171
01:14:02,864 --> 01:14:04,944
Wear whatever
you want to.

1172
01:14:07,464 --> 01:14:10,144
- He's so modest.
- He's so sensitive.

1173
01:14:10,223 --> 01:14:12,623
Tripp, why don't you
cut the kid some slack?

1174
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:15,783
These are all overdue
library books, every one of them.

1175
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:19,102
Then it looks like our Mr. Leer
is facing some monster late fees.

1176
01:14:19,182 --> 01:14:21,422
I just can't believe
all the shit he spins.

1177
01:14:21,462 --> 01:14:24,582
Just once I'd like to know if the
little bastard's telling the truth.

1178
01:14:24,662 --> 01:14:26,501
Hey.

1179
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:28,421
Check this out.

1180
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:31,221
"Finally, the door opened.
It was a shock to see him...

1181
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:33,380
shuffling into the room
like an aging prizefighter...

1182
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,580
Limping, beaten."

1183
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:38,060
Does that sound like
anyone we know?

1184
01:14:40,339 --> 01:14:42,899
"But it was later
when the great man...

1185
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,939
squinted into
the bitter glow of twilight-"

1186
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:48,018
"Twilight." This kid
definitely needs an editor.

1187
01:14:48,098 --> 01:14:50,618
"And muttered simply,
'It means nothing.

1188
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:54,657
All of it. Nothing. '
that the true shock came.

1189
01:14:54,737 --> 01:14:57,177
It was then that the boy
understood...

1190
01:14:57,257 --> 01:15:00,097
that his hero's true injuries
lay in a darker place.

1191
01:15:00,177 --> 01:15:02,096
His heart-"

1192
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:05,816
His heart what?

1193
01:15:08,696 --> 01:15:11,615
"His heart, once capable of
inspiring others so completely...

1194
01:15:11,655 --> 01:15:13,535
could no longer inspire
so much as itself.

1195
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:16,694
It beat now
only out of habit.

1196
01:15:16,774 --> 01:15:19,934
It beat now only-

1197
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:21,894
because it could."

1198
01:15:24,893 --> 01:15:26,773
I'm ready.

1199
01:15:28,533 --> 01:15:31,892
- You all right, Prof. Tripp?
- He's fine.

1200
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:35,012
Can we go before Granny comes down
and boils your bones for breakfast?

1201
01:15:35,092 --> 01:15:37,292
That could be a problem.
She's been coming down here...

1202
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,291
every half-hour or so
to check up on me...

1203
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:42,491
and if I'm not here, she might
call the police or something.

1204
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:46,011
Okay. Decoy. We'll put your pillows
and a teddy bear under the spread.

1205
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,210
- She won't know the difference.
- Like in Against All Flags...

1206
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,130
only they used a couple
of gigantic hams.

1207
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:53,330
No, no, no, no.
I got a better idea.

1208
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:02,728
Good night,
sweet prince.

1209
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:27,965
Shadows are fallin'

1210
01:16:28,045 --> 01:16:30,684
And I've been here
all day

1211
01:16:33,804 --> 01:16:36,564
- It's too hot to sleep
- Let's go upstairs.

1212
01:16:36,644 --> 01:16:39,123
- Bad vibes down here.
- Time is runnin' away

1213
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:43,323
Things must've picked up
after we left, huh, Grady?

1214
01:16:43,403 --> 01:16:49,162
Feel like my soul
has turned into steel

1215
01:16:52,202 --> 01:16:58,281
I've still got the scars
that the sun didn't heal

1216
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,440
There's not even
room enough

1217
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,360
To be anywhere

1218
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,599
- It's not dark yet
- Good night, bro.

1219
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:16,238
But it's gettin' there

1220
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:14,110
You've reached
the home of Sara and Walter Gaskell.

1221
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:17,790
Neither Walter or I
can take your-

1222
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:20,350
- Hello.
- Walter?

1223
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:24,189
Grady? Oh, Christ, Grady,
do you know what time it is?

1224
01:18:24,269 --> 01:18:26,989
Yeah. I got, uh, 8:15.

1225
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,908
I don't think
that's right, though.

1226
01:18:28,988 --> 01:18:30,828
It's 3:30, Grady.

1227
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:32,748
Well, this is important,
Walter.

1228
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:34,748
Oh?

1229
01:18:34,828 --> 01:18:39,067
I, um-I-

1230
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:41,907
What is it, Grady?

1231
01:18:41,947 --> 01:18:43,866
I'm in love with your wife.

1232
01:18:46,266 --> 01:18:48,466
Excuse me?

1233
01:18:48,506 --> 01:18:51,905
Sara. I'm in love with her.

1234
01:18:52,025 --> 01:18:54,705
Are you drinking,
Prof. Tripp, right now?

1235
01:18:54,745 --> 01:18:56,905
No.

1236
01:18:56,985 --> 01:19:01,224
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you
in my office Monday morning.

1237
01:19:07,023 --> 01:19:08,863
Oh, boy.

1238
01:19:37,179 --> 01:19:39,819
- Sara, what-
- I tried to call, but...

1239
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:43,498
it seems there's
something wrong...

1240
01:19:43,538 --> 01:19:45,738
with your phone.

1241
01:19:45,778 --> 01:19:49,617
It appears one of our students
is missing...

1242
01:19:49,697 --> 01:19:53,977
and his parents
found a dead dog in his bed.

1243
01:19:54,057 --> 01:19:56,697
It's my fault. I'm sorry.
I've been trying to tell you-

1244
01:19:56,776 --> 01:20:01,576
I'm not feeling very happy
with you right now.

1245
01:20:01,656 --> 01:20:03,656
And more importantly,
Walter isn't very happy.

1246
01:20:03,736 --> 01:20:05,575
He's gotten the police involved.

1247
01:20:05,615 --> 01:20:09,215
They seem to think James Leer is
somehow responsible for all this.

1248
01:20:09,295 --> 01:20:14,894
You wouldn't happen to know
where James Leer is, would you?

1249
01:20:14,934 --> 01:20:17,134
He's inside.

1250
01:20:17,174 --> 01:20:19,733
And Marilyn's jacket?

1251
01:20:21,453 --> 01:20:23,653
Oh, it's in my car.

1252
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:30,612
- Somebody stole my car.
- Oh, man!

1253
01:20:30,652 --> 01:20:32,692
Honestly!
Somebody stole my car!

1254
01:20:32,772 --> 01:20:35,051
I parked it right there
last night!

1255
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:37,171
- Are you sure it was parked there?
- Of course I'm sure! It was-

1256
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:40,331
Oh, Christ. Here comes
the puberty police now.

1257
01:20:40,371 --> 01:20:43,530
Okay, okay, I'll deal with this.
You go dig up James.

1258
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:54,489
Is he awake?

1259
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:58,048
There's a police officer on
the porch, and he's not going away.

1260
01:20:58,128 --> 01:21:01,168
- That same guy?
- Same one.

1261
01:21:01,248 --> 01:21:05,247
No offense, Prof. Tripp,
but you look sort of crappy.

1262
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,847
He's right. I mean,
you do look horrible.

1263
01:21:07,887 --> 01:21:11,686
It's the chancellor.

1264
01:21:11,806 --> 01:21:14,166
- We're fine. We're just fine.
- Fine, right.

1265
01:21:14,246 --> 01:21:17,486
- Fit as a fuckin' fiddle.
- James...

1266
01:21:17,566 --> 01:21:20,245
come on.

1267
01:21:20,325 --> 01:21:24,005
Uh, James,
this book of yours?

1268
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:27,884
It's... not bad.
It's not bad at all.

1269
01:21:28,004 --> 01:21:31,484
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1270
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:37,523
I'm wanna publish this.

1271
01:21:37,603 --> 01:21:41,402
I think with the proper
editorial guidance...

1272
01:21:41,482 --> 01:21:43,362
this could be brilliant.

1273
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:45,282
Aw, that's great.
That's great.

1274
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:49,681
Between Officer Pupcik and you,
he can be the next Jean Genet.

1275
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:52,881
Been a long time since somebody
wrote a really good book in jail.

1276
01:21:52,961 --> 01:21:56,760
Don't you worry, James.
We 're gonna figure something out.

1277
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,440
I'm not worried. You're
not worried, are you, Prof. Tripp?

1278
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,719
I'm a little worried, James.

1279
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:07,439
Don't be.
I don't care if they expel me.

1280
01:22:07,519 --> 01:22:09,399
I probably should be expelled.

1281
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:11,438
Well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

1282
01:22:14,398 --> 01:22:16,278
Prof. Tripp.

1283
01:22:16,358 --> 01:22:20,117
- Yes, James?
- Even if I end up going to jail...

1284
01:22:20,197 --> 01:22:22,437
you're still the best teacher
I ever had.

1285
01:22:29,156 --> 01:22:31,316
I wonder if this is
what the university has in mind...

1286
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:34,115
when it promises
a liberal education.

1287
01:22:35,315 --> 01:22:37,515
Walter wouldn't really
press charges, would he?

1288
01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:39,434
We'll know soon enough.

1289
01:22:39,514 --> 01:22:40,434
In a couple of hours...

1290
01:22:40,514 --> 01:22:42,394
he's gonna sit down with
the police and James' parents...

1291
01:22:42,434 --> 01:22:45,354
and he was a wee bit prickly
this morning.

1292
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:51,673
You didn't happen to call
our house last night, did you?

1293
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:54,752
I think I might have, yes.

1294
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:57,672
What do you think
you might have said?

1295
01:22:57,752 --> 01:23:01,311
I think I might have said
I was in love with you.

1296
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:05,351
He told you.

1297
01:23:05,431 --> 01:23:08,630
- He told me.
- And what did you say?

1298
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:11,510
I said it didn't
sound like you.

1299
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:27,988
Hey, Tripp!

1300
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:33,947
So, what do we do now?

1301
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:36,707
Find the jacket!

1302
01:23:36,787 --> 01:23:38,866
Exactly how do we do that?

1303
01:23:38,906 --> 01:23:40,906
I've got an idea
where it is.

1304
01:23:40,986 --> 01:23:44,346
We could ask Hannah
if we could borrow her car.

1305
01:23:44,426 --> 01:23:49,385
Sure. Keys are on the desk,
next to your book.

1306
01:23:53,304 --> 01:23:55,224
I didn't finish it.
Fell asleep.

1307
01:23:55,344 --> 01:23:57,784
Oh, it's that good, huh?

1308
01:23:57,864 --> 01:23:59,704
It's not that. It's just-

1309
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:03,103
It's just... what?

1310
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,141
Grady, you know how in class...

1311
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:17,341
how you're always telling us
that writers make choices?

1312
01:24:17,421 --> 01:24:19,581
Yeah.

1313
01:24:19,661 --> 01:24:21,981
And even though your book
is really beautiful...

1314
01:24:22,061 --> 01:24:24,660
I mean, amazingly
beautiful, it's-

1315
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:28,100
It's, at times, it's, uh-

1316
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:31,979
Very detailed. Uh-

1317
01:24:32,059 --> 01:24:35,419
You know, with the genealogies
of everyone's horses...

1318
01:24:35,499 --> 01:24:38,698
and the dental record s
and so on and-

1319
01:24:38,778 --> 01:24:42,818
And I could be wrong, but it just,
it sort of reads in places like-

1320
01:24:44,337 --> 01:24:46,177
You didn't really
make any choices.

1321
01:24:49,377 --> 01:24:51,257
At all.

1322
01:24:53,216 --> 01:24:56,016
And I was just wondering if
it might not be different if-

1323
01:24:56,056 --> 01:24:58,216
if when you wrote,
you weren't always...

1324
01:25:00,135 --> 01:25:02,135
under the influence.

1325
01:25:09,414 --> 01:25:11,254
Well-

1326
01:25:11,334 --> 01:25:16,693
Well, uh, thank you
for the thought.

1327
01:25:16,733 --> 01:25:19,093
But shocking
as it may sound...

1328
01:25:19,133 --> 01:25:22,732
I am not the first writer
to sip a little weed.

1329
01:25:22,772 --> 01:25:24,652
Furthermore, it might
surprise you to know...

1330
01:25:24,692 --> 01:25:27,092
that one book I wrote as you say
"under the influence"...

1331
01:25:27,132 --> 01:25:30,131
just happened to win a little
something called the PE N Award...

1332
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:33,291
which, by the way,
I accepted under the influence.

1333
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:47,809
Hey, let me
help you with that.

1334
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:50,449
- Don't touch it.
- Okay. I'll drive.

1335
01:25:55,008 --> 01:25:57,968
Let me get this straight.
Jerry Nathan owes you money...

1336
01:25:58,007 --> 01:26:00,127
so as collateral,
he gives you his car.

1337
01:26:00,207 --> 01:26:02,047
Only I'm beginning to think
that the car...

1338
01:26:02,127 --> 01:26:03,967
...wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.

1339
01:26:04,047 --> 01:26:05,886
Ah, so whose car was it?

1340
01:26:05,926 --> 01:26:08,806
- My guess? Vernon Hard apple.
- The hood jumper?

1341
01:26:08,846 --> 01:26:12,606
He said a few things that lead me
to believe that the car was his.

1342
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:15,245
- Such as?
- "That's my car, motherfucker. "

1343
01:26:17,445 --> 01:26:19,725
All right, so we find Vernon,
we find the car.

1344
01:26:19,805 --> 01:26:22,764
- We find the car-
- We find the jacket.

1345
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:35,842
Wow. Christ!
How'd you know, Tripp?

1346
01:26:37,482 --> 01:26:39,242
Oh, I don't know.

1347
01:26:39,322 --> 01:26:41,642
- Let's just call it a hunch.
- I call it genius.

1348
01:26:41,682 --> 01:26:45,321
Good to know I'm still
talented at something.

1349
01:26:45,361 --> 01:26:47,721
Careful.

1350
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:50,560
Keep that motor running.

1351
01:27:45,953 --> 01:27:48,033
I know you.

1352
01:27:49,312 --> 01:27:51,192
Double Dickel
on the rocks.

1353
01:27:53,752 --> 01:27:55,592
Oola.

1354
01:27:55,672 --> 01:27:57,871
I never forget a drink.

1355
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:05,470
I never forget an Oola.

1356
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,870
Forget me?

1357
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:10,710
- Vernon?
- Go inside, cupcake. He's got a gun.

1358
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:14,069
- Who's got a gun?
- You've got a gun! Drop it!

1359
01:28:14,109 --> 01:28:16,789
- Uh-oh.
- Vernon, relax.

1360
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:19,388
- Why is he calling you Vernon?
- Why is he sitting in my car?

1361
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:22,748
He's crazy, that's why!
He probably calls everybody Vernon.

1362
01:28:22,788 --> 01:28:24,948
- Now drop that gun!
- Oh, dear.

1363
01:28:24,988 --> 01:28:27,387
It's a souvenir. They don't
even have caps for this thing.

1364
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,347
- It's a souvenir.
- Bullshit!

1365
01:28:29,427 --> 01:28:31,507
I know a gun when I see one,
and that's a gun!

1366
01:28:31,547 --> 01:28:32,866
No! No, really-

1367
01:28:32,946 --> 01:28:34,706
Oh, God! Oh!

1368
01:28:34,746 --> 01:28:37,786
Gimme that gun!
Are you crazy?

1369
01:28:37,866 --> 01:28:41,585
Can't you see the condition
my girl's in? Get out! Get out!

1370
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:44,665
Hey! Stop!

1371
01:28:44,745 --> 01:28:46,665
Cupcake, you okay?

1372
01:28:46,745 --> 01:28:49,544
Tripp, run!

1373
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:52,824
Who in the hell is that?

1374
01:28:52,864 --> 01:28:56,823
- Oh, shit!
- Vernon, don 't - No! Don't shoot!

1375
01:28:56,863 --> 01:28:58,943
- Oh, no! Don't!
- Don't shoot!

1376
01:28:59,023 --> 01:29:01,143
Come on, Tripp!
Jump in! Run!

1377
01:29:01,183 --> 01:29:03,582
He's a crazy man.

1378
01:29:14,301 --> 01:29:17,061
Oh, my God.

1379
01:29:30,819 --> 01:29:32,698
I take it back.

1380
01:29:32,738 --> 01:29:35,258
Shoot him.

1381
01:29:39,138 --> 01:29:42,777
Naturally, you have copies.

1382
01:29:42,857 --> 01:29:46,457
I have an alternate version
of the first chapter.

1383
01:29:46,497 --> 01:29:48,216
You'll be all right, then.
Look at-

1384
01:29:48,256 --> 01:29:50,176
Look at Carlyle
when he lost his luggage.

1385
01:29:50,256 --> 01:29:53,296
- That was Macaulay.
- Oh.

1386
01:29:53,336 --> 01:29:56,295
Well, what about Hemingway
when Hadley lost all those stories?

1387
01:29:56,375 --> 01:29:58,935
He was never able
to reproduce them.

1388
01:29:59,095 --> 01:30:02,134
Look, Tripp, I don't wanna
depreciate the loss here...

1389
01:30:02,214 --> 01:30:05,814
but maybe, you know,
in a sense, it's for the best.

1390
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:08,773
You suggesting
it's some kind of sign?

1391
01:30:08,853 --> 01:30:10,853
- In a sense.
- In my experience...

1392
01:30:10,933 --> 01:30:13,173
signs are usually
a little more subtle.

1393
01:30:13,293 --> 01:30:16,572
Let me get this straight. All that
paper that blew away back there...

1394
01:30:16,692 --> 01:30:18,572
that was the only copy?

1395
01:30:18,652 --> 01:30:20,532
I'm afraid so, yes.

1396
01:30:20,572 --> 01:30:24,691
And you, you're saying
that it's some kind of a sign?

1397
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:26,611
Man, what in the fuck
the matter with you?

1398
01:30:26,691 --> 01:30:28,531
Don't.

1399
01:30:28,611 --> 01:30:32,410
All I'm saying is that
sometimes, subconsciously...

1400
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:34,530
a person will put themselves
in a situation...

1401
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:36,850
perhaps even create
that situation...

1402
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:40,689
in order to have an arena in which
to work out an unresolved issue.

1403
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:43,409
It's a covert way, if you will,
of addressing a problem.

1404
01:30:43,529 --> 01:30:45,369
I'll tell you
the problem.

1405
01:30:45,449 --> 01:30:48,248
You behind the wheel,
there's your problem.

1406
01:30:48,328 --> 01:30:51,128
Did you or did you not
have a gun to his head?

1407
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:53,807
- Watch the road, please.
- He was trying to steal my car.

1408
01:30:53,927 --> 01:30:55,967
Did you or did you not
have a gun to his head?

1409
01:30:56,047 --> 01:30:57,807
All right! All right!

1410
01:30:57,927 --> 01:30:59,767
That's enough!
That is enough!

1411
01:30:59,847 --> 01:31:03,806
What is done is done! I don't
wanna hear about it anymore, okay?

1412
01:31:18,524 --> 01:31:21,404
So what was it about,
your book?

1413
01:31:23,403 --> 01:31:25,803
What was the story?

1414
01:31:27,803 --> 01:31:29,683
I don't know.

1415
01:31:29,763 --> 01:31:31,002
What he means is...

1416
01:31:31,082 --> 01:31:33,522
it's difficult to distill
the essence of a book sometimes...

1417
01:31:33,642 --> 01:31:35,402
because it lives in the mind.

1418
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:37,481
But you got to know
what it was about, right?

1419
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:40,921
If you didn't know what it
was about, why were you writing it?

1420
01:31:44,521 --> 01:31:46,400
I couldn't stop.

1421
01:31:57,119 --> 01:31:58,959
Vernon, can I
ask you a question?

1422
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:04,398
Boy or girl?

1423
01:32:10,277 --> 01:32:13,837
As long as it looks like her...

1424
01:32:13,957 --> 01:32:16,356
- I really don't care.
- You-

1425
01:32:16,436 --> 01:32:18,316
You know what I'm saying?

1426
01:32:18,396 --> 01:32:20,316
Yeah.

1427
01:32:21,795 --> 01:32:23,675
- Thanks for the ride, Vernon.
- Anytime.

1428
01:32:23,715 --> 01:32:26,115
- And another thing.
- Yeah?

1429
01:32:26,155 --> 01:32:29,234
- Stop calling me Vernon.
- Okay.

1430
01:32:29,314 --> 01:32:32,714
- Jacket, Tripp.
- What?

1431
01:32:32,834 --> 01:32:34,994
We need the jacket.

1432
01:32:35,074 --> 01:32:37,153
Oh, right.

1433
01:32:40,993 --> 01:32:42,873
Oola, about that jacket-

1434
01:32:42,913 --> 01:32:44,952
Yeah.

1435
01:32:45,032 --> 01:32:47,152
It used to belong
to Marilyn Monroe.

1436
01:32:48,752 --> 01:32:50,592
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1437
01:32:50,672 --> 01:32:52,951
She had small shoulders...

1438
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:55,191
just like you.

1439
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:57,471
A lot of people
don't know that.

1440
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:01,710
Thank you.

1441
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:05,150
Man, that book of yours
must have been one nutty ride.

1442
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,349
Come on, baby. Let's go.

1443
01:33:19,108 --> 01:33:21,507
Would you mind explaining to me
what you just did?

1444
01:33:21,547 --> 01:33:23,547
Came to my senses.

1445
01:33:23,627 --> 01:33:26,787
Oh. Congratulations. Meanwhile,
what's James supposed to do?

1446
01:33:26,907 --> 01:33:28,746
Pray that Walter Gaskell
comes to his?

1447
01:33:28,826 --> 01:33:32,146
Walter Gaskell doesn't wanna
send James Leer to jail.

1448
01:33:32,226 --> 01:33:34,106
He's up in his office
right now.

1449
01:33:34,146 --> 01:33:37,185
He's talking to his parents,
local police...

1450
01:33:37,305 --> 01:33:39,145
trying to find a solution.

1451
01:33:39,225 --> 01:33:41,585
Tripp, the least
they're gonna do is expel him.

1452
01:33:41,665 --> 01:33:44,704
It doesn't matter.

1453
01:33:44,784 --> 01:33:46,624
That's very enlightening,
Professor.

1454
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,624
It's comforting to know
that America's children...

1455
01:33:48,704 --> 01:33:50,263
have you for a teacher.

1456
01:33:50,343 --> 01:33:52,903
Nobody teaches
a writer anything.

1457
01:33:53,023 --> 01:33:54,863
You tell 'em what you know.

1458
01:33:54,943 --> 01:33:56,823
You tell 'em to find their voice
and stay with it.

1459
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:58,782
You tell the ones
that have it to keep at it.

1460
01:33:58,862 --> 01:34:00,742
You tell the ones that don't
have it to keep at it too...

1461
01:34:00,822 --> 01:34:04,382
because that's the only way they're
gonna get to where they're going.

1462
01:34:04,502 --> 01:34:08,381
Of course, it does help
if you know where you wanna go.

1463
01:34:09,741 --> 01:34:13,500
Helping my students
figure that out...

1464
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:16,500
that and Sara...

1465
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:20,259
that's what's made
these last years worthwhile.

1466
01:34:23,259 --> 01:34:26,778
As for James, well,
he doesn't really need me anymore.

1467
01:34:26,858 --> 01:34:28,698
He's got you.

1468
01:34:30,218 --> 01:34:34,777
Me? What can I do?

1469
01:34:34,897 --> 01:34:36,737
Oh, I don't know, Crabs.

1470
01:34:36,817 --> 01:34:38,657
Improvise.

1471
01:34:38,737 --> 01:34:41,257
You're pretty good at that.

1472
01:34:45,896 --> 01:34:47,736
Tripp.

1473
01:34:51,775 --> 01:34:53,655
I'm sorry.

1474
01:35:05,373 --> 01:35:07,253
Improvise.

1475
01:35:07,413 --> 01:35:10,373
As for me,
I was through improvising.

1476
01:35:10,453 --> 01:35:14,572
I knew what I had to do.
I had to find Sara.

1477
01:35:14,652 --> 01:35:18,931
I had to convince her
that she was my choice...

1478
01:35:18,971 --> 01:35:21,811
that, in fact, she had been
from the very beginning.

1479
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:36,689
And now, as those of you who've been
with us in previous years know...

1480
01:35:36,769 --> 01:35:39,769
we have a tradition of sorts
here at WordFest.

1481
01:35:39,889 --> 01:35:42,568
I'm speaking, of course,
of the Plums...

1482
01:35:42,648 --> 01:35:44,568
those fortunate local writers...

1483
01:35:44,688 --> 01:35:47,608
who have successfully
placed their manuscripts...

1484
01:35:47,728 --> 01:35:51,007
with visiting publishers'
representatives.

1485
01:35:51,127 --> 01:35:53,927
This weekend, Susan Lowery
of North Braddock...

1486
01:35:53,967 --> 01:35:56,806
found a publisher
for her children's book...

1487
01:35:56,846 --> 01:35:58,206
The Loneliest Prawn.

1488
01:35:58,286 --> 01:36:02,925
Stand up, Susan.

1489
01:36:11,084 --> 01:36:16,644
No w, this next one is, I think,
very exciting to announce...

1490
01:36:16,684 --> 01:36:20,323
because it concerns
a student here at the university.

1491
01:36:20,363 --> 01:36:22,323
Our own James Leer...

1492
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:25,562
sophomore
in English Literature...

1493
01:36:25,642 --> 01:36:29,042
has found a publisher
for his first novel...

1494
01:36:29,122 --> 01:36:33,401
which I believe is called...
"The Lovely Parade."

1495
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:38,321
- Love Parade.
- Love Parade.

1496
01:36:38,401 --> 01:36:42,640
- James?
- Stand up. Go on.

1497
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,239
He's a real alien probe,
if you know what I mean.

1498
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:51,119
Take a bow, James!

1499
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:19,875
Wonder boy.

1500
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:31,473
And finally, and perhaps
not least importantly...

1501
01:37:31,553 --> 01:37:35,713
Terry Crabtree of Bartizan has also
decided to publish my own book...

1502
01:37:35,793 --> 01:37:39,872
a critical exploration of
the union of Joe DiMaggio...

1503
01:37:39,912 --> 01:37:41,792
and Marilyn Monroe...

1504
01:37:41,832 --> 01:37:44,712
and its function
in American mythopoetics...

1505
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,951
which, tentatively,
I have entitled...

1506
01:37:48,031 --> 01:37:50,791
The Last American Marriage.

1507
01:37:50,831 --> 01:37:55,790
So, until next year,
thank you, everyone.

1508
01:38:14,748 --> 01:38:16,227
Grady, I took another look...

1509
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,027
at The Arsonist's Daughter
the other night.

1510
01:38:18,107 --> 01:38:21,027
That description of the bald
cypress left me breathless.

1511
01:38:21,107 --> 01:38:23,306
Thanks, Q.
I appreciate that.

1512
01:38:48,143 --> 01:38:50,143
Sara!

1513
01:39:25,378 --> 01:39:27,258
Yo, Traxler.

1514
01:39:30,417 --> 01:39:33,857
Hey, Prof. Tripp.

1515
01:39:33,937 --> 01:39:38,696
- You get high, Sam?
- Only when I'm workin'.

1516
01:39:51,254 --> 01:39:53,654
Holy shit.

1517
01:39:53,694 --> 01:39:56,294
Are you serious?

1518
01:39:58,813 --> 01:40:01,213
Careful there,
Prof. Tripp.

1519
01:40:07,732 --> 01:40:10,252
Whoa.

1520
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:17,171
I didn't fall.

1521
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:20,810
Not then, not ever again.

1522
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:24,490
Once the Monongahela River
swallowed my never-ending opus...

1523
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:26,970
there were no more spells.

1524
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:30,289
James Leer didn't
get expelled or go to jail...

1525
01:40:30,369 --> 01:40:32,969
thanks to Crabtree's
wheeling and dealing.

1526
01:40:33,009 --> 01:40:34,929
But he quit anyway,
went to New York...

1527
01:40:34,969 --> 01:40:37,648
to rework his novel
for publication.

1528
01:40:37,688 --> 01:40:42,008
Hannah Green has decided to take
a position as a junior editor...

1529
01:40:42,088 --> 01:40:43,927
when she graduates.

1530
01:40:44,007 --> 01:40:48,767
And Crabtree, well, Crabtree's
gone right on being Crabtree.

1531
01:40:48,847 --> 01:40:51,886
As for me,
I lost everything.

1532
01:40:51,966 --> 01:40:54,686
my wife, my book, my job...

1533
01:40:54,766 --> 01:40:57,525
everything that I thought
was important.

1534
01:40:57,605 --> 01:41:00,285
But I finally knew
where I wanted to go.

1535
01:41:32,601 --> 01:41:35,320
And now I had someone
to help me get there.

1536
01:41:54,998 --> 01:41:58,437
A worried man
with a worried mind

1537
01:41:58,517 --> 01:42:01,477
No one in front of me
and nothin' behind

1538
01:42:01,517 --> 01:42:04,636
There's a woman on my left
and she's

1539
01:42:04,676 --> 01:42:06,596
Drinkin' champagne

1540
01:42:09,516 --> 01:42:13,035
Got white skin
Got assassin's eyes

1541
01:42:13,115 --> 01:42:16,115
I'm lookin ' up into
the sapphire-tinted skies

1542
01:42:16,195 --> 01:42:18,235
I'm well-dressed

1543
01:42:18,315 --> 01:42:21,274
Waitin' on the last train

1544
01:42:23,834 --> 01:42:28,513
Standin' on the gallows
with my head in a noose

1545
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:34,072
Any minute now
I'm expecting all hell

1546
01:42:34,152 --> 01:42:36,232
To break loose

1547
01:42:38,632 --> 01:42:41,711
People are crazy
and times are strange

1548
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:45,471
I'm locked in tight
I'm out of range

1549
01:42:45,511 --> 01:42:48,310
I used to care, but

1550
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:50,470
Things have changed

1551
01:43:07,788 --> 01:43:10,827
This place ain't doing me
any good

1552
01:43:10,907 --> 01:43:14,547
I'm in the wrong town
I should be in Hollywood

1553
01:43:14,627 --> 01:43:19,386
Just for a second there, I
thought I saw something move

1554
01:43:21,426 --> 01:43:23,506
Gonna take dancing lessons

1555
01:43:23,586 --> 01:43:25,425
Do the jitterbug rag

1556
01:43:25,505 --> 01:43:28,945
Ain't no shortcuts
Gonna dress in drag

1557
01:43:29,025 --> 01:43:35,024
Only a fool in here would think
he's got anything to prove

1558
01:43:36,544 --> 01:43:38,664
Lot of water
under the bridge

1559
01:43:38,744 --> 01:43:41,183
Lot of other stuff too

1560
01:43:43,783 --> 01:43:46,863
Don't get up, gentlemen
I'm only

1561
01:43:46,943 --> 01:43:48,942
Passin' through

1562
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:54,941
People are crazy
and times are strange

1563
01:43:54,981 --> 01:43:58,261
I'm locked in tight
I'm out of range

1564
01:43:58,301 --> 01:44:01,021
I used to care, but

1565
01:44:01,061 --> 01:44:03,900
Things have changed

1566
01:44:19,658 --> 01:44:23,258
I've been walkin'
40 miles of bad road

1567
01:44:23,338 --> 01:44:26,777
If the Bible is right
the world will explode

1568
01:44:26,857 --> 01:44:30,817
I've been trying to get
as far away from myself

1569
01:44:30,897 --> 01:44:32,736
As I can

1570
01:44:35,096 --> 01:44:38,576
Some things are
too hot to touch

1571
01:44:38,616 --> 01:44:41,655
The human mind
can only stand so much

1572
01:44:41,695 --> 01:44:44,175
You can't win

1573
01:44:44,215 --> 01:44:47,694
With a losing hand

1574
01:44:48,934 --> 01:44:51,254
Feel like falling in love

1575
01:44:51,334 --> 01:44:53,653
With the first woman I meet

1576
01:44:55,693 --> 01:44:57,693
Putting her
in a wheel barrow

1577
01:44:57,773 --> 01:45:01,612
And wheeling her
down the street

1578
01:45:03,532 --> 01:45:07,012
People are crazy
and times are strange

1579
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:10,531
I'm locked in tight
I'm out of range

1580
01:45:10,611 --> 01:45:13,371
I used to care, but

1581
01:45:13,451 --> 01:45:15,650
Things have changed

1582
01:45:32,048 --> 01:45:33,928
I hurt easy

1583
01:45:33,968 --> 01:45:35,848
I just don't show it

1584
01:45:35,888 --> 01:45:39,607
You can hurt someone
and not even know it

1585
01:45:39,687 --> 01:45:44,447
The next 60 seconds
could be like an eternity

1586
01:45:46,206 --> 01:45:48,086
Gonna get lowdown

1587
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:50,246
Gonna fly high

1588
01:45:50,286 --> 01:45:54,005
All the truth in the world
adds up to one big lie

1589
01:45:54,085 --> 01:45:59,085
I'm in love with a woman
who don't even appeal to me

1590
01:46:00,684 --> 01:46:05,844
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy
they jumped in the lake

1591
01:46:08,883 --> 01:46:14,243
I'm not that eager
to make a mistake

1592
01:46:15,722 --> 01:46:19,002
People are crazy
and times are strange

1593
01:46:19,082 --> 01:46:22,521
I'm locked in tight
I'm out of range

1594
01:46:22,601 --> 01:46:25,521
I used to care, but

1595
01:46:25,601 --> 01:46:29,281
Things have changed
