I saw a girl who looked upset

328
00:22:01,908 --> 00:22:03,261
and I made sure that she was all right

329
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:05,982

to do a spot of meditation.

Has anybody ever told you
that you have great eyes?

343
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,332
Oh, sorry. Are we in Stringfellows?
No, really, you do.

344

Make an effort.
No, you do. You have great eyes.

Which is lucky.
Lucky?

346
00:23:14,782 --> 00:23:18,331
Yeah. Because they tend
to pull focus from your nose.

347
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:20,373
What's wrong with my nose?
Nothing's wrong with your nose.

You have a great nose.
You have a great fuckin' nose.

Are you seriously trying to tell me

Not big.
Well, what, then?

351
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:32,012
What I'm sayin' is that it doesn't
matter what kind of nose you have,

352
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,576
because those eyes
will always overpower it.

Overpower?!
You happen to have a beautiful nose.

354
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,096
My point is that
those eyes are so good

355
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,293
that even if you had
a ridiculous nose it wouldn't matter,

which you don't.

But if you did, I wouldn't notice,
which I didn't until now.

always used to say to me,

798
00:49:52,011 --> 00:49:56,527
"You stay in the game long enough,
the cards'll eventually turn up."

799
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:59,370
The lottery of life.
He sounds like a wise man.

800
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:03,325
He was. And he was killed
by the thing he loved.

801
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:05,407
Great way to go.
Shame it was a train.

802
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,078
But he died happy.

803
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,724
I just hope he got the number.
[LAUGHS]

804
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,966
Have you ever thought about it?

805
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,683
What?
How you'd like to die?

806
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,280
Have you?
God, yes.

807
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:23,526
I've narrowed it down to two exits.

808
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,208
Peacefully in my sleep,

809
00:50:25,409 --> 00:50:28,207
or drowned in a Jacuzzi
after an overdose of champagne

810
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:31,718
poured down my throat
by Thierry Henry.

811
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,681
You be careful what you wish for.
I'm safe. He's married.

812
00:50:34,888 --> 00:50:37,197
He's a footballer.
He's not the affair type.

813
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:40,956
He's a French footballer.
You haven't answered my question.

814
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,635
What?
Have you thought about it?

815
00:50:43,847 --> 00:50:46,645
Actually, I have.
Well?

816
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:48,917
Murdered by a jealous husband.

817
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:50,685
Now stop being morbid.
Do you want a cigarette?

818
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:52,525
I quit.
When?

819
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:54,603
At Mum and Dad's.
They don't know I smoke.

820
00:50:54,806 --> 00:50:56,205
How old are you?
That's not the point.

821
00:50:56,406 --> 00:50:59,842
It would upset them.
But you're a...

822
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:02,037
A what?
A smoker.

823
00:51:02,246 --> 00:51:03,884
Well, I'm not any more.

824
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:05,234
Okay.

825
00:51:06,885 --> 00:51:09,445
Do you mind if I smoke?
No.

826
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:18,122
Can I bring up the "H" word?

827
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:20,758
Oh, come on, babe.
We need to go away.

828
00:51:20,964 --> 00:51:23,956
When was the last time
you had a holiday?

829
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,155
I don't do holidays.
You know that.

830
00:51:26,364 --> 00:51:30,276
I know, but, well,
I'm just thinking about you.

831
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,476
Dah-dah!

832
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:39,354
Two tickets. The Mariott Hotel
on Spaniards Beach in...

833
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,996
Barbados.
Yeah.

834
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,116
How on earth did I find you?

835
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:48,272
I found you, remember?

836
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,397
[MEN CHATTER AND LAUGH]

837
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:34,112
Eve.

838
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,637
Why don't we go
and get an ice-cream?

839
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,672
Again?
Some days you need two ice-creams.

840
00:52:41,478 --> 00:52:43,069
And it just so happens

841
00:52:43,277 --> 00:52:45,427
this is one of those days.

842
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,072
There's more to life
than thoughts. There's actions.

843
00:52:54,277 --> 00:52:59,191
Yeah. What sort of actions
are playing on your mind?

844
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:01,068
Kids.
Kids?

845
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:02,629
Kids.

846
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:05,396
Do you think you could
not shout the word "kids"
while we're sitting here?

847
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:08,587
People might think we're,
um, teachers or something.

848
00:53:08,795 --> 00:53:11,184
I'm serious.
So am I.

849
00:53:11,395 --> 00:53:13,272
Kids?!
Now you're doing it.

850
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:15,591
You want to talk about them,
or you want to have them?

851
00:53:15,795 --> 00:53:18,707
I think I do. I think
I really want to have them.

852
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:21,474
Uh, Billy, you're gay.
So are you.

853
00:53:21,674 --> 00:53:23,471
It doesn't fuckin' matter
any more. We can adopt.

854
00:53:23,674 --> 00:53:26,142
I know we're legally
allowed to adopt, but...

855
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:27,582
But what?

856
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:29,432
But...

857
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:33,023
I'm not ready.
You're not ready? You're in your 40s.

858
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,349
I know straight men in their 40s
who aren't ready.

859
00:53:35,553 --> 00:53:37,225
Yeah, but that's different.
How's it different?

860
00:53:37,433 --> 00:53:39,469
Well, it's not down to them.
It's not down to them?

861
00:53:39,673 --> 00:53:40,867
No, it's the woman's choice.

862
00:53:41,073 --> 00:53:43,507
A straight man can remove
any sense of responsibility.

863
00:53:43,712 --> 00:53:45,065
We don't have that luxury.

864
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:47,502
That is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard,

865
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:49,270
and I've lived with you for 15 years.

866
00:53:49,472 --> 00:53:52,066
Look, I think they would be
a great addition to our relationship.

867
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:55,786
You can't have kids to add to your
relationship. You have kids 'cause...

868
00:53:55,991 --> 00:53:58,380
you wanna have kids.
Exactly.

869
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:01,864
They're not just for Christmas.
You know what you're like.

870
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:03,709
You'll be bored within a month,
and sending them back

871
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:05,503
to whatever godforsaken home
they came from.

872
00:54:05,711 --> 00:54:08,349
Don't be ridiculous. Look,
I think they would be great for us.

873
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,099
But would we be great for them? Why
does nobody ever ask that question?

874
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,983
I'm fed up with seeing people
start families just 'cause they can.

875
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,021
What about the kids?
What about what they want?

876
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,982
Oh, you sound like Cliff Richard.
Stop.

877
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,578
I'm serious. It's all, " Look at us,
aren't we great for having a child?

878
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,108
"Aren't we great
for calling it Taramasalata?

879
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:25,459
"Aren't we great for adding
to the population of the world

880
00:54:25,669 --> 00:54:27,546
"and filling it full
of our insecurities and fears?

881
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:29,899
"Aren't we great?"
Jesus.

882
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:33,896
If there's one good thing about being
gay, it's that we are, by definition,
environmentally friendly.

883
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:35,257
And that's it, is it?

884
00:54:35,468 --> 00:54:38,824
Well, no, we can also dress well
without fear of ridicule.

885
00:54:40,868 --> 00:54:42,460
It might help me settle down.

886
00:54:42,668 --> 00:54:44,499
You're doing it again.

887
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:46,459
"Let's have kids
because it'll make my life better."

888
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,861
Do you seriously think
people should have kids

889
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:49,739
for purely altruistic reasons?

890
00:54:49,947 --> 00:54:51,824
Altruistic? Have you been
secretly reading my books?

891
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:56,418
We are all here because
two people needed something more
in their life than what they had.

892
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,423
What's wrong with that?

893
00:54:58,626 --> 00:55:01,015
My parents didn't speak to one
another for a year before I was born,

894
00:55:01,226 --> 00:55:03,217
and then I came along
and everything got better.

895
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:06,463
And they don't regret me
coming along, and I certainly don't.

896
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,257
I mean, admittedly, they haven't
spoken to me in over ten years,

897
00:55:09,465 --> 00:55:11,820
but they didn't know they were
creating a sexual deviant.

898
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:14,778
Your parents are cave dwellers.
They are a bad example.

899
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:16,259
Yeah, but, look, my point is...

900
00:55:17,225 --> 00:55:19,785
that I am the result
of truly selfish behaviour

901
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,179
and I'm fuckin' made up about it.

902
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:25,695
I can see.

903
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:30,179
I love you, Brian.

904
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:32,261
And I think
having a child would be a...

905
00:55:32,464 --> 00:55:34,818
An amazing expression of how I feel.

906
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:38,140
I know that sounds a bit Cliff.

907
00:55:38,343 --> 00:55:41,335
I just think there are
enough parents in the world.

908
00:55:41,543 --> 00:55:43,499
Yeah, that's why they're
closing down all the orphanages.

909
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:44,772
I love kids as much as anyone else.

910
00:55:44,983 --> 00:55:46,381
I've got seven godchildren,
for fuck's sake.

911
00:55:46,582 --> 00:55:48,937
You have seven godchildren, because
you can't have any of your own

912
00:55:49,142 --> 00:55:50,700
and people feel sorry for you.
Do they, bollocks!

913
00:55:50,902 --> 00:55:53,018
They think it's cool to have
a gay influence. It's North London.

914
00:55:53,222 --> 00:55:55,053
Yeah, well, all that would stop.
No more godkids.

915
00:55:55,262 --> 00:55:56,536
You'd be a father.
What would you be?

916
00:55:56,742 --> 00:55:57,810
A father.
Two fathers!

917
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,091
What a nightmare.
No, it's better than two mothers.

918
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:03,259
That is sexist.
You've met my mother.

919
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:05,410
Fair enough.

920
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,216
We'd have to move.
You're thinking about it?

921
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,375
I think we'd have to move.

922
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,535
But you don't think
it's out of the question.

923
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,537
I don't know what I think.
I think I'll have to have a think.

924
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,015
Well, that's all I ask, Bri.

925
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:26,373
Are you sure you wanna do this?

926
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:30,174
No, I'm not sure. It just
keeps playing on my mind.

927
00:56:30,379 --> 00:56:34,530
There are things to consider.
Of course.

928
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:36,808
One of us
would have to give up work.

929
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,610
Would we? Why?
Well, of course.

930
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:40,774
You can't bring up a baby
if you're both working.

931
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:42,172
Why? People do it all the time.

932
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:44,573
Yeah, look at the little wankers
they produce. No, I'm clear about that.

933
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:46,495
If you're gonna commit
to having a child,

934
00:56:46,697 --> 00:56:48,733
then one of you's got to stay at home.

935
00:56:48,937 --> 00:56:50,290
I had no idea
you were so old-fashioned.

936
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,886
No, I just don't believe
you can do a good job with a child

937
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:54,132
if you're both
as interested in your work.

938
00:56:54,337 --> 00:56:56,612
That's just how I feel.
Oh.

939
00:56:56,817 --> 00:57:00,286
No, maybe you're right.
No, it's just how I feel.

940
00:57:03,016 --> 00:57:06,167
So, how much do you earn?
You know how much I earn.

941
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:08,094
Considerably less than me.
Yeah.

942
00:57:08,296 --> 00:57:11,014
So, then, I suppose
it would have to be you.

943
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:14,173
You cannot make judgements on
a financial basis. That's ridiculous.

944
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:15,933
I bring in almost twice what you do.

945
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:17,284
If we're going to be
supporting a family,

946
00:57:17,495 --> 00:57:19,929
then, by your reckoning,
you'd have to give up work.

947
00:57:20,135 --> 00:57:22,251
That's ridiculous.
Why?

948
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:25,526
'Cause work is about more than
money. It's about who you are.

949
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,406
Well, who are you?

950
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:30,287
I'm a restaurant critic.
Oh. I'm a financial advisor.

951
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:33,054
I get more pleasure out of my work
so you should give up work.

952

Tommy loved spending time...

987
01:00:57,717 --> 01:00:59,548
He was never very big on plans.

01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:02,225

the future was nothing.

That what we had at any given
moment, was what we had.

I suppose he was in a way.

992

Well, I don't know, but I think
I found a certain comfort

1023
01:02:56,667 --> 01:03:00,262
in not being that boy.

1024

I would ask him, what is it
about coloured envelopes
that so intrigued him.

1032
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,096
He could never explain it.

1033
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:31,374
He said he liked them
because they kept on coming,

1034
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:34,735
and his collection got bigger.

What sort of people do you help?

1106
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:53,511
What sort of people?
Yes, I mean, erm...

1107
01:08:53,718 --> 01:08:55,788
poor people,
starving people, black people?

1108
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,227
Black people?
Yes.

1109
01:08:58,437 --> 01:08:59,995
You think black people need help?

1110
01:09:00,197 --> 01:09:03,826
Well...
I think you might need some help.

1111
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:06,870
Well, that's very possibly true,
but I meant Africans, not...

1112
01:09:07,077 --> 01:09:10,149
I meant Africans,
not black people as a race.

1113
01:09:11,876 --> 01:09:13,309
You're wondering
whether I was just being racist.

1114
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,984
No, not whether. Why.
Is that racist?

1115
01:09:16,196 --> 01:09:17,948
Yes.

1116
01:09:18,156 --> 01:09:19,794
It's so tricky nowadays,
don't you think?

1117
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:21,315
Tricky?

1118
01:09:21,516 --> 01:09:25,952
I mean, last week I was told off for
referring to my lovely newsagent

1119
01:09:26,155 --> 01:09:28,350
as coloured.
Instead of Asian.

1120
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:31,115
Asian? No, he's black.

1121
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:36,267
I think you may have been racist.

1122
01:09:36,474 --> 01:09:37,987
Do you?

1123
01:09:38,194 --> 01:09:41,106
Assuming he was Asian
because he was a newsagent,

1124
01:09:41,314 --> 01:09:43,748
when in fact he's from Somalia.

1125
01:09:51,913 --> 01:09:54,791
My mother was asking me about work.
Uh-huh.

1126
01:09:54,993 --> 01:09:57,951
I said it was good.
She didn't believe me.

1127
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:00,871
She's convinced I have
no idea who I am or what I want.

1128
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,142
All mothers think like that.

1129
01:10:03,352 --> 01:10:05,547
It's what connects them
to their children.

1130
01:10:05,752 --> 01:10:07,982
Well, I know she doesn't
really understand what I do,

1131
01:10:08,192 --> 01:10:10,911
but she won't let it go.

1132
01:10:11,112 --> 01:10:13,147
She has no idea what you do?
No.

1133
01:10:13,351 --> 01:10:16,388
All she needs to know
is that I love what I do.

1134
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:20,939
My point exactly.
But she's proud of you.

1135
01:10:21,151 --> 01:10:24,142
How do you know?
Well, you told me.

1136
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,864
Hey, I tell you a lot of things.
I'm like that.

1137
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:30,107
And that's why I love you.
I know.

1138
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:33,620
Excuse me, mate, erm,
can I get a light, please?

1139
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,024
Yeah, sure.

1140
01:10:37,749 --> 01:10:40,183
Very nice.

1141
01:10:40,389 --> 01:10:43,028
I'm sorry?
Um, I said very nice.

1142
01:10:43,229 --> 01:10:45,948
What's very nice?
She looks very nice.

1143
01:10:46,549 --> 01:10:50,302
Oh, do you want to fuck off?
Erm...

1144
01:10:50,508 --> 01:10:52,464
How dare you
fucking talk to me like that?

1145
01:10:52,668 --> 01:10:54,898
Go on, fuck off.

1146
01:10:55,628 --> 01:11:01,179
Erm, sorry. I'm not having
a very good day today. I'm sorry.

1147
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:02,502
Just leave.

1148
01:11:08,707 --> 01:11:10,902
Can you believe that?

1149
01:11:11,987 --> 01:11:13,704
What makes someone
think it's remotely okay

1150
01:11:13,906 --> 01:11:17,740
just to walk up to a man and say,
"Your girlfriend's very nice"?

1151
01:11:17,946 --> 01:11:19,937
"Very nice"?

1152
01:11:20,146 --> 01:11:22,102
Unbelievable.

1153
01:11:22,306 --> 01:11:24,297
There should be a law.

1154
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:27,335
Oh, I've missed you, Louis.

1155
01:11:27,545 --> 01:11:29,501
Yeah? You too.

1156
01:11:39,704 --> 01:11:42,298
[BOTH EXHALE]

1157
01:11:49,183 --> 01:11:51,458
After finally climbing
this infernal hill,

1158
01:11:51,663 --> 01:11:53,415
after all those years
of thinking about it,

1159
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:58,617
what you're saying is, the view
is better from where we were.

1160
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:02,580
Well, on reflection, yes.

1161
01:12:04,662 --> 01:12:06,061
I think you're right.

1162
01:12:07,262 --> 01:12:10,538
It may not be as high,
but it did seem clearer.

1163
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:13,778
I mean, maybe
it's just what we're used to.

1164
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:16,972
I've never been a fan of change.

1165
01:12:17,181 --> 01:12:20,491
Never been a risk taker.
Apparently not.

1166
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:25,458
I'll never be Thierry Henry, you know.

1167
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:26,934
Well, that's good.

1168
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:30,735
It means
you'll never be responsible for
my champagne-infused death.

1169
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:33,932
Why do you like me, Esther?

1170
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,568
Why?
Yeah. Why do you miss me?

1171
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,294
What is it about me that
makes you pleased to see me?

1172
01:12:43,499 --> 01:12:47,697
Are you fishing for compliments?
No. I'm asking for them.

1173
01:12:49,019 --> 01:12:50,736
Okay.

1174
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:56,094
I like you because you're honest.
Mm-hm.

1175
01:12:56,298 --> 01:13:00,496
I like you because you know how
to listen, and you know when not to.

1176
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:02,289
I like you because

1177
01:13:02,497 --> 01:13:05,887
when you take my hand
and when you touch my neck

1178
01:13:06,097 --> 01:13:09,646
you're not just touching, you're...

1179
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:12,410
I don't know.

1180
01:13:12,617 --> 01:13:15,494
I like you.

1181
01:13:15,696 --> 01:13:18,335
Do you want to know why I like you?
I don't know.

1182
01:13:18,536 --> 01:13:22,768
I think sometimes it's good to
never quite know. It's good to guess.

1183
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:24,250
What? Keeps it interesting?

1184
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:26,525
Which is the most important thing
in any relationship,

1185
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,090
no matter what kind.

1186
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:30,250
So you don't want
to know why I like you?

1187
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:32,650
Well, of course I do.
Do you think I'm mad?

1188
01:13:32,855 --> 01:13:33,810
Good, 'cause I'm going to tell you.

1189
01:13:34,015 --> 01:13:35,289
Go on.

1190
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:39,851
I like you because
you don't try and change me.

1191
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:42,443
You just let me be myself.

1192
01:13:44,974 --> 01:13:47,613
Is that it?
That's it.

1193
01:13:48,854 --> 01:13:51,447
There's nothing about my, er...

1194
01:13:51,653 --> 01:13:53,769
wonderful sense of humour?

1195
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:59,172
My long legs? My sensitive touch?
My witty repartee?

1196
01:13:59,373 --> 01:14:00,647
No, those are the reasons I love you.

1197
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,241
We're talking about like.
What?

1198
01:14:03,452 --> 01:14:06,922
It's much easier to love someone
than it is to like them.

1199
01:14:07,132 --> 01:14:08,565
Okay.

1200
01:14:08,772 --> 01:14:10,251
Yeah, I like that.

1201
01:14:10,452 --> 01:14:12,124
Those things I said,
they're why I love you,

1202
01:14:12,332 --> 01:14:13,765
they're not why I like you.
Okay.

1203
01:14:13,972 --> 01:14:15,848
Do you want to know why I like you?

1204
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:19,407
No, I think I know.
I think you do.

1205
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:32,407
When do I see you next?

1206
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:35,602
You tell me.
We're not done yet, are we?

1207
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:39,359
I'm sorry. I've got
things I need to sort out.

1208
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:47,120
And it's one fifty now.
The agency changed the rates.

1209

Worth every penny.
I can't wait for Barbados.

1210
01:14:53,048 --> 01:14:54,276
I can't wait for next time.

1211
01:14:54,488 --> 01:14:58,800
Maybe we could have sex.
That's not how this works.

1212
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:01,124
I know.

1213
01:15:34,045 --> 01:15:36,275
So, you never married?

1214
01:15:36,485 --> 01:15:37,679
No.

1215
01:15:38,845 --> 01:15:41,642
I was married.
Yes.

1216
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:45,881
It was the most wonderful
three and a half months of my life.

1217
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:48,075
Three and a half months?

1218
01:15:48,284 --> 01:15:51,082
Well, you've got to give it a chance.

1219
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:09,920
So, has there never been anyone?

1220
01:16:10,122 --> 01:16:12,716
Oh, yes, I'm not a...

1221
01:16:12,922 --> 01:16:16,835
Relax. I'm talking about love, not sex.

1222
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:19,999
Have you ever been in love?

1223
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:23,594
No.

1224
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:28,680
Never? Not even as a teenager?

1225
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,632
No, absolutely not.

1226
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,549
Does that seem a little odd?

1227
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,279
Odd?

1228
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,550
Well...

1229
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,750
a little, yes.

1230
01:16:41,959 --> 01:16:44,917
I suppose it is. I mean, everywhere I
look, people seem to be falling in love

1231
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:47,553
or talking about it or claiming it.

1232
01:16:47,759 --> 01:16:50,114
Mm. Playing it out.

1233
01:16:54,758 --> 01:16:57,318
Playing it out?

1234
01:16:59,078 --> 01:17:00,716
I like that.

1235
01:17:05,598 --> 01:17:07,553
Do you think I could have another?

1236
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:09,554
Ooh, yes.

1237
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:13,429
I think it is living up
to its billing after all.

Children?
Yes.

Children?
Yes.

that we love and adore,

1243

until they grow up and leave us.

1244
01:17:31,995 --> 01:17:33,269
No, me neither. I hated being one,

1245
01:17:33,475 --> 01:17:35,193
and I've never met one who can
hold down a decent conversation.

1246
01:17:35,395 --> 01:17:39,070
Oh, indeed. I've never met
a parent that can, either.

1247

friends when they become parents.

Oh, God, yes.

for dinner the other night.

You're so right. I knew
he reminded me of someone.

01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:46,143
I'd like to have a child.

1261
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:49,348
Me too.

1262
01:18:56,508 --> 01:18:58,624
They're strange, aren't they?

1263
01:18:58,828 --> 01:19:01,262
Well, Jeremy's is.

1264
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:03,626
No.

1265
01:19:03,828 --> 01:19:06,581
Blind dates.
Oh.

1266
01:19:07,388 --> 01:19:08,502
Yeah.

1267
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:11,221
This is my first.

1268
01:19:12,307 --> 01:19:13,979
Really?
Mm.

1269
01:19:15,507 --> 01:19:17,543
How old are you?
How old?

1270
01:19:17,747 --> 01:19:21,375
Sorry, that is a terrible question.
It's fine.

1271
01:19:21,586 --> 01:19:25,022
I'm 43.
I'm 41.

1272
01:19:25,226 --> 01:19:28,059
Well, you have...

1273
01:19:28,266 --> 01:19:30,177
You have time.

1274
01:19:32,345 --> 01:19:35,462
I think we both know
that's something I don't have.

1275
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,339
You have some time.

1276
01:19:41,025 --> 01:19:43,141
Some.

1277
01:19:46,744 --> 01:19:48,814
Shall we...

1278
01:19:49,024 --> 01:19:50,980
walk, or?

1279
01:19:52,624 --> 01:19:55,821
Walk?
We don't have to.

1280
01:19:57,863 --> 01:20:00,935
No, no.

1281
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:03,703
A walk would be...
[MAN'S VOICE IN DISTANCE]

1282
01:20:10,502 --> 01:20:12,174
A walk...

1283
01:20:13,582 --> 01:20:16,335
would be great, yes.

1284
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:26,378
You know what?
I ought to get back to the shop soon.

1285
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:30,299
Really? Oh.

1286
01:20:30,501 --> 01:20:32,059
What about the walk?

1287
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:33,488
Very nice meeting you.

1288
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,658
Oh. Er, you too.

1289
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,499
Are you okay?
Okay? Yeah.

1290
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,213
I'm fine.

1291
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,891
Time just seemed
to run away with me.

1292
01:20:47,099 --> 01:20:48,691
With us.

1293
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:50,651
Hm.

1294
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:54,055
Bloke with sunglasses and blazer,
and she's off.

1295
01:20:54,259 --> 01:20:57,092
Anyone that comes along,
really. Anyone but me.

1296
01:21:30,656 --> 01:21:33,124
Well, I'll tell you something.

1297
01:21:33,336 --> 01:21:36,247
The view may be
slightly disappointing,

1298
01:21:36,455 --> 01:21:40,004
but it's been nice to spend
some time up here with the kites.

1299
01:21:40,215 --> 01:21:42,649
Hasn't it?

1300
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:46,925
You know, I think
Tommy was right all along.

1301
01:21:47,534 --> 01:21:51,527
No point in wishing your life away
with your head in the clouds.

1302
01:21:54,694 --> 01:21:58,369
And I think the walk
has done us both good.

1303
01:21:59,413 --> 01:22:01,608
So, how about a dance?

1304
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,767
I don't think you're
the person I thought you were.

1305
01:22:05,973 --> 01:22:09,329
Oh?
No, it's a good thing.

1306
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:11,443
You've surprised me.

1307
01:22:11,652 --> 01:22:13,529
Well, I don't know
what to think about that.

1308
01:22:13,732 --> 01:22:15,688
No, really, it's fine.

1309
01:22:15,892 --> 01:22:18,804
It's just that...

1310
01:22:19,012 --> 01:22:21,207
Look, I'm no dancer, never have been.

1311
01:22:21,412 --> 01:22:23,686
Oh, me neither.

1312
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:27,169
Maybe we could
just have a cup of tea.

1313
01:22:27,371 --> 01:22:28,850
Now?

1314
01:22:29,051 --> 01:22:32,487
Well, I could break
the habit of a lifetime,

1315
01:22:32,691 --> 01:22:35,762
come here on a Wednesday?

1316
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:39,324
You know, take a chance.

1317
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:43,689
Eddie?
Yes.

1318
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:47,928
You know, I think I might
change my routine as well.

1319
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:52,998
I think I might visit Tommy's grave
on Wednesday.

1320
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:56,087
We had a good time.

1321
01:22:56,289 --> 01:22:58,086
I never realised that.

1322
01:23:05,368 --> 01:23:09,441
Well, I've always felt that Thursdays

1323
01:23:09,648 --> 01:23:13,083
have a better feel about them anyway.

1324
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,596
You know, back of the week
broken and all that.

1325
01:23:15,807 --> 01:23:20,437
I mean, I'd very much like to...

1326
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:23,639
You know, there are
other hills to climb.

1327
01:23:24,486 --> 01:23:27,478
Heath's a huge place.

1328
01:23:27,686 --> 01:23:29,802
Endless...

1329
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:31,678
possibilities.

1330
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:09,313
So, it's just you and me.

1331
01:24:09,523 --> 01:24:12,515
I know, I know.

[HE SIGHS]

1333
01:24:20,442 --> 01:24:22,034

1334
01:24:22,242 --> 01:24:23,800
Hey.

1335
01:24:24,002 --> 01:24:26,037
I love you too.

1336
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:58,868
You cheeky bugger.
