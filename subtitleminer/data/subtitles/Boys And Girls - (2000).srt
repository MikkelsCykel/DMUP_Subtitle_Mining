- Since when?

Does this feel like we're clicking?

165
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,944
I was only talking about
going and getting a cup of coffee.

Time for me to leave

178

That's impossible. I set
my alarm exactly one minute

well, I got to the room...

- Our story. Oh, oh, I know.

a month?

Six weeks, two days.

235

You visited
back and forth...

236
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,875
maybe three times,
called each other every night?

That's right.
You have to put in the work.

- No, no, but I do have friends there.

- You're living with one guy?
- Yeah.

00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:56,814
You've made a commitment that prohibits
choices in the name of love?

00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,823
Uh-huh.

254
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:02,190

00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:16,102
I came as fast as I could.
What happened?

259
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:18,109
[Gasping]
He dumped me!

260
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:20,111
Why?

261
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,511
Because he fell in love
with somebody else.

262
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:26,575
- Oh, God. Who?
- I don't know who, Amy,
and I don't care who.

263
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,586
The point is,
is that he dumped me.

264
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:32,317
Well, how did you find out? I mean,
did you catch them or something?

265
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:34,416
Oh, God, in this bed?

266
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:37,894
No. Oh, God, no.

267
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:39,898
No, no, no,
he just told me.

268
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:42,457
- He told you.
- Yeah, we made that whole pact.

269
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:45,299
You know, that if you meet
somebody else, you're gonna
tell the other person.

270
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,067
Yeah, well, no one
ever takes that pact seriously.

271
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,267
I mean, you just say it
to cover your own ass.

272
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,073
Yeah, well, I'm really lucky
because my boyfriend,

273
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:55,511
he's really loyal
to his pacts.

274
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,947
- Well, how did you find out?
- At the club.

275
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,951
What, did he yell it
over the music?

276
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:04,012
- No, no, no, it was the music.
- No.

277
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,786
It was the same club
where we first met.

278
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:10,420
It was the same club where
we first decided to move in together.

279
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,987
It was the same stage
where he first sang that song...

280
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:15,431
"Jennifer, Jennifer,
this heart is made for two."

281
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:19,198
And I'm just sitting there watching him,
and I'm thinking how much I love him,

282
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:22,537
and how I can't believe
that I can love somebody that much.

283
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,542
And then he sang
this brand-new song.

284
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,544
A little something called...

285
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,546
? Jennifer, Jennifer?

286
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:31,549
? You asked me
to be true?

287
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:34,177
? What can I say?

288
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:38,155
 <i>I found someone new</i>

00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:48,523
By the second chorus,
everybody was singing along.

00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:51,866

- Nothing.

- Why didn't I listen?

I mean, now you get
to move in with me.

pretty horrible right now,

but, you know, it's just
gonna take some time...

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,224
'cause that's what my therapist
keeps telling me.

301
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,385
To hell with your therapist,
Ame, really,

302

because I just need
to feel better... now!

Do-dooby-do, my ass.

It's tough out there, man.
You don't know how lucky you are.

305
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,435
- Betty and I broke up.
- What?

306
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,444
You're kidding. When?

307
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:36,003
- A couple of days ago.
- Why didn't you tell me?

308
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:40,280
I don't know. I guess
it's just now kind of sinking in.

309
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,287
Well, this is
great news.

310
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:44,448

- Right.
- I don't think so.

00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:49,627
Believe me,
it's way easier with two of us.

313
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:52,425
See, you pretend to be my idiot cousin
in for the weekend.

314
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:54,523
All of a sudden,
I'm sensitive.

315
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,534
You get drunk,
start coming on too strong,

316
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:59,002
I beat the shit out of you,
I'm masculine.

317
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,471
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

318
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,100
Well, we could trade off.
You can hit me first if you want.

319
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:06,906
It was two days ago.
I think I need a little time.

320
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,913
You're right.
I'm sorry you're hurting.

321
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:10,915
So let's get drunk
and go see some strippers.

322
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,975
- I'm not that hurt.
- Shh. Please.

323
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:17,147
I'm fine. Breaking up was
the right thing to do.

324
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:20,158
We were just...
going in different directions.

325

Mm.

- No.

No, no, no.
Come on. Do it.

328

- Hurry. Before she leaves.
- Who?

329

- You know her?
- Kind of.

Good. You?

334

Great.

335

- Yes.

Oh, uh, Jennifer,
this is Hunter.

340

Hi.

341

Well, you know,
I'd love to stick around,

342
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:15,545
but, uh, I have to go to the train
station to pick up my cousin.

343
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:17,980
He's an idiot.
My whole family is, actually.

344
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,984
Me too.

345
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:24,216
Yeah, me too.
I'm an idiot.

346

How's
"long-distance Betty"?

352

I don't wanna talk

353

But I just told you
about my whole breakup.

Come on. I mean,
it couldn't be worse.

355
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,279
Why? Why do you
wanna know?

356
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:50,577
- Misery loves company.
- No!

357
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,583
You'll just find some way
to use it against me.

358
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:56,781
[Gasps] Okay, okay, maybe I might
have done that in the past,

359
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:58,790
but I've changed.

360
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:01,759
I have. I'm scarred now,
and I look at life very differently.

361
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,431
Okay.

362
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,758
- You were right.
- It was the long-distance thing.

363
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,860
- Yes, but not for me.
- I knew it.

364
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:14,906
I was fine with it.
I would go there, she would come here.

365
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:18,137
If I told her I would call her at
a certain time, no matter where I was...

366

- You would call.

of that ever seemed like work to me.

right?

<i>with her boyfriend.</i>

<i>They were both carrying</i>
<i>these bags of laundry,</i>

375
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,962
<i>and Betty</i>
<i>just started crying.</i>

376

<i>And she said</i>...

377
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:50,669
"We never get to do
our laundry together."

378
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:54,406
She was right. We never did get
to do our laundry together,

379
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,505
and that was it.

380
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:59,107
You broke up
because of laundry?

381

I send mine out.

382
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:06,090
Not laundry, exactly. Just all
the things that couples do together...

383
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:08,558
- that couples should do together.
- Uh-huh.

384
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:12,256
We just didn't have the time anymore.
She couldn't handle that.

385
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:14,492
- Why didn't you move there?
- Scholarship.

386
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,866
- Well, she could have moved here.
- Scholarship.

387
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:20,462
- Wow, so that was it?
- Yeah.

388
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,508
- I mean, she needed something
that I couldn't give her.
- Oh, no.

389
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,771
There's a lot of other
little things too.

390

Too many differences
make relationships impossible.

Michael and I didn't agree
on anything... ever.

That's what I loved about it.
We fought, shouted, had sex.

I mean,
it's what I miss.

394
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,791
That doesn't sound like
a very healthy relationship.

395
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,986
Yeah, but what do you know
about healthy relationships?

396
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:46,156
- Excuse me?
- I'm saying, who are you
to judge my relationship?

397
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:49,030
- Well, see, I knew this was a mistake.
- What?

398
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:52,161
I'm just saying that you were
in an unhealthy relationship.

399
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:55,571
It's about having to like things
all the time. It's about surprises.

400
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:58,337
I mean, love is exciting
and it's thrilling...

401
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,106
and it drives you so insane,
you just think you're gonna explode.

It's the whole point.

403
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:06,117
Then I guess Michael
didn't get the point.

No, that's a lie.
I lied. I can't stop.

was pretend to be someone I wasn't.

anymore, you know?

breaking up with him?
- Yeah, I know,

but do you think
I'm being too cowardly?

I mean, my therapist wants me to take
more responsibility for my emotions,

You know what? I wouldn't really
call him my boyfriend.

but they burnt.

around 9:30, and then they burnt.

00:48:57,641 --> 00:49:00,303
You're... You're right.
You are absolutely right.

906
00:49:00,377 --> 00:49:03,278
I mean, what... what's wrong
with being from the country?

907
00:49:03,347 --> 00:49:05,645
A simple kid raised on
fresh eggs and good values,

908
00:49:05,716 --> 00:49:07,650
who had to get up
at the crack of dawn every morning...

909
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:10,744
with a three-legged dog named Lucky by
his side to help his pa with the cattle.

910
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:14,086
- Hunter, you're not from the country.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

911
00:49:14,158 --> 00:49:18,026
Oh, jeez, Ryan,
what do you want me to say?

912
00:49:18,095 --> 00:49:20,689
Hi. My name is Steve.
I grew up in the suburbs...

913
00:49:20,764 --> 00:49:22,891
with two working parents,
two sisters and a two-car garage.

914
00:49:22,966 --> 00:49:24,957
I have no real identity,

915
00:49:25,035 --> 00:49:27,196
nor do I have a clue
what I'm doing or what I wanna be.

916
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:29,364
Wanna go out?

917
00:49:31,175 --> 00:49:33,871
- Your name is Steve?
- You know,
the whole point of college...

918
00:49:33,944 --> 00:49:35,935
is it's a place where
you can reinvent yourself.

919
00:49:36,013 --> 00:49:39,210
No, it's a place where you can
define yourself. Your name is Steve?

920
00:49:39,283 --> 00:49:43,413
Yes. Yes. To be honest,
I'm not so crazy about "Steve," okay?

921
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:46,183
- Why would anyone else be?
- That's who you are.

922
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:48,816
Oh, really?
It's just that easy?

923
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:50,826
Then, why don't you drop
the cool guy act and go tellJennifer...

924
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:53,385
- how you really feel about her?
- What?

925
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:56,922
<i>But you'd better do it quick</i>
<i>before she leaves with that guy.</i>

926
00:49:58,302 --> 00:50:01,032
I don't feel that way
about her.

927
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:03,834
Seeing her with that guy right now,
it doesn't bother you?

928
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:06,239
<i>No. She goes on dates</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

929
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,505
- We talk about her dates.
- And you're fine with that?

930
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:10,513
- Yes. Yes.
- Honestly.

931
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:12,947
Okay, then, how come you're
here all by your lonesome?

932
00:50:13,016 --> 00:50:15,849
Look. If you're waiting for
a girl to just walk over...

933
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:18,012
and do all the work, you
got another thing coming.

934
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:20,955
- They don't do things
that way. Trust me.
- <i>[Woman] Excuse me.</i>

935
00:50:21,024 --> 00:50:23,492
- Is your name Ryan?
- Yeah.

936
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,587
- <i>I think you're in my statistics class.</i>
- That's nice.

937
00:50:27,664 --> 00:50:30,258
What are the odds?

938
00:50:31,502 --> 00:50:33,663
- You're Engineering, right?
- Yeah.

939
00:50:33,737 --> 00:50:37,901
I'm Electrical.
Not me, my major.

940
00:50:37,975 --> 00:50:41,138
Can you believe
how much work they give us?

941
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:44,339
But I like it, you know, because there
are so many people floating around here,

942
00:50:44,414 --> 00:50:47,815
like negative ions,
with no place to go.

943
00:50:47,885 --> 00:50:51,651
I'm a laser. I know what I want,
and I go straight for it.

944
00:50:51,722 --> 00:50:54,122
Oh.

945
00:50:54,191 --> 00:50:58,025
[Chuckles] I feel like there's
an armature spinning in my head.

946
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:02,532
- <i>You wanna sit down?</i>
- Uh, sure, sure.

947
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:05,762
But, actually,
I was just leaving.

948
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:08,703
It's because
I'm too forward, isn't it?

949
00:51:08,772 --> 00:51:13,505
No, not at all. There's just these two
assignments that I've been putting off.

950
00:51:13,577 --> 00:51:17,775
I told my girlfriend
that I would meet her...

951
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:19,941
twenty minutes ago.

952
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:23,384
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yes, I do.

953
00:51:23,453 --> 00:51:27,014
- Now I feel really so stupid.
- You're not stupid.

954
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:30,059
I just...
I really have to go.

955
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:42,964
Hey, sis. You okay?

956
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,372
Yeah, I'm great.
Thanks, Billy.

957
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,376
See, <i>amor, amore.</i>

958
00:51:47,444 --> 00:51:49,878
You say it
so beautifully.

959
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:52,006
All right, so I'm gonna
take off, then.

960
00:51:52,082 --> 00:51:54,710
- Okay.
- See ya, bro.

961
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:13,124
So, how'd you get
rid of him?

962
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:15,296
We fooled around for a while,
and then I told him,

963
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:17,340
"Hey, I got
an early class."

964
00:52:17,407 --> 00:52:19,341
- You fooled around?
- Uh-huh.

965
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:23,140
Hold on. Now, when we're
talking about "fooling around,"

966
00:52:23,213 --> 00:52:27,343
are we talking about
"fooling around" or...

967
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:31,183
We're talking about
"fooling around."

968
00:52:31,254 --> 00:52:33,688
Oh.

969
00:52:33,757 --> 00:52:35,691
It's not like
we had sex.

970
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:38,193
- I didn't say that.
- Couldn't find a condom.

971
00:52:38,261 --> 00:52:41,992
- You would have?
- Yeah. Probably.

972
00:52:42,065 --> 00:52:45,000
I have midterms coming up.
I gotta relieve the stress somehow.

973
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:49,630
- Wow. That's amazing.
- What?

974
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:51,731
Ju... Just that
on any given date,

975
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:54,436
the possibility exists
that you'll have sex with a guy.

976
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:57,412
Isn't that the point of dating,
possibilities?

977
00:52:57,481 --> 00:53:00,450
It's not like I know what's gonna
happen in advance. I don't.

978
00:53:00,517 --> 00:53:02,849
Sometimes I think it'd be
a whole lot easier to have sex...

979
00:53:02,919 --> 00:53:05,410
than have to sit there and think
of something clever to say.

980
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:08,686
Granted, I haven't been
in that situation in a long time,

981
00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:12,593
but I just can't sleep
with somebody unless I like them.

982
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:16,326
- So, you think I'm a slut?
- I didn't say that.

983
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,392
- We're just different.
- Yeah, you sleep with no one.

984
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:23,200
- So?
- So, do you know any other single,

985
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:26,208
20-year-old college guys who
never sleep with anyone?

986
00:53:26,276 --> 00:53:28,904
- Who don't even try?
- Hey, maybe you're trying too hard.

987
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:31,641
Ryan, you don't try
at all.

988
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:34,650
I just think that it might be making
things weird between us.

989
00:53:34,718 --> 00:53:37,186
What? What are you
talking about?

990
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:40,553
Are we friends?
I mean, am I your friend...

991
00:53:40,624 --> 00:53:43,752
or have I just become
your girlfriend substitute?

992
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:48,093
- Are you serious?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

993
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:51,100
It's like with me in your life,
you never have to try.

994
00:53:51,168 --> 00:53:53,295
That's the beauty
of our relationship.

995
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:57,466
<i>You'll just never get hurt again as</i>
<i>long you pretend I'm your girlfriend.</i>

996
00:54:00,444 --> 00:54:05,143
Yeah. Yeah, maybe
we shouldn't hang out anymore.

<i>Ryan?</i>

998
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:17,050
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean that.

999
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:19,061
- Yeah, you did.
- No.

1000
00:54:19,129 --> 00:54:21,757
I love hanging out
with you.

1001
00:54:21,832 --> 00:54:24,494
I do. You're my most favorite
person in the whole world.

1002
00:54:24,568 --> 00:54:27,537
I don't wanna change
anything.

1003
00:54:27,604 --> 00:54:29,538
- Maybe you're right.
- No, I'm wrong.

1004
00:54:29,606 --> 00:54:32,700
You're just waiting
for the right girl to come along,

1005
00:54:32,776 --> 00:54:34,710
and you don't take
sex lightly.

1006
00:54:34,778 --> 00:54:37,076
I think that that's
a great quality.

1007
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:42,949
No, l-I think I am
hiding behind you or... or us.

1008
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:46,588
There was this girl
at the party the other night.

1009
00:54:46,656 --> 00:54:49,648
A girl girl?
You didn't tell me.

1010
00:54:49,726 --> 00:54:52,217
I just blew her off.

1011

Why?

1012
00:54:54,297 --> 00:54:56,231
I don't know.

1013
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:00,834
Maybe I should have
given her a chance.

1014
00:55:00,904 --> 00:55:04,340
Yeah, you shoulda.

1015
00:55:04,407 --> 00:55:06,432
Well, you still can.

00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:23,490
Yeah, I guess.

Is she
cuter than me?

No. She's thinner.

l-I really wanted
to kiss you.

1053

- No, Amy! A-Amy!

Hey, buddy.

1055
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:17,632
[Chuckling]
It's like a bridge.

- Yeah, you're absolutely right.

- Hi!
- Hi.

00:57:27,918 --> 00:57:30,853
- Mm.
- Mm.
- Is Katie coming?

1060
00:57:30,921 --> 00:57:32,855
She's gonna meet us at the bar.
I just talked to her.

1061
00:57:32,923 --> 00:57:34,857
- Really?
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

1062
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:36,825
This is great.
This is great!

1063
00:57:36,893 --> 00:57:38,827
She will be the first
to experience the new me.

1064
00:57:38,895 --> 00:57:42,831
- Oh, this oughta be good.
- Oh, no, I'm serious. No more lies.

1065
00:57:42,899 --> 00:57:44,833
It's like you said, buddy.
I don't need to pretend...

for someone else to like me.

1067

- [Ryan] Yeah, she is.

1072
00:58:07,757 --> 00:58:12,194
That, uh, Paul guy. Didn't you go
out with him a couple of times before?

1073
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:15,629
- Yeah. It's working out.
- Good for you.

1074
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:19,430
Hey, Jen. Megan here has never been
to the Automotive Museum.

1075
00:58:19,502 --> 00:58:21,595
Imagine that.

1076
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:25,337
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

1077
00:58:25,408 --> 00:58:27,501
Hey, did you guys read
how the zoo animals tried...

1078
00:58:27,577 --> 00:58:30,205
to reorganize their cages
in alphabetical order?

1079
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,214
Apparently,
the aardvarks started it.

1080
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:35,410
That's right, but
the zebras, they vetoed it.

1081
00:58:35,485 --> 00:58:38,886
- Yeah, how did you know?
- I just... I don't know.

1082
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:40,889
I don't get it.

1083
00:58:40,957 --> 00:58:43,118
- [Chuckles]
- Me neither.

1084
00:58:46,696 --> 00:58:49,631
So, uh, Katie.
How are you liking Berkeley?

1085
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:52,259
It's a bit overwhelming,
right?

1086
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:54,269
Katie's a double major
here on scholarship.

1087
00:58:54,337 --> 00:58:56,862
- I don't know how she does it.
- How do you do it?

1088
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,966
I can barely juggle
napping and sleeping.

1089
00:59:00,043 --> 00:59:04,173
Well, this may sound a little weird, but
I spend a lot of time with the elderly.

1090
00:59:04,247 --> 00:59:06,238
That doesn't sound weird.

1091
00:59:06,316 --> 00:59:08,511
It sounds
a little weird.

1092
00:59:08,585 --> 00:59:10,519
Think about it this way:
when you're sitting with someone...

1093
00:59:10,587 --> 00:59:14,751

marriages, kids, grandkids,

<i>money problems and disease</i>...

1095
00:59:17,394 --> 00:59:21,490
I mean, getting a "B" on a biology exam
doesn't seem like that big of a deal.

1096
00:59:21,564 --> 00:59:23,759
- I think we should do
what the Eskimos do.
- Mm?

1097
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,767
Just kick the old people
out of the igloos.

1098
00:59:25,835 --> 00:59:27,769
Leave them for the polar bears
and the storms at sea.

1099
00:59:27,837 --> 00:59:31,864
The minute they can't go on the big hunt
anymore, you gotta get rid of them.

1100
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:36,378
I mean, otherwise... otherwise, they'll
just suck us dry. Those bastards.

1101
00:59:38,348 --> 00:59:41,784
- You're kidding, right?
- No. No, not at all.

1102
00:59:41,851 --> 00:59:45,309
And take away their driver's
license too, while you're at it.

1103
00:59:45,388 --> 00:59:47,686
Hmm?

agreeing for the sake of it.

I did what you said.
I was being honest.

1109

Yeah, but come on. You don't have to
say everything that comes in your head.

he even stopped cheating on me.

- Hey.
- Hi.

1200
01:06:34,964 --> 01:06:37,762
- Where are you going?
- Class.

1201
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:40,359
Oh, no, you're not.
You're staying right here.

1202

- [Chuckles]
- Where I can see you.

1203
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,232
I really... have to go.

1204
01:06:45,308 --> 01:06:47,242
You never go to class.

1205
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:49,244
I know.
But that's why I have to go.

1206
01:06:49,312 --> 01:06:52,247
Wait.
I'll make us breakfast.

1207
01:06:52,315 --> 01:06:55,478
It's okay.
I'm late.

1208
01:07:01,224 --> 01:07:03,658
I'll see you later.

1209

Is this about Megan?

- No.
- I'm gonna tell her.

1211
01:07:14,237 --> 01:07:16,398
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

1212
01:07:18,241 --> 01:07:20,402
Oh.

1213
01:07:22,078 --> 01:07:24,740
[Softly]
We'll talk about this later. Okay?

1214
01:07:26,482 --> 01:07:28,416
Yeah, okay. Okay.

1215
01:07:28,484 --> 01:07:31,681
Just stay as long
as you like, and, uh...

1216
01:07:31,754 --> 01:07:33,688
Well, you know
where everything is.

1217
01:07:43,266 --> 01:07:45,757
Jen!

1218
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:48,395
Jen. Hi.

1219
01:07:48,471 --> 01:07:50,632
Um, I have to talk
about what happened.

1220
01:07:50,706 --> 01:07:52,936
Amy, it's okay.

1221
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:54,943
No, it's not okay.
But it is okay,

1222
01:07:55,011 --> 01:07:57,241
because I've been thinking about it,
and I think what happened is...

1223
01:07:57,313 --> 01:08:00,043
that you're my best friend and
I love you and I think I got jealous...

1224
01:08:00,116 --> 01:08:02,346
when you were spending
so much time with Ryan,

1225
01:08:02,418 --> 01:08:04,886
and then, with you
graduating and everything...
and then I think in a weird way,

1226
01:08:04,954 --> 01:08:06,888
I was just desperately trying
to keep things the way they were,

1227
01:08:06,956 --> 01:08:09,322
and I did what I did
because I was afraid of losing you.

1228
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:11,656
Isn't that amazing?

1229
01:08:11,727 --> 01:08:15,219
Yeah, without therapy. I came
up with that completely on my own.

1230
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:17,892
I was thinking about us
and all the time we spent together,

1231
01:08:17,967 --> 01:08:19,901
and then it hit me
like a thunderbolt.

1232
01:08:19,969 --> 01:08:22,767
By kissing you, I was
trying to prevent change.

1233
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:25,329
But maybe change
isn't always catastrophic.

1234
01:08:25,408 --> 01:08:28,104
Before we met, I didn't
know you at all, right?

1235
01:08:28,177 --> 01:08:30,805
- Right.
- Yeah, that was a change!

1236
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,781
I mean, that was a great change.
I loved that change.

1237
01:08:33,849 --> 01:08:37,649
I mean, who knows? I mean, maybe
I'll kill myself by midterms next year.

1238
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,120
But, then again,
maybe I won't.

1239
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:42,248
You know?
Maybe it'll be okay.

1240
01:08:42,325 --> 01:08:45,317
And that's the beauty of change.
You know, you never know
how things are gonna work out.

1241
01:08:45,394 --> 01:08:49,888
- So, everything's okay?
- Yeah, never been better!

1242
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:52,230
- Ohh.
- [Giggles]

1243
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:55,603
You know, Ryan's
in your bed right now.

1244
01:08:57,139 --> 01:09:01,269
- Yeah.
- You know he's naked, right?

1245
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:04,711
- Yeah.
- But you know I'm curious, right?

1246
01:09:05,781 --> 01:09:09,911
- Yeah.
- So? What happened?

1247
01:09:09,986 --> 01:09:12,955
I think I was
afraid of losing him.

1248
01:09:21,931 --> 01:09:23,956
Megan!

1249
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:27,969

1251
01:09:30,806 --> 01:09:33,240

<i>And I didn't get to see him as much,</i>

1252
01:09:33,309 --> 01:09:36,608
and then the whole thing with Paul
happened, and seeing him with Mary...

1253
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:40,240
- Megan.
- Whatever. I just
wanted to be with him.

1254
01:09:40,316 --> 01:09:44,013
It was a huge mistake.
Huge. Huge, big fat mistake.

1255
01:09:44,086 --> 01:09:47,419
We're friends.
We're great as friends.

1256
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:49,424
So, what are you
going to do about it?

1257
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:51,483
I have no idea.

1258
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,494
He takes this kind of thing
so seriously,

1259
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:56,326
and the last thing in the world
I want to do is hurt him.

- [Scoffs] What does that mean?
- I don't know.

1264
01:10:10,346 --> 01:10:14,442
I just... don't want things
to be weird with us.

1265
01:10:14,517 --> 01:10:18,715
Uh, buddy, if you're looking at me
for answers, I'm flattered, but, uh,

1266
01:10:18,788 --> 01:10:21,586
you've come
to the wrong place.

1267
01:10:21,657 --> 01:10:24,091
If I just pretend
like nothing happened, then I'll be...

1268
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,459
lying to myself about
feelings I might be feeling.

1269
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:31,489
But if I tell her how I <i>might</i>
be feeling, she'll run,
because that's what she does.

1270
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:33,626
And I know that
better than anyone.

1271

I want to have happen.

- Does this feel weird to you?
- Oh, yes.

1275
01:11:05,334 --> 01:11:08,269
Okay. Well, maybe we should
talk about this.

1276
01:11:08,337 --> 01:11:11,329
- I think that would be good.
- All right. It's just...
I had this feeling...

1277
01:11:11,407 --> 01:11:14,899
that things might get strange between
us because of what happened last night,

1278
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:17,537
- and I don't want that to happen.
- Me neither.

1279
01:11:17,613 --> 01:11:20,707
'Cause we're too good together
to let that come between us.

1280
01:11:22,384 --> 01:11:26,013
- It was a mistake.
- You think so?

1281
01:11:26,088 --> 01:11:29,751
- Yes.
- Yeah, I think you're right.

1282
01:11:29,825 --> 01:11:32,953
I think that we just,
you know, we got carried away,

1283
01:11:33,028 --> 01:11:35,622
in the moment,
and... you know.

1284
01:11:37,066 --> 01:11:39,728
Yes.

1285
01:11:40,803 --> 01:11:43,670
Last night was
really special to me...

1286
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:46,765
because you're really
special to me, Ryan.

1287
01:11:46,842 --> 01:11:50,505
But that's all it was:
it was an incredibly special night.

1288
01:11:52,014 --> 01:11:54,107
I just got worried
that maybe,

1289
01:11:54,183 --> 01:11:56,583
you know, we'd give it more
importance than we should.

1290
01:11:58,687 --> 01:12:01,918
Uh, no.
I'm totally with you.

1291

Great.

1292
01:12:07,129 --> 01:12:11,793
- You didn't tell Megan, did you?
- No. No.

1293
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:14,028
- It's probably better not to.
- Yeah.

Well, I feel so much lighter. Do you?

Yeah.

Actually, you know what?
I shouldn't.

1299
01:12:34,223 --> 01:12:36,748
I'd like to, but I still
have some more studying to do.

Studying.

1345
01:15:31,934 --> 01:15:34,334
Well, what's going on?

1346

- Good.

- Busy.
- Yeah. Me too.

1348

No. You know, I should really

1352
01:15:58,093 --> 01:16:00,118
Okay.

my bon voyage party, huh?

Okay.
I guess we'll talk.

- What?

What? This!
This! What is this?

1365

I don't know.
Nothing's going on.

1366
01:16:50,546 --> 01:16:54,505
Really? Because I just
ran into Megan, and she told me
that you broke up with her.

1367
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,949
<i>Is that what this is about?</i>

1368
01:16:57,019 --> 01:16:59,078
Because I thought I told you
not to tell her anything.

1369
01:16:59,154 --> 01:17:01,122
Yeah, I know.

1370
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:04,825
- Well, are you upset? Are you...
- <i>No!</i>

1371
01:17:04,893 --> 01:17:07,919
- So what's going on?
- I don't know!

1372
01:17:07,996 --> 01:17:10,123
Things are different.

1373
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:13,430
<i>But I thought</i>
<i>we talked about that.</i>

1374
01:17:13,502 --> 01:17:16,130
Ryan, I thought that we said that we
didn't want anything to be different.

1375
01:17:16,205 --> 01:17:19,606
I thought we said that having sex
was just a huge mistake and...

1376
01:17:19,675 --> 01:17:21,939
and I mean...
I mean, it was weeks ago now.

1377
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:24,069
<i>I thought we'd go back to being just</i>
<i>friends. I thought that would just</i>...

1378
01:17:24,146 --> 01:17:26,410
- Why was it a mistake?
- <i>What?</i>

1379
01:17:26,482 --> 01:17:29,849
You and me. Why was that a mistake?
I'm curious.

1380
01:17:31,787 --> 01:17:34,688
We've already talked about...
What, do you want to go over it again?

1381
01:17:34,756 --> 01:17:37,156
No, you want to talk?
Let's talk.

1382
01:17:37,226 --> 01:17:41,890
Was it a mistake because
anything that comes close to
real intimacy freaks you out?

1383
01:17:41,964 --> 01:17:44,194
Or just that I'm not
good enough for you?

1384
01:17:46,101 --> 01:17:50,060
Ryan, you...
you kissed me, and...

1385
01:17:50,139 --> 01:17:52,369
and I responded.

1386
01:17:52,441 --> 01:17:55,501
But I wouldn't have done it if I thought
it was gonna end our friendship.

1387
01:17:55,577 --> 01:17:57,875
And neither would I.

1388
01:17:57,946 --> 01:18:01,575
Ryan, if I could
take it all back, I would.

1389
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:04,778
Take it.
It's yours.

1390
01:18:04,853 --> 01:18:07,515
Put it on the shelf
with all your other one-night stands.

1391
01:18:12,394 --> 01:18:14,328
Why are you doing this?

1392
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:18,423
Look, that night was as much
a surprise to me as it was to you.

1393
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,197
But being with you was like going
to a place that I had never been before.

1394
01:18:22,271 --> 01:18:25,604
<i>And after you fell asleep,</i>
<i>I just laid there, staring up...</i>

1395
01:18:25,674 --> 01:18:29,770
at those cheap fluorescent stars
you have stuck on your ceiling.

1396
01:18:29,845 --> 01:18:33,337
And after a while,
they just started forming a pattern,

1397
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:38,478
this weird, glow-in-the-dark
pattern that linked together
our entire relationship.

1398
01:18:38,554 --> 01:18:41,182
And for the first time,
everything seemed clear to me,

1399
01:18:41,256 --> 01:18:43,486
like one
logical progression.

1400
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:45,789
It felt like you and I were
the greatest plan ever made,

1401
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:48,386
and I had
nothing to do with it.

1402
01:18:48,463 --> 01:18:52,695
Being with you made me feel that maybe
I didn't have to keep planning anymore,

1403
01:18:52,768 --> 01:18:55,236
because it felt like
I was actually living,

1404
01:18:55,304 --> 01:18:59,798
and that for once in my life, I wouldn't
have to work so hard at being happy.

1405
01:19:00,943 --> 01:19:03,707
That it could just happen.

1406
01:19:06,682 --> 01:19:11,381
Nothing will ever hurt me as much as
your reaction to that same experience.

1407
01:19:13,956 --> 01:19:16,151
- Ryan...
- What? What?

1408
01:19:16,225 --> 01:19:19,820
You want to go hang out at the library
and pretend like nothing happened?

1409
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:23,295
I can't do that.

1410
01:19:26,468 --> 01:19:29,926
I'm sorry.

1411
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:31,939
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

1412
01:19:32,007 --> 01:19:35,204
Look, you don't
have to say anything.

1413
01:19:36,578 --> 01:19:39,069
I have to go.

1414
01:19:39,147 --> 01:19:41,445
