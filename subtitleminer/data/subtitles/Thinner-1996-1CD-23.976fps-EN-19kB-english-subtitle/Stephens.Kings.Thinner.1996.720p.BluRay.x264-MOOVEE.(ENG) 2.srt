00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:28,998
That will be all, Mr. Bangor.
You may step down.

162
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:31,209
Chief Hopley.

163
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:42,720
Chief, perhaps you can help us.

164
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:45,515
Was Mr. Halleck traveling
within the legal speed limit?

165
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:48,268
Yes, sir.
We have witnesses...

166
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,103
and his skid marks confirmed that.

167
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,479
Was he Breathalyzed?

168
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:53,481
Yes, sir.

169
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,900
Results?

170
00:15:55,984 --> 00:16:01,030
Well, sir, Mr. Halleck was
as sober as a judge, Judge.

171
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:04,867
Under the circumstances,
I'll let that go.

172
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:07,287
You are dismissed, Chief.

173
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:17,380
This court finds no grounds
on which to charge William Halleck...

174
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:23,219
in the death of Suzanne Lempke,
which is hereby ruled accidental.

175
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:25,555
This hearing is closed.

176
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:31,686
[Billy Exhales]

177
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:33,688
- You drive.
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:44,991
Sir?

179
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,870
Thinner.

180
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,890
[Heidi]
Get in the car.

181
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,322
[Whistling]

182
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:29,035
283. Somebody call Richard Simmons.

183
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:39,420
- Did you weigh yourself?
- 283.

184
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:42,173
283. No fooling?

185
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:43,716
No fooling.

186
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:49,764
That is 14 pounds in seven days.

187
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:53,142
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

188
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,687
You look slimmer.

189
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:58,314
I haven't seen you stop eating.

190
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:01,526
- Maybe it's guilt.
- That's stupid.

191
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:05,363
It hasn't affected my diet
any more than it's affected yours.

192
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:11,953
[Sighing]

193
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:16,249
[Sighing]

194
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,378
Ahhh!

195
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:24,382
- Why did I come out here today?
- For the exercise.

196
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,885
From the looks of you,
it's finally doing some good.

197
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:29,679
There's nothing like avoiding
a manslaughter charge...

198
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:31,764
to turn a man's life around.

199
00:18:31,848 --> 00:18:35,143
That's witty, Kirk,
and compassionate too.

200
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:37,687
- What did he say?
- Foot-in-mouth disease.

201
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,190
That kind of attitude
could cost you court cases...

202
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:43,192
especially in my court.

203
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:48,865
You leave me alone, or I'll get Billy
to run you over in that golf cart.

204
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:50,658
- Kirk.
- What?

205
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:54,162
Give me a little kiss, sweetheart.
Right here.

206
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:58,666
Billy, have you lost your mind?

207
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:05,548
That's surprisingly easy to do
once you've lost a few pounds.

208
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,050
Come on.

209
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:13,890
Mike, look at this, would you?

210
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:22,899
- Your psoriasis is coming back.
- Why?

211
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:25,151
"Why ask why?"
As they say on TV.

212
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:28,655
Stress probably.
Use that ointment from last time.

213
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:34,994
- Hey!
- For horses. Better for cows.

214
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:38,331
281!

215
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:42,335
I've lost two pounds since this morning?
Is that possible?

216
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:47,048
Relax. Soon you'll be able to see
your balls without using a mirror.

217
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:50,218
[Laughter]

218
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:58,184
Listen, Cary...

219
00:19:58,268 --> 00:20:01,688
I never really thanked you
for taking care of me.

220
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:06,526
Never told you what happened
right after that, did I?

221
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,861
Leda and I went to lunch.

222
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:11,739
When we came out,
that old gyp was waiting for me.

223
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:15,118
- The one with the...
- Yeah, him.

224
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:19,080
He walked up and touched me,
right here.

225
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,585
Did he say anything?

226
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,879
How the hell should I know?

227
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:29,382
I was worried I might catch
impetigo from him.

228
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,426
Or lice!

229
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,063
- I want you to go off this diet.
- Does it look like I'm on a diet?

230
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,816
When did you stop?

231
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:50,737
About a week ago.

232
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:58,912
That's another 25 pounds.

233
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:03,791
That's over 40 pounds
in two weeks?

234
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,586
Make up your mind.
Do you want me fat or thin?

235
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:11,132
I just...

236
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:19,265
I was thinking that sudden weight loss
is an early warning sign of...

237
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:23,937
- Of what?
- You know what.

238
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,774
Christ! If I gain weight,
I have a heart attack.

239
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:30,026
If I lose weight,
I have cancer.

240
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,528
I can't win.

241
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:36,366
I ran into Mike Houston
yesterday.

242
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:40,286
He wants you
to take a few tests.

243
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,544
All right.

244
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:52,715
If you don't want to do it for yourself,
and you don't want to do it for me...

245
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,759
will you do it for Linda?

246
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:00,056
Everything's fine.

247
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,102
- "Fine"?
- Yeah.

248
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:09,148
Your blood work is five by five.

249
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,443
That's better than mine, in fact.

250
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:18,241
Let's see, cholesterol
and triglycerides are both down.

251
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,830
You haven't been this healthy since you
banged Mary Lou Singer in high school.

252
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:27,750
Sangster,
and I never got into her pants.

253
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:31,421
Mike, are you sure about this?

254
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:36,050
I weigh 240 pounds. I've lost
the equivalent of a fucking suitcase.

255
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:39,345
Look, Billy...

256
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:42,432
the important thing here
is for you to relax.

257
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:45,143
Just stop thinking about this.

258
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:48,438
Your weight will stabilize,
and you'll gain some back.

259
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:52,191
Believe me,
everything is gonna be all right.

260
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,570
Mr. Halleck!

261
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:58,615
I see you finally found
a diet that works.

262
00:22:58,698 --> 00:23:00,825
You look wonderful.

263
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:02,535
Right, and I...

264
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:05,788
want a whole new wardrobe to go with
my new look, so you might want to...

265
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:08,750
Well, let's do it!

266
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:19,886
You're down to a pant 40.
Maybe even 38.

267
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:23,765
That can't be right.

268
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:28,102
Do you have a scale?

269
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:40,698
This diet you're on...

270
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,283
what is it?

271
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:45,995
I've tried all the others.
I might as well try this one.

272
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,747
I don't think you'd like it, Henry.

273
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,585
In fact,
I don't think you'd like it at all.

274
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:12,772
- [Billy Grunting]
- [Groaning]

275
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,274
Dad.

276
00:24:20,613 --> 00:24:22,031
Can I ask you a question?

277
00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:29,872
Is there such a thing
as, like, male menopause?

278
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:33,918
- I mean, hormones that, like...
- What are you trying to say?

279
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:37,255
I'm worried about you.

280
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,552
What's there to worry about?
I found a diet that works.

281
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:44,929
Eat all you want
and still lose the weight.

282
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:49,309
[Laughing]

283
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,067
- What happened?
- I don't know. I must've said something.

284
00:24:58,151 --> 00:25:03,239
Don't. You'll only upset her more.
There.

285
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:09,412
Billy, will you please slow down?

286
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,414
Why are you eating like that?

287
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:13,458
I don't know
if it's all in my head.

288
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:17,086
- Dr. Mikey thinks it is.
- I hate when you call him that.

289
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:22,050
I do know one thing: I've lost three
pounds a day every day until today.

290
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,219
You're putting weight back on?
That's wonderful.

291
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:27,263
Today, I skipped lunch.
Instead of being three pounds lighter...

292
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:30,391
when I got home from the office,
I'm six pounds lighter.

293
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,810
You see, I have to eat like this.

294
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,812
It's a race,
and I'm losing.

295
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:39,025
- You sound mean, as if it's my fault.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:42,028
Was I giving myself a blow job
just then?

297
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:44,489
That is a horrible thing to say.

298
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:50,328
I don't remember you complaining
about it at the time.

299
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,582
Linda should go visit her Aunt Rhoda
for a few weeks.

300
00:25:56,834 --> 00:26:00,838
- What?
- She can't watch you go through this.

301
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:04,467
It's tearing her apart.
Look at what just happened.

302
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:06,719
I'll drive her there tomorrow.

303
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:23,361
Billy. Finally got through
to that specialist.

304
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:24,612
And?

305
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:28,366
Good news. Based on your test results
and what I've told him...

306
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:31,119
it's definitely not a parasite.

307
00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:33,371
Not a tapeworm.

308
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:36,708
- What does he recommend?
- The Glassman Clinic.

309
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:39,127
They're expecting you tomorrow.

310
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:43,423
And, Billy, even if
you don't want to go...

311
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:46,593
you have to,
for Heidi's sake.

312
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:48,094
She's upset.

313
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,638
Mike.

314
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:52,765
Leda was eating alone
again last night.

315
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,727
Is the judge sick?

316
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,228
Out of town.

317
00:26:57,312 --> 00:27:00,940
His sister was
in a pretty bad car accident.

318
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:03,693
Cary Rossington
doesn't have a sister.

319
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,908
Then it was Leda's sister.
You have to relax.

320
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:11,910
See you tomorrow.

321
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:30,887
Leda.

322
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,848
Is Cary in?

323
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:37,143
He's in Minnesota
visiting relatives.

324
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,315
What's wrong with him?
Has he lost weight?

325
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:44,859
What are you talking about?

326
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:49,572
I've lost 100 pounds.

327
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:52,325
That's spelled
with a one and two zeroes.

328
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,329
It was the Gypsies, wasn't it?

329
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:58,748
What do you mean, "Gypsies"?

330
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:02,752
Did the old man touch you?

331
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,879
What does that have to do with...

332
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:08,007
[Laughing]
Come on in, Billy.

333
00:28:12,136 --> 00:28:14,722
Here. You'll need this.

334
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:30,530
He is in Minnesota...

335
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:33,783
but he's not visiting relatives.

336
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:36,035
He's at the Mayo Clinic.

337
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,453
Leda...

338
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:44,210
there's no such thing
as Gypsy curses.

339
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:46,796
You trying to convince me
or yourself?

340
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,926
He came up to us as we were coming out
of La Zuppas, that place over in Milton.

341
00:28:53,386 --> 00:28:55,555
Cary was hunting for his keys.

342
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:58,516
He never saw the old man coming.

343
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,686
I did. I tried to warn him,
but I was too late.

344
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:05,106
He touched him.

345
00:29:05,189 --> 00:29:07,734
Then he whispered something
in his ear.

346
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,447
Cary claims he didn't hear
what it was.

347
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,948
I heard.

348
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:17,619
What?

349
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:19,621
What did he say?

350
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:22,957
One word.

351
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:29,631
Lizard.

352
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:36,054
His skin was plating,
turning into scales.

353
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:39,098
It's evolution in reverse.

354
00:29:39,182 --> 00:29:42,435
A sideshow freak.
Lord Jesus.

355
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:46,731
He chartered a plane
to take him to the Mayo.

356
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:51,444
Did I tell you that? He can't bear
to have people look at him.

357
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:56,366
At the end, before he left,
his hands were like claws!

358
00:29:56,449 --> 00:30:01,913
His eyes were just two bright little
specks inside these deep hollows.

359
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:06,918
Like pieces of tin foil!
And his nose...

360
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,129
I have to go
to the Glassman Clinic.

361
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:12,840
I have a metabolic disorder.

362
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,093
Why did you come here?

363
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:17,512
Why are you looking
for my husband?

364
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:19,681
I just wanted
to compare notes.

365
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:22,225
God. What did he say to you?

366
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:25,186
- What did the old gyp say to you?
- Nothing!

367
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,188
I don't believe that.

368
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:30,149
I believe it's all your fault.
You hit that old lady!

369
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:35,446
You were the one that hit her!
You! Not Cary!

370
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,117
I wrote on the fence, but your husband
slapped on the whitewash.

371
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,703
He was too happy to do it.

372
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:45,999
Have a nice stay
at the Glassman, Billy.

373
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:47,417
[Laughing]

374
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:50,253
I hear the food's good.

375
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:53,798
There's no such thing
as a Gypsy curse.

376
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,092
You come back in another
couple of weeks...

377
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:59,429
after you've lost
another 40 or 50 pounds!

378
00:30:59,512 --> 00:31:02,765
Tell me what you believe then!

379
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:05,268
Yes, you tell me
what you believe then!

380
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,936
You hear me?

381
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,772
You tell me what you believe then!

382
00:31:09,856 --> 00:31:11,858
You tell me!

383
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:14,986
- You gave me that.
- I did?

384
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:18,072
Mr. Ginelli,
it's Billy Halleck for you.

385
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:25,246
- What can I do for you?
- I got a crazy question for you.

386
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,748
Go ahead, Counselor.

387
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:32,795
Do you believe Gypsies
can curse people?

388
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:39,886
I tend to believe what my friends
tell me and what I can see.

389
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:44,474
My mother is a different story.
Hold on.

390
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:46,059
[Speaking Italian]

391
00:31:47,143 --> 00:31:52,357
[Speaking Italian]

392
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,483
Si.

393
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:55,652
[Thunderclap]

394
00:31:57,028 --> 00:32:00,615
[Speaking Italian,
Pretends To Spit]

395
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:04,786
She says she believes.
She knew Gypsies in the old country.

396
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:08,122
She says whoever puts it on
has to take it off. No one else can.

397
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:10,250
No one else.

398
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,751
What's this all about?

399
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,879
I'll get back to you. Thank you.

400
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:25,473
What happened
at the Rossington's last night?

401
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:31,354
Leda Rossington thinks that old Gypsy,
Tadzu Lempke, put a curse on Cary and I.

402
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:34,315
What?

403
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,528
I know how it sounds,
but that's what she thinks.

404
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:43,866
You see...

405
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,204
Cary has this skin cancer...

406
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:52,000
Billy, there is no such thing
as a Gypsy curse.

407
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:56,880
Even if there were, it wouldn't just
be you and Cary that Lempke would curse.

408
00:32:56,963 --> 00:32:58,882
It would be the entire town.

409
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:00,425
Yeah?

410
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:04,220
The whole town didn't kill his wife
and then try and cover it up.

411
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:06,764
It was me and Cary and...

412
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:08,641
What?

413
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:11,728
It would be Hopley too.

414
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:15,273
He was in on the cover-up.

415
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:19,444
Billy...

416
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,906
all you have to do right now...

417
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:26,743
is to think about checking yourself
into the clinic and getting better.

418
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:28,369
That's all.

419
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:30,663
Look out!

420
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,630
We're here.

421
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:45,386
Hopley, answer, damn it.

422
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,556
- Good morning, Mr. Halleck.
- Morning.

423
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,017
We've used the computer
to synthesize your test results.

424
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,229
Amazing.

425
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:58,524
Over 12,000 calories a day,
and you continue to lose weight.

426
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,319
Here you are.

427
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:04,656
Extra whipped cream,
just as you specified.

428
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:09,244
We have some good protocols.
They'll take a week or two to work out.

429
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:12,413
What if that
doesn't tell you anything?

430
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:15,959
We'll keep running tests.
We won't give up.

431
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:18,461
Rest assured of that.

432
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:27,554
- Where are you going?
- To get some takeout.

433
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:41,067
Duncan, it's Billy Halleck.

434
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,862
The guy at the station house
said you were home sick.

435
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:46,531
You okay?

436
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:58,501
Come on, Duncan.
I know about the judge.

437
00:34:58,585 --> 00:35:00,545
What's happened to you?

438
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:04,674
I don't really think
you want to know...

439
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,218
but come on in.

440
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:08,720
[Lock Clicking]

441
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:01,397
So...

442
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:05,735
now Rossington looks like
what he was all along.

443
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:11,741
That's funny.

444
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:16,704
And look at you.
You finally found a diet that works.

445
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,584
Whatever we did,
we don't deserve this.

446
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:25,171
No? You ran the old lady down.

447
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:31,010
Rossington fixed it so points weren't
even taken off your driving record.

448
00:36:31,094 --> 00:36:36,349
And I just ran the whole pack
of them out of the county.

449
00:36:36,432 --> 00:36:41,187
Come on. I'm not a criminal.
I wasn't drunk.

450
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:43,356
How would I know?

451
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:47,944
I didn't give you a Breathalyzer test.
I said I did.

452
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:52,574
That's just the way we do things
here in Fairview, isn't it?

453
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:55,910
What the hell.

454
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,790
- Old lady was jaywalking.
- I wasn't drunk.

455
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,211
Maybe there was
something else going on, though.

456
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:08,631
- Like what?
- Never mind.

457
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:14,846
I want to find the old guy
and tell him we don't deserve this.

458
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:18,057
You think he put a curse on you?

459
00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:21,394
Good old-fashioned Gypsy curse,
like in Shock Theater?

460
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:25,523
Does it matter?
I have some things to say to him.

461
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:28,151
Maybe you want to come with me?

462
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:38,328
Christ, Hopley.

463
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:40,580
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

464
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:44,375
Yours is just a little slower.

465
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:47,170
You'll get there eventually.

466
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:49,797
I am not going anywhere.

467
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:55,678
You find him, Billy.

468
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:59,015
You find him.

469
00:37:59,098 --> 00:38:00,516
When you do...

470
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:07,982
I want you to kill that old bastard
and say it's from me.

471
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:11,110
I can't.

472
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:13,905
I can't kill him.

473
00:38:13,988 --> 00:38:17,825
I need him to take the curse off.
He's the only one who can, I think.

474
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:21,871
You think he'll take it off?

475
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:27,293
Are you gonna snivel up to him
and say, "I'm so sorry"?

476
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:30,171

I didn't take it.

- Thank God!
- I probably should have, though.

I heard a gunshot after I left.

Maybe Duncan saw a rat and decided
to do a little brain surgery on it...

01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:56,679
But I'm fine now.
Even put a little weight back on.

960
01:27:56,763 --> 01:27:59,891
I was just digging into a slice
of this breakfast pie.

961
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:03,186
- Care to join me?
- I really shouldn't.

962
01:28:03,228 --> 01:28:07,690
Come on, Mike.
I've settled everything with Heidi.

963
01:28:07,774 --> 01:28:11,569
Now it's your turn.
The pie's delicious.

964
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,571
You sure I'm not intruding?

965
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:15,198
Positive...

966
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,705
white doctor from town.
