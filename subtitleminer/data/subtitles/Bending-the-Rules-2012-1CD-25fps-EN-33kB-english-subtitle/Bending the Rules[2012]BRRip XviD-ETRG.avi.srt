1
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,802
My head.

2
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,795
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil. How you been?

3
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,844
Move. Move. I said move.

4
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,764
First of all, A, I'm a cop.

5
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,517
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.

6
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,146
Doesn't it get itchy? Sweaty?

7
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,689
The paper.

8
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,110
Even though your face is covered,
I can tell, you need a hug.

9
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,863
- Back off.
- Come on.

10
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,448
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.

11
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,200
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.

12
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,535
No love? Really?

13
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,876
You coming?

14
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,878
- What did I do?
- How should I know?

15
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,507
You gonna pick that up?

16
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,884
Hurry, I gotta go to court.

17
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:10,690
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet. Let's go.

18
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,950
Thank you.

19
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,651
Come on, man. You can't lock me up
for walking down the street.

20
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,778
Guy with the persuader
pointed at my head?

21
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,321
I don't know that guy.

22
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,615
- What's in the paper?
- News. Newspaper.

23
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,617
Wallet.

24
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,713
And the gun.

25
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,301
Okay, easy tiger.

26
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,639
What's with the paper?

27
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,603
This is a really unsatisfying
conversation.

28
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,065
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?

29
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,192
Better than you.

30
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,866
He took my money.

31
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,996
And when you tell me what
I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.

32
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,789
Off to dance with Lady Justice.

33
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,958
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.

34
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,377
I've always been lucky.

35
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,506
Hey. What the hell?

36
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,093
Firearm.

37
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,095
Thank you, sir.

38
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,895
You're Lena Valoise.

39
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,354
I was.

40
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,732
Tomorrow, Again
is one of my favorite movies.

41
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,025
Me too.

42
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,194
- Nick.
- How do you do?

43
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,154
Great. What are you doing here?

44
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,573
I've come to see my son,
the assistant DA.

45
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,949
Me too.

46
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,452
- You must be very proud.
- I must.

47
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,371
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.

48
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,708
- You look a little lost.
- I am. Courtroom 3?

49
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,044
Come. I'll show you.

50
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,696
We call it the thin blue line, the police.

51
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,407
The fragile barrier
between the bad guys and you.

52
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,538
We give policemen
like Detective Nick Blades guns.

53
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,747
We pay them well.

54
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,919
And all we ask in return
is that they do what they swear they'll do.

55
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,212
Protect and serve.

56
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,422
But what happens
if they break that promise?

57
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,176
What happens if one day you can't tell
the good guys from the bad guys?

58
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,346
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold
care to join us in this case?

59
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,848
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.

60
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,600
Anarchy.

61
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,437
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully
wears in this courtroom...

62
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,231
...is emblematic of the point.

63
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,149
- Objection.
- Sustained.

64
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,735
When I was a kid,
I believed in Batman and Superman.

65
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,363
- Mr. Gold....
- You know what? I still do.

66
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,865
I believe there is such a thing
as right and wrong.

67
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,868
I believe in an irrepressible commitment
to the truth.

68
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:55,623
An irreproachable moral and ethical code
that cannot be compromised.

69
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,711
Detective Blades thought
he could be the law, but not follow it.

70
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,171
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,675
That's wrong.

72
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,510
Thank you.

73
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,226
We will adjourn for the day.

74
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,563
First time he called the police on me
he was 9.

75
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,025
- What'd you do?
- I took away his LEGOs.

76
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,693
Mr. Gold.

77
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,945
Your reaction
to the DA's decision to retire?

78
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,698
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.

79
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,909
Do you have any comments
on a frontrunner for the interim slot?

80
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,245
I've been dealing with police corruption.

81
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,582
It doesn't leave a lot of time
to deal with office personnel matters.

82
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,252
Do you plan on attending
Willie Van Beber's execution?

83
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,380
I did my job...

84
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,050
...putting Willie Van Beber
right where he belongs.

85
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,219
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner
take it from there.

86
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,055
Excuse me.

87
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,808
You people don't mind if I borrow my son,
the assistant DA, do you?

88
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,977
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.

89
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,354
You sure you don't have
an announcement to make?

90
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,981
Your father is having an affair.

91
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,901
Would you and the good Lord
care to comment on that?

92
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,236
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?

93
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,031
Every time you say
Dad's having sex with someone else.

94
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,408
Go to the country house.

95
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,589
Where's the van?

96
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,133
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.

97
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,178
I thought we'd agree
we only use the Hawk in an emergency.

98
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,224
This is an emergency. Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1 :30.

99
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,310
Honey, this car represents
the last fragile thread of dignity...

100
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,438
...holding my family together.
Take my car. Park in my spot.

101
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,981
Theo.

102
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,613
I thought on people's birthdays, other
people are supposed to do what they want.

103
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,407
And I thought turning 40
meant not acting 7.

104
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:06,462
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch
with the next DA.

105
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,257
Great. And you'll still earn less
than our gardener...

106
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,468
...and I'll still be paying for lunch
with my parents' credit card.

107
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,887
Jeez, Kelly, come on. Don't do this.

108
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,850
Just give me today. You're the one who
wants to live in a house big enough for 12.

109
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,269
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.

110
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,521
I'm leaving.

111
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,064
I'm not done yet.

112
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,400
Leaving you.

113
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,528
Actually, you're the one leaving
since my parents own the house.

114
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,197
I'll give you one week
to get your things and get out.

115
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:37,243
Today you do this? Today?
On my birthday?

116
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,121
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years...

117
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,999
...I've wasted on someone
going precisely nowhere?

118
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,876
Kelly, come on.

119
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,171
Wait a minute. What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.

120
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,467
Really? And how many hours do you
spend with them on any given week?

121
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,387
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.

122
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,016
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you
three times what the DA's job pays.

123
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,435
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.

124
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,520
I believe in what I do. Is that so wrong?

125
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,065
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?

126
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,070
Yeah? Okay.

127
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,407
They want me back.

128
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,576
- Right away, sir.
- Good.

129
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,578
Because I don't.

130
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,468
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,889
Please remember
to put the cover back on the Hawk.

132
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,694
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.

133
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,447
I've received the following note
from the jurors.

134
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,990
"We have voted several times.

135
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,786
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."

136
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,456
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.

137
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,959
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.

138
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,337
Would you like to set the matter
for retrial?

139
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,589
Yes. Absolutely, yes.

140
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,928
Blades? I don't care what the jury did.

141
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,640
You're on leave until you deal
with Internal Affairs. Do you hear me?

142
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,268
Until I say so, you are not police.

143
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,647
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA,
they're gonna rush out...

144
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,400
...and get my name tattooed
across their butt cheeks.

145
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,321
- Give me five.
- Nice going.

146
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,866
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.

147
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,661
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?

148
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,205
Was in Interview 4,
but Schaefer needed the room...

149
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,999
...so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?

150
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,836
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate? I'm buying.

151
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,629
You're buying? Or is Gil buying?

152
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,048
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.

153
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,634
He was carrying the paper the cash
when I popped him.

154
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,804
Then some ape in a wool ski mask
came at me with a piece.

155
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,223
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?

156
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,600
There's numbers and letters
circled all over it.

157
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,520
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.

158
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,356
I tried to decipher it
but Gold's closing was distracting.

159
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,900
Sure. Yeah, I'll check it out.

160
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,861
I'll go sit on Gil.

161
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,905
Blades strikes me
as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.

162
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,907
He's dirty.

163
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,619
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.

164
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,874
Yes, exactly. We used to call that felony
larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.

165
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,252
I understand Internal Affairs
is going to water board him next week.

166
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,254
Trust cops to deal with cops?

167
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,300
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.

168
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,678
Wouldn't it be nice
if life was all blacks and whites?

169
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,598
Turns out, it's mostly grays.

170
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,352
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.

171
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,521
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.

172
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,274
Am I supposed to see the forest
or mostly grays?

173
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,860
Look, everything I know
comes from you.

174
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,821
A much younger and stupider me.

175
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:04,408
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.

176
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,495
Good. Grant Stone's gonna get
the interim appointment as the DA.

177
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,789
You're kidding? Grant Stone?

178
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,626
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.

179
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,004
And everyone in the office thinks
you're an asshole. So do the judges.

180
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,464
Most of the defense bar.

181
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,799
I should start caring about
defense lawyers?

182
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,052
Everybody in the system
gets chewed up, Theo.

183
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,304
Including the poor bastards
we send to prison.

184
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:29,058
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--

185
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:31,977
Theo. Take some time off.

186
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,813
Go home. Look in the mirror.

187
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,322
I need Gil Ott for an interview.

188
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,283
- Not here.
- Where is he?

189
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,953
Check again. Detective Schaefer
brought him earlier.

190
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,873
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.

191
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,502
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want? I just came on.

192
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,004
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.

193
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,049
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.

194
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,074
What the crap? Come on.

195
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,718
What's up with the sneak attack?

196
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,928
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

197
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,138
I'm a DA.

198
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,434
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

199
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,978
License.

200
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,106
My registration.

201
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:44,610
Have you had anything to drink tonight,
Mr. Gould, is it?

202
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:48,488
It's Gold. Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.

203
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:52,326
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.

204
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,995
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.

205
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,456
Mr. Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.

206
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,168
If you do not calm down,
I will have to place you under arrest.

207
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,879
Are you joking? What is all this about?

208
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,465
- Please step out of the car.
- No.

209
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,259
Mr. Gold, please step out
of the vehicle now.

210
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,054
I am placing you under arrest.

211
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,390
This is absolutely ridiculous.

212
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,684
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.

213
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,228
- No, I'm not.
- You are definitely resisting arrest.

214
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:21,647
What are you talking about?

215
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,232
If you continue to resist arrest,
I will Tase you.

216
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,735
Are you out of your freaking mind?

217
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,910
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.

218
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,913
Make the call. Let's go 10-99.

219
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,795
Detective Nick Blades...

220
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:49,091
...there's something shocking
you should see, State and Chestnut.

221
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,531
Get the hell away from me.

222
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,908
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.

223
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,702
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.

224
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:19,955
Just leave me alone.

225
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,833
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.

226
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,585
I've seen Tomorrow, Again
like 50 times.

227
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:29,047
Please don't speak to me.

228
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,133
What happened?

229
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:36,430
Two policemen kidnapped
and Tased me.

230
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,723
Friends of yours, I presume.

231
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,351
I've never been Tased myself.

232
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,439
Imagine the worst dental appointment
of all time.

233
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,653
You got lucky, detective.

234
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,948
It won't happen again.

235
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,117
I've always been lucky.

236
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,912
Today's my birthday.

237
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,999
I hope it's the best one ever.

238
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,120
Kelly!

239
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,332
No, no. Don't do this to me.

240
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,417
Kelly.

241
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,419
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.

242
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,796
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.

243
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,174
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!

244
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,301
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead...

245
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,595
...apparently,
your precious Hawk is missing...

246
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,097
...and you may remember,
I'm going to my parents...

247
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:04,851
...until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.

248
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,353
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.

249
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,774
Just give me a little more time
to explain to the kids.

250
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:19,908
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys. Daddy loves you.

251
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,576
See you soon.

252
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,546
This asshole must be having
the worst day of his life.

253
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:37,592
He just called in to report that
someone stole his car out of his driveway.

254
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:41,262
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.

255
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,432
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?

256
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,978
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?

257
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:51,398
You know what happens
when you wake up in the morning...

258
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:54,609
...and you can't tell the difference between
good guys and bad?

259
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,445
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.

260
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,239
Anarchy.

261
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,325
And the Cubs win the World Series.

262
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:08,748
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.

263
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,510
Yeah?

264
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,930
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.

265
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,059
We've done our share of fooling around
over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.

266
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:32,355
It's time for him to hang up his sword and
die with something approaching dignity.

267
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,441
Mom, I don't need to hear this.

268
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,444
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.

269
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,613
I thought it was the cancer,
so I didn't push. But now I know.

270
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,201
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.

271
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:48,246
What time are you picking us up
for lunch?

272
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,332
Theo?

273
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,210
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.

274
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,004
- So take the van.
- It's dead.

275
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,467
Again? All right, you have my permission
to use the Hawk, just be very careful.

276
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:03,553
- I can't.
- Why not? What's wrong with the Hawk?

277
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,140
I don't believe this.

278
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,392
I gotta go.

279
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,520
If something happens to that automobile,
it'll kill your father.

280
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:16,691
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.

281
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:42,675
Move out of the street.

282
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:47,722
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.

283
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,892
Please move out of the street
or I'll have to cite you.

284
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm bleeding here. I'm bleeding here.

285
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,232
Move now.

286
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,416
My car was stolen. I saw the guy driving it
around the corner two minutes ago.

287
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:20,255
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh? Shocking.

288
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:25,260
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.

289
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:27,136
I don't see anything.

290
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:30,139
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.

291
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,810
You know, I'm about to go off shift
if you want a ride downtown.

292
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,979
Thank you.

293
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,337
Okay, Blades,
so now you're buying two dinners.

294
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,464
And not the Whole Foods deli again,
either.

295
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:05,800
Someplace where they bring food
to the table.

296
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,885
Let's see what you got,
then we'll decide.

297
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:12,140
Well, it was code. Forensics figures it
for driver's license numbers.

298
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:13,808
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

299
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,520
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep. And it's four local Louisiana plates.

300
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,772
It's just that there are three extra letters.

301
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:22,650
WVB or BVW,
depending on how you read it.

302
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:27,238
But one of the cars is registered
to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.

303
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,366
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.

304
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,245
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.

305
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,707
If we have the list and Gil's in jail,
how does the car get stolen?

306
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,543
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.

307
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,963
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.

308
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,424
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.

309
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,925
Check with Schaefer and Chin.

310
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,845
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses
on my way to Gil's.

311
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,054
Okay.

312
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,850
Hi, Nick.

313
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,019
Blades. Goddamn it.

314
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,773
If you're out there impersonating
a police officer, I will pinch you myself.

315
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:04,817
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.

316
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:07,111
In the meantime,
I'm having my teeth cleaned...

317
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:08,613
...and maybe a trim.

318
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:26,172
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.

319
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,051
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.

320
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:34,889
So as soon as we can unplug an officer
from another matter, we'll be with you.

321
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:39,477
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor
and tell him to come out here now.

322
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:43,481
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs
to see you.

323
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:45,399
Thank you, sir.

324
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,694
Yes?

325
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,280
I understand that my reputation
precedes me.

326
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:54,283
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour...

327
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,411
...my car was stolen,
and I just want a little help. That's all.

328
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:00,998
Despite the fact you've been trying
to put one of my best cops in jail...

329
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,292
...I find this conversation scintillating.

330
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:08,130
You, in fact,
may describe it as electrifying.

331
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:30,361
- How you doing?
- Good.

332
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,655
I'm detective Nick Blades,
New Orleans police.

333
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,616
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.

334
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,952
- Your parents home?
- No.

335
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,037
- They at work?
- No.

336
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,416
- I give up. Where are they?
- Dead.

337
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,211
My grandma says
that if she was on the jury...

338
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,046
...she'd vote to send you to jail.

339
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:51,590
I guess I'm glad
your grandma's not on the jury.

340
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:55,094
My grandma says
you should be ashamed of yourself.

341
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,222
I am. Your grandma take care of you?

342
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:00,808
- Yeah.
- Is she home?

343
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,018
No.

344
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:04,854
Is that your grandma's car
in the driveway?

345
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,898
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?

346
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:10,568
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?

347
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,778
- Yeah.
- Is he home?

348
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:14,530
- No.

349
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,699
- Where's he?
- Jail.

350
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,618
Does he get out soon?

351
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:23,414
My grandma said it depends if his jury
is as dumb as yours.

352
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:27,084
Tell your grandma
to lock the car up tight.

353
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:29,128
All right.

354
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:23,224
- Hand over the money already.
- It's not like it's because you got nothing.

355
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,975
Yeah, well.

356
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:45,788
It's okay, guys.

357
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,674
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.

358
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:59,385
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot? He just said that.

359
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:01,679
Never heard of you. Let's see it.

360
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:19,154
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.

361
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,325
Enjoy.

362
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:26,370
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.

363
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:29,248
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know. Ask him.

364
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,417
What you want with Gil?

365
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:33,877
Where is the little creep?

366
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:37,506
After he robbed 400 off me,
he didn't leave no forwarding address.

367
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:40,175
- You see him with this guy?
- No.

368
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,886
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?

369
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:46,682
All I know is, last time I saw him,
he was okay.

370
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:49,560
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.

371
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:52,104
I chose Olive Garden.

372
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,732
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?

373
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,609
Thank you.

374
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,574
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.

375
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,121
I also took that off Gil.

376
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:13,125
Call 911. Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.

377
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,966
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.

378
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,301
I'm sure they'll find it.

379
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:25,262
But with my luck,
somebody will probably have peed in it.

380
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,182
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?

381
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,143
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.

382
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,686
Well, also in the meantime...

383
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:35,481
...my wife is taking away my kids,
my car was stolen...

384
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:38,442
...and because of Blades,
I'm getting no help from the cops.

385
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:42,362
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.

386
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:48,243
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.

387
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,537
I should have listened.

388
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:55,959
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.

389
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:58,670
That's much better than rotting teeth.

390
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:04,718
You mentioned the Van Beber case.

391
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:06,470
Here's the murder book.

392
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:10,849
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.

393
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:13,894
And everyone was mad at me
for not dealing.

394
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:17,064
The judge was mad at me
for ruining his summer vacation.

395
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:19,650
The boss didn't want me tied up
for three months.

396
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,986
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.

397
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:26,406
Plead it. Settle it. Compromise.

398
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,744
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber
gets his just punishment...

399
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,746
...because I refused to compromise.

400
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:35,624
Grab that, will you?

401
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:38,627
- Hello?
- Kelly...

402
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,921
...you get your husband
on the phone right now.

403
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:44,007
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.

404
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,677
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.

405
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:48,637
- Yeah.
- Who was that?

406
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:50,639
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.

407
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:54,393
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger
about our problems like it's CNN.

408
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,521
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

409
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:01,400
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly
he insisted we come to your house.

410
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,444
When you weren't here,
he got very upset and locked himself...

411
00:31:04,611 --> 00:31:06,947
- ...in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?

412
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:10,409
Apparently. He must've had it
in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears...

413
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:13,912
- ...like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?

414
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,748
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.

415
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:19,209
You can buy guns
in vending machines now.

416
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:21,837
- Call the cops.
- No. I will not have some SWAT team...

417
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:24,715
...blasting through the door
scaring your father to death.

418
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:28,510
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can. I gotta go.

419
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:40,856
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.

420
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,907
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.

421
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,078
Where'd you get those tickets? Kinko's?

422
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:57,497
Nice pants.

423
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:01,001
Nick? Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

424
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:03,170
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?

425
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:06,256
He's been threatening to kill himself
for the last 20 minutes.

426
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:09,384
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.

427
00:32:10,052 --> 00:32:11,845
Herb, I want the truth.

428
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,723
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.

429
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,808
Along with everything else,
he's cheating.

430
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:19,394
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?

431
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,688
Herb. What did you do?

432
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:25,275
- Wait.
- Marty. Holy moly.

433
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:26,818
Put down the gun.

434
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:30,739
- Oh, Lord. Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.

435
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:31,907
He's not well, Nick.

436
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:35,911
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky. He won't shoot Marty.

437
00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:38,955
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.

438
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:41,166
You need a haircut.

439
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:45,379
I said I'd stay with him in sickness
and in health.

440
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:48,090
Now he's sick and I'm staying.

441
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:50,092
But I can't abide the cheating.

442
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:52,844
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.

443
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:55,680
Just follow him. I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.

444
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:58,100
That sounds like a bad idea.

445
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,435
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?

446
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:03,563
I heard about your son's car being stolen,
thought I could help.

447
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:05,398
What car?

448
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:10,153
- Oh, my God. The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?

449
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,906
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?

450
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:15,867
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.

451
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:19,162
Detective Blades happened to stop by
and everything's under control.

452
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:21,623
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.

453
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,209
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.

454
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:26,962
He's agreed to help find the car.

455
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:29,131
And the other matter?

456
00:33:29,464 --> 00:33:32,175
Forget the other matter for the moment.

457
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:34,970
You and Theo find the Hawk.

458
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:38,014
I'll do everything I can
to keep this from your father.

459
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:39,975
I'll expect regular reports.

460
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:45,105
- She wants reports.
- I heard.

461
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,118
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.

462
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:02,664
This is a very comfortable mattress.

463
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:05,417
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.

464
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:07,377
Kelly bought it.

465
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:14,676
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.

466
00:34:15,343 --> 00:34:19,306
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?

467
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:22,767
Same reason everybody buys one.

468
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:25,729
It's a crazy world out there, son.

469
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:29,649
And I got like 30 percent off.

470
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:34,154
Don't you tell your mother.

471
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,367
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.

472
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:42,954
Am I dreaming this
or is your Uncle Marty here?

473
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:44,831
Uncle Marty?

474
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:48,251
Of course, he had to leave.

475
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,630
Took my gun.

476
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:55,508
I think that's probably for the best.

477
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:59,721
Theo, your mother
has to try this mattress.

478
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:04,851
I mean, it is incredible. You should try it.

479
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:08,355
Come on. Try it. Come on.

480
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:23,119
Yeah. So?

481
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:27,415
It is. It's a great mattress.

482
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:33,755
It is sublime is what it is.

483
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,633
Yeah.

484
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:39,219
It's nice.

485
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:05,703
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.

486
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,705
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.

487
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:10,708
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.

488
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,335
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.

489
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:15,505
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck. Monday, on a ship.

490
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:18,174
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.

491
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:21,010
Trust me, you're not getting any play
from the department.

492
00:36:21,177 --> 00:36:24,264
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.

493
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:27,642
You get your way, I'm gonna need
all the money I can scrape together.

494
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:30,687
I'm not dropping the charges,
even if you do find the car.

495
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:33,648
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.

496
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:36,651
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.

497
00:36:36,818 --> 00:36:39,362
- You know him?
- How would I know him?

498
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:43,032
Gil was carrying a newspaper with
plates numbers written in code on it.

499
00:36:43,825 --> 00:36:45,577
Your plate number was on the list.

500
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:49,330
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye
on the Hawk. It's a very nice car.

501
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:52,167
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.

502
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,378
I wasted every weekend of my childhood
working on that damn car.

503
00:36:57,297 --> 00:37:00,300
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.

504
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,344
I get it.

505
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,182
So, what do we do? We go see Ott,
you slap him around a little...

506
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,850
...he tells us where my car is?

507
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:12,437
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court,
so I had to park him.

508
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:15,690
While you were blasting me
in front of the jury, he slipped.

509
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,984
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.

510
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:21,362
But I'll assume that he delivered
a copy of the list once he got out.

511
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,323
So how do we find my car?

512
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:25,408
How should I know?

513
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,828
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.

514
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:31,748
Although, technically,
I'm on administrative leave.

515
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,043
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.

516
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,211
Don't do that.

517
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:44,218
What--?

518
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,013
What--?

519
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:55,730
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?

520
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:57,774
I'm a lawyer. My mind is my weapon.

521
00:37:57,941 --> 00:38:01,361
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me
long before I find your car.

522
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:10,203
Come on.

523
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:15,625
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.

524
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,543
Why are we here?

525
00:38:18,753 --> 00:38:20,588
Come on, let's go.

526
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:25,426
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.

527
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:30,640
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.

528
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:35,311
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.

529
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:39,607
Gentlemen, we honor the master
and the practice...

530
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:42,443
...by bowing when we enter the dojo.

531
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:54,163
We're police. You Edward Mackie?

532
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:01,838
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.

533
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:05,216
Are you insane?

534
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:16,227
Ever see that scene in Indiana jones
where he watches some guy...

535
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:18,938
...with a big sword do his thing
and then shoots him?

536
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,065
In this situation, I'm Indy.

537
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:29,740
Move. Now.

538
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:33,911
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--

539
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:38,166
Move.

540
00:39:45,256 --> 00:39:46,716
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

541
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:49,177
Theodore, put thing down
before you kill someone.

542
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:58,603
Hey. Hey, give me a break.

543
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,689
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?

544
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:03,900
It's already in the book.

545
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:07,945
Thanks for everything.

546
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:10,948
That's why those people
are so widely despised.

547
00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:14,535
There's no give and take.
No compromise.

548
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:18,039
What does any of this
have to do with my car?

549
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:21,459
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.

550
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:24,670
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.

551
00:40:24,837 --> 00:40:27,798
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.

552
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:32,053
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.

553
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,138
In prison,
he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.

554
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:37,767
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect,
looking for Gil at his father's place.

555
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:41,145
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names
before I do more good deeds.

556
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:44,315
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning. He's in jail.

557
00:40:44,482 --> 00:40:46,901
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?

558
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:49,320
The boy's running
so he must have burned somebody.

559
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:51,948
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.

560
00:40:52,114 --> 00:40:55,326
I seem to recall something about
my mother paying you to find my car?

561
00:40:55,493 --> 00:40:57,954
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?

562
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:01,082
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?

563
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:04,502
Possibly. There seems to be a connection
between gangs and the list.

564
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:08,005
Before I was chief assistant,
I did head up the gang prosecution unit.

565
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:11,008
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?

566
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:13,302
- Really.
- Isn't he about to be executed?

567
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:15,471
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.

568
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:21,811
Get in.

569
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:24,897
Get in. Come on, move, move.

570
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:27,692
- You, too.
- Let's go.

571
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:29,777
Come on, let's go.

572
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:31,862
Go, go, go.

573
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:41,288
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.

574
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:44,125
No, thanks. You're like a walking cliché.

575
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,753
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.

576
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:51,132
Brother Blades. So nice to see you.

577
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:54,593
Happy, this is my partner,
Roberto Clemente.

578
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,305
The sainted ballplayer. It's my honor.

579
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:02,059
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott
and he ends up locked up.

580
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,602
You know anything about that?

581
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:05,855
I heard some old guys
kicked the shit out him.

582
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:09,233
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.

583
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,739
Give me six maple, two glazed,
and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.

584
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:17,658
And I'll need the paper back
when you're done reading it.

585
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:25,291
It's like warm maple syrup
being poured over your tongue.

586
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,129
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.

587
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,591
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?

588
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:36,844
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.

589
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:41,140
Why do they never see that coming?

590
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:48,147
What a waste of 50 grand.

591
00:42:48,481 --> 00:42:51,484
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.

592
00:43:04,205 --> 00:43:07,333
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.

593
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:11,045
That one on the list?

594
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,175
Yep.

595
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:17,843
It's mine.

596
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,679
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.

597
00:43:20,846 --> 00:43:22,890
Yeah. I'll make sure to use my Club.

598
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:25,851
That was my guy yesterday,
outside the bar.

599
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:27,311
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.

600
00:43:27,478 --> 00:43:28,771
Why a wool mask in July?

601
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:31,482
I was hoping to grab Gil
before he delivered the paper.

602
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:34,026
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.

603
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,528
No, the paper wasn't for me.

604
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:40,616
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily
bad reputation, Blades.

605
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:45,788
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor
convicts on the four yard at Angola.

606
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:48,624
I was one of them. It was a social club.

607
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:51,669
I understand you've since
diversified considerably.

608
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:58,050
And like all other complex organizations,
we have our internal differences.

609
00:43:58,676 --> 00:44:02,221
The newspaper was a delivery
from Willie Van Beber...

610
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,890
...to a pro hitter, identity unknown.

611
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,558
You know who Van Beber is?

612
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:09,853
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?

613
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:14,108
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.

614
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:15,943
He's running out of time.

615
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,363
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?

616
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,115
I believe I do.

617
00:44:21,281 --> 00:44:24,660
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.

618
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:27,162
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.

619
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:31,208
I need Gil because he's the one
that can ID the person out on the street...

620
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,335
...taking orders from Van Beber.

621
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:34,920
- Still with me?
- Yeah.

622
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:39,008
If you hadn't popped Gil,
I'd have his contact and it would be over.

623
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:43,762
I'm genuinely sorry. I had no idea
my nose was in your business.

624
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:47,516
- Yeah. These things happen.
- So where's Ed?

625
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:51,395
Ed's dead. Or will be shortly.

626
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:54,732
And you better keep your eye
on your little pal Roberto the DA...

627
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,067
...because if he's not on the list,
he will be.

628
00:44:57,234 --> 00:44:59,987
You know
he's the one that put Willie down.

629
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:01,697
He's on the list.

630
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:03,907
Like I said, find Gil.

631
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:08,203
Get his contact, take him off the street,
or feed him to me.

632
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,998
Then, hopefully,
Van Beber will go to his great reward...

633
00:45:11,165 --> 00:45:13,292
...and I'll get back
to my goddamn doughnuts.

634
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:25,304
- Blades.
- It's not cars. It's bodies.

635
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:30,851
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.

636
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:33,604
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.

637
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:37,316
I mind. You're putting my life at risk
and those of everyone around you.

638
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:44,031
Idiot!

639
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:47,993
Hey, I'm back.

640
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:51,038
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males...

641
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:55,042
...all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?

642
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:58,629
How many non-Whole Foods dinners
am I up to? I'm going to prison soon.

643
00:45:58,796 --> 00:46:01,298
Two of out of the three
have federal jackets.

644
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:03,717
Happy Conners is a snitch?
That's hard to believe.

645
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:07,513
Negative. It's Ed Mackie and
Dean Nickerson are the informants.

646
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:09,765
- Which agency?
- FBI.

647
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:13,268
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy
named Willie Van Beber. Know him?

648
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:17,022
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.

649
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:20,567
Very soon. This is his last hurrah.

650
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:23,987
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber
the names of the informants.

651
00:46:24,154 --> 00:46:26,698
Who has access to the FBI
informant database?

652
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:31,662
Anyone senior in this department or
in any other in the region, state or federal.

653
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:33,747
Why is Gold on the list though?

654
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:36,500
I'm sure there's more than a few
who wanna smoke Gold.

655
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:39,419
I expect it's because
he put Van Beber on death row.

656
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:43,215
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?

657
00:46:43,382 --> 00:46:45,884
No, we put this out there,
our leaky cop evaporates.

658
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:47,177
True.

659
00:46:47,344 --> 00:46:51,014
Glass finds out I'm working this,
he'll have a coronary. I don't need that.

660
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:53,725
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.

661
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:56,603
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?

662
00:46:57,437 --> 00:47:00,274
- Come on! What are you doing?
- No.

663
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,858
Come on! Dude!

664
00:47:11,952 --> 00:47:12,995
You coming?

665
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:24,423
Five-0 in the house.

666
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:25,757
Was that really necessary?

667
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:28,719
I keep my love of food
and my professional life separate.

668
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:33,598
- Fatty.
- Blades.

669
00:47:33,765 --> 00:47:36,018
Give me a slab to go with
the sauce on the side.

670
00:47:36,184 --> 00:47:38,395
I heard you paid off that jury.

671
00:47:38,562 --> 00:47:40,981
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.

672
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:45,277
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.

673
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,281
Along with my order,
I'll need an address on Gil Ott.

674
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:51,616
I don't know no Gil.

675
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:55,287
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.

676
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:57,789
And I do know me a Bill.

677
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:04,129
Theodore, assume for a moment...

678
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:07,174
...most of the people in this place
are on parole, probation...

679
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:09,301
...or otherwise in the system.

680
00:48:09,468 --> 00:48:14,556
How long would it take for me to find out
one of them is in possession of a gun...

681
00:48:14,723 --> 00:48:20,479
...resulting in their immediate
and protracted incarceration?

682
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:23,690
You ain't even no police.

683
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:30,530
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.

684
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:34,159
Feel free to call me any time
within the next five minutes.

685
00:48:45,545 --> 00:48:46,880
Yeah.

686
00:48:49,174 --> 00:48:51,968
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.

687
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:55,555
Most importantly, what does any of it
have to do with finding my car?

688
00:48:55,722 --> 00:48:58,141
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.

689
00:48:58,308 --> 00:49:00,268
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.

690
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:03,396
Talk to me.

691
00:49:04,648 --> 00:49:06,441
Thanks, Fatty. I owe you.

692
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:10,862
Hey. You can't just go and
do whatever you want in life, Blades.

693
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:12,447
There are systems and rules.

694
00:49:12,614 --> 00:49:14,699
These systems and rules exist
for a reason.

695
00:49:14,866 --> 00:49:16,993
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.

696
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,539
And not once have you just cut a corner,
just bent a little.

697
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:23,500
You know what the United States
Supreme Court says?

698
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:27,003
United States Supreme Court says
a prosecutor is a representative...

699
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,757
...not of an ordinary party
to a controversy. No, sir.

700
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:35,679
As a prosecutor,
I am the representative of our sovereignty...

701
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:38,098
...whose obligation
to govern impartially...

702
00:49:38,265 --> 00:49:41,434
...is as compelling as its obligation
to govern at all.

703
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:44,729
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective...

704
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:49,276
...my solemn obligation
is not to win cases, but to do justice.

705
00:49:50,193 --> 00:49:53,321
I make one wrong move,
I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.

706
00:49:53,697 --> 00:49:57,117
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.

707
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:59,202
It's very tiring to be around you.

708
00:50:08,086 --> 00:50:10,130
You just bought a slab of ribs.

709
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:14,009
You kidding me? The last time I ate
at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.

710
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:15,802
This place rocks.

711
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:18,179
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?

712
00:50:18,346 --> 00:50:21,683
I'm feeling really lost. Can you try
and explain to me what's happening?

713
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,476
Your car look anything like that?

714
00:50:24,602 --> 00:50:27,647
That's it. I don't believe this.

715
00:50:27,814 --> 00:50:28,982
That's it. That's my car.

716
00:50:29,149 --> 00:50:32,360
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?

717
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:34,279
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.

718
00:50:34,446 --> 00:50:36,323
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.

719
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:38,992
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.

720
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,036
Give me the keys.

721
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:44,039
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.

722
00:50:44,205 --> 00:50:46,624
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear...

723
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,627
...on how important that car is
to my father. To me.

724
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:52,797
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
- It's not.

725
00:50:52,964 --> 00:50:54,507
I need to find that car, Blades.

726
00:50:54,716 --> 00:50:58,386
My family is gone, my career is shit,
my mother's insane and my father's dying.

727
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:01,473
The one thing I got half a chance of doing
is finding that car.

728
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:05,185
And if you can't or won't help me,
then goddamn it, I will do it myself.

729
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:08,146
Get off. Get off.

730
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,149
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.

731
00:51:11,316 --> 00:51:15,945
Hello? I'm kidnapped. Here, here.

732
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:18,698
This is why this country's
going in the toilet.

733
00:51:18,865 --> 00:51:20,992
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?

734
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:24,120
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?

735
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:27,624
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.

736
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,751
I just saw him.

737
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:32,962
Called from the trunk of his car
after you told me about the list.

738
00:51:33,129 --> 00:51:35,757
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk? What happened?

739
00:51:35,924 --> 00:51:37,383
A pro, for sure.

740
00:51:37,592 --> 00:51:39,969
You were right about Mackie,
he was working for us.

741
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,890
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.

742
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:46,309
Mackie would have put him down forever.

743
00:51:46,476 --> 00:51:48,478
I was actually figuring Happy
for the body.

744
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:52,273
I don't think so. Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.

745
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,026
- You know Willie Van Beber?
- 4-4 number-one shot caller?

746
00:51:55,193 --> 00:51:58,404
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.

747
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:00,782
Van Beber's settling up
before he gets executed.

748
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:03,034
They wanna kill each other,
it's fine with me.

749
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:05,328
Start smoking my informants,
I get annoyed.

750
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:08,832
I mean, Mackie means
we lose two ongoing investigations.

751
00:52:08,998 --> 00:52:11,501
He made the list
for putting Van Beber on the row.

752
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:15,004
- How nice. Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.

753
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:18,341
After you get your delivery boy,
plug the damn leak.

754
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:23,847
We're not even looking for my car.
I doubt we ever were.

755
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:26,724
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?

756
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:29,102
These things take time. Have faith.

757
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:32,105
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.

758
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:52,917
I don't understand. Why are we waiting?

759
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:56,212
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we
just go in and get Gil Ott now?

760
00:52:56,379 --> 00:52:58,006
Fools rush in, my friend.

761
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:03,011
I hate golf.

762
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:09,892
Other than working on the Hawk, this was
the one thing my father and I did together.

763
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:13,479
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs
around people's necks.

764
00:53:14,022 --> 00:53:15,106
You just have to relax.

765
00:53:17,317 --> 00:53:18,359
How?

766
00:53:19,235 --> 00:53:22,447
Before you swing, breathe.

767
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:30,246
Okay, time's up. I'll go get him.

768
00:53:31,581 --> 00:53:34,083
If Gil Ott's in there,
you think my car is nearby?

769
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,128
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.

770
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:42,216
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing. I'll be back.

771
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:15,583
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil. How you been?

772
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,586
Until about two seconds ago,
pretty good.

773
00:54:18,753 --> 00:54:22,048
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?

774
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:24,467
- Out where?
- Jail.

775
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:27,970
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.

776
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:33,142
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead. Okay?

777
00:54:33,351 --> 00:54:36,354
Paper had the name of 4-4's,
two of which were federal snitches.

778
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:39,315
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

779
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:43,986
It also had the name of a DA named Theo
Gold, who also happens to be a friend.

780
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:45,905
You get the needle for whacking a DA.

781
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:48,658
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.

782
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:50,827
You're the only one
who can ID the source...

783
00:54:50,993 --> 00:54:54,872
...which is why I assume you're whacked
out in this caddy shack shit hole.

784
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,167
That's just rude. I live here.

785
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:02,004
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.

786
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:15,768
Everybody wants you, Gil. Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.

787
00:55:15,935 --> 00:55:19,355
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.

788
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:21,899
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.

789
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:26,279
Sit down.

790
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:28,447
I need your contact. One name.

791
00:55:28,614 --> 00:55:31,826
Give me that name and maybe
I'll let you live so you can remodel.

792
00:55:31,993 --> 00:55:34,078
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.

793
00:55:36,914 --> 00:55:38,749
Back inside.

794
00:55:39,584 --> 00:55:41,085
Now!

795
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:07,445
You want me to go after them
or get those off you?

796
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:10,114
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.

797
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:12,950
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.

798
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,620
Did you ask about the car?

799
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:17,830
I forgot.

800
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:21,042
It's okay.

801
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:25,713
I'm sorry I shot you.

802
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:29,759
Nothing nine Band-Aids
and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.

803
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:32,762
I did predict you'd shoot me.

804
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:34,221
I remember.

805
00:56:34,388 --> 00:56:37,058
I decided I wanted to live
more than I want my car.

806
00:56:37,224 --> 00:56:39,101
My father will understand that.

807
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:40,645
I'll take you home.

808
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:42,772
Just drop me off at my parents'.

809
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,649
I'll break the news.

810
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:46,359
I can already see his face.

811
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:49,362
God, I'd do anything to avoid
that slightly disappointed...

812
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:52,114
...but not altogether surprised look.

813
00:56:52,531 --> 00:56:54,158
You know the look?

814
00:56:54,325 --> 00:56:55,785
Please.

815
00:56:55,951 --> 00:57:00,331
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old
daughter I see one weekend a month.

816
00:57:00,498 --> 00:57:02,333
I know the look.

817
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:10,383
Theo, go get him before
one of the neighbors calls the police.

818
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:14,345
Yeah.

819
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:16,347
- Yep.
- What are you doing?

820
00:57:16,514 --> 00:57:17,848
Call you in a bit.

821
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:20,059
I can't tell whether
I'm being guarded or surveilled.

822
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:22,395
Your little redheaded
co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?

823
00:57:22,561 --> 00:57:26,107
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really? Why?

824
00:57:26,273 --> 00:57:28,192
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.

825
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:32,029
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.

826
00:57:32,196 --> 00:57:34,990
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.

827
00:57:35,157 --> 00:57:38,327
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?

828
00:57:38,494 --> 00:57:42,039
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on. That's ridiculous.

829
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:46,127
She can go to any private firm in this city
and make five times what she's making.

830
00:57:46,335 --> 00:57:49,547
She doesn't need to sell informant data
for money, okay?

831
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:53,551
- You want me to call her? Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore. Maybe later.

832
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:56,595
My mother wants you to come in
for my belated birthday dinner.

833
00:57:56,762 --> 00:58:00,808
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.

834
00:58:00,975 --> 00:58:05,688
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.

835
00:58:05,855 --> 00:58:09,400
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.

836
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:11,777
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?

837
00:58:11,944 --> 00:58:16,407
Can you do the entire Valoise family a
favor and just stay off the subject? Please?

838
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:20,494
Did you know that Robert Evans was
our neighbor for a while in California?

839
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:23,122
Of course,
that was before he became huge.

840
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:28,502
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.

841
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:31,922
Apparently not so incredible
that he cast me in anything.

842
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:34,633
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.

843
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,386
Sonny and Cher. Bobby Redford.

844
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:39,638
Bobby had a terrible overbite.

845
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:42,141
Tell me again. Who are you?

846
00:58:42,308 --> 00:58:45,644
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.

847
00:58:46,187 --> 00:58:47,938
That is very interesting.

848
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:50,107
Your son's a great lawyer.

849
00:58:50,274 --> 00:58:53,485
We would have preferred
if he had gone into dentistry...

850
00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:55,988
...but you give them wings,
they fly away.

851
00:58:56,155 --> 00:58:57,489
You know how it is, Marty.

852
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:02,578
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.

853
00:59:02,745 --> 00:59:07,833
That was before anyone told me
about his, you know, style.

854
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,253
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it? Thank you.

855
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:17,593
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.

856
00:59:18,344 --> 00:59:20,471
I used to think I had one.

857
00:59:20,638 --> 00:59:23,015
Now I realize I burned it down
without even knowing.

858
00:59:23,682 --> 00:59:25,517
Homes get rebuilt.

859
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:28,938
All I wanted was to spend
whatever time my dad has left...

860
00:59:29,855 --> 00:59:32,358
...driving around with him in the Hawk.

861
00:59:32,524 --> 00:59:35,486
- Pulling plugs. You know?
- And sending me to prison.

862
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:38,405
I figured this is the time
to be a good son.

863
00:59:39,031 --> 00:59:41,367
After, I'd try to be a better
husband and father.

864
00:59:44,954 --> 00:59:46,789
Tell me about your daughter.

865
00:59:46,956 --> 00:59:48,916
She lives with her mom.

866
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:53,629
All the money I skimmed from the
detective busts went toward her school.

867
00:59:53,796 --> 00:59:57,883
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.

868
01:00:00,177 --> 01:00:01,387
I feel horrible about it.

869
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:05,057
You expect me to drop the case...

870
01:00:05,224 --> 01:00:08,102
...because you have the same problems
that everybody else does.

871
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:11,063
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.

872
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,316
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.

873
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:17,152
People get divorced
and pay for braces all the time...

874
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:20,364
- ...without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.

875
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:21,949
They lack opportunity.

876
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:24,743
Maybe.

877
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,037
I mean, my wife's family has money.

878
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:29,623
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.

879
01:00:30,457 --> 01:00:33,377
You still can't tell me
what we've been doing for the past day?

880
01:00:33,544 --> 01:00:34,878
For the moment, no.

881
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:37,631
And the car is safely on its way
to Argentina.

882
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:42,594
Bon voyage, old friend.

883
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:47,558
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.

884
01:00:47,725 --> 01:00:50,602
Tomorrow, Again,
again and again and again.

885
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:54,273
- It's a great movie.
- Yeah. She's not your mother.

886
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,941
What's that about your mother?

887
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:58,735
Theo was just telling me
that Lena's not my mother.

888
01:00:58,986 --> 01:01:00,737
You didn't know that?

889
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:14,126
I told you, detective, my father dropped
me off at the hotel. I was alone.

890
01:01:14,293 --> 01:01:16,753
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.

891
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,423
- I can't help it.
- Try.

892
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,341
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.

893
01:01:21,508 --> 01:01:24,970
He was there with you. He used three
capital letters to sign for the drink.

894
01:01:25,137 --> 01:01:27,848
WMP. William McPherson.

895
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:29,349
Why do you hate me?

896
01:01:29,516 --> 01:01:34,146
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson. People love me.

897
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,068
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson. People love me.

898
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:43,238
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.

899
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:45,449
That scene kills me every time.

900
01:01:45,616 --> 01:01:47,701
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.

901
01:01:47,868 --> 01:01:49,620
- WVB?
- Yeah.

902
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:52,122
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.

903
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:54,458
Makes sense, but we figured
it came from him.

904
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,168
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl...

905
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:59,463
...and she says Gil snitched for her
in a possession case last year.

906
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,423
So she felt like she owed him a favor.

907
01:02:01,757 --> 01:02:04,551
Gil gave her some story
about the hold being trumped up.

908
01:02:04,718 --> 01:02:07,221
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.

909
01:02:07,387 --> 01:02:09,223
Check and see
if Van Beber has any kids.

910
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:11,850
Nick, what the heck
are you doing in there?

911
01:02:12,017 --> 01:02:14,519
- I gotta go. Just check.
- Okay.

912
01:02:22,736 --> 01:02:23,987
I'm sorry.

913
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:25,572
Okay, that's it.

914
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:28,450
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.

915
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:32,120
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?

916
01:02:32,287 --> 01:02:34,873
You say you'll bring it back
and I nod like a robot?

917
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,751
I'll take him. Just let me get this. Yo.

918
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:40,587
Detective Blades? It's Rosalyn Wohl.

919
01:02:40,754 --> 01:02:42,422
- Yes?
- Who is that?

920
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:44,049
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.

921
01:02:44,216 --> 01:02:46,093
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?

922
01:02:48,303 --> 01:02:51,431
He says he'll give you the guy
who's killing the people on the list.

923
01:02:51,598 --> 01:02:53,475
All right. Where?

924
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,645
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.

925
01:02:56,853 --> 01:02:59,272
Just do what he says.

926
01:03:01,274 --> 01:03:02,818
- What does Gil want?
- The list.

927
01:03:02,985 --> 01:03:04,611
- Why?
- If he gets the list back...

928
01:03:04,778 --> 01:03:07,572
...his employer refrains
from putting a bullet in his ear.

929
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:10,742
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.

930
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:12,786
You don't have the list. Happy took it.

931
01:03:12,953 --> 01:03:15,914
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?

932
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:19,876
You know all those bad people you sent
to prison? They ever call to say thanks?

933
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:23,463
No. Sometimes I send people
to prison for doing bad things.

934
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:26,299
Doesn't necessarily mean
they're bad people.

935
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:28,468
I appreciate that.

936
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:31,763
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?

937
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:35,308
Apparently his last wish is for you
to precede him to the promised land.

938
01:03:35,475 --> 01:03:38,603
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo. Too dangerous.

939
01:03:38,812 --> 01:03:42,733
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?

940
01:03:42,899 --> 01:03:45,819
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.

941
01:03:48,697 --> 01:03:51,450
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car. Don't give me a gun.

942
01:03:51,616 --> 01:03:54,119
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.

943
01:03:54,286 --> 01:03:55,620
- You trust me?
- I trust you.

944
01:03:55,787 --> 01:03:57,831
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.

945
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:00,834
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.

946
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:17,225
- Yeah.
- Happy. Blades.

947
01:04:17,392 --> 01:04:20,687
If you're not too busy making doughnuts
I could use some backup.

948
01:04:21,188 --> 01:04:24,191
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?

949
01:04:24,399 --> 01:04:27,652
Well, technically,
I'm on administrative leave.

950
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:24,584
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?

951
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:27,003
- Gold, yes. Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.

952
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,256
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.

953
01:05:30,215 --> 01:05:32,550
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.

954
01:05:32,717 --> 01:05:34,135
Let's go. Now. Come on.

955
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:36,471
You're staying with me.

956
01:05:54,322 --> 01:05:55,323
Hey, Blades.

957
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:58,285
- Gil. How you been?
- Wonderful.

958
01:05:58,451 --> 01:05:59,953
Hands on your head.

959
01:06:00,704 --> 01:06:02,289
Hands.

960
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:05,834
Come on.

961
01:06:08,336 --> 01:06:10,422
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?

962
01:06:10,588 --> 01:06:13,633
I don't know. Am I supposed to know?

963
01:06:19,556 --> 01:06:22,142
Oh, shit. Call 911 and stay with the car.

964
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:37,157
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.

965
01:06:37,323 --> 01:06:38,867
I ran into your father, Gil.

966
01:06:39,034 --> 01:06:41,369
- He's worried about you.
- My father?

967
01:06:41,703 --> 01:06:44,914
That's funny. That's really--
That's hilarious.

968
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:47,500
- Where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.

969
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,377
Bullshit. Give me the goddamn paper.

970
01:06:49,544 --> 01:06:51,671
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.

971
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,049
And you don't really need it anyway.

972
01:06:54,674 --> 01:06:56,176
Hands up on your head.

973
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:01,890
I'm really sorry about
the way this ends, detective.

974
01:07:02,098 --> 01:07:04,684
I had such a good time
watching you in trial.

975
01:07:04,851 --> 01:07:07,061
You were the happiest defendant
I've ever seen.

976
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,564
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.

977
01:07:11,483 --> 01:07:14,027
You know you were right.
About the list?

978
01:07:14,235 --> 01:07:17,572
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.

979
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:20,992
You're not the first to say so,
although you may be the last.

980
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:23,161
Thought that kidnapping thing
sounded fishy.

981
01:07:23,369 --> 01:07:26,080
I knew you'd respond
to a lady in distress.

982
01:07:26,539 --> 01:07:28,958
That's no way to treat an employee.

983
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:30,543
Independent contractor.

984
01:07:31,252 --> 01:07:34,088
I thought I was doing you
a favor though, killing Gold.

985
01:07:34,255 --> 01:07:35,632
He wants to put you away.

986
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:37,801
Once you know him,
his intentions are good.

987
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:39,594
That's very magnanimous.

988
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:41,137
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?

989
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:45,099
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.

990
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:47,977
So, yeah, sad story all around.

991
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:51,606
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.

992
01:07:52,106 --> 01:07:53,900
Police!

993
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:58,404
A few of my dad's friends.

994
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:01,074
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.

995
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:02,784
Oh, shit.

996
01:09:02,468 --> 01:09:03,511
Blades.

997
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:05,638
You could have
put my father away for life.

998
01:09:05,805 --> 01:09:08,308
Instead you had to kill him?

999
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:13,354
- I'm sorry. I was just doing my job.
- No compromises. No deals.

1000
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,481
Right? Well, guess what.

1001
01:09:15,982 --> 01:09:17,400
No deal for you either.

1002
01:09:17,817 --> 01:09:19,235
Don't move.

1003
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:54,479
Yeah, well,
Wohl was her mother's maiden name.

1004
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:56,230
Van Beber never married her.

1005
01:09:58,566 --> 01:10:01,944
I hate to admit it, Blades,
but you're not a half-bad detective.

1006
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:07,283
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.

1007
01:10:07,492 --> 01:10:10,495
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath
the next 85 years.

1008
01:10:10,661 --> 01:10:12,246
Are we still on for Whole Foods?

1009
01:10:12,455 --> 01:10:15,249
You bet. Want a ride to work
in the morning?

1010
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,542
Sure.

1011
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:20,922
How very gallant of you.

1012
01:10:23,424 --> 01:10:25,051
Thanks.

1013
01:10:40,691 --> 01:10:42,985
- It's tomorrow.
- Again.

1014
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:45,822
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.

1015
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:47,698
That is good.

1016
01:10:51,118 --> 01:10:52,870
- That's bad.
- That is bad.

1017
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,879
Still going after my dad for adultery?

1018
01:11:02,046 --> 01:11:04,173
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.

1019
01:11:04,715 --> 01:11:08,010
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.

1020
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:11,180
It's a fantasy. He never cheated on her.

1021
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:14,517
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.

1022
01:11:14,684 --> 01:11:17,812
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God. More fantasy.

1023
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:20,731
Does my mother have any
actual evidence of this affair?

1024
01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:23,693
Her theory is that he takes
his girl or girls...

1025
01:11:25,069 --> 01:11:26,070
...to this hotel.

1026
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:29,574
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.

1027
01:11:33,077 --> 01:11:35,413
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1028
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:39,542
It means I found the car.

1029
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,378
If the Hawk was supposed
to be on its way to Argentina...

1030
01:11:42,545 --> 01:11:44,380
...why did it keep popping up
over town?

1031
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:45,756
Excellent question.

1032
01:11:45,923 --> 01:11:48,593
You wouldn't expect a thief
to steal it then tool around.

1033
01:11:48,759 --> 01:11:51,679
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.

1034
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:53,180
Except when driving the Hawk.

1035
01:11:53,347 --> 01:11:56,183
He would never take a mistress
to a swank hotel.

1036
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:00,396
He would park the car in a hotel garage
if it meant keeping it off the street.

1037
01:12:07,403 --> 01:12:08,529
Yes!

1038
01:12:08,696 --> 01:12:11,365
What do you say? I get a turn
at the wheel of this beauty?

1039
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:13,784
All right, you've earned it.

1040
01:12:15,286 --> 01:12:17,705
You just go very easy, okay?

1041
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:20,750
She likes to be rewed a lot
before she downshifts.

1042
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:21,917
- Taser boy?
- Yes?

1043
01:12:22,126 --> 01:12:23,461
Relax.

1044
01:12:23,627 --> 01:12:27,298
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.

1045
01:12:27,506 --> 01:12:29,300
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.

1046
01:12:29,508 --> 01:12:34,013
You have to convince 12 jurors,
including at least a few females.

1047
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:39,143
Yes. Yes.

1048
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:51,238
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!

1049
01:12:56,994 --> 01:12:58,996
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?

1050
01:12:59,163 --> 01:13:00,956
Letting you drive!

1051
01:13:15,221 --> 01:13:17,264
Apologize to your father for me.

1052
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:22,103
Dad, I am really, really sorry.

1053
01:13:56,303 --> 01:13:57,972
Is he dead?

1054
01:13:58,806 --> 01:14:01,433
He never stood a chance
against the Hawk.

1055
01:14:02,309 --> 01:14:03,894
Who is he?

1056
01:14:04,311 --> 01:14:06,897
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.

1057
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:10,484
I guess killing his daughter
didn't endear us to him.

1058
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:14,071
We got lucky.

1059
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:17,283
I've never been lucky.

1060
01:14:29,795 --> 01:14:31,130
Thanks.

1061
01:14:31,755 --> 01:14:33,090
For what?

1062
01:14:33,507 --> 01:14:35,676
Keeping me alive.

1063
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:39,013
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.

1064
01:14:40,556 --> 01:14:43,142
So speaking of you
sending me to prison....

1065
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:45,185
We were?

1066
01:14:45,769 --> 01:14:48,647
Admittedly, I've had some lapses
of judgment.

1067
01:14:49,106 --> 01:14:51,442
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.

1068
01:14:52,985 --> 01:14:56,196
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses
here and there.

1069
01:14:56,363 --> 01:14:58,407
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.

1070
01:15:00,909 --> 01:15:03,912
Thanks for showing me
the forest and the grays.

1071
01:15:06,373 --> 01:15:09,460
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.

1072
01:15:11,587 --> 01:15:14,006
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?

1073
01:15:14,173 --> 01:15:17,092
What am I gonna tell my dad?

1074
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:19,720
Tell him how much you love him.

1075
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:22,848
The rest is pretty much
paint by numbers.

1076
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:56,090
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.

1077
01:16:22,574 --> 01:16:23,992
Son.

1078
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,412
Hey. Dad.

1079
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,873
What time is it?

1080
01:16:30,457 --> 01:16:31,917
I have some bad news.

1081
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:34,253
What? Where's mom?

1082
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:38,006
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. Mom is fine.

1083
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:39,800
She's fine.

1084
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:45,347
Now, look, Theo. I don't want you
to overreact or anything...

1085
01:16:45,514 --> 01:16:49,268
...but it appears as if
the Hawk has been stolen.

1086
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:53,856
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.

1087
01:16:54,022 --> 01:16:56,108
I know how much it meant to you.

1088
01:16:56,733 --> 01:16:58,110
Me?

1089
01:16:58,652 --> 01:17:00,737
That car meant everything
in the world to you.

1090
01:17:00,904 --> 01:17:03,407
Everything? No, no, no.

1091
01:17:04,491 --> 01:17:06,952
It's a fine automobile...

1092
01:17:08,245 --> 01:17:10,664
...but you know what I always say:

1093
01:17:11,248 --> 01:17:13,500
It's just a car.

1094
01:17:15,419 --> 01:17:16,837
Yeah.

1095
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:21,967
I love you, Dad.

1096
01:17:23,093 --> 01:17:25,137
I love you too, kiddo.

1097
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,601
We interviewed a few jurors
after the mistrial...

1098
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:33,312
...they seemed pretty unimpressed,
so we walked away.

1099
01:17:33,478 --> 01:17:35,856
But the fact that you decided
to dismiss the case...

1100
01:17:36,064 --> 01:17:38,525
...doesn't mean
Detective Blades is innocent.

1101
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:42,613
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?

1102
01:17:42,779 --> 01:17:44,531
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.

1103
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:47,075
I understand you spent time
with Detective Blades...

1104
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:50,037
...looking for your car,
which you reported stolen?

1105
01:17:50,621 --> 01:17:53,790
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?

1106
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,501
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.

1107
01:17:57,753 --> 01:18:01,381
Looks like you and Detective Blades
had quite an adventure.

1108
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:07,054
Detective Blades was instrumental
in uncovering a damaging leak...

1109
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,555
...that was in our office.

1110
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:11,892
A leak which had already resulted
in the death of an FBI informant.

1111
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:14,311
That's very impressive. Look...

1112
01:18:14,478 --> 01:18:18,440
...you knew at the time that Detective
Blades was on administrative leave...

1113
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:21,652
...and he had specific orders
not to do any police work.

1114
01:18:21,818 --> 01:18:24,029
My mother hired him as a Pl
to look for the car.

1115
01:18:24,196 --> 01:18:25,405
Which your father had.

1116
01:18:26,698 --> 01:18:28,408
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

1117
01:18:28,575 --> 01:18:30,744
I bet Detective Blades
went out of his way...

1118
01:18:30,952 --> 01:18:33,038
...not to mislead anyone
about his status.

1119
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:35,999
He never flipped his badge, right?

1120
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:37,542
Never brandished his gun?

1121
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:42,005
Never once in your presence
identified himself as a police officer?

1122
01:18:49,721 --> 01:18:51,556
Technically, no.

1123
01:18:54,059 --> 01:18:55,727
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
