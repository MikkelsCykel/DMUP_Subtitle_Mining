1
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,112
Hey!

2
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,748
Hey!

3
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,555
Come back here.

4
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,232
Hey!

5
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,631
Hey!

6
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,231
I hate that when you do that!

7
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,038
I was bored to death.

8
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,076
<i>Well, I was having fun.</i>

9
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,991
Well, good for you.

10
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,196
- Get in!
- No, I'm grabbing a cab.

11
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,599
Get in!

12
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,272
Stop it!

13
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,351
Leave me alone, Eddie.

14
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,271
<i>Don't ever try that again...</i>

15
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,837
or else!

16
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,717
Or else what?

17
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,393
Mr Yoshida says,
"We regret we can go no further. "

18
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,789
"This is our final proposal. "

19
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,668
"Your company will benefit greatly
from this new relationship. "

20
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,718
"Now you must decide the fate of MicroCon. "

21
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,314
We should close at this price.

22
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,119
Let's see if we can hold out
till Congress votes.

23
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,077
We can't pull backjust now.

24
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,151
Deal's too far gone.

25
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,391
We can't pull backjust now.
Deal's too far gone.

26
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,917
<i>- They'll suspect if we stall.
- They'll suspect if we stall.</i>

27
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,039
Listen, I'm the last guy
who wants to screw this up.

28
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,033
Deal's too good,
but we have to have some strategy.

29
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,839
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

30
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,875
They're going to stall.

31
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,112
Hey, guys.

32
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,591
- How's it going?
- Good.

33
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,071
If there's anything you don't understand...

34
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,071
Oh, no. We're uh...

35
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,799
- We're fine.
- Great. That's good to hear.

36
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,110
You're gonna be part of a great team.

37
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,398
Once these guys draw
a line in the sand, that's pretty much it.

38
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,711
You want that research and development
money, don't you?

39
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,791
Nakamoto Group can do a lot for you.

40
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,791
- Yeah, right.
- Great.

41
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,477
That guy is an asshole.

42
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,791
That guy is an asshole.

43
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,389
The deal will put vital elements of our
military weaponry under Japanese control.

44
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,870
Come on, Senator Morton.
That's really a scare tactic.

45
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,795
During the Gulf War, the Japanese suggested
they could deny us that weaponry. In fact...

46
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,792
- You're oversimplifying a complex issue.
- No...

47
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,512
He's trying to say America is looking for
a new enemy now the Cold War is over.

48
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,397
Talk about simplifying!

49
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,517
You're doing the simplifying, Senator.

50
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,713
<i>Hold on.</i>

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,837
<i>Let's let... Eleanor, let the Senator in, please.</i>

52
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,911
<i>I came here to Los Angeles because...</i>

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,755
<i>Before we hear that, I couldn't detect
exactly how you're going to vote.</i>

54
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,310
<i>- You know, they warned me about you.
- Well, they should!</i>

55
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,435
<i>They should!</i>

56
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,592
<i>- How are you going to vote?
- Against the sale of MicroCon.</i>

57
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,910
<i>Thank you for saying that flat out.</i>

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,070
<i>Let me ask you guys on this side.</i>

59
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,756
<i>You sometimes make it sound as if
Japan's prosperity is bad for America.</i>

60
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,478
<i>Is that what you mean?</i>

61
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,588
<i>The real issue is that this technology
is paid for by American taxpayers...</i>

62
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,792
<i>This discussion is degenerating
into the kind of argument we don't need.</i>

63
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,156
<i>This is already a very tense situation.</i>

64
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,118
<i>There will soon be a vote
in Congress and we will decide</i>

65
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,395
<i>whether the MicroCon sale goes through.</i>

66
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,275
I don't get you, Eddie.

67
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,351
So what?

68
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,471
Oh, ladies, one thing.

69
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,994
Do remember that the custom here
is bow when you're bowed to.

70
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,518
Oh, wow!
They really rolled out the red carpet.

71
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,678
- What floor are we going to?
- 45th.

72
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,752
- After you, Greg.
- Thank you, Rick.

73
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,354
Bow when you're bowed to.

74
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,830
- Oh, wow! Look at this. Everybody's here.
- This is amazing!

75
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,115
There's Barry Hirsch. The Mayor.

76
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,113
- We're in the fast lane now.
- Oh, we sure are.

77
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,873
- Look, here's Yoshida-san and the boys.
- Get ready to bow.

78
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,999
Wife.

79
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,915
- Taiko drums!
- Huh?

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,755
Taiko drums. Long ago
they were used to drive away evil spirits.

81
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,551
Come here.

82
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,911
No, here.

83
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,959
Yes.

84
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,111
Yes...

85
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,311
Yes... More...

86
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,391
Ah, yes...

87
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,994
Yo, what's up?

88
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,392
<i>Web. Tom Graham. You're on the chart
tonight, Special Services liaison.</i>

89
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,471
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Better get over here.</i>

90
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,120
<i>The new Nakamoto building. 1100 Figueroa.</i>

91
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,431
<i>- I can't believe they're pulling this shit.
- What stuff?</i>

92
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,432
<i>Demanding to see
the fuckin' Special Services liaison.</i>

93
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,399
<i>They say the police can't proceed
until you get here.</i>

94
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,995
<i>And what time
was that phone call from Lieutenant Graham?</i>

95
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,071
What time?

96
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,710
Yes. What time was it?

97
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,791
9.00pm.

98
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,198
February 9th.

99
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,874
Four nights ago?

100
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,391
Was that a yes, Lieutenant Smith?

101
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,630
Yeah. It's a yeah.

102
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,516
Lieutenant Smith,
we appreciate your cooperation.

103
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,639
You waived your right
to be represented here by an attorney.

104
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,714
So... Lieutenant Graham called for
the Special Services liaison.

105
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,234
<i>He said he had a homicide.</i>

106
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,993
Yeah, a homicide. Apparent 601.

107
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,958
Caucasian female, I'd say 25.

108
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,558
Lying flat on her back on the boardroom table
like a piece of sushi.

109
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,871
Quite a sight. Better get down here.

110
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,189
<i>Hello. I'm a police officer.
Can I be of assistance?</i>

111
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,115
<i>May I see your passport?</i>

112
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,471
<i>- What's up?
- This is Watch Commander Hoffman.</i>

113
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,551
Yes, sir.

114
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,076
<i>You're on your way to Nakamoto Towers.
I want you to pick someone up.</i>

115
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,549
<i>- Certainly, sir.
- A guy named Connor.</i>

116
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,108
<i>- Connor?
- Yeah, John Connor.</i>

117
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,314
But I thought... he was long gone.

118
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,472
<i>No, he's very much alive.
They put in a request for him.</i>

119
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,279
<i>- They? Who's they?
- You go. I'll phone him.</i>

120
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,796
<i>- He lives by Little Tokyo. 428 Rose Street.
- Yes, sir.</i>

121
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,871
428 Rose Street.

122
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,311
Connor?

123
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,516
<i>And you did not know
Captain Connor prior to this night?</i>

124
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,477
<i>No, I did not.</i>

125
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,074
<i>- I'd only heard about him.
- What had you heard?</i>

126
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,153
<i>I heard that he had long ago
put himself on indefinite leave.</i>

127
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,028
<i>That he had lived in Japan.
Some people thought they got to him.</i>

128
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,712
<i>Some people said that...</i>

129
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,630
<i>Said what?</i>

130
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,109
<i>The man couldn't be trusted.</i>

131
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,632
You're late.

132
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,948
Yeah, sorry.

133
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,031
- The directions were...
- No.

134
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,511
Be on time.

135
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,359
Shoes.

136
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,950
Is it normal procedure now for the Japanese
to demand a liaison officer?

137
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,554
No. It's usually an assignment.

138
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,392
What time were you called?

139
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,199
Lieutenant Graham called at nine.
Hoffman called in the car.

140
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,510
You were called twice?

141
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,318
Yeah.

142
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,789
I wish I'd known that sooner.

143
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,349
Have you negotiated with the Japanese?

144
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,158
Negotiated?

145
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,630
Mm. Perhaps I can suggest the strategy.

146
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,756
Well, this is hardly a negotiation.

147
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,434
Oh? What is it, then?

148
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,237
What is it?

149
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,992
It's a homicide.

150
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,199
When we arrive,
you take charge of the negotiations.

151
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,510
Don't introduce me or refer to me.

152
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,875
Don't even look in my direction.

153
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,080
Keep yourjacket buttoned at all times.
If they bow, you bow back.

154
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,674
Believe it or not, I have done this before.

155
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,751
You know, I do know these things.

156
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,115
Do keep your hands at your sides.

157
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,795
The Japanese find
big arm movements threatening.

158
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,311
Keep your voice calm and even.

159
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,358
You'll probably find them irritating tonight.

160
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,159
But whatever happens,
don't lose your temper.

161
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,196
I don't lose my temper.

162
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,271
That's good to know.

163
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,999
When you start to get into trouble...

164
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,991
I won't get into trouble.

165
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,992
When you start to get into trouble,

166
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,709
I will say, "Perhaps I can be of assistance?"

167
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,790
<i>From then on, I do the talking.</i>

168
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,429
You stand behind me.
And don't appear distracted.

169
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,071
We may come from a fragmented,
MTV, rap-video culture, but they do not.

170
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,995
Every aspect of your appearance
and behaviour will reflect on you,

171
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,719
<i>the Department, and me as your sempai.</i>

172
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,791
<i>My sempai?</i>

173
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,996
That wouldn't be massa, would it?

174
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:19,589
<i>No. The sempai is the senior man
who guides the junior man, the kohai.</i>

175
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,473
<i>In Japan, the sempai-kohai relationship
is presumed to exist</i>

176
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,632
when the younger man and the older man
work together.

177
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,712
Hopefully, they will presume that of us.

178
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,515
So what does it mean
that I was called twice?

179
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,591
It means they're ahead of us.

180
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,717
For all they know,
I could have been five minutes away.

181
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,839
They know who was on call tonight,
how long it would take you to get here.

182
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,911
They know all about you.

183
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,991
- All about me?
- Mm.

184
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,994
- It took you long enough.
- Tom.

185
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,036
What the fuck's he doing here?

186
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,270
Fred Hoffman told me to bring him.

187
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,351
The guy is trouble. Watch out.

188
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,319
The Department put him on leave
because he's too close to Japan.

189
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,472
- He's not a team player.
- Where is everybody?

190
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,949
They made us put our cars around back.

191
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,828
They keep saying
nothing must disrupt the grand opening.

192
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,276
Finding that blonde piece of sushi
drove them nuts.

193
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,352
Don't want their guests or the press to know.

194
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,351
Step aside, pal.

195
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,594
- You come down already.
- Yeah?

196
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,591
Well, now I go back up.

197
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,956
Maybe come down, go up 10 times more. OK?

198
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,513
We're still the fuckin' police
in our own country.

199
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,434
Built this building in six months.

200
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,036
Prefab units from Japan, slapped 'em
together here. Not one American worker.

201
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,112
City gave 'em an eight-year break
on property taxes.

202
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,475
Shit! We're giving this country away.

203
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,312
Nobody forced us to do it.

204
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,752
Jesus!

205
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,197
If an elevator's gonna talk, it should
speak in American. What did it say?

206
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,919
We're arriving at the 45th floor.

207
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,033
No, no. Wait a second.

208
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,875
The Japanese provide jobs here,
but US companies are moving jobs offshore.

209
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,951
Ground floor, please.

210
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,031
- They must...
- Going up, Senator.

211
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,669
- No, no. I wish to go down.
- Get the next one, Senator.

212
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,751
Come on.

213
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,630
No, no, no. You don't understand!

214
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,672
Senator Morton.

215
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,354
Real nice to find him partying here,

216
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,150
considering he's on the committee
which sets all import regulations.

217
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,671
Geronimo!

218
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,271
Coming through!

219
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,075
I have your liaison for you.

220
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,392
Is this your home phone, Detective?

221
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,798
Yes. Right there at the bottom.

222
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,713
Detective, let's dispense with the formalities.

223
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,315
We'd like to cooperate,
but you can't start without a warrant.

224
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,029
- Bullshit. We don't need one.
- We can get one in 15 minutes.

225
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,193
- But we do have a reported homicide here.
- More likely a drug overdose.

226
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,510
We can't know that until we investigate.

227
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,999
Obviously.

228
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,756
But I'm concerned about the attempt
to link this death to our reception downstairs.

229
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,833
I don't know, sir.
Looks like she's wearing a party dress.

230
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,558
She is, I agree.

231
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,519
Lieutenant, you have to appreciate
the position of the Nakamoto Corporation.

232
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,592
- Sir, I...
- This is an important evening for us.

233
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,671
A very public evening.

234
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,878
We don't want it marred by the death
of a woman of no importance.

235
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,110
- Of no importance?
- You have some nerve!

236
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,556
- I can't imagine how she came to be in here.
- You have some nerve!

237
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,871
Your Lieutenant Graham intends
to interrogate everybody,

238
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,520
the Mayor, the Senators, and Congressmen.

239
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,636
Graham said that?

240
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,599
Oh, Christ! What is this?

241
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,750
Do you mind turning around?

242
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,673
- Who is he?
- Mr Tanaka works for Nakamoto Security.

243
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,150
- Get him outta here!
- We have authorised him to be here.

244
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,949
I'm authorising him out!
He's contaminating the area. And get his film!

245
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,273
- We must undertake our own private inquiry.
- I'll get you a warrant and a restraining order!

246
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,749
Do that! Be my guest!

247
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,232
Excuse me.
Perhaps uh... I can be of assistance.

248
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,635
Ishihara-san, I'm sure none of your guests
are involved in this unfortunate incident.

249
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,711
They are free to go as they wish.

250
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,428
I am grateful for your assistance.

251
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,150
But before they leave, give me
the names of those gentlemen, please.

252
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,558
I'm sorry.

253
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,359
The names of those gentlemen.

254
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,871
May I ask why?

255
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,750
- Ritchie! Mugshots! All of them!
- You cannot do this!

256
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,509
No! You are to blame here!

257
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,795
You will assist my detectives!

258
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,269
And I want to know who discovered the body!

259
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,631
And don't you fuck with me!

260
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,552
But of course... Captain.

261
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,871
Yeah, don't fuck with us.

262
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,509
Mount up, boys. Let's get it done
before she starts to smell.

263
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,594
- Isn't it bad form to lose your temper?
- It is. But I had to, to assist Ishihara.

264
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,352
Assist Ishihara?

265
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,829
Now why would you wanna do that?

266
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,388
He wasn't the most important man
in the room.

267
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,869
- Oh, he wasn't?
- No. It was the older man.

268
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,835
<i>His juyaku, his superior.</i>

269
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,677
<i>But I wanted to get the investigation going
so I played the out-of-control gaijin.</i>

270
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,035
So Ishihara wouldn't lose face.

271
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,998
So now, Ishihara owes me a favour.

272
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,311
Deep, isn't it?

273
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,391
Heavy.

274
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,469
The executive fuck chamber.

275
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,793
Oh, man, I like this! I like this!

276
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,754
That's nice. That's nice.

277
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,718
These guys sure know how to do business.

278
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,911
Hold that.

279
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,435
Her nostrils look like
a margarita glass rim.

280
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,671
- Think she OD'd on coke?
- I don't think so.

281
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,753
We'll get lab values on all fluids.
Some seminal fluid down here.

282
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,229
External genitals are pretty raw.

283
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,110
It looks like forced intercourse,
but I'm not sure she was murdered.

284
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,795
Not sure she was murdered?
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.

285
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,271
The make-up on the neck
covers signs of prior throat injuries.

286
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,318
That suggests a pattern
of repeated cervical trauma.

287
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,675
Could be a case of sexual asphyxia.

288
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,557
She's a gasper.

289
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,631
Which is what?

290
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,077
Individuals sexually aroused by
the hypoxia of near-strangulation.

291
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,756
They ask their partners to strangle them
or suffocate them during sex.

292
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
It's easy to make a mistake and go too far.

293
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,871
This looks like death from inhibition to me.

294
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,430
- Instantaneous physiological death.
- Meaning what?

295
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,636
The person just... dies.

296
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,711
Happens with neck or chest injuries.

297
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,236
Had a kid got hit with a baseball.
Fell down dead in the schoolyard.

298
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,754
Yeah. Maybe she got hit with a baseball.

299
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,831
Odds are she was strangled.

300
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,071
But since having sex isn't a felony,
it wouldn't be murder.

301
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,789
Anyway, file in the back of your mind
that maybe she just popped off.

302
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,431
Cheryl Lynn Austin. Age 23.
This says she has a Westwood address,

303
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,353
but she hasn't changed
her Kentucky licence yet.

304
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,432
Japanese cigarettes and credit cards.

305
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,312
Nice tight roll of $100 bills.
Miss Austin's well taken care of.

306
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,550
These little guys eat shit in Tokyo.

307
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,677
Crammed into subways,
working for big companies.

308
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,035
They come here and they're rich and free.

309
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,315
They all want to fuck a Rose Bowl queen.

310
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,109
And then kill the Rose Bowl queen
on the Nakamoto boardroom table?

311
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,192
Call the police and create a scandal?

312
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,671
Is that your theory?

313
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,751
- My theory?
- Mm.

314
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,879
My theory is that these guys
are known perversion freaks.

315
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,110
I got a nose for these things.

316
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,191
I'm sure.

317
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,115
Hey, Spider-san.

318
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,191
Tell your pal they got a contest.

319
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,748
Whoever kisses the most asses
wins a Toyota.

320
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,235
Hey, Graham! Want some sushi?

321
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,517
Nah. If I get a craving for mercury,
I'll eat a thermometer.

322
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,190
In Japan, criminals expect to be caught.

323
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,195
Convictions run about 90%.

324
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,039
Here, it's closer to 17%.

325
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,990
They think we're stupid.

326
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,915
They think we're corrupt.

327
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,389
And they're not often wrong.

328
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,551
What the hell are you doing?

329
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,029
<i>Good evening, officers. Can I help you?</i>

330
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,395
Yes, you can. Where are you located?

331
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,917
<i>- Lobby level. Across from the elevators.
- Thank you.</i>

332
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,798
How long have you been on duty tonight?

333
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,871
About half an hour.

334
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,838
Mr Tanaka was here when I got here.

335
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,150
Mr Tanaka? Who's Mr Tanaka?

336
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,231
He's the head of security.

337
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,750
Mr Phillips, the 46th floor, the cameras?

338
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,116
I know in Japan
they like to observe their workers

339
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,839
to help them improve their efficiency.

340
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,515
I saw at least four up there. Why so many?

341
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,509
You didn't hear this from me.

342
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,117
I guarantee we didn't hear it from you.

343
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,599
Maybe they put in a couple of new cameras
to observe those negotiations.

344
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,274
What negotiations were those?

345
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,759
The ones that go on up there during the day

346
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,354
with a company called MicroCon.

347
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,432
MicroCon. The computer chip company?

348
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,990
There's a vote coming up
in Congress on that deal.

349
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,311
Put up the 46th floor.

350
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,308
Can the camera get in closer?

351
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,472
- You have to use the gizmo.
- The gizmo? Show me.

352
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,151
You, uh, use the gizmo... to zoom in.

353
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,472
This is all next-generation. There is
nothing like this in this country... yet.

354
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,551
You record by disk?

355
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,995
Record? What do you mean, record?

356
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,991
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,469
The disks are all back there.

358
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,191
It's all there on next-generation laser disk.

359
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,997
I'd like to see tonight's disk for the 46th floor.

360
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,553
You'd have to talk with my supervisor.
You got a warrant?

361
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,790
These disks record for 12 hours.

362
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,750
Why does the one on the 46th floor
only show two hours?

363
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,831
Excuse me?

364
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,069
The original disk isn't even here,
anyway, is it?

365
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,549
Because it's been replaced.

366
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,755
I wouldn't know about that.

367
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,513
That's Mr Tanaka's department.

368
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,397
Someone at this very moment is watching us.

369
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,753
Under the circumstances,
you've been more than helpful.

370
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,230
I'd like to tell you officers something.

371
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,311
This is a good job.

372
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,916
Around here, if something doesn't work,
I got a problem,

373
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,389
I tell somebody, they fix it!

374
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,277
It's not like when I was working
at GM out there in Van Nuys.

375
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,352
- This is different here.
- You're part of a team.

376
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,318
What, a team? What are they doing for you?

377
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,153
They spotting for you?
Sending you in plays, huh?

378
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,231
Maybe they got instant replay...

379
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,551
Hey, brother, come on!
These people have been good to me.

380
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,269
<i>Kohai, I'm gonna call in a favour.
Stay here with Mr Phillips.</i>

381
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,157
<i>Come on, kohai.</i>

382
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,515
Lieutenant Smith.

383
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,835
Don't fuck with these guys.

384
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,553
Hey, the honeys are out tonight.

385
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,030
Oh, here's a nice one. Let's use the gizmo.

386
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,111
Oh, yeah, she's nice.

387
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,351
Not so nice.

388
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,671
She's my ex-wife.

389
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,429
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

390
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,954
Don't be. She's a lawyer.

391
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,036
It must be nice to fuck a lawyer

392
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,714
instead of always being fucked by one.

393
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,478
I've seen your friend
around here quite a bit.

394
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,596
- Really?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,989
Real friendly with Mr Yoshida there.

396
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,389
And who's Mr Yoshida?

397
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,470
Mr Yoshida's the man!

398
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,551
Let's listen in.

399
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,711
<i>I know nothing of this.</i>

400
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,394
<i>Any recordings we have
are yours to examine.</i>

401
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,471
<i>I will look into it immediately.</i>

402
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,911
What does that mean?

403
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,468
Massa wants me to get the car.

404
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,993
Senator Morton, you said
if the sale of MicroCon is approved,

405
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,311
they will control the market
and use the technology

406
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,595
to compete against our own companies.

407
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,752
You know that there is a time and a place
for business,

408
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,755
and tonight I just want to say
that our hosts threw one heck of a gala.

409
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,310
But, Senator, you've said,
"Look what happened to our TV industry. "

410
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,836
- Is there such a thing as off-duty?
- Let's wrap it up.

411
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,309
Hey, you! Quit loafing!

412
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,516
Get the Senator's car! We're waiting.

413
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,830
<i>No! You get the Senator's car.</i>

414
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,559
Wrong guy. Wrong fuckin' century.

415
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,949
Penguin-lookin' motherfucker!

416
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,476
Let me smack this asshole.

417
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,439
Captain Connor!
Remember me? Bob Richmond.

418
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,511
Myers, Lawson and Richmond.

419
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,229
I understand my Nakamoto guys
got a little frazzled tonight.

420
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,709
If I can be of any help to you,

421
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,791
I'm available.

422
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,911
That's comforting.

423
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,431
Asshole!

424
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,196
I knew him when he was a government
trade negotiator dealing with the Japanese.

425
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,713
Now he's working for them.

426
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,791
Like I said... asshole.

427
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,714
Help you?

428
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,711
Cheryl Lynn Austin.

429
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,439
- She not in.
- Yeah, I know.

430
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,352
Keys.

431
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,075
Room two.

432
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,391
The doorman's Yakuza.

433
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,189
I noticed his tattoo. I didn't know
there were so many Yakuza in America.

434
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,431
This isn't America.
This is that shadow world.

435
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,717
<i>They have bars, clubs and... bettaku.</i>

436
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,509
<i>Bettaku. Love residence
where mistresses are kept.</i>

437
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,989
- This is one, huh?
- Correct.

438
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,071
Here we are.

439
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,790
What time did it start raining tonight?

440
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,871
After nine.

441
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,316
Someone was here after nine.

442
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,471
Correct.

443
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,271
Look at this.

444
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,071
She's with Eddie.

445
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,912
You know him?

446
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,116
Mm. Eddie Sakamura.

447
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,397
What's this?

448
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,390
Girlfriend was into some different shit.

449
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,391
Look.

450
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,110
What is with this guy? There's a lot
of pictures of her with your friend Sakamutu.

451
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,191
- Sakamura.
- Whatever.

452
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,437
Somebody's taken photos from here recently.

453
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,230
Oh... I thought I heard Eddie's voice.

454
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,551
Say...

455
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,110
- Why is everybody in Cheryl's room tonight?
- Everybody?

456
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,191
Well, you and...

457
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,953
Aren't you just a little bit off limits here?

458
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,553
And who are you?

459
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,631
Me?

460
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,671
Well, I'm Julia.

461
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,869
I'm just a little neighbour girl
who lives down the hall.

462
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,951
Are you Cheryl's back-door man?

463
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,917
And what if I am?

464
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,911
Well...

465
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,116
If you are,

466
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,191
I heard of you.

467
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,073
You better watch out
cos Eddie, he's the real jealous type.

468
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,038
They don't call him Crazy Eddie for nothing.

469
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,032
Really? Well, I'm kinda tough.

470
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,111
Mm, well,

471
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,430
tough as you may be,

472
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,555
Eddie finds out,
then you're gonna be crying.

473
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,951
Um, say,

474
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,031
is Cheryl all right?

475
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,111
No, she isn't.

476
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,471
Lieutenant Web Smith. LAPD.

477
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,157
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

478
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,879
I heard him screaming at Cheryl.

479
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,795
Shouting things like, "I'll kill you",
before he took her to that party tonight.

480
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,069
Many thanks, miss.
Someone from my office will contact you.

481
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,998
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

482
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,719
<i>Kohai.</i>

483
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,951
You know, Web...

484
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,717
<i>Eddie's father is a big industrialist
over there at Daimatsu.</i>

485
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,078
He has a... a friend he sees.

486
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,917
Jeanette.

487
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,389
Right up here on the second floor.

488
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,875
You know how Eddie met Cheryl?

489
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,751
Well,

490
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,231
she was working in that Toyota plant
back there in Kentucky.

491
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,111
Then one day,

492
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,198
who should show up
in that small, little town...

493
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,911
but Eddie.

494
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,391
Web...

495
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,071
She was about to give up the murderer,
and you just walk away.

496
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,914
Maybe I've been bought off by the Japanese.

497
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,232
<i>Sempai, apple pie, whatever I have
to call you... we have a murder here.</i>

498
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,993
I want to solve it,
not listen to true confessions.

499
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,071
You know what's true?

500
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,755
When something looks too good
to be true, then it's not true.

501
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,877
Everything she said about Eddie
might have been true.

502
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,428
The real question is
why was she saying it?

503
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,715
OK! Why was she saying it?

504
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,677
I'm not sure.

505
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,598
Because she thought
Eddie killed the girl!

506
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,240
This Julia accidentally walked in...

507
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,915
Nothing is happening accidentally.
She's a messenger.

508
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,312
- Oh, you think someone sent her?
- Mm.

509
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,277
OK. Who?

510
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,271
The bad guys.

511
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,670
And I suppose they sent her in
to find out what we know.

512
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,433
Or to tell us what they wanted us to know.

513
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,511
Or maybe to slow us down.

514
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,470
She certainly slowed you down.

515
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,834
Bullshit!

516
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,957
Bullshit?
Never underestimate your opponent.

517
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,508
Never take what he offers you.

518
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,070
You want to solve this crime?

519
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,116
- Yes.
- Well, so do I.

520
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,349
Now let's move.

521
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,671
Come on, Eddie!

522
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,515
Darling, those days are gone from your life.

523
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,270
I could dance like that. I'm an old
song-and-dance man from way back.

524
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,272
Oh, yeah? Wanna teach me some steps?

525
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,597
- It's by invitation only, gentlemen.
- Mr Sakamura.

526
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,956
- Mr Sakamura is not here.
- That's him. The bad tap-dancer.

527
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,040
Mr Sakamura is not available.

528
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,238
Mr Sakamura is a good friend of mine.
I'm sure he's available for me.

529
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,071
Gentlemen, you're trespassing.

530
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,756
Now, unless you have a search warrant,
you'll have to leave.

531
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,353
You should know I'm a black belt.

532
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,000
- But of course you are, dear.
- Need help, Perry?

533
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,752
So is Jeff.

534
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,909
OK, fellas. You're leaving.

535
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,711
That's assault.

536
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,591
I don't wanna hurt you.

537
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,790
They say if you must resort
to violence, you've already lost.

538
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,711
What do you think, Jeff?

539
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,553
I think I'll go get Mr Sakamura.

540
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,080
- Ah, Captain Connor!
- Eddie.

541
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,152
My father will be happy to hear
you're still up to your same old tricks.

542
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,231
We're here to talk, Eddie.

543
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,916
So talk. It's a free country.

544
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,197
It's about the murder at Nakamoto tonight.

545
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,475
Well, let's talk outside.

546
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,314
Yeah. I heard about that. Some poor girl.

547
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,197
You know her, Eddie.

548
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,151
Cheryl Austin.

549
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,879
Oh, yeah, Cheryl. Mm. That girl.

550
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,751
Too bad.

551
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,308
<i>I hear she was a real hentai onna.</i>

552
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,277
You knew her better than that.

553
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,113
You're putting her up at the Imperial Arms.

554
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,510
Oh, that Cheryl. Oh, I know her real well.

555
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,831
- She was all over me, Connor-san.
- You're irresistible.

556
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,911
That's true, but...

557
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,309
Connor-san, she had a big problem.

558
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,949
She was a sick girl. She liked pain.

559
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,158
Put a plastic bag over her head,
always saying, "Squeeze harder. "

560
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,232
Squeeze the neck? You like that, do you?

561
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,311
Me? No!

562
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,119
I'm a straight meat-and-potatoes man.

563
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,475
Don't let 'em see you like this. Get up!

564
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,836
- Did you see her tonight?
- Tonight? Me?

565
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,390
Maybe for two minutes at the party.
Just to say hello.

566
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,472
Mr Sakamura,
I think you'd better come with us.

567
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,996
Yeah, I saw her tonight.

568
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,676
I brought her to the party.

569
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,228
But I have nothing to do with it.

570
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,108
Look, I can prove it to you.
Just let me call you later.

571
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,668
I will bring you something.

572
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,752
- I think that's a bad idea.
- Captain.

573
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,990
<i>Nakamoto is keiretsu.</i>

574
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,197
<i>My father is Daimatsu keiretsu.</i>

575
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,274
If his son is arrested here,
there will be repercussions.

576
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,636
Business is war. I know you understand.

577
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,231
Do you have your passport?

578
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,311
Yeah, sure.

579
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,351
Give him your card.

580
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,431
And you call him, Eddie.

581
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,159
Connor-san!

582
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,192
- I sure hope you know what you're doing.
- Me, too.

583
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,271
He's guilty as hell.

584
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,920
<i>Well, my dairokkan says he's not.</i>

585
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,594
I hope your intuition is right.

586
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,831
<i>Look, sempai,</i>

587
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,913
<i>my dairokkan tells me your dairokkan
wasn't why you let Eddie go.</i>

588
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,112
In Japan, his father saved my life.

589
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,111
And Eddie reminded you of that?

590
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,270
He would never remind me.

591
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,954
It's my responsibility to remember.

592
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,271
<i>So what is all this bullshit
about his father's keiretsu?</i>

593
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,999
<i>Bullshit? There's a keiretsu war going on.</i>

594
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,277
A Japanese corporation never stands alone.

595
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,480
<i>A keiretsu is a united front
of hundreds of powerful companies,</i>

596
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,074
all acting in partnership to win.

597
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,434
To win what?

598
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,511
Whatever's there.

599
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,273
You ever hear "business is war"?

600
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,391
The war is never over.

601
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,597
Maybe you heard
"All's fair in love and war"?

602
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,238
No.

603
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,709
- So where does that leave us?
- Us?

604
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,271
We're in the war zone.

605
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,232
So, based on the lab results,
the guy who fucked her was Japanese.

606
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,311
Semen analysis is blood type AB.

607
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,359
Diego factor positive.
Negative for ethanol dehydrogenase.

608
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,750
Asian pattern.
Male pubic hair also Asian in origin.

609
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,957
Evidence points to a Japanese perpetrator.

610
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,110
It's a Jap perp all right.

611
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,831
What the hell's this?

612
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,511
Looks like your guy confessed.

613
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,909
<i>No. It's just Sumimasen.</i>

614
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,869
If they're caught doing something wrong, to
get leniency, they must perform an apology.

615
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,349
- You mean it's an act?
- Not exactly.

616
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,238
He's genuinely scared
you'll create a scandal.

617
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,075
Yoshida-san insisted that he find
the missing disk and deliver it to us.

618
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,832
Yeah, good luck.

619
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,117
That disk is probably
in a Tokyo landfill by now.

620
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,271
What the hell's this?

621
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,351
Daytime. 46th floor.

622
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,512
Negotiations for MicroCon.
Semiconductors.

623
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,591
Hey, can we skip the cartoons?

624
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,671
Hold on. We're just starting.

625
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,191
Richmond-san. Busy, busy.

626
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,635
Hey, let's go. Get to it!

627
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,109
Night-time. Same place.

628
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,031
Looks different then.

629
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,711
Jesus! It's her.

630
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,872
Hello.

631
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,711
Come on in.

632
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,431
He looks Japanese.

633
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,231
Maybe he's Polish.

634
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,393
He's checking to see
if she's carrying a gun.

635
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,550
Someone's using the gizmo.

636
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,200
Gizmo. He's sure using it on her.

637
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,988
There go the hands to the neck.

638
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,071
Just the way she likes it.

639
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,868
Hey, Mr Nice Guy. Turn around.

640
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,711
Oh, no! Don't tell me
he's gonna walk out in the dark.

641
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,429
No! Step into...

642
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,637
There! Back it up!

643
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,592
There.

644
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,955
That's right, I knew it all along.

645
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,190
- I was right about this.
- Eddie.

646
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,236
You know this fucker?

647
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,878
Eddie Sakamura.

648
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,712
We had him tonight.

649
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,634
- What do you mean, you had him?
- We had him. We let him go.

650
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,673
- I kept his passport.
- His fuckin' passport? Jesus!

651
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,115
Get his ass, not his passport!

652
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,955
<i>What are you waiting for? You want banzai
carved on her ass with a samurai sword?</i>

653
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,918
Let's go get this Eddie Sock-It-To-Me.

654
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,312
I'm gonna break your arms, my friend.
I'm gonna love breaking them.

655
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,791
Come on, Web!

656
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,950
The old guy sucker punched me.

657
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,115
If I see him again, he's dead meat.

658
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,430
Oh, forget it.

659
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,592
Good evening, Jeff. Mr Sakamura in?

660
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,511
Easy, big fella.

661
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,750
Just like old times, Web.

662
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,673
Do you miss it? A night out with the boys?

663
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,074
- Sure beats all that diplomacy shit.
- I thought no violence.

664
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,031
Last thing we want.

665
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,509
The guy's a murderer, Spider-san.

666
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,591
LAPD takes no chances.

667
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,194
Yeah, but we do take prisoners. Right?

668
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,390
Why did Connor let this guy walk?

669
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,471
I can't say.

670
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,111
What is he about?

671
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,480
He's always careful not to offend their...

672
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,949
What is it we're not supposed to offend?

673
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,031
Fuck 'em, they break the law.

674
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,509
If that brands me as a reactionary...

675
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,876
<i>- We're in position. Stand by.
- Moving in.</i>

676
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,509
Is reactionary a dirty word?

677
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,591
Like racist, or something like that?

678
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,719
All this talk of race.
Whatever happened to good and evil?

679
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,791
A guy did it, you catch him.

680
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,670
Plundering our natural resources.

681
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,194
Fuckin' guys are into everything!

682
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,191
What time you got, Web?

683
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,311
2.10.

684
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,191
Make a note.
At 2.11, suspect was apprehended.

685
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,034
Eddie Sakamura calling. It's urgent.
I must speak about missing disk.

686
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,271
Police! Get down!

687
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,958
Stay where you are! Get down!

688
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,712
Don't move! Get down!

689
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,791
- You guys, out the back!
- You son of a bitch!

690
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,871
What the hell? Get off of me!

691
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,193
There he goes!

692
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,191
Ow, shit!

693
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,396
What the hell is wrong with you? Get off!

694
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,555
You're nuts! Get off of me!

695
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,871
Get that son of a bitch!

696
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,116
- I'm a police officer!
- You're a piece of shit!

697
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,711
<i>8- Adam-65.</i>

698
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,870
<i>Am in pursuit of 187 suspect,
eastbound, Sunset.</i>

699
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,431
<i>All units, stand by.
8- Adam-65 in pursuit eastbound...</i>

700
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,798
<i>8- Adam-65, what is your location?</i>

701
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,435
<i>Stay back, I want him alive.</i>

702
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,311
Holy shit!

703
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,951
Damn! Damn, damn, damn!

704
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,594
Coroner's officials have taken possession

705
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,150
of the charred remains
identified as Mr Edward Sakamura.

706
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,071
The crash took place after...

707
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,355
We tried to take him, but he ran, Chief.

708
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,115
Burnt beyond recognition. The guy's a cinder.

709
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,873
You got proof that Sakamura
committed the murder?

710
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,033
- Absolutely. Got it all recorded. Right?
- Absolutely.

711
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,951
You did everything by the book?

712
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,190
By the book. Absolutely, Chief.

713
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,111
Absolutely.

714
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,397
But everything was not
absolutely by the book.

715
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,871
Absolutely not.

716
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,758
And when did you discover this?

717
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,035
Yeah.

718
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,031
<i>- Lieutenant Smith?
- Yeah.</i>

719
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,714
<i>This is division dispatcher.
Uncleared messages.</i>

720
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,236
<i>- All right, go ahead.
- 5.27 am, Captain Connor.</i>

721
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,276
Oh, Connor.

722
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,716
<i>He said to give you a wake-up call at seven</i>

723
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,473
<i>and to meet him at the golf club at 9.15am.</i>

724
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,630
All right, all right. Anything else?

725
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,711
<i>Let's see... Nope.</i>

726
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,438
What about last night?

727
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,114
<i>You got all your messages last night.</i>

728
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,191
No, I didn't call in last night.

729
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,271
<i>Yeah, you did.</i>

730
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,551
<i>Let's see... yep.</i>

731
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,072
<i>2.33. Your clearance number was given
and messages were transmitted.</i>

732
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,833
Look, I forgot.

733
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,914
Can you give those messages to me again?

734
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,036
<i>All right, just a sec.</i>

735
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,315
What were you doing last night?!

736
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,839
- Sort of helping my career.
- Is that good?

737
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,876
Yeah. It's always good.

738
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,349
Cos you gotta look out
for yourself in life.

739
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,238
<i>Grandma says you gotta look out
for other people.</i>

740
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,118
Yeah. Well, you gotta do that, too.

741
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,873
That's why everybody's so busy all the time.

742
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,077
So, is that what business is?

743
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,513
Business?

744
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,478
No, business... Business is...

745
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,271
Business is... is...

746
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,190
I can't explain it to you right now.

747
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,078
Is that why Mommy says
you've no head for business?

748
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,230
<i>- Lieutenant Smith? Here we go.
- Yeah.</i>

749
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,756
Daddy? Why does Mommy call you a loser?

750
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,831
Out!

751
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,357
<i>Ken Shubik, please call. Message reads,
"The Weasel's checking up on you. "</i>

752
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,237
<i>- The Weasel?
- Yeah.</i>

753
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,198
<i>Then 2.10 this morning,
Mr Eddie Sakamura...</i>

754
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,229
<i>- Eddie Sakamura?
- Correct.</i>

755
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,995
<i>2.10am. Message reads,
"Urgent. Must speak about missing disk. "</i>

756
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,671
Nice shot!

757
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,314
Hey! I gotta talk to you!

758
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,439
We gotta have a conversation.

759
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,511
Shit!

760
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,557
Yoshida-san. I'm embarrassed
by this crude interruption.

761
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,631
You must play your stroke again.

762
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,711
No penalty.

763
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,635
<i>- Ken Shubik.
- Hey, Ken! Web Smith.</i>

764
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,439
<i>- Did you get my message?
- Yeah, about the Weasel.</i>

765
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,273
<i>Last night, I'm working late at the paper...</i>

766
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,749
I see the Weasel arrive, dressed in his tux.

767
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,831
He goes right to the library.

768
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,957
I could tell the ambitious turd
had the scent of blood.

769
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,359
He's still here.

770
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,671
<i>I ask the librarian what he's checking out.</i>

771
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,638
<i>She says, "A cop named Web Smith. "</i>

772
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,838
<i>- What?
- Yep. The guy's a scumbag for hire.</i>

773
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,276
He used to do jobs
for the studios and realtors.

774
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,353
The little turd just got
a new Mercedes 500SL.

775
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,557
Pretty good on a reporter's salary.

776
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,313
Wonder who he's working for now?

777
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,437
You get on the wrong side
of somebody last night?

778
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,273
<i>- Maybe.
- Somebody's got the Weasel tracking you.</i>

779
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,874
<i>Something about
a charge brought against you.</i>

780
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,078
<i>- A charge brought against me?
- You and a Lieutenant Tom Graham.</i>

781
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,515
At the hearing I was cleared. It was bullshit!

782
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,034
<i>Maybe so, but I thought you'd better know.</i>

783
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,078
<i>Smells like something heavy coming down.</i>

784
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,033
What happened to the disk? We left it
with you when we went to get Eddie.

785
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,351
And you got Eddie.
Oh, yes. It was all over the paper.

786
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,831
There was no mention of the murdered girl
on the boardroom table, right?

787
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,071
You had the disk.
It is against the rules to take evidence.

788
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,991
The rules?

789
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,638
Whose rules?

790
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,517
<i>The rules!</i>

791
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,591
The chief says we fucked up...

792
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,514
The Japanese have a saying.
"Fix the problem, not the blame. "

793
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,875
Find out what's fucked up and fix it.

794
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,112
Nobody gets blamed.
We're always after who fucked up.

795
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,077
Their way's better.

796
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,879
Their way is better?
You wake me up to tell me that?

797
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,554
Wake you up? That'll be the day.

798
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,992
Keep it, sport.
Next time, try a parking meter.

799
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,956
- Captain Connor?
- Yes.

800
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,031
A gift from Mr Hanada.

801
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,395
Thank you. I appreciate it.

802
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,630
Most welcome. Most welcome.

803
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,512
You must have really
took those guys this morning.

804
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,591
No. I lost.

805
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,353
Lost? Guys didn't look all that good.

806
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,431
They're not.

807
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,717
It's difficult to lose
without making it too obvious.

808
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,712
- That way they don't lose face.
- Saving face.

809
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,155
Sounds more to me
like you were kissing ass.

810
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,676
Not exactly.
I've done services for those men in the past.

811
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,149
And we've shared information.

812
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,994
They said that Eddie's death
will have repercussions.

813
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,433
Yeah, right!

814
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,308
I'm sorry. The guy was a fugitive.
He killed the girl.

815
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,675
- I doubt it.
- You doubt it?

816
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,830
Well, I saw it on the disk.

817
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,911
Did you?

818
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,669
It's the only space available to us.

819
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,151
We analyse commercials and network news
to see how the public's being tricked.

820
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,472
Problem is, most students want to learn
the tricks so they can use them to get ahead.

821
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,551
OK, everybody!

822
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,551
Class is over.

823
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,030
Ice-skating rink upstairs.
The ice melts down here.

824
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,398
Speaking of ice, Captain, she's been at it
since you gave her the disk at 3am.

825
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,234
Jingo Asakuma...
meet Lieutenant Web Smith.

826
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,230
You're late.

827
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,515
What have we got?

828
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,597
Something there.

829
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,031
In the edge colours.

830
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,792
Look at shadow lines.
They added some shadows.

831
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,871
Look at the light source.

832
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,960
We can see her face, but we can't see his.

833
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,838
- Perfectjob, though.
- And what else?

834
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,717
The reflection.

835
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,360
- Of Eddie.
- It's fishy.

836
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,593
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

837
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,671
Here we are.

838
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,036
Let's look at the colour shift in the pixels.

839
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,793
Yeah. Let's look at those pixels.

840
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,150
Pixels have been doctored.

841
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,231
See the blue edge?

842
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,392
- This disk's a copy.
- A copy? Wait a minute.

843
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,837
You're saying somebody put Eddie's face
there and it's not his reflection?

844
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,911
Come on, that's bullshit!

845
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,835
Bullshit? Where have you been, Lieutenant?
You don't think video can be altered?

846
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,151
I want you to watch what I've been recording
on that camera.

847
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:13,359
This is quick and crude, but imagine
the effect with more sophisticated equipment.

848
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,237
Watch this.

849
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:20,075
<i>You're saying somebody put Eddie's face
there and it's not his reflection?</i>

850
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,151
<i>Come on, that's bullshit!</i>

851
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,589
- They'd need photos of this man.
- They have photos of Eddie.

852
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,399
From the dead girl's apartment.
Off the mirror.

853
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,632
- Do you believe in ghosts, Lieutenant Smith?
- What do you mean, do I believe in ghosts?

854
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,757
In Japan, when I was growing up,
we believed in many ghosts.

855
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,876
I want you to watch this.

856
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,269
Tell me what you see.

857
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,919
See it?

858
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,592
- See what?
- Yeah.

859
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,796
Play it again... but slowly.

860
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,872
The way to see it is to move slightly faster.

861
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,077
It's a ghost!

862
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,197
- Look at that! It's a ghost!
- A third person.

863
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,636
- It's been systematically erased.
- Erased?

864
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,315
Just like airbrushing someone out of a still,
only much harder.

865
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,671
It pisses me off, though.

866
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,832
They expect us to be sloppy Americans.

867
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,230
They think we will not be thorough,
not be intelligent.

868
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,515
In Japan, I guess they'd have done it right.

869
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,760
Right. The ghost would have stayed hidden.

870
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,752
To do this, they would need
high-res video stills,

871
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,308
close-ups of the table, anything in the area.

872
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,914
They'd have to duplicate
the ghost's walk.
