2
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
Fast bike, huh?

3
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,100
Yeah, sometimes.

4
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,400
Want me to fill it up?

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm not here for the gas.

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,000
You can keep an eye on it for me.

7
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,600
Leave it on the road, guys.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
That stunt almost cost me my ride, boy.

9
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,700
- You were in my way. I was in a hurry.
- Well, now you'll be late.

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,700
Hey! Get your dirty little punk ass
off my car.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,300
What is it about driving cars
that makes you all such assholes?

12
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Can you do something
about these dirty windows?

13
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,700
Five bucks.

14
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,500
Make it 10.

15
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,600
Thanks.

16
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,700
Buckle up.

17
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,800
Well. It didn't take long
for you to find trouble.

18
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Step up. I'm running
a two-for-one special today.

19
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,700
Special, huh?

20
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,900
Can I get fries with that?
Because I'm hungry as hell.

21
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,900
- What's up, Ford? How you doing, boy?
- Good to see you, man.

22
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,700
- Wish I could say the same for you.
- Welcome home.

23
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,700
Thanks, man.
Val, Dalton. Late as usual.

24
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,900
Dude's gone six months in Thailand without
a word and now he's busting our chops.

25
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,500
Since when did you get so sensitive?

26
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
I got a rally to get to.

27
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,300
You must be in a hurry to die.

28
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,200
Henry James and his boys aren't gonna be
as happy to see you as we are.

29
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,100
- You were on the run. Why you back now?
- I gotta make things right.

30
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,800
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

31
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,100
- And here I thought it was all about us.
- Look...

32
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,300
...this is my mess, not yours.
You don't have to make this run.

33
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,000
- We can't let you have all the fun.
- You're gonna need us.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes, I am.

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Still know how to ride that thing?

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
We'll have to race
the twisties to find out.

37
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,400
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

38
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,400
I don't want to miss that look
on your face when I blow past you.

39
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,600
What the...?

40
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,200
- We got company.
- Out of my way, punk!

41
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,900
What's his problem?

42
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
I got him!

43
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
- Your ass is mine.
- Let's go, punk.

44
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,600
Come on, what you got?

45
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,600
- You like that?
- Bring that piece of shit on.

46
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm burning, I'm burning.

47
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
- Relax!
- You should've let him burn!

48
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
He could've killed us!

49
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,200
Hey, punk, we ain't done yet.
Move out of the way.

50
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Let's see if this guy fights
as bad as he rides.

51
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,100
- Walk away.
- You got loud pipes...

52
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,300
...but you ain't saying nothing!

53
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,300
You ain't gonna like how this ends.

54
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,700
It's your turn to burn, white boy.

55
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
What's up, J? Drop something?

56
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Just taking care of some business, T.

57
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Ford. I heard you was up in Indochina
eating sushi and shit.

58
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,300
- I thought sushi came from Japan.
- I know where sushi come from, nigga.

59
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,300
I ain't even talking to you.

60
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,100
You know I could smash you right now.

61
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,400
You and your little tricycle friends.

62
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
But I'm gonna give you a pass.

63
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,900
Consider it a welcome-home present.

64
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,500
Under one condition. Somebody gonna
give my brother a new bike.

65
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,700
- I want his bike.
- I ain't giving you shit.

66
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,500
There's only one way
you're getting one of these bikes.

67
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
I know you been gone a long time, Ford.

68
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,600
But not long enough to forget
who run things around here.

69
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,700
I hate to see you end up as Dojo's dinner.

70
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,300
Trey. One-time.

71
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,900
Probably not a good time
to be feeding Dojo anything, huh?

72
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,500
Get that bike from you later.

73
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,100
Hey, officer, how's it going?

74
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,400
Beautiful day today.

75
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,000
- What are you waiting for?
- What you think?

76
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Go show these boys how to ride.

77
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,200
- How about a ride?
- This thing might be too much for you.

78
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,300
- We'll never know till I'm on it.
- All right, you too.

79
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
It's not that I don't enjoy your company.

80
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,600
Just be gentle with him.

81
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,900
- Nice bike.
- Nice ass.

82
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
Got a name?

83
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,400
Yeah.

84
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
Ford. What's he doing here?

85
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,200
Forecast for today:
sun, sun and more sun.

86
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,900
Highs 94 to 103.
Don't forget your sunscreen, folks.

87
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,500
Southwest winds 10 to 15 miles per hour,
with locally higher gusts.

88
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Be with you in a second.

89
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Looking for something in particular?

90
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,100
Yeah, you got one of them seats in a pink
Naugahyde? Maybe with a little gold fringe?

91
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,900
You never were funny, Ford.

92
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Oh, come on, you used to think
I was funny.

93
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,100
Maybe you lost your sense of humor.

94
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
I think I have a pretty good sense of humor.

95
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,800
Like the morning you skipped town
before agents raided my shop...

96
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,100
...waving warrants, telling me
my boyfriend's a drug dealer?

97
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,500
That was funny.
I laughed my ass off for weeks.

98
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,900
I wrote you letters.

99
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,300
- I made fires.
- I tried to call.

100
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,100
Yeah, but my phone was tapped
for six months. That was fun too.

101
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,900
- Can I explain?
- Let me guess.

102
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,800
You're sorry, you didn't mean to hurt me,
you were trying to protect me...

103
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
...and it wasn't your fault.
- It was my fault.

104
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
- We're closed.
- The sign said...

105
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, the sign lied. Thanks.

106
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,600
You too, Ford.

107
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,600
You don't know how many times I've played
this out in my head in the last six months.

108
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,500
Must be frustrating.

109
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
You got balls even coming here.

110
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,900
The feds and the Hellions are after you
and Henry James thinks you stole his bikes.

111
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,300
Yeah.

112
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, that's because I did.

113
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,600
- Ford?
- Yeah?

114
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,300
- Go now, please, before l...
- Before what?

115
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,700
And to think we almost decided
to go to the beach this weekend.

116
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,400
Lucky for me, Luther hates to swim.

117
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,400
Henry.

118
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I don't know why
you're buying a new seat, Ford.

119
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,500
Looks like you haven't
broken in your old one yet.

120
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,900
Looks like Ford prefers to ride bitch to me.

121
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,700
It looks to me like you ought
to buy a new seat yourself, Henry.

122
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,900
Share one with your friends long enough
and you're liable to catch something.

123
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,700
Heard you were in Indochina.

124
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,400
Some shit like that.

125
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,100
- Good food there?
- Thailand, actually...

126
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,800
...but the food was great.
Thanks for asking.

127
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,300
You're a pretty funny guy, Ford.

128
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Tell me...

129
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,100
...you got a punch line for this:

130
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,400
Where are my goddamn bikes?

131
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,700
You really want them...

132
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
...or what's inside them?

133
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,100
Where are they?

134
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,800
- Why don't you just cut it out of him.
- No, he won't.

135
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,300
He's too smart for that.

136
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,500
Because he knows if he touches me
he'll never get his shit back.

137
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,500
Then again...

138
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,000
...l'm not that smart.

139
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,900
Shane.

140
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,900
You've got till sundown
to hand over my bikes.

141
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,900
- Your brother said we had a deal.
- Junior don't do the deals around here, I do.

142
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Well, if Junior ain't allowed to make deals,
he shouldn't be allowed to speak.

143
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,300
That's funny, because I was
thinking the same thing.

144
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,700
I didn't come here to watch you
pet your dog, primate.

145
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,500
I didn't invite your Dukes of Hazzard ass.

146
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,900
So you can raise up whenever you feel it.
The answer is no.

147
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,000
You're not slinging your dope on my streets.

148
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Hand me that bottle.

149
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
Look...

150
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,400
...l'm not some dimebag street punk.

151
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm a businessman.

152
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,200
And I'm telling you to make this right.

153
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
I wouldn't give a shit
if you was Don Corleone himself.

154
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
The answer is still no.

155
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,200
So get out of my face.

156
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
What the hell was you looking at?

157
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,100
I love you.

158
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Trey, what's wrong? I thought you
would've been down with that shit.

159
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
You could've made a killing.

160
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,200
First you gonna act a fool
up there on the road, now this?

161
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
What's wrong with you?

162
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,600
You messing with
my goddamn good nature, boy.

163
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,400
Go get me a beer, man.
You messing up my buzz.

164
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Get me a Diet Pepsi. Don't slam my door.

165
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,100
You better count to 10!

166
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,600
- I'm gonna whup his ass.
- Shut up. Put Rasan and Nomo on him.

167
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Dojo got more sense than that boy.

168
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,100
Henry, looks like
you're the one riding bitch.

169
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Looks like your engine
could use a little work.

170
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,600
What part of "I don't love you
anymore, you're a bastard...

171
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,900
...and I never wanna see you again"
didn't you understand?

172
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,300
How about the part that stops you
from driving off right now?

173
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,800
Thirsty?

174
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,900
All right, one beer. But you're buying.

175
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,100
- What up, Junior? You all right?
- No, I'm definitely not all right, man. Move!

176
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
Watch out, white boy.

177
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,500
- Call it an accident?
- How about I kick your ass?

178
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,100
No, I prefer we still call it an accident.

179
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,100
- How about now?
- Now it looks like you owe me a beer.

180
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
- Junior! Junior!
- I'm gonna kill you!

181
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,400
Come on, chill!

182
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm gonna talk to you. Why you always
got to show your ass, man, huh?

183
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,200
Why you can't come here
and play your position?

184
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,000
Look at me, boy.

185
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,800
I love you. You're my brother,
but you better stop embarrassing me.

186
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,400
Stop acting so damn crazy.

187
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,500
And I got your back for life.

188
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,400
Well, if you got my back, then show me,
blood, on everything!

189
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,800
You ain't got my back, man. You ain't
got my back, Trey. Forget you, man.

190
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,200
Watch out. Get out of my way, man.

191
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,600
Dawson's Creek almost beat
your brother's ass, blood.

192
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Shut up, man. Go get my dog.

193
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,300
- What're we gonna do about Ford?
- Junior just solved our problem.

194
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,900
- Why don't we just grab him right now?
- No, not now.

195
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,500
I got a better idea. Get the boys.

196
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,400
What is it with you, Ford?
Everywhere you go, everything turns to hell.

197
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah, it's a talent I have.

198
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
Go powder your nose, China.

199
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,000
Let's have some fun.

200
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,200
- That's him. Get him.
- There he is.

201
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,100
We'd like to thank the Hellions for
messing up another gig. I'm out of here.

202
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
He ain't going anywhere.

203
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,100
- Here he comes.
- There he goes. Get him!

204
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
See you, Junior.

205
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,300
Hey, what's up, man?

206
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Hey. What's up?

207
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,200
Hey, dude.

208
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,800
Damn!

209
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,500
You screwed me, Junior.

210
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,000
I assume you're apologizing
for setting up a deal you couldn't do.

211
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I made promises based on your black ass.

212
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,700
And now I've got a problem.

213
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,800
- But you're gonna help me out of it.
- Yo, dog.

214
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,500
Just give me time. I'm gonna talk to Trey.
We could work this out, man.

215
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,100
I could make this happen, all right?

216
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,600
Time's up.

217
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,500
You know what to do, baby?

218
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,900
There's this one road that winds up
the coast from Bangkok to Pattani.

219
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,500
It's got mountains on one side,
ocean on the other...

220
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,500
...so close sometimes it feels like
you can just drag your foot in it.

221
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,900
I tell you, the last six months, every time
I took that drive I thought about you.

222
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,200
Did you come all this way
to sell me a trip to Thailand?

223
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,700
You got to the bottom of this beer.
Explain away.

224
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,300
All right.

225
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,800
First met Henry about a year ago. I didn't
like him, but he was a paying customer.

226
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,900
I fixed his chopper a couple times.

227
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,000
Six months ago, he turns up at your shop...

228
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,700
...with these two bikes.
He asked me if I'd mind looking after them.

229
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,500
I figure,
what the hell, right?

230
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,800
So I do.

231
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,200
Then I go to move them, they don't start.
So I check the tanks.

232
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
They're filled with kilos of crystal meth.

233
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,900
So first thing, I get them out of there.

234
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,400
So that's why that fed McPherson
raided my shop after you split.

235
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
And you dropped off
the face of the Earth.

236
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,900
I took off...

237
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,100
...so that you wouldn't get dragged into it.

238
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,800
I split.

239
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,000
Now I'm the only one involved with Henry.

240
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,800
So you left to protect me?

241
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,300
What'd you think, you were gonna just
come back and explain everything...

242
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,500
...and then we'd just ride off
into the sunset together?

243
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,100
More or less.

244
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,000
Well, which is it? More or less?

245
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,200
Well, I was actually thinking Mexico.

246
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
- You're killing me.
- Get your gear on.

247
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,800
- Not a good time.
- Heading to Cabo. Shane's coming.

248
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,500
- Damn, really?
- Yeah.

249
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,900
- Give me 10 minutes, all right?
- Come on.

250
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,700
Move.

251
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,600
Move, man! Move!

252
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Damn!

253
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Wait. That's my brother, man.

254
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,400
It's all right.

255
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,700
Oh, no. No, man.
I'm taking him with me.

256
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,800
You can't do that, son.

257
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,500
Now, we're gonna find out who done this.

258
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,100
If you have any ideas who would
want to kill your brother...

259
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,600
If I knew who did this,
you'd have two dead bodies right now.

260
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,100
We got a witness.
Says she saw the whole thing.

261
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,500
A white male, mid-20s,
rode a custom motorcycle.

262
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,200
- Wore black and orange leathers.
- Black and orange leathers?

263
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,300
Hey, you know somebody
who fits that description?

264
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,900
Not anymore.

265
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,600
Let's go!

266
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,000
FBI. Agent McPherson,
federal gang task force.

267
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,900
Sheriff Barnes.
You don't look like your typical fed.

268
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,800
What'd you expect? A cheap suit,
late-model Taurus, a $ 10 haircut?

269
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,500
How'd y'all get here so fast?

270
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,800
Get this many motorheads
in one place, all wearing colors...

271
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,500
...something's bound to happen.
Pays to be close.

272
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, this is Agent Henderson.

273
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Don't let her good looks fool you.
She's one of the best field operatives.

274
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,800
Excuse me, I have to take this.

275
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,800
Yeah. Hi, baby.
I'm at a crime scene right now.

276
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,200
- It's a typical homicide.
- Typical homicide?

277
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,200
Maybe you can explain to me
what a typical homicide is.

278
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,600
All right, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, I promise.

279
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,500
- I've got an eyewitness.
- You do?

280
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,900
- Yeah.
- You've practically got this solved.

281
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,900
I love you too. Jesus Christ.

282
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,000
We've got the murder weapon
and she saw the whole thing.

283
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,600
Congratulations.

284
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't care if we have to comb
every inch of California.

285
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,900
I want that boy Ford, and I want
his head in Dojo's bowl by midnight.

286
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,500
- Amen?
- Amen.

287
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,000
Come on, boy.

288
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Motel policy for cash customers.

289
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,000
Jay.

290
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,300
- Got him.
- Son of a bitch.

291
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,000
- I tried to pop Ford six months ago.
- He's cute.

292
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,400
You can visit him in prison. Map.

293
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,600
That's why you broke, you eat too much.

294
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,800
- I got it.
- That's okay.

295
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,200
What were you planning on paying with,
your good looks or your smile?

296
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,100
I love a girl who can
take care of herself, man.

297
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,400
I would've come back too.

298
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,100
If you boys will excuse me.

299
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,100
It seems like I'm overdue
for some paint and bodywork myself.

300
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,500
So, what are you gonna do about Henry?
We got a plan, right?

301
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, once we're in the clear, I'm gonna tell
Henry where he can pick up his shit.

302
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,200
Of course...

303
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,800
...l'm also gonna call that punk
McPherson and tell him.

304
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
Arrange a get-together with the evidence.

305
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,900
That way everybody gets
what they deserve, right?

306
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,800
Henry gets his shit,
McPherson gets Henry...

307
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,400
...and we all go to Mexico and get drunk.

308
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,600
As I reported earlier, Wallace, a member
of an Inglewood motorcycle gang...

309
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,800
...the Reapers, was brutally murdered
last night with a motorcycle chain.

310
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,500
With the help of an eyewitness,
the FBI has come up with a suspect:

311
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,500
Cary Ford, a white male
in his late 20s.

312
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,400
Ford was last seen riding
a black custom motorcycle...

313
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,900
...wearing orange and black
racing leathers.

314
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,600
If you have any idea
as to his whereabouts...

315
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,600
...please contact the local authorities.

316
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,900
Cary Ford is now the prime suspect
in the murder of Junior Wallace.

317
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,400
Call the sheriff, Hal.

318
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,100
Ford was just spotted at Lone Pine.

319
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,400
Let's drive a little.

320
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,900
Yeah.

321
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,600
Heard on the scanner
they spotted the white boy.

322
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,500
- Dawson's Creek, the white boy.
- All right, get me a map.

323
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,700
We gotta make up some time.

324
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,400
- Yeah?
- Give me Ford.

325
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,500
Ford. It's for you.

326
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,100
- Ford.
- Change in plans.

327
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,200
Seems your buddy Junior's dead.

328
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Feds think you did it.

329
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,500
Reapers think you did it.
Hell, everybody thinks you did it.

330
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,400
You tell me where my stuff is
and it all goes away.

331
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,400
I don't take orders, Henry.

332
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,700
- Never have, never will.
- What's that?

333
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,600
Ever heard that what you put out
comes back tenfold?

334
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,500
You spent too much time in Chink Land,
Ford. What does that mean?

335
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,200
It means I don't wanna be next to you
when the shit hits the fan.

336
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,900
And by the way, Henry...

337
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,000
..."Chink Land" implies China.
I was in Thailand, it's a different country.

338
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,000
Hey, my phone!

339
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,500
Hold it right there.

340
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,900
Everybody down on the ground!

341
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Quit shooting!

342
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,900
You got the wrong guy.

343
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,600
We'll let the sheriff sort it out
when they get here.

344
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,500
- Are you okay?
- I got it under control!

345
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,400
I didn't kill anybody.

346
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,500
Shit!

347
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,600
You Earl?

348
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,800
Loved your French toast.

349
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,200
- Down.
- Like I said...

350
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,500
...I love a girl who can take care of herself.
- Thanks.

351
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,800
You're on the news.
That guy you got in a fight with is dead.

352
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,900
- Henry set me up. He wants his drugs back.
- Why don't you give them back.

353
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,200
- It's the only insurance I got.
- You were with me last night.

354
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,300
I'm your alibi. Down, Earl!

355
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,200
Tell the cops.

356
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Right now it ain't the cops
that I'm worried about.

357
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,800
Not good.

358
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,800
- Reapers!
- He's right, Shane.

359
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
You think we could finish
this conversation later?

360
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,400
All right. Once we're in the clear,
you call the cops. Agreed?

361
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,900
What should I do with this?

362
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,800
Forget what I said about liking women
who can take care of themselves.

363
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,100
Sorry, it's gonna get crazy.
You'll be safer here than running with us.

364
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,900
- See you back in L.A.
- What am I supposed to do?

365
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,000
Hang out with Earl?

366
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Which way?

367
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,000
Which way did you say, old man?

368
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,600
- Which way?
- Shortcut!

369
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,700
Let's catch them,
kill them and bury them!

370
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,700
They're still on us!
Shit! There's more of them!

371
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,400
- What are we gonna do, Ford?
- Where we going?

372
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,800
I'm working on it!

373
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,200
Which way did they go?

374
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,200
Damn! Come on!

375
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,800
Now can we call the cops?

376
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,700
- No.
- Why not?

377
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,400
Because it's not just the cops,
it's McPherson.

378
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,400
McPherson?

379
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,300
The guy that tore up your shop.

380
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,500
He already thinks I'm a drug dealer.

381
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,500
Now he thinks I shot Junior.
And he has no reason to think otherwise...

382
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,000
...unless I can prove it.
- Bad just turned to worse. Bent link.

383
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,300
This just keeps getting
better and better.

384
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,500
I got a spare in my toolkit.

385
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,600
He was strangled, by the way.

386
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,400
- Who?
- Junior. He was strangled with a bike chain.

387
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,200
Shit.

388
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Henry used the chain off his own bike.

389
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,400
- How do you know that?
- How do you know?

390
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,600
Yeah, how did you know that?

391
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,200
Well, it's...

392
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,100
It's complicated.

393
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,100
- You turning left, or we going to Oregon?
- It's right.

394
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,500
It's right? What...?

395
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,900
Get the finger out of my face.
I know where I'm going.

396
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,300
Henry just screwed himself.

397
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,000
- See those scratches and nicks?
- Yeah.

398
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Well, it picks them up
from the sprocket.

399
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Now, no two bikes
got the same chain-wear pattern...

400
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,700
...because no two sprockets
are the same.

401
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,000
So we match the chain
used to kill Junior with Henry's bike...

402
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
...and we got him.

403
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Like a fingerprint.

404
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,800
Try not to move your lips
so much when you think.

405
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,000
Now we call the cops, right?

406
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,900
Now we call the cops.

407
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,300
- Real cute, guys.
- Get a room.

408
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,800
- McPherson, it's F...
- Ford. Looks like you're trading up.

409
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,600
Going from drug trafficking
to first-degree murder.

410
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,300
- I was set up.
- In my business I hear that a lot.

411
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,100
- Loud. Recorder's on.
- Who wants to set you up?

412
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,100
Henry James.

413
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,800
Leader of the Hellions.
Now, why would he wanna do that?

414
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,700
Those drugs you were looking for
belong to Henry.

415
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,700
I stashed them the night before you
raided the shop. He wants them back.

416
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,300
Tell me where the drugs are,
I might buy that'd give Henry motive.

417
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,800
- Maybe we can work something out.
- "Maybe" don't cut it. Arrest Henry...

418
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,300
...then I'll take you to the drugs.
- Arrest him? On what grounds?

419
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,900
First-degree murder.

420
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,200
- What if I tie the murder weapon to Henry?
- Big "if."

421
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,900
Arrest him.

422
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,800
- Get his bike, I'll show you.
- Get his bike. Okay.

423
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,800
Anyone else you'd like me to arrest?
Ex-girlfriend, second-grade teacher...?

424
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,100
- Hold on, I'm making a list.
- You're not listening to me.

425
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,700
- Henry killed Junior.
- I don't know that.

426
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Then you can't help me!

427
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,500
Well, that didn't fly.

428
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,800
Screw it. Let's haul ass down
to Mexico and don't look back.

429
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,300
As much as I hate to say it,
I agree with him.

430
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,000
- We're going to L.A.
- Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

431
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,900
I have to get Henry's bike.
That will clear me.

432
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,800
They'll have checkpoints on every
dirt road between here and the coast.

433
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,700
We're not exactly hard
to spot driving these.

434
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,100
- You wanna ditch the bikes?
- No, I'd rather be fast than invisible.

435
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,700
Come on. Wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy, right?

436
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,200
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

437
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,100
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

438
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,700
Po-po got the highways
blocked from here to L.A.

439
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,400
L.A.?

440
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,900
Why would he go to the one place
he know I got on lockdown?

441
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,400
- Let's catch him on the interstate.
- No, he's smarter than that.

442
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,100
He trying to backdoor us.

443
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,100
He going through the Palms.

444
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,600
That's the way I'd go.
And that's the way we going.

445
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,900
You know, Henry James did pull six months
in L.A. County last year for possession.

446
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600
Maybe Ford is onto something.

447
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,000
Then you can't help me!

448
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,600
Call in. Check everything
from Lone Pine and L.A.

449
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,400
- You think Ford's going back to L.A.?
- He's going after Henry James.

450
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,200
If he's right and Henry did set him up,
that's what I'd do. Let's go!

451
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,400
- You have to pay for the gas.
- Oh, right.

452
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,200
Reapers!

453
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,900
- We'll lose them in the Palms!
- Are you crazy?

454
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,500
I hate it when he does this!

455
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,000
- They going into the trees!
- I could see that, fool! Stay on Ford.

456
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,700
- I got his ass!
- They're shooting at us, Ford!

457
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,100
- I know!
- What do we do?

458
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,000
Go right! They'll follow me!

459
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,600
Meet the twins!

460
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,500
All right, Ford!

461
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,600
Just you and me, baby!

462
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,400
Shouldn't pick on girls.

463
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,000
You all right?

464
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,500
I just jumped my bike
onto the roof of a moving train.

465
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,900
It's amazing what you can do
when you have no choice.

466
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
Where are Val and Dalton?

467
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,500
He had me, dog. He had me.
I was gone!

468
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,600
He's the one snatched me up out of there!

469
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm trying to figure out why.
He ain't acting like no killer!

470
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,700
Your brother's dead
and cracker's on the run.

471
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,200
Shit don't feel right.
Don't sound right, don't look right.

472
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,100
Only way we can find out
is to get our hands on him.

473
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,500
- I'm with that.
- Then get your black ass up and let's go!

474
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,300
Everybody, let's go!

475
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,000
First time Val's beat you anywhere!

476
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,300
Must be the chick.

477
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,100
Yeah, I stopped for a manicure.

478
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,200
Want this hour's bad news?
Every major road in L.A. is blocked.

479
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,100
I know you said it wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy...

480
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,800
...but does it have to be this much fun?

481
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,400
You said you could make this
go away. How?

482
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,800
Sometimes witnesses
forget what they saw.

483
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,900
Refuse to testify.

484
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,700
You still want your shit back...

485
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,200
...l'll call you when I get to L.A.
3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

486
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,400
What?

487
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,400
Jay, something doesn't sit with me.
Ford doesn't profile up as a killer.

488
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,500
Yeah? Good instincts, Henderson.

489
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:44,200
Listen, I gave Ford a chance
to tell the truth six months ago. He ran.

490
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,100
I gave him another chance last night.
He ran again.

491
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,100
Innocent men, Henderson, don't run.

492
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,400
He went for it!

493
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,600
Now we just gotta get past the several
hundred cops between us and L.A.

494
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,500
God, I hope you have a plan this time.

495
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,700
Yeah, I got a plan.

496
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,300
You gonna leave without me?

497
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,500
Oh, my God.

498
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,400
Check it out, man.

499
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,300
Holy shit.

500
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,400
Seen three bikers and a chick on a couple
of crotch rockets in the last hour?

501
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,800
Must be something in the water up here.

502
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,900
Okay. Words strung together
into sentences obviously bewilder you.

503
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Let me try again.

504
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,600
Three dudes...

505
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,200
...a girl...

506
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,300
...and a couple of bikes.

507
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,000
- Don't know. Seen a lot of truckers.
- Really?

508
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,100
One girl.

509
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,400
- Man, you should've seen the pair...
- Shut up.

510
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,500
Does this thing work?

511
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Ford. What is wrong with you?

512
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,000
Sorry.

513
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,300
- Is it fried?
- Yeah.

514
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,500
So you never actually told me
why you chose Thailand.

515
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,800
Well, I just wanted to go someplace
that wouldn't remind me of you.

516
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,300
Oh, yeah?

517
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,000
How did that work out for you?

518
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,900
- Not real well.
- No?

519
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,500
Oh, come on, admit it.

520
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,400
You're so glad I came back.

521
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,200
I just had nothing better to do
this weekend.

522
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,500
Why we stopping
in the middle of the interstate?

523
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,600
Roadblock.

524
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,400
Sir! You're clear. Go ahead.
Move it out.

525
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,100
Go ahead and send the next one!

526
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,700
Check the second one back!

527
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,800
- Good evening, officer.
- Could you step out of the vehicle, please.

528
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,700
- There a problem?
- No, sir. Just a routine check.

529
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,100
- You mind opening her up?
- No, not at all.

530
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,000
- Where you coming from?
- Barstow.

531
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,100
- Much drier in Barstow.
- Yeah, just a little.

532
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,000
Hey, Ed!
What are you doing back so soon?

533
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,600
I got a race in L.A. tomorrow night.

534
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,000
He's all right.
Regular hero here on the local circuit.

535
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,600
- Let him through.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,600
Hey, Ed, good luck tomorrow night.

537
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,700
- Beat it.
- Thanks, Frank.

538
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,000
Ford should've called us by now.

539
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,500
He's just having a good run.
Don't sweat it, man.

540
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,900
We got over a mil riding on this!

541
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,600
We're looking at life in prison if Ford
doesn't go down as planned.

542
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,400
Don't tell me not to sweat it.

543
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,800
So grab yourself a candy bar
and shut your mouth.

544
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,000
That's a sweet hog, man.
Look at that beast!

545
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,000
Live to ride. Or that. Yeah.

546
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,500
Could we get a picture of you guys?

547
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,400
We're on a road trip, we e-mail people
on our buddy list where we're at.

548
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,200
Could we do that?
Who's in love?

549
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,600
- They are.
- Right there.

550
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,300
Give me a big smile,
like you guys are human.

551
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,700
He blinked and she blinked.
Look at this. Let's do it again.

552
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,100
This time, no blinking.

553
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,900
Smile.

554
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,600
Now what?

555
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,300
It's also about financial freedom.

556
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,200
- What can I do for you?
- Why don't you open up the back for me.

557
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,100
That's a long truck.

558
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,600
Don't touch me.

559
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,800
- That's weird.
- What?

560
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,600
My lock's gone.

561
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,700
You waiting for a green light?

562
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,800
- Let's go, make a hole!
- Truck's broke. Call a tow truck.

563
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,300
- Are you done?
- Get in. I'm driving.

564
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,500
Fuck the police!

565
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
- Was that a threat?
- I think it was.

566
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,100
Ford, traffic!

567
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,500
This is why I hate four wheels.

568
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,200
Hey, you're gonna have to
make a break!

569
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,900
- We go together!
- No, you and Val can get Shane out of this!

570
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,500
No way, I'm going with you!

571
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,500
- No, you're not.
- Goddamn it, Ford!

572
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,700
I always knew you had a thing for me.

573
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,600
Get her out of here!

574
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,100
Hey!

575
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Watch out.

576
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:02,000
And I'm not gonna stand for it. I wanna
return the bike. You can take it back.

577
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,200
What do you mean I can't bring it back?
Okay, there's only 200 miles on the bike.

578
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,600
If you say one more word...

579
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,000
Asshole!

580
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,600
Hello? Hung up again!

581
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,800
- Bikers.
- This is crazy! We can call backup.

582
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,900
If you don't like my driving, Henderson,
you can get out and hitch.

583
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,800
No way!

584
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,100
Thank God for airbags. Shut up.

585
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,900
- Come on, Ford.
- You got this wrong!

586
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,300
Damn!

587
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,100
Damn! Crazy white boy!

588
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,700
Look, man, I don't wanna...

589
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,800
You think you man enough
to drop that hammer?

590
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,200
Don't want to.
I didn't kill Junior either.

591
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,800
If I did, I would've
let you die at the tracks.

592
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:41,200
- Why didn't you stick around and talk?
- I didn't think this would go all that well.

593
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,400
All right.
You didn't kill him, who did?

594
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,700
Henry James. He set me up.

595
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,000
So I'm supposed to just believe
what you say now?

596
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,200
Well, see for yourself.
I'm taking him down.

597
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,600
You don't believe me,
you can always shoot me then.

598
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,900
You dropped this.

599
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,600
This better be someone
with good news or money.

600
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,200
What would you say if I gave you Junior's
killer and Henry's drugs at the same time?

601
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,200
Where?

602
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,300
You know the address. You busted its doors
down about six months ago.

603
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,500
Meet me there in two hours.

604
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,100
Crystal meth.

605
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,200
I don't suppose we got
a spare set of hands?

606
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,200
- Yeah?
- Don't "yeah" me.

607
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,200
How we doing over there?

608
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,200
It's just me and the fishes, man.

609
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,500
If a mermaid pops up, I'll call you.

610
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,800
- Just stay there at Dalton's.
- Yeah.

611
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,800
It's lovely here.

612
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,000
I'll see you in a little while.

613
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,600
Just be careful, all right?

614
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,900
- Well, you know me.
- Yeah, that's why I'm worried.

615
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,800
I'll call you when it's over.

616
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,900
- Who the hell is that?
- I ordered pizza.

617
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,600
- You're kidding me, right?
- No.

618
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,100
- You're not kidding?
- I eat when I'm nervous.

619
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,300
He eats when he's horny.
He just likes to eat.

620
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,200
How you doing?

621
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,800
Seems like your boy ain't coming.

622
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,100
Now what?

623
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,300
He'll be here. Trust me.

624
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,100
Tell me you got a million dollars'
worth of my ice?

625
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,300
I'd try to be punctual.

626
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,000
You ain't Henry.

627
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,700
He'll be here.

628
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,200
You know, I ain't exactly
known for my patience.

629
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,900
- What's this?
- Y2K.

630
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,800
Fastest bike in the world.

631
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,800
Carbon-fiber chassis built around
a Rolls-Royce jet helicopter engine.

632
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,500
Zero to 200 in less than 10 seconds, huh?

633
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,400
I heard of these.

634
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,000
- What's wrong with this one?
- I don't own it.

635
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,200
- FBI! Hands where I can see them!
- Drop it. Hands behind your head.

636
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,000
- You tried to set me up.
- They're here for Henry.

637
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,800
Put the gun on the ground
and slide it to me, now.

638
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,200
You're supposed to wait for Henry.
Didn't you learn anything in FBI school?

639
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,900
Ford, shut up.

640
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,600
Those Henry's bikes?

641
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,700
- Yeah.
- And the meth's inside them?

642
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,200
- Yeah.
- Then...

643
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,600
...nice work.

644
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,400
Hey. Nancy Drew.

645
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,100
"No. Don't shoot. Stop."

646
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,900
What a sad and sudden tragedy.

647
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,600
Nice shot, by the way.
Seriously. So now...

648
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,500
...I get to pin this murder on you...

649
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,700
...and, well, everyone knows
you killed Junior...

650
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,000
...so now
I can shoot you both.

651
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,200
- Shit.
- Yeah.

652
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:01,400
- Which one of you guys wants to go first?
- Him. Shoot him first.

653
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,500
You sure the drugs are in there?

654
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,700
- Hey.
- They're wired.

655
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,700
You put the gun on the ground
or we all go up.

656
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,100
It's my girlfriend. Excuse me. Sorry.

657
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,200
Hey, baby. I'm fine.

658
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,200
Why don't you come in? All right.

659
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,700
You're gonna love her.

660
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,300
Meet my partner.

661
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,800
Did you really think I was stupid enough
to walk into a trap?

662
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,500
Wait.

663
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,400
Say hello, bitch.

664
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,400
Shane.

665
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,700
Look who it is.

666
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:16,000
Guess the lunch line's gonna be
a little shorter at family reunions.

667
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,000
Huh, dog?

668
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,700
I should have done your ass
when I did your bitch brother.

669
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,300
Yeah, you should have.

670
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,800
Really?

671
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,400
All right. It seems we
have ourselves a little dilemma.

672
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,400
Give me my meth or your little girlfriend
is gonna redefine the term "airhead."

673
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,700
Now, drop that switch.

674
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,200
Who knows, baby?

675
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,600
After a little time with us,
she might not wanna go back to Ford.

676
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,500
Go ahead, take a moment.
We have plenty of time.

677
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,500
Requesting backup
at 12000 North Alameda Street.

678
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,200
Thanks.

679
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,200
No, no, no!

680
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,500
Hey, wait!

681
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,200
Now, ain't that ironic?

682
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,000
- You okay?
- Yeah. Where's Henry?

683
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,700
- I gotta get that bike.
- I gotta get that bitch.

684
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,100
Damn right.

685
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,500
- You Power Rangers all right?
- That hurt.

686
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,300
- Hey.
- Jay!

687
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,100
Bulletproof vest, asshole.

688
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,800
Shit! Let's go!

689
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,100
You were always a punk.

690
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,700
- Going somewhere?
- You want some of this, bitch?

691
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,800
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

692
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,800
You messed with the wrong chick!

693
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,300
Looks like you did, bitch.

694
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,600
Need a ride?

695
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,800
- You all right?
- I'll live.

696
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,800
This is Henry's sprocket.
It should match the chain...

697
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,500
Your friends just told me.
Could we maybe do this later?

698
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,400
All these dead white folks around here.

699
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,100
So it look like we done, huh?

700
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,600
- I'm sorry about your brother.
- Yeah.

701
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:44,200
I gotta get out of here. Me and Johnny Law
ain't on a first-name basis.

702
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,900
Hey.

703
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,900
- What?
- Thanks.

704
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,600
Don't sweat it, man.
Just do me one favor.

705
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,400
- What's that?
- Keep your ass out of Inglewood.

706
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,800
This shop was the only thing
in the world that was really mine.

707
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,200
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to save up for it?

708
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,300
I'm sorry, Shane.

709
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,500
You're in the clear,
so I guess you got what you wanted.

710
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,800
You're looking at the only reason
that I came back.

711
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,800
I'm betting on more days like that.

712
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,700
You know what you could do for me, Ford?

713
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,200
Take me to Mexico.

714
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,500
- Where we heading?
- South.

715
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,600
I got someone to pick up.

716
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,000
Let's ride.

717
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,200
