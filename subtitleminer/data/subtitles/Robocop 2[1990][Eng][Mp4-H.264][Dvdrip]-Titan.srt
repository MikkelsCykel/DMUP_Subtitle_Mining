MagnaVolt.
The final word in auto security.

2
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:10,595
No embarrassing alarm noise,
no need to trouble the police...

3
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:20,071
...and it won't even
run down your battery.

4
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,568
<i>MagnaVolt.</i>

5
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:26,607
<i>Lethal response.</i>

6
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,750
<i>On the international scene, the Amazon
nuclear power facility has blown its stack...</i>

7
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:36,483
...irradiating the world's largest rain forest.
Environmentalists call it a disaster.

8
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:38,684
But don't they always?

9
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:41,762
In national news,
Attorney General Marcos today...

10
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:46,902
...approved the ED 209 combat unit
for deployment in five American cities...

11
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:50,163
...despite widespread complaints
of malfunction.

12
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:51,806
The surgeon general is dead.

13
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:56,138
Gunned down 20 minutes ago by a militant
addict of the deadly designer drug Nuke.

14
00:01:56,346 --> 00:02:00,476
The greatest health threat
facing our nation.

15
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:06,882
Nuke.

16
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,452
The most addictive narcotic
in history.

17
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,854
A plague that...

18
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:20,735
Nuke! Nuke!

19
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:27,604
This station has just received
this transmission from Cain...

20
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:30,768
...convicted murderer
and leader of the Nuke cult.

21
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,243
The people want paradise.

22
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:36,846
And they will have it.

23
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:40,317
<i>The assassination is the latest
act of terrorism by Cain...</i>

24
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:45,151
<i>...following the bombing
of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.</i>

25
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:49,989
After the latest breakdown in negotiations,
Detroit's police returned to the picket line...

26
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:53,759
...demanding better terms from
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

27
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:57,802
...the corporation contracted by the city
to run the police department.

28
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:02,374
OCP cut our salaries 40 percent
and canceled our pensions.

29
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:05,204
Now they refuse to even talk to us.

30
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:07,574
God knows why,
but they want this strike.

31
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:47,579
What happened?

32
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,043
Get up!

33
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,652
- Hold him!
- You put my eye out, you bitches!

34
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,790
Shut up, you fuckhead!

35
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:29,351
- You're breaking my fucking arm!
- Hurry!

36
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,296
Look at this. What a nasty man.

37
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,368
Night's made. Let's pay Papa
and get us what we need.

38
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,333
Nuke me, baby!

39
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,371
- I'll kill you bitches!
- He's up! Come on!

40
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:53,578
- You're shit with a timer, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

41
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,688
I'll take out an army with this shit!

42
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:10,532
Let's load up
and get the hell out of here!

43
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:20,910
Where's the bullets for this gun, man?

44
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:23,941
Third drawer, bottom.

45
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,856
We should've brought a truck!

46
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,596
I really like this gun, man.

47
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,273
Just take it and get out.

48
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,769
Thanks.

49
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,240
- I don't believe this!
- What?

50
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,145
- It's the cops, man.
- Cops are on strike, stupid.

51
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:04,320
Can't you hear that?

52
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:16,925
- See. What did I tell you?
- I'll fix him.

53
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:31,079
Did you see that? We got him!

54
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,277
- Beautiful. Come on, man. Let's move it.
- No. One more!

55
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,452
Nice shit, man.

56
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,087
Fucking cops!

57
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:37,504
Peace officer.

58
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,974
Think it over, creep.

59
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,620
Nuke.

60
00:07:58,198 --> 00:08:00,132
It's not mine, man.

61
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:03,534
Where is it made?

62
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:06,797
It's not mine, man. I told you! I'm clean!

63
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,338
Where is it made?

64
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:16,838
I don't know, man!
All I know is where I get it!

65
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,950
Freeze.

66
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,991
Nobody move. This is a bust.

67
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,907
Ladies, stay down.

68
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:12,870
Somebody! Open the fridge, damn it!

69
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,248
Come on!

70
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,307
Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?

71
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,312
<i>Can't shoot a kid...</i>

72
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,611
<i>Throw it home, Dad!</i>

73
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,033
Shut up!

74
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:14,463
Drop it or the little shit's dead!
I'll blow its fucking head off, man!

75
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:16,334
Lewis...

76
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:18,305
...hang it up.

77
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:27,849
Now, no shit from either one of you!

78
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,021
- And don't try to follow me!
- We won't.

79
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:31,712
The baby's going with me!

80
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,721
I'll kill it, man. I'll do it. I'll fucking kill it!

81
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:37,121
We can't have that.

82
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:51,898
Nice shooting.

83
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:56,938
See you, Jimmy.

84
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,192
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

85
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:54,129
Don't do it! No! Stop... Stop it, Alex!

86
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,457
<i>OCP defines you as a machine...</i>

87
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:26,893
...that utilizes some living tissue.
You understand that.

88
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,997
Yes.

89
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:34,499
And so do you
consider yourself human?

90
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:38,677
I require an answer.

91
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,380
Stop tape.

92
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,515
You have any idea what you're doing
to that poor woman?

93
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,552
Take a look at her file.

94
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:52,123
Go on.

95
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:57,328
Officer, Mrs. Murphy
is bringing suit against OCP.

96
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,090
My name is Tom Delaney.
I'm representing her.

97
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:03,498
Up to a few months ago,
she wouldn't leave her bedroom.

98
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:06,503
Then there were hypnotists
and harmonic treatments.

99
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,610
Then you pull this shit!
Driving past her house day after day.

100
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:14,304
Spying on her. Trying to make her
think her husband is still alive.

101
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,278
She's barely started
to accept the loss.

102
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,781
- You're ripping her to pieces.
- And for what?

103
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:24,217
Do you think you could ever be
a husband to her?

104
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:27,985
I mean, what can you offer her?

105
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:30,226
Companionship?

106
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:33,663
Love?

107
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,769
A man's love?

108
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,816
No.

109
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,145
Roll tape.

110
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,822
Are you Alex Murphy?

111
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:07,831
No.

112
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,330
Are you human?

113
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,003
No.

114
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,769
You are simply a machine.

115
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:18,173
I am...

116
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,434
...a machine.

117
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,475
Nothing more.

118
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:24,913
Nothing more.

119
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,587
That'll do it. Stop tape.

120
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:37,591
Now, you stay there.
All right, go get her.

121
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:40,890
Let's be decent about this.
Give them some privacy.

122
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,964
I don't have a problem with that.

123
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,716
Alex?

124
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,091
Don't you know me?

125
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:47,821
Don't you remember me?

126
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:53,428
Alex, it doesn't matter
what they've done to you...

127
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,598
Touch me.

128
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:07,510
It's cold.

129
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,311
They made this...

130
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,282
...to honor him.

131
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:19,890
- No, I...
- Your husband is dead.

132
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:24,122
I don't know you.

133
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,550
Why is this happening?

134
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,512
I thought all communication systems
were the same.

135
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:16,849
I tried to save the company
a few bucks.

136
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:21,548
It took two days to download specs
from Cleveland.

137
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,324
I lost the account.

138
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:52,443
It hardly befits my dignity
to have to come to you, Johnson.

139
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:55,247
Sorry for the slight inconvenience,
Your Honor.

140
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:57,686
Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight.

141
00:20:57,891 --> 00:20:59,881
Not when you're mayor of a major city!

142
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,688
When will you start paying the cops
so they'll go back to work?

143
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,625
We're not a charity.

144
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,027
The city owes us over $37 million.

145
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,692
- You'll have to cut us some slack.
- A deadline's a deadline. Sorry.

146
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,338
How are we supposed to raise
that kind of money?

147
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,201
You aren't.

148
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:20,312
- What the hell is he talking about?
- We don't expect you to pay.

149
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,743
Let me refer you to our contract.

150
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,084
"In the event of default...

151
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,984
...OCP shall have the uncontested right
of foreclosure on all city assets. "

152
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,016
You signed this.

153
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,989
We miss one payment,
and you can foreclose?

154
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,993
We can and we will.

155
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,526
We're taking Detroit private.

156
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,269
So you deliberately undermined
our credit.

157
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,630
That was the easy part.

158
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,973
And you engineered the police strike.

159
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,371
You want Detroit to tear itself apart...

160
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,514
...so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation!

161
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,740
Do you know how many people
are dying?

162
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,178
You're murderers!

163
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,253
I'd advise you to say nothing further.
It might be...

164
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,650
...actionable.

165
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,415
It's bullshit!

166
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,760
- Bullshit, you senile, old bastard!
- All right, calm down.

167
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,021
- We better get out of here.
- I'm okay!

168
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,256
- Calm down. We better leave.
- I'm calm.

169
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,559
- Calm down. Easy.
- I'm okay.

170
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,065
All right, good.

171
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,227
- I'm in control. Everything is fine. It's okay.
- Relax.

172
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,331
I'm fine.

173
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,475
One last thing, gentlemen.

174
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:27,303
We will sue your asses.

175
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,342
Give it your best shot.

176
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:33,244
Fuck you, you old, senile bastard!
This is bullshit!

177
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,043
Fuck you!

178
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,720
- This is bullshit!
- Calm down.

179
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,559
I've been very patient, Johnson.
Five months.

180
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,498
- Who's that?
- That's Dr. Juliette Faxx.

181
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,191
Just moved up to head the
Attitude Adjustment team.

182
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:55,338
Five months. Ninety million dollars!

183
00:22:57,241 --> 00:23:01,233
- I want to see some results.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you what we have.

184
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:05,640
<i>OCP pioneered cyborg technology.</i>

185
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:08,477
<i>And now we take
a quantum leap forward.</i>

186
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:10,915
<i>State-of-the-art
destructive capabilities...</i>

187
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:15,820
<i>...commanded by a unique combination
of software and organic systems.</i>

188
00:23:15,992 --> 00:23:18,392
<i>In every way,
an improvement over the original.</i>

189
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:23,128
<i>It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you, Robocop 2.</i>

190
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:36,875
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

191
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:40,642
<i>Stop or I'll shoot.</i>

192
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:44,311
<i>Stop or I'll shoot.</i>

193
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:57,225
<i>OCP is proud to present the future
of urban pacification:</i>

194
00:23:57,432 --> 00:23:59,059
<i>Robocop 2.</i>

195
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,816
Ninety million.

196
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:24,088
They all go crazy.

197
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,624
Robots with emotional problems.

198
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:29,261
No, sir, not robots, cyborgs.

199
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:33,695
Cybernetic organisms. We use living human
tissue and that's our whole problem.

200
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:36,928
The candidates were all fine men,
respected police officers.

201
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:39,072
I reviewed their files myself.

202
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:43,676
Sir, police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes.

203
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:46,472
They're a physical bunch.
They're macho, body-proud.

204
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:50,105
Stripped of all that it's no wonder
they become suicidal.

205
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,479
Our one success was a cop.

206
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:55,121
Well, yes, Mr. Johnson. Alex Murphy.

207
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:58,258
Top of his class,
devout Irish Catholic, family man.

208
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:01,586
Everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty.

209
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,592
That's probably what kept him alive.

210
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:07,494
With due respect, Dr. Faxx,
your area of expertise is psychology.

211
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,032
Not robotics.

212
00:25:09,236 --> 00:25:12,296
There's no harm in hearing
the young lady out, is there?

213
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:13,700
No, sir.

214
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:17,832
Thank you, sir. I believe that Murphy's case
was unusual but not unique.

215
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:22,481
We can find someone else, someone
to whom the prospect might even be...

216
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:24,013
...desirable.

217
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:28,349
I've never met anyone who wanted
to be a robot.

218
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:32,488
It would require a screening process,
one I'd would be happy to supervise.

219
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:34,319
The cost would be negligible.

220
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:38,998
It would be a shame
to waste all the work that's been done.

221
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:40,996
It certainly would.

222
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:43,168
Go to it. Report to me directly.

223
00:25:44,036 --> 00:25:45,901
Yes, sir.

224
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,806
You could learn a thing or two
from that girl, Johnson.

225
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,481
- not for me!

226
00:25:56,682 --> 00:26:00,709
Decent pay to decent cops!

227
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:08,886
Union's got a list!
We ain't forgetting who you are!

228
00:26:09,094 --> 00:26:10,584
One at a time!

229
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:16,428
Please, one at a time.

230
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:22,465
Don't you know
what's going on out here?

231
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,374
It's the best we can do!

232
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:29,841
Hello, ladies!

233
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,851
They won't be fucking
with any more cops!

234
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,546
They won't be fucking
with nobody, man!

235
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,054
Hob. That's him.

236
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:23,833
Thank you.

237
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:29,428
Nuke me!

238
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,344
Go ahead. Take two.

239
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:38,405
There's plenty of Nuke to go around.

240
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,674
I've lost him.

241
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:43,614
You haven't been around in a while.

242
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,947
Go ahead. This one's on me.

243
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:48,521
Five degrees south-southwest.

244
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:50,888
There's the little darling.

245
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:52,455
Good eyes, Murphy.

246
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:54,720
Good as money can buy.

247
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,625
Ferdy, you got out.

248
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:59,167
Well, I'll tell Cain, okay?

249
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:12,007
Better have something
to give me this time, officer.

250
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:18,414
One cop per car.
Okay, these are the routes.

251
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,056
Three cars.

252
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:23,020
- One cop per car?
- That's right.

253
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:27,490
Sitting ducks. We set up three
snipers and that's all it takes.

254
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:31,422
- Pay the man.
- All right.

255
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,827
Thank you.

256
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,127
- You didn't count it.
- That's all right.

257
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,327
You should really count it, you know.

258
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:38,870
It's okay.

259
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:42,099
Give him something
to help him with his conscience.

260
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:47,678
No, that's all right. I don't really want it.

261
00:28:47,882 --> 00:28:50,180
Come on, Duffy. I know you need it.

262
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,563
Isn't this a school day?

263
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,337
Cops!

264
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:22,605
Oh, shit!

265
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:31,813
Oh, no.

266
00:29:50,376 --> 00:29:51,843
Freeze!

267
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:55,103
Turn around. Put your hands up.

268
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:11,752
Shit.

269
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:28,840
Officer Duffy, have a seat.

270
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:37,781
You look a little out of breath, bitch.

271
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:45,685
- You sold us out, Officer Duffy.
- What are you talking about, Murph?

272
00:30:45,864 --> 00:30:48,560
Where is Cain?

273
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:51,395
I don't know any Cain.

274
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:55,631
Where is Cain?

275
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,172
I don't know.

276
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,615
Where is Cain?!

277
00:31:07,818 --> 00:31:10,252
I told you, I don't know!

278
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,802
Where?

279
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,505
River Rouge. The old sludge plant.

280
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:42,081
You're a rotten cop.

281
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:35,853
Go.

282
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:50,287
- You.
- You want me?

283
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,120
Dead or alive.

284
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:55,359
Then one of us must die.

285
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,824
Dead, then.

286
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:23,421
Jesus...

287
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:25,652
...had days like this.

288
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:29,559
Hounded and attacked like a criminal.

289
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,967
But like him, I don't blame you.

290
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:35,728
They program you, and you do it.

291
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:41,104
- I will kill you.
- Oh, you just tried.

292
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:44,001
And...

293
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:45,476
...I forgive you.

294
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:00,050
Why'd you stop? You got it cracked.

295
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,448
I'm tired.

296
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,423
They say he's got a brain.
I want to see it.

297
00:38:10,263 --> 00:38:12,754
You think it was me that beat you?

298
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,897
It wasn't.

299
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,799
It was this.

300
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,916
It's too tough.

301
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:37,515
Try here at the joint.

302
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:44,690
Yeah!

303
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:50,795
Look at that!

304
00:39:00,446 --> 00:39:02,539
Come on. Cut it out.

305
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:07,443
How's it taste?

306
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,231
What the hell's going on?!

307
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,291
Man, just look at him.

308
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:28,236
Christ, he's been stripped.

309
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:44,952
Let's not get carried away here.
We're talking about a piece of equipment.

310
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:47,386
Don't tell me he can't suffer.

311
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:49,654
Just look at him.

312
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,390
It's electrical.

313
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:54,257
Bullshit.

314
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:57,395
I know every inch of him.
Every circuit.

315
00:39:57,601 --> 00:39:59,535
Every living nerve.

316
00:39:59,736 --> 00:40:03,672
His pain centers are alive.
They're lit up like Christmas trees.

317
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:06,741
The back-up generator's
just making him twitch.

318
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:08,434
He's suffering.

319
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,510
How long can he last?

320
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:12,375
No way of knowing.

321
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:15,215
Got him on minimal life support.

322
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:19,446
Keeping the brain going
with microshocks.

323
00:40:20,924 --> 00:40:25,293
- It's damn tricky. He could go anytime.
- Move. Move!

324
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:28,363
What's happening in here?

325
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:33,024
OCP is happening. These bastards
won't lift a finger to help him.

326
00:40:33,236 --> 00:40:36,103
This unit needs
millions of dollars in parts.

327
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:40,265
You can't expect authorization for that
kind of cash overnight. Be reasonable.

328
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:42,205
If you don't fix him, it's murder.

329
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:45,209
Settle down. I'm doing you
a favor by talking to you.

330
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:48,978
You son of a bitch. He's in hell.

331
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:53,653
Fix him!

332
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:56,649
We'll be in touch.

333
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,967
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest!

334
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,104
Did you see their faces?

335
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:12,399
"We're gonna throw away
the key, Duffy. "

336
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:16,641
The cops didn't give you trouble,
did they?

337
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:20,543
The usual shit from Reed.
They'll never prove anything.

338
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,311
Hey, want some?

339
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:25,884
Hey, I'm a minor.
Don't want to break any laws.

340
00:41:26,955 --> 00:41:28,479
Here, you take it.

341
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,954
God, I just love you guys!

342
00:41:35,664 --> 00:41:37,154
What happened?

343
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:39,399
Hey, where we going?

344
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:43,094
Hey, come on, guys.
This isn't funny, man.

345
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh, God, my head.

346
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:48,343
My head is killing me.

347
00:41:49,544 --> 00:41:51,341
Hey, man. What's...?

348
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:54,970
Hey, Cain! Hey, it's good to see you.

349
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:56,740
Thanks for getting me out.

350
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:00,886
- I can't get up.
- You noticed that one.

351
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:04,582
- Cain, I don't know what the kid told you...
- You told them, Duffy.

352
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:07,091
- You told them where we were.
- That's not true.

353
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:12,028
- We know all about it, Duffy.
- You think you're the only cop we have?

354
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:16,261
Oh, shit!

355
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:19,103
Cain. Cain, come on.
Man, I'm begging you, man!

356
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:21,605
Look, I'll do anything!

357
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:24,774
Okay. You're kidding, right?
Yeah, you're just kidding.

358
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:29,046
You scared me.
You taught me a lesson, man.

359
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,447
I'd never fuck with you,
because I really love you guys.

360
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,610
- I really do!
- Shut up!

361
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:39,087
I've been loyal. I know shit
that I still haven't even told you, Cain!

362
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,595
You deserve this, Duffy.
Cain might have been killed.

363
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:45,094
Okay. Okay.

364
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:47,959
Maybe you ought to have the kid leave.

365
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:52,430
- Why?
- What do you mean, "have the kid leave"?

366
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:57,266
That's a good touch. That's a good touch.
"Have the kid leave. "

367
00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:01,940
That's good. "Have the kid leave. " Why?

368
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,178
Come on. It's over.

369
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:09,784
Come on, Cain! Come on, man.
What are you doing?

370
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,982
Come on!

371
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:30,637
You said you were
just gonna scare him!

372
00:43:30,843 --> 00:43:32,811
Doesn't he look scared?

373
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,286
I can't believe you'd do this.

374
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:48,426
It hardly matters what you believe,
Mr. Schenk.

375
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,391
But these are criminals.
They're maniacs.

376
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:54,623
You're giving premature
value judgments.

377
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,403
All right, it may be true.
The subjects are socially misaligned.

378
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:02,539
Socially misaligned?
These are death row inmates!

379
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:06,302
And of no use to society. We need a
subject who'll welcome the power...

380
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,342
...the virtual immortality we offer.

381
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:12,312
Now, I really think this is a good place
to start looking.

382
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:18,081
- You're out of your mind.
- Is that your professional opinion?

383
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,156
Yes, goddamn it, it is! Yes!

384
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,728
And you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg.

385
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,762
We'd dearly miss you here.

386
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,334
You're the one that's gonna be
out of a job.

387
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,865
I'm going to take this directly
to Johnson.

388
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:40,702
He's just been waiting for an excuse
to get you fired.

389
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,249
Good morning, sir.

390
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,785
I'm sorry to bother you this early.

391
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:56,689
You seem agitated.

392
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:59,088
Frankly, I'm shocked.

393
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,188
Mr. Schenk just called.

394
00:45:01,364 --> 00:45:04,993
Dr. Faxx has begun screening
candidates for the Robocop 2 project...

395
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,865
So I understand. It's very exciting.

396
00:45:09,105 --> 00:45:12,040
She's screening psychotics, sir.
Murderers.

397
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,109
We aren't planning to build a toy,
Johnson.

398
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:16,710
Faxx knows what she's doing.

399
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:20,643
She's keeping Robocop offline.
It's a public-relations disaster.

400
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:24,709
You've got to learn to look
at the larger picture. The foreclosure.

401
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:26,980
You must know how important
that is to us.

402
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:30,990
With Robocop out of commission, the
chaos down there will increase...

403
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:33,889
...and the odds the city will fall
into our hands.

404
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:38,659
But a competent executive would find a way
to deal with the corporate image problem.

405
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:41,428
Couldn't agree with you more,
Mr. Johnson.

406
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:44,639
Fortunately, I have found a way.

407
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,332
Yes, Ms. Faxx and I have
already discussed it.

408
00:45:49,578 --> 00:45:53,207
I know you'll help
to implement her ideas.

409
00:45:53,582 --> 00:45:55,277
Of course, sir. Whatever I can do.

410
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:56,678
Anything else?

411
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,949
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

412
00:46:00,188 --> 00:46:02,816
Don't forget your shoes
on the way out.

413
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:38,481
He's my patient and critical.
I must stay with him.

414
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,490
We'll let you know when we need you.

415
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:43,721
Nobody on your staff has my experience
with him. You need me.

416
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:45,398
We don't need anybody.

417
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,830
"We. " Who the hell are "we"?
You're a lawyer who knows nothing!

418
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:51,732
You're exactly this far
from getting fired, babe.

419
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:54,135
Shyster!

420
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:56,970
He's one of mine.

421
00:46:57,678 --> 00:46:59,646
I want him back on his feet.

422
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:03,478
Maybe he will be,
or maybe we'll just sell the parts for scrap.

423
00:47:03,684 --> 00:47:05,345
That's up to us.

424
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:07,885
You see, Robocop's off warranty.

425
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:13,284
Robocop's command program...

426
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:16,860
...his set of directives...

427
00:47:17,064 --> 00:47:21,295
It determines his behavior.
It's time to update the program...

428
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,163
...and I would like to hear
from each one of you.

429
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:28,506
It's about time they asked us.

430
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:31,734
We're getting a lot of heat
from parents' groups.

431
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:34,175
Personally, I don't blame them.
I'm a parent.

432
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,443
All that destructive behavior.

433
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:39,643
He's become a role model
for our children.

434
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:42,412
- Now, what are we teaching them?
- You have a point.

435
00:47:42,622 --> 00:47:45,853
If he talked things out with people
instead of firing that gun.

436
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,858
Couldn't he take a little time
to address environmental issues?

437
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:51,087
What was that?

438
00:47:51,263 --> 00:47:53,629
He could speak out
on environmental issues.

439
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,323
Don't see any reason why not.

440
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:57,092
For all the shooting he does...

441
00:47:57,269 --> 00:48:00,533
...I've never once seen him take the time
to do anything nice...

442
00:48:01,306 --> 00:48:05,106
...like visit an orphanage.
- You're absolutely right.

443
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,834
Or help a cat out of a tree...

444
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,674
...or go door to door collecting
for the Red Cross...

445
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:14,545
...or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some Cub Scouts.

446
00:48:14,753 --> 00:48:20,055
Why, Mr. Johnson, that is wonderful.
Thank you so much.

447
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:28,473
- It's no good. The program isn't uploading.
- He's resisting.

448
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:29,879
There's too much data.

449
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:34,216
- No, it's him. Leave him to me, Schenk.
- I can't... It's not going to work!

450
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:37,352
You're wasting valuable time.

451
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,387
- Don't resist us.
- Let me up.

452
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:42,858
I must go.

453
00:48:44,732 --> 00:48:46,029
Go where?

454
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:51,764
Do what? Go dancing? Fall in love?
What is it you think you are?

455
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,001
Alex Murphy.

456
00:48:55,643 --> 00:48:56,974
That's a delusion.

457
00:48:57,445 --> 00:49:01,176
It's a glitch in your system.
Alex Murphy is dead.

458
00:49:01,382 --> 00:49:04,909
Take away the metal and wires,
you're just a couple chunks on a table.

459
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,178
You're not even a corpse.

460
00:49:09,657 --> 00:49:10,954
What are you?

461
00:49:13,494 --> 00:49:14,825
Respond.

462
00:49:15,964 --> 00:49:19,490
I am Officer Alex Murphy...

463
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,258
...Detroit Police Department.

464
00:49:21,468 --> 00:49:22,935
That won't do.

465
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:31,738
What are you?

466
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:38,082
Robocop. Crime Prevention Unit.

467
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,917
OCP.

468
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:42,751
Better. Much better.

469
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,922
I type it. You think it.

470
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:51,491
You type it. I think it.

471
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:54,932
What a wonderful opportunity
you represent.

472
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:57,868
Psychotherapy, it's such a...

473
00:49:58,772 --> 00:50:03,231
It's a slow, clumsy practice.
But with you this is so simple.

474
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:05,137
Direct.

475
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:13,680
You're lucky.

476
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,754
We can do in moments with you what
would take years with a human patient.

477
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:21,188
I'm really very lucky.

478
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:25,626
You're free. You're free from doubt.
Free from having to make painful choices.

479
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:29,494
I am free.

480
00:50:30,536 --> 00:50:32,163
He's ready.

481
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,369
Uploading command program.

482
00:50:38,878 --> 00:50:42,074
I am so glad we had this chance
to dialogue.

483
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:56,116
Look at you. It's like you're brand-new.

484
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:57,693
Thank you. Thank you.

485
00:50:57,862 --> 00:50:59,921
You really had us worried there, Murphy.

486
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,429
I'm touched.

487
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:03,328
Get this guy.

488
00:51:04,135 --> 00:51:05,568
He's touched.

489
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:10,564
That's enough. All of you,
back to your posts. Come on. Let's go.

490
00:51:14,346 --> 00:51:15,779
How you feeling, Murphy?

491
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,507
I'm just fine, Warren.
Thank you for asking.

492
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:21,875
Let's get you downstairs.

493
00:51:22,086 --> 00:51:25,453
I want to see what those amateurs
at OCP screwed up.

494
00:51:25,723 --> 00:51:29,022
Pity. It's a beautiful morning.

495
00:51:29,693 --> 00:51:31,285
Shame to waste it.

496
00:51:33,297 --> 00:51:35,458
- Ready for duty, partner?
- You betcha.

497
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:38,157
- Let's go.
- Nothing I'd rather do.

498
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:41,931
He sounds terrific.

499
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,663
Something's wrong.

500
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,258
Harder!

501
00:52:25,047 --> 00:52:27,914
It's Robo!
Everybody out the back door!

502
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,547
- It's locked!
- It won't open!

503
00:52:37,193 --> 00:52:39,161
Murph, wake up, will you?

504
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:49,032
Good morning.

505
00:52:54,176 --> 00:52:56,144
Come on, take him out.

506
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:03,408
I think we should talk.

507
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:09,350
What's with you, Murph?

508
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:19,096
- Where'd they go?
- "Where'd they go?"

509
00:53:19,835 --> 00:53:23,531
They're still here,
the little bastards!

510
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:26,837
Hands up! Let's go! Everybody up!

511
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:29,939
Move it. Up against the wall.

512
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:32,073
Let's go.

513
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:43,284
Hands on top of your heads.
Nobody move.

514
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:46,052
You are under arrest.

515
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,590
You have the right to remain silent.

516
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:52,288
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

517
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,230
...in a court of law.
- He's dead, Murphy.

518
00:53:55,436 --> 00:53:58,496
- You have the right...
- You're reading Miranda to a corpse!

519
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:06,468
I'm having trouble.

520
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:17,823
Oh, my.

521
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:21,558
This isn't very nice.

522
00:54:22,662 --> 00:54:25,756
Though you may think
you're having fun now...

523
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:29,264
...you only hurt the one you love.

524
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:32,529
Think of Mom and Dad.

525
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:35,071
What kind of lesson are
you teaching them?

526
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:38,502
And now, a word on nutrition.

527
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:40,679
Shit! He's fucked up!

528
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,443
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

529
00:54:44,683 --> 00:54:45,945
Let's go!

530
00:54:46,285 --> 00:54:47,684
The point is...

531
00:54:48,053 --> 00:54:50,248
...we all have to work.

532
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:52,751
I haven't finished.

533
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:56,224
Hit the gas, Murphy.

534
00:54:56,828 --> 00:54:59,695
The posted limit is 35.

535
00:54:59,898 --> 00:55:02,264
We should set an example, Anne.

536
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,934
Your hair looks lovely that way.

537
00:55:08,273 --> 00:55:10,901
It's OCP. They did something to you.

538
00:55:11,343 --> 00:55:12,571
I'm fine.

539
00:55:17,015 --> 00:55:19,381
Isn't the moon wonderful tonight?

540
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,543
It's still daytime.

541
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,050
It's the thought that counts.

542
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:28,257
Oh, Jesus, we're heading back
to the station. That's all there is to it.

543
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,532
What the hell are you doing?!

544
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,802
Waste makes haste...

545
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,981
...for time is fleeting.

546
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:55,078
A rolling stone is worth
two in the bush.

547
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:57,481
Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck!

548
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,185
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

549
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:04,855
You're nuts!

550
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,593
Murphy, come on, let's go.

551
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,965
Come on!

552
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,439
Back!

553
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,848
Thank you for not smoking.

554
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,190
Well, there it is. It's OCP.

555
00:56:46,902 --> 00:56:48,392
They screwed him up.

556
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:51,065
He must be going out of his mind.

557
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:53,705
It's not as if he can just say no.

558
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:58,903
They put all this nonsense
into his brain. He has to obey.

559
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:01,014
Take them out, all of them!

560
00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:03,707
Can't be done,
not with this equipment.

561
00:57:03,952 --> 00:57:07,046
Are you saying there's no way?
I can't believe that.

562
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:10,384
Sure, there are ways.
You can pull his cranial circuits.

563
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,890
Which would shut down
his life-support.

564
00:57:13,128 --> 00:57:16,325
You could run a few thousand volts
through him.

565
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:18,561
Probably kill him.

566
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,293
I'll get some help!

567
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:26,005
- Get him inside!
- Come on, move it!

568
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:28,302
- Come on!
- Don't touch him, he's hot!

569
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:30,069
Use your jackets.

570
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:31,474
Why'd he do that?

571
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:34,445
Fried himself to get rid
of OCP's crazy commands.

572
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:37,549
- Nice and easy.
- He weighs a ton.

573
00:58:44,728 --> 00:58:46,285
Out of the way! Move out!

574
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,128
- Think he's alive?
- I don't know. He's pretty hot.

575
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:55,598
Put me down.

576
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:02,770
All right. Come on, stand him up.

577
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:18,850
Are we cops?

578
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:20,790
What's bugging you, Murph?

579
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:22,588
Cain.

580
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:24,932
Cain's bugging me.

581
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:28,563
We have only just begun, my flock.

582
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,500
Soon we will expand from city to city.

583
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:34,140
The rich and poor alike
will know a paradise...

584
00:59:34,342 --> 00:59:37,311
...for every moment of their lives.

585
00:59:37,912 --> 00:59:40,676
This is a Nuke for every mood.

586
00:59:40,915 --> 00:59:42,473
We'll offer the opportunity...

587
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:46,312
...to control every aspect
of their emotional lives.

588
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:48,989
Here with the white noise
and black thunder...

589
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:52,648
...and the red ramrod
and the blue velvet.

590
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,590
Frank. The blue velvet.

591
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:57,628
I think it's ready, sir.

592
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:04,466
Thank you, Frank.

593
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:20,680
Frank. The Benzedrine's
got my teeth wiggling.

594
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:22,946
Cut it with scopolamine.

595
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,754
- Five mils per.
- Yes, sir.

596
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:30,361
Made in America.

597
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:33,362
Yeah. We're gonna make that
mean something again.

598
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:40,164
- Hey! Cops!
- What?

599
01:00:40,373 --> 01:00:41,670
Cops!

600
01:00:42,242 --> 01:00:45,575
And they ain't carrying
no picket signs!

601
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:48,306
They're going to kick somebody's ass!

602
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,092
Give me your hand, goddamn it!

603
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,129
Christ!

604
01:03:32,974 --> 01:03:34,635
Fuck.

605
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:37,738
Fuck!

606
01:03:38,446 --> 01:03:40,073
Get out!

607
01:03:40,515 --> 01:03:42,210
Bomb! Get down!

608
01:04:27,461 --> 01:04:29,622
You son of a bitch!

609
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:27,936
Five hundred million in cash.
Nuke money seized by police.

610
01:06:28,145 --> 01:06:32,138
But State Attorney Sphincter won't let
the bankrupt city government touch it.

611
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:36,509
Coming up next, threats from the police
union and cheers from the public...

612
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,123
...as Metro-North cops go back to work
and apprehend the Nuke lord, Cain...

613
01:06:41,325 --> 01:06:43,623
...who may not live to stand trial.

614
01:06:47,565 --> 01:06:51,365
They say 20 seconds
in the California sunshine...

615
01:06:51,902 --> 01:06:54,495
...is too much these days...

616
01:06:54,837 --> 01:06:57,237
...ever since we lost the ozone layer.

617
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,434
But that was before Sunblock 5000.

618
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:05,871
Just apply a pint...

619
01:07:06,082 --> 01:07:07,777
...to your body...

620
01:07:08,384 --> 01:07:11,182
...and you're good for hours.

621
01:07:12,889 --> 01:07:14,914
See you by the pool.

622
01:07:21,864 --> 01:07:24,424
<i>Sunblock 5000.</i>

623
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:28,034
<i>Protection for the new age.</i>

624
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:30,762
Subject is violently antisocial...

625
01:07:30,974 --> 01:07:34,465
...given to delusions of godhood.

626
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:38,368
And he's hopelessly addicted
to narcotics.

627
01:07:39,548 --> 01:07:42,039
Which offers us a simple
and infallible method...

628
01:07:42,251 --> 01:07:45,550
...of insuring his obedience.

629
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,226
You're perfect.

630
01:07:55,764 --> 01:07:57,254
I must have you.

631
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,362
What are you talking about?
It's like you don't even care!

632
01:08:04,573 --> 01:08:07,508
- Just do what I say, Angie!
- He'd want us to come for him!

633
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:11,270
Forget about it! It's not gonna happen!
I'm through arguing with you!

634
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,813
I'm not asking permission! Cain is
in the hospital, and we're getting him.

635
01:08:16,017 --> 01:08:19,612
You've really thought this out, haven't you?
What about the cops?

636
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,253
We've got guns!

637
01:08:21,422 --> 01:08:24,152
- Damn it, Hob, Cain needs us!
- Fuck Cain!

638
01:08:26,127 --> 01:08:29,187
- He'd kill you if he heard you.
- He's not gonna kill anybody!

639
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:32,491
- Shit, he's probably dead already.
- You just shut the hell up!

640
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:36,466
You mouth off like that again,
and it's no more Nuke for you, bitch.

641
01:08:38,706 --> 01:08:41,231
Damn it, Hob, you know that's not fair.

642
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:42,974
Now, come on.

643
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:46,712
- It's been a bad time.
- Sure has. You're really hurting.

644
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:48,647
Yeah, so I'm hurting.

645
01:08:48,849 --> 01:08:51,409
You're gonna get the shakes soon, Angie.

646
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,383
You got it bad.

647
01:08:55,588 --> 01:08:57,055
You little bastard.

648
01:09:00,593 --> 01:09:03,585
You just do what I tell you
from now on, Angie.

649
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:07,594
Start the motor and drive.

650
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:12,164
He'll kill you.

651
01:09:12,672 --> 01:09:14,105
He'll kill us both.

652
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:16,768
Fuck him.

653
01:09:31,624 --> 01:09:34,092
Oh, you're a mess.

654
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:38,762
I got good news for you.

655
01:09:38,931 --> 01:09:42,196
You're going to have a chance
for immortality.

656
01:09:42,634 --> 01:09:46,297
As long as nothing happens
to that lovely brain.

657
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:58,481
Dr. Weltman? It's Faxx.

658
01:09:58,684 --> 01:10:00,584
I'm afraid we lost our patient.

659
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,313
Yeah, he just expired.

660
01:10:03,655 --> 01:10:08,115
Contact the organ harvest team. We've got
six minutes before the brain's useless.

661
01:10:20,004 --> 01:10:21,596
Night.

662
01:10:33,785 --> 01:10:37,050
Come on. Let's move it.
We've only got five minutes.

663
01:10:38,356 --> 01:10:39,721
Lock it up.

664
01:10:45,897 --> 01:10:48,365
Move the screen in closer.
I can't read it.

665
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:54,103
- How'd we get this one?
- Well, Faxx found him.

666
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:56,972
He volunteered.

667
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:58,903
Volunteered?

668
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:00,770
Big-hearted guy.

669
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:03,502
Yeah, it's not the heart
we're after, though.

670
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:09,216
Speaking of hearts, how's Ilene?

671
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:11,614
Christ, does everybody know?

672
01:11:36,045 --> 01:11:38,104
All right, hold your breath.

673
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,975
Showtime.

674
01:11:44,053 --> 01:11:46,783
It's nice and clean in here.
There's no damage.

675
01:11:49,658 --> 01:11:51,455
Here we go.

676
01:11:51,627 --> 01:11:52,924
Easy.

677
01:11:54,663 --> 01:11:57,530
We got it. Here it comes.

678
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,301
- Thing of beauty.
- Excellent.

679
01:12:00,503 --> 01:12:03,631
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm hungry.

680
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:22,576
Thank you!

681
01:13:22,749 --> 01:13:24,011
Yes!

682
01:13:24,217 --> 01:13:25,775
Spider Baby Stalirski!

683
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:29,478
He's come out for Detroit,
and now you come out for him.

684
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,887
The lines are open,
waiting for your pledge.

685
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:35,027
If you want an honest government...

686
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:36,786
<i>...that works for you...</i>

687
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:42,263
<i>...I'm asking you to dig deep
into your pockets.</i>

688
01:13:42,535 --> 01:13:45,402
<i>I'm asking you to give...</i>

689
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,470
<i>...whatever you can spare!</i>

690
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,301
Where does that put us?

691
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:57,172
Hi. Yes, ma'am.

692
01:13:57,383 --> 01:13:59,248
Hello! This is Mayor Kuzak!

693
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,487
<i>Could you turn down your set, please?</i>

694
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:08,087
Your Honor...

695
01:14:08,594 --> 01:14:11,461
...I have some very good news for you.

696
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,688
I think...

697
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:16,197
...the city is saved.

698
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,102
Now...

699
01:14:19,304 --> 01:14:22,068
...you listen very carefully.

700
01:14:22,974 --> 01:14:25,943
It's no bluff.
Someone's shown up to bail the city out.

701
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:29,045
- A rival corporation.
- The mayor isn't saying.

702
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,876
And whoever it is is taking great
pains to keep their identity secret.

703
01:14:33,084 --> 01:14:36,884
They're paying in cash and they're not
moving the money through the banks.

704
01:14:37,088 --> 01:14:39,454
Thank you, councilman.

705
01:14:41,192 --> 01:14:42,853
That will be all.

706
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,625
You know, once you guys take over...

707
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:49,766
Your services to OCP
will be rewarded.

708
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:56,863
If the city can pay,
we'll be humiliated.

709
01:14:57,075 --> 01:15:00,566
It's worse than that. We've shifted
80 percent of our resources...

710
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:02,973
...to the urban pacification plan.

711
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:08,015
If we can't foreclose, public confidence
in OCP will plummet, so will our stock.

712
01:15:08,285 --> 01:15:09,547
Sir?

713
01:15:09,987 --> 01:15:11,284
If I may?

714
01:15:11,488 --> 01:15:13,319
There's another option.

715
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:18,352
We certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor.

716
01:15:18,729 --> 01:15:21,892
It all depends how far
we're willing to go.

717
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:25,893
If anything went wrong...

718
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:28,031
As I said, sir...

719
01:15:28,205 --> 01:15:30,503
...it all depends how far
we're willing to go.

720
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:34,269
We have no legal recourse.

721
01:15:44,053 --> 01:15:46,078
There must be no witnesses.

722
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:48,723
You've gone too far! Give me...

723
01:15:49,192 --> 01:15:50,489
Your blood pressure.

724
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,357
Get me fired if you want to.
You're not bringing illegal drugs to my lab!

725
01:15:54,564 --> 01:15:58,694
I'll do worse than get you fired.
Now leave me alone!

726
01:16:07,477 --> 01:16:10,002
Such terrible pain.

727
01:16:14,684 --> 01:16:16,845
You don't remember me.

728
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,317
But you do remember this, don't you?

729
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:29,664
And we have it.
All the Nuke you'll ever need.

730
01:16:36,538 --> 01:16:38,403
Not so fast.

731
01:16:38,673 --> 01:16:41,540
I need you to do something
for me first.

732
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:44,512
Then the pain stops.

733
01:16:47,215 --> 01:16:48,614
Good boy.

734
01:17:07,234 --> 01:17:10,863
I don't like this. I think we'd better
get out of here while we can.

735
01:17:11,071 --> 01:17:12,834
I know what I'm doing.

736
01:17:43,503 --> 01:17:46,131
If you have any cash,
put it in your shorts.

737
01:17:46,339 --> 01:17:48,398
That's just plain rude.

738
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,346
I wonder if any of you could help me.

739
01:18:03,556 --> 01:18:05,547
I'm looking for a Mr. Hob.

740
01:18:05,758 --> 01:18:07,020
So...

741
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:09,188
...how much you need?

742
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:11,628
Money, I mean.

743
01:18:11,865 --> 01:18:14,959
Well, our current debt to OCP is...

744
01:18:16,736 --> 01:18:20,103
$37,480,911 dollars.

745
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,803
Guess you're in some pretty deep shit.

746
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,102
We need all the help we can get,
young man.

747
01:18:25,277 --> 01:18:27,939
Tell you what. Put me down for 50,
just to make sure.

748
01:18:28,647 --> 01:18:32,083
- 50 cents, 50 dollars. That's cute.
- Don't be a queer.

749
01:18:33,185 --> 01:18:34,482
Fifty million.

750
01:18:34,686 --> 01:18:37,177
This is bullshit.
Let's get out of here.

751
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,345
Good God.

752
01:19:11,022 --> 01:19:12,512
Gentlemen?

753
01:19:12,924 --> 01:19:14,619
Well, will 50 do it?

754
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:20,121
Oh, yes. That'll do it.

755
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:22,731
- Don't you guys think that'll do it?
- Yeah.

756
01:19:22,934 --> 01:19:25,869
Fifty mil. That will do it.

757
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:28,901
- That'll do it.
- These people are criminals!

758
01:19:29,106 --> 01:19:30,471
Why do you have to label people?

759
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,871
- I hate labels!
- You shut up.

760
01:19:59,654 --> 01:20:02,555
We cannot capitulate
in the war on crime.

761
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:06,158
I'd be voted out of office.
I don't think anyone wants that.

762
01:20:06,361 --> 01:20:08,329
War on crime is fine with us.

763
01:20:08,896 --> 01:20:11,228
It's business we're talking about here.

764
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:13,764
Do you have any idea
how many people we employ?

765
01:20:13,968 --> 01:20:17,335
No. I never thought
about it like that.

766
01:20:17,505 --> 01:20:18,631
Sharp kid.

767
01:20:19,007 --> 01:20:20,235
So...

768
01:20:20,908 --> 01:20:22,431
...your war on crime...

769
01:20:22,643 --> 01:20:24,304
...you want to win it or what?

770
01:20:25,212 --> 01:20:27,737
We're the only chance you have.

771
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,711
Listen to him.

772
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:31,645
He's got it all worked out.

773
01:20:38,425 --> 01:20:39,824
Why do people do crimes?

774
01:20:41,194 --> 01:20:44,960
- Why? Drugs. People do drugs.
- Because they want drugs.

775
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:47,497
The kind that cost too much.

776
01:20:48,201 --> 01:20:51,034
Nuke gives high quality
at a cheap price.

777
01:20:51,238 --> 01:20:53,536
If you get off our backs,
we'll make it cheaper.

778
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:54,729
And safer.

779
01:20:54,941 --> 01:20:57,307
We don't shove our shit
down anybody's throat.

780
01:20:57,511 --> 01:21:01,072
And we don't advertise it
like they do with cigarettes or booze.

781
01:21:01,281 --> 01:21:03,111
So leave us alone...

782
01:21:03,315 --> 01:21:06,113
...and anybody who wants it gets it.

783
01:21:08,721 --> 01:21:10,279
So no more crimes.

784
01:21:10,623 --> 01:21:14,184
You get to be the mayor
who cleaned up Detroit.

785
01:21:21,701 --> 01:21:23,498
He's got a point.

786
01:21:24,704 --> 01:21:26,365
Don't you think he's got a point?

787
01:21:26,572 --> 01:21:28,540
Yeah, he's got a point.

788
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,513
What the hell is that?

789
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:46,785
Get out!

790
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:53,823
Marv, are...?

791
01:24:33,721 --> 01:24:35,382
Cain.

792
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:37,423
Oh, wow.

793
01:24:41,262 --> 01:24:43,059
You look great.

794
01:25:41,654 --> 01:25:44,521
It'll take some getting used to...

795
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:49,450
...but it'll be great, Cain.

796
01:28:51,305 --> 01:28:52,533
Lie still.

797
01:28:58,045 --> 01:29:01,640
- I'm cold.
- You are going into shock.

798
01:29:02,116 --> 01:29:04,744
I will call for a medical emergency unit.

799
01:29:05,052 --> 01:29:07,316
Wait. No.

800
01:29:09,156 --> 01:29:10,919
Don't leave me.

801
01:29:13,727 --> 01:29:15,718
I won't leave you.

802
01:29:20,867 --> 01:29:22,630
Who did this?

803
01:29:22,836 --> 01:29:24,599
It was big.

804
01:29:25,238 --> 01:29:27,536
Bigger than you.

805
01:29:28,108 --> 01:29:29,803
It was Cain.

806
01:29:31,645 --> 01:29:33,613
I'm gonna die.

807
01:29:36,049 --> 01:29:38,540
You know what that's like, don't you?

808
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:42,210
It really sucks.

809
01:29:48,528 --> 01:29:50,051
Yes.

810
01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:14,977
<i>Thirteen dead in what appears
to be a Nuke money massacre.</i>

811
01:30:15,187 --> 01:30:18,247
<i>Among the victims,
two city councilmen.</i>

812
01:30:18,457 --> 01:30:21,620
<i>Was the city trying to strike a deal
with the drug lords?</i>

813
01:30:21,827 --> 01:30:24,887
No comment!
I said, I have no comment!

814
01:30:25,097 --> 01:30:27,031
No comments on these allegations.

815
01:30:27,233 --> 01:30:30,224
These were men
who served this city tirelessly.

816
01:30:30,435 --> 01:30:34,633
However, I make a promise
to the people of Detroit City...

817
01:30:34,839 --> 01:30:38,036
...that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly!

818
01:30:38,243 --> 01:30:40,040
But, Mr. Mayor, what about...?

819
01:30:40,245 --> 01:30:42,736
I'm sorry. No more questions.

820
01:30:42,947 --> 01:30:44,972
<i>Our own Mayor Kuzak.</i>

821
01:30:45,183 --> 01:30:46,844
<i>Now let's go live to Jess.</i>

822
01:30:47,051 --> 01:30:52,079
And here it is, the Civic Centrum, OCP's
100-story gift to the Motor City.

823
01:30:52,257 --> 01:30:55,283
While debate continues
over OCP's hostile takeover...

824
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:58,054
...there's no denying
the mood down here is festive.

825
01:30:58,229 --> 01:31:01,721
Citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope...

826
01:31:01,933 --> 01:31:06,097
...that OCP will make good on its
promise of a better life in Detroit.

827
01:31:06,304 --> 01:31:08,329
- Press!
- Sorry, folks, media only.

828
01:31:08,506 --> 01:31:10,700
TV and press only.
You'll have to step back.

829
01:31:19,483 --> 01:31:20,711
There he is!

830
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,317
Can OCP bring industry
back to Detroit?

831
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:32,086
Does OCP own the city?
Will you hold elections?

832
01:31:32,296 --> 01:31:35,561
- Do we become OCP employees?
- Why not go to City Hall?

833
01:31:35,766 --> 01:31:37,256
Just a minute.

834
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:39,666
I'll answer that, young lady.

835
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:44,466
City Hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption.

836
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:45,869
You get that?

837
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:49,979
This magnificent structure will be the seat
of leadership for the new Detroit.

838
01:31:50,147 --> 01:31:53,411
And what better place
for a clean, fresh start?

839
01:31:53,616 --> 01:31:56,642
And so, people of the press...

840
01:31:56,852 --> 01:31:58,547
...city officials...

841
01:31:58,754 --> 01:32:01,951
...in a few minutes
Omni Consumer Products...

842
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:04,922
...and the troubled city of Detroit...

843
01:32:05,127 --> 01:32:08,927
...will join in a bold new venture.

844
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:11,122
Now I'd like to explain...

845
01:32:11,334 --> 01:32:13,199
...just what this will mean.

846
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:16,064
Sometimes we just
have to start over...

847
01:32:16,272 --> 01:32:17,603
...from scratch...

848
01:32:17,807 --> 01:32:19,638
...to make things right.

849
01:32:20,109 --> 01:32:23,476
And that's exactly
what we're going to do.

850
01:32:23,779 --> 01:32:26,247
We're going to build
a brand-new city...

851
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:28,713
...where Detroit now stands.

852
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:30,852
An example...

853
01:32:31,053 --> 01:32:32,679
...to the world.

854
01:32:53,641 --> 01:32:54,869
My friends...

855
01:32:55,043 --> 01:32:58,274
...welcome to our city
as it should be.

856
01:32:58,513 --> 01:33:02,347
And as it will be,
in the hands of responsible...

857
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:04,745
...private enterprise.

858
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,911
And a special welcome...

859
01:33:08,123 --> 01:33:11,456
...to Mayor Kuzak
and the outgoing administration.

860
01:33:11,659 --> 01:33:13,558
We're not going anywhere.

861
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:15,558
Your Honor.

862
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:21,025
You'll have to tear down a lot
of houses to make that.

863
01:33:21,235 --> 01:33:22,964
I mean, take away their homes!

864
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:26,196
We're going to raise towers
of glass and steel.

865
01:33:26,407 --> 01:33:30,173
Every citizen will have a living unit,
safe, secure, and clean.

866
01:33:30,377 --> 01:33:31,844
Now, please take your seat.

867
01:33:32,045 --> 01:33:34,172
Won't be much room for neighborhoods.

868
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:36,542
Not like the kind we all grew up in.

869
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:39,742
Today neighborhoods are places
where bad things happen.

870
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,148
Don't be nostalgic.

871
01:33:41,355 --> 01:33:44,415
What about democracy?
Nobody elected you.

872
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,991
Anyone can buy OCP stock...

873
01:33:47,194 --> 01:33:49,754
...and own a piece of our city.

874
01:33:50,731 --> 01:33:52,960
What could be more democratic
than that?

875
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:57,626
There's a lot of people in this town
that can't afford to buy your stock!

876
01:33:57,837 --> 01:33:59,998
And they won't let you
get away with this.

877
01:34:00,406 --> 01:34:02,374
You haven't been following the polls.

878
01:34:04,143 --> 01:34:05,701
Sit down.

879
01:34:06,946 --> 01:34:09,881
Sit down, mayor.

880
01:34:13,352 --> 01:34:15,946
About a year ago
we gave this city Robocop.

881
01:34:16,155 --> 01:34:18,453
I think he's worked out pretty well.

882
01:34:18,658 --> 01:34:20,956
But things have become
rougher out there.

883
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,095
And now we need
a law enforcement unit...

884
01:34:24,297 --> 01:34:26,561
...able to meet the enemy
on his own ground...

885
01:34:26,766 --> 01:34:29,564
...and carrying enough firepower...

886
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:32,169
...to get the job done.

887
01:34:36,908 --> 01:34:38,967
Ladies and gentlemen...

888
01:34:39,177 --> 01:34:40,906
...with great pleasure...

889
01:34:41,246 --> 01:34:42,736
...I give you...

890
01:34:42,948 --> 01:34:45,109
...Robocop 2.

891
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:57,094
- Those bastards are maniacs!
- What's the matter?

892
01:34:57,295 --> 01:35:00,196
I can't believe it.
It was them! They sent it!

893
01:35:00,398 --> 01:35:01,831
Sent what?

894
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:03,595
Nothing.

895
01:35:03,768 --> 01:35:06,168
There going to be a big call
for this unit.

896
01:35:06,371 --> 01:35:08,532
And we'll make him right here in Detroit.

897
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:11,675
That means jobs
we can all be proud of.

898
01:35:11,877 --> 01:35:14,003
And make "Made in America"...

899
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:16,543
...mean something again.

900
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:21,609
This single container...

901
01:35:21,819 --> 01:35:24,947
...holds enough Nuke
to addict a city block.

902
01:35:25,456 --> 01:35:28,220
A hundred of these
are produced every day...

903
01:35:28,392 --> 01:35:29,825
...and sent to sweatshops...

904
01:35:30,027 --> 01:35:32,962
...where urban slaves
prepare this poison...

905
01:35:33,163 --> 01:35:36,189
...for our friends, our loved ones,
our children.

906
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,924
Now, I say...

907
01:35:38,135 --> 01:35:41,400
...it's high time
we put an end to this plague.

908
01:35:41,605 --> 01:35:45,701
Robocop 2 will seek out
every laboratory...

909
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:49,073
...every dealer,
and rid our city of Nuke.

910
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:54,646
Yes.

911
01:35:54,851 --> 01:35:58,014
Things will be a lot quieter
with this boy around.

912
01:36:13,736 --> 01:36:16,034
- What's wrong with him?
- It's nothing.

913
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,730
- Nothing at all.
- Turn him off.

914
01:36:19,842 --> 01:36:21,070
I can't.

915
01:36:21,277 --> 01:36:23,541
Cain! Let's step outside.

916
01:36:26,316 --> 01:36:29,308
You! Get out of here!
You're obsolete!

917
01:36:29,519 --> 01:36:31,077
That thing is a killer!

918
01:36:31,254 --> 01:36:34,711
- It's not even armed! It's harmless!
- It's a killer, and I saw it!

919
01:36:50,872 --> 01:36:53,306
- Take her out of here! Now!
- Let me go!

920
01:37:14,429 --> 01:37:16,919
Behave yourselves!

921
01:38:04,477 --> 01:38:08,538
- What's the deal here?
- Christ knows. Sounds like a war in there.

922
01:39:22,253 --> 01:39:25,120
You're coming with me, Cain.

923
01:41:23,938 --> 01:41:25,428
There he is!

924
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:40,645
- All right, get back!
- Are you jealous of the replacement?

925
01:42:31,204 --> 01:42:34,037
This could look bad for OCP, Johnson.

926
01:42:34,641 --> 01:42:37,439
Scramble the best spin team we have.

927
01:43:47,112 --> 01:43:49,580
Ammo! Ammo!

928
01:44:09,733 --> 01:44:11,223
Get down!

929
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:34,218
Hold your fire!

930
01:44:34,825 --> 01:44:37,385
Hold your fire, damn it!

931
01:44:59,615 --> 01:45:01,048
Let's get him out of here.

932
01:45:03,352 --> 01:45:06,685
Watch his neck. He's hurt bad. Easy.

933
01:45:13,062 --> 01:45:14,290
Shit!

934
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,021
I gotta get back.

935
01:45:17,233 --> 01:45:19,258
Move it back! Move it back!

936
01:45:34,483 --> 01:45:36,883
Let's give him what he wants.

937
01:47:37,135 --> 01:47:38,898
Goodbye.

938
01:48:11,102 --> 01:48:13,434
It's serious trouble.
So many dead and wounded.

939
01:48:13,638 --> 01:48:15,629
There won't be trouble from the dead.

940
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,001
They'll have relatives. They always do.

941
01:48:18,209 --> 01:48:21,178
- It'll be a feeding frenzy.
- It's only money.

942
01:48:21,379 --> 01:48:23,404
- What about criminal proceedings?
- Well...

943
01:48:23,614 --> 01:48:27,448
...we're looking at major indictments, sir.
Prison terms.

944
01:48:27,618 --> 01:48:30,246
- What about me?
- You know we'll do whatever we can.

945
01:48:30,454 --> 01:48:32,285
- That's not good enough.
- Sir?

946
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:34,754
What if this was the work
of one individual?

947
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:38,861
A person who had her own agenda, wasn't
in sync with the goals of our company?

948
01:48:39,063 --> 01:48:41,793
Well, that usually works.

949
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,733
A woman who was not a team player.

950
01:48:44,934 --> 01:48:47,528
Who violated our trust.

951
01:48:48,738 --> 01:48:50,968
Easy, easy.

952
01:48:51,474 --> 01:48:52,964
Well...

953
01:48:53,176 --> 01:48:55,610
...we'd need some evidence
to support that.

954
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,543
Sir, whether it exists or not,
I know I can find it.

955
01:48:58,748 --> 01:49:01,740
She did choose the brain, sir.

956
01:49:03,253 --> 01:49:05,483
- Good thinking.
- Sir.

957
01:49:05,689 --> 01:49:07,816
Thank God you're all right.

958
01:49:08,024 --> 01:49:11,323
I was worried. I thought
it was going to hurt you.

959
01:49:11,528 --> 01:49:13,587
It's over. It's all over.

960
01:49:14,964 --> 01:49:16,454
I failed you.

961
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:20,500
Don't be hard on yourself.
Everything's going to be all right.

962
01:49:23,173 --> 01:49:27,268
Johnson, that business
we were talking about.

963
01:49:27,443 --> 01:49:29,343
Get right on it.

964
01:49:33,549 --> 01:49:35,016
Yes, sir.

965
01:49:39,588 --> 01:49:42,648
Just look at what they've done.
They are criminals.

966
01:49:42,825 --> 01:49:45,589
OCP won't own this city for long.
And I'll see to that.

967
01:49:45,794 --> 01:49:48,160
I'll take it to the streets
and the people.

968
01:49:48,364 --> 01:49:49,729
What has it come to?

969
01:49:49,932 --> 01:49:52,594
Businessmen can buy our rights
like stock?

970
01:49:52,801 --> 01:49:54,860
You don't realize what we're losing!

971
01:49:56,739 --> 01:49:58,934
- Right here, sir!
- Give us a statement!

972
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:02,838
Dozens are dead.
Is this your idea of a better life?

973
01:50:03,045 --> 01:50:06,878
- Was this an experiment of some kind?
- He was crazy. How did it happen?

974
01:50:07,081 --> 01:50:10,983
- Did you build it to take control?
- How do you account for this disaster?

975
01:50:11,185 --> 01:50:14,348
Will OCP make reparations
to the victims?

976
01:50:15,123 --> 01:50:17,557
That son of a bitch
is getting away with it.

977
01:50:17,759 --> 01:50:19,624
We can't even touch him.

978
01:50:21,129 --> 01:50:22,892
Patience, Lewis.

979
01:50:24,465 --> 01:50:26,365
We're only human.

980
01:50:27,365 --> 01:50:37,365
