1
00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:02,031
Yeah, good morning, Sergeant.

2
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:06,306
I've been trying to reach Detective Barrett
but he doesn't return my calls.

3
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,746
<i>Would you like to leave a message, sir?</i>

4
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:10,004
No, I wouldn't like to leave
another message.

5
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:11,985
Doesn't anyone down there give a damn?

6
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:13,952
Doesn't anyone down there
work for a living?

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,353
<i>Would you like to leave a message, sir?</i>

8
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:24,384
Don't you know
how important this is to me?

9
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:26,153
I know, I just...

10
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,457
You know, I thought
I was going to be able to work it out, but...

11
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:31,997
But I couldn't get
the money together, you know.

12
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,533
All my friends think I'm going to be there,
what am I going to tell them?

13
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:37,195
You know, I mean,
there's going to be other field trips.

14
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:39,238
<i>Not to The Lion King, there won't.</i>

15
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,002
Look, Dad, if you weren't going to pay for it,
you should have just said so

16
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:45,567
and saved me the humiliation of having
to tell all my friends that you're a loser.

17
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:21,637
<i>Hey, this is Hank. I must
be out, so leave a message at the beep.</i>

18
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,075
I know you're there. Pick up the phone.

19
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,982
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

20
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:32,826
<i>Pick up the fucking phone,
you fucking faggot.</i>

21
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:37,656
- Andy, I'm here.
- Where have you been?

22
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,299
Here. I called in sick.

23
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,971
And what the fuck were you doing
with that fucking asshole?

24
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,472
<i>- I was scared, all right? So I...
- I didn't say anything about</i>

25
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,568
A fucking gun, God damn it.

26
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,374
But we got to talk.

27
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,581
Andy.

28
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,945
<i>Meet me at Mooney's.</i>

29
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:58,879
You still can't get by? To see Mom?

30
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:02,684
- What am I going to say?
- Don't say anything. Fuck.

31
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:04,586
- Who else knows?
- Nobody.

32
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,592
- You didn't tell anyone?
- No.

33
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:08,889
- No one saw you talking with Bobby?
- No.

34
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:10,291
All right. Nobody saw you here?

35
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:13,628
No, come on, it was crowded, it was busy.
No, no.

36
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,497
- Did he rent the car with you?
- Did he what?

37
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:17,628
- Did he rent the fucking car with you?
- No, no, no.

38
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,296
All right, did you...

39
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:20,703
- You picked him up?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:23,470
- At his house.
- Did anyone see you there, at his house?

41
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,405
- Did anyone see you at his house?
- No, no.

42
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:27,879
- Nobody saw you at the house?
- No.

43
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,847
Did you clean the car?
Did you wipe the car down?

44
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:38,015
- Did you wipe the floor?
- Yeah, I totally... Totally, totally.

45
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:43,363
- Did you leave anything in the car?
- No, of course not.

46
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,706
We're probably okay.

47
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:02,573
If they don't connect the car to us,
we're probably okay.

48
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,644
That's what I was thinking.

49
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:09,015
- Go back to work, totally normal.
- Okay.

50
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,587
I'm so sorry, Andy. I'm sorry.

51
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,930
I don't think I can get through this.

52
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:22,161
Shut up.

53
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,204
- I loved her so much.
- Just shut the fuck up.

54
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:31,708
If he had to take somebody out,
why couldn't it have been him?

55
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:49,893
<i>One new message.</i>

56
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:53,865
<i>This is Mike Steuben calling
from Auto Rent for Mr. Henry Hanson.</i>

57
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,829
<i>Mr. Hanson, you returned a car
the other day.</i>

58
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>It seems you forgot
some personal items in it.</i>

59
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,610
<i>Please give me a call at 555-2649
and ask for Mike Steuben.</i>

60
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:09,043
<i>Again, that number is 555-2649. Thank you.</i>

61
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,142
<i>End of messages.</i>

62
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,620
Okay. God.

63
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:22,587
Okay.

64
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:28,498
<i>Hello, you've reached
Auto Rent. Our office is currently closed.</i>

65
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:29,626
<i>- Our business hours...
- Fuck.</i>

66
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:30,931
Fuck!

67
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,267
Okay. All right. It's okay, it's okay.

68
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:51,449
Excuse me?

69
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,352
That's right, sir. It's $255 plus tax.

70
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,726
But for an additional $17,
I could upgrade you to a luxury.

71
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,422
Or, for... Yes.

72
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,961
No, that's right,
the mid-size is $255 plus tax.

73
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,635
Unless you'd like to upgrade to an SUV,
which I could offer you for 29...

74
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,368
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?
No, I know, I'm just looking for Mike.

75
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:11,239
So, would you like to upgrade to the SUV?

76
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,209
No, no. No, mid-size is fine, sir.

77
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:15,908
No.

78
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,916
Thank you for calling.

79
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:18,985
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:20,581
Good morning, how can I help you, sir?

81
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,851
Yeah, I got a message from Mike Steuben.

82
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,688
Apparently I left something in a vehicle

83
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:29,160
that I returned last Saturday.
I think it was a CD.

84
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,027
Oh, well, you would talk
to Mr. Steuben, then. He's the manager.

85
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:34,191
Yeah, I know, so could I speak with him?

86
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,269
I'm sorry, he's not here.
You'll have to come back.

87
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,462
- When will he be in?
- I don't...

88
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:40,972
He won't be in at all today.

89
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:43,441
Well then, maybe you can help me.

90
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:45,011
Oh, no. Sorry, sir.

91
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,579
I'm sorry, excuse me.

92
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,011
- Do you think...
- I'm sorry.

93
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,675
- Will he be in tomorrow?
- Yes, Auto Rent.

94
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:51,910
No, I...

95
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,780
No, I didn't say that, sir.
That's not up to me.

96
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,079
No.

97
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:59,853
Excuse me, can I get a beer? Thanks.

98
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,592
That's the guy, that's him.

99
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,173
Yo, buddy.

100
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,946
- This guy?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,811
You were with Bobby Lasorda, Saturday?

102
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,010
- What?
- I asked you a fucking question.

103
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,652
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,683
- What's your name?
- I'm Hank.

105
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,385
- Hank what?
- You know what?

106
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,827
Come. Why don't you... Let's go.

107
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:39,431
Follow me, we can talk over here.

108
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:46,098
- Come on. Have a seat.
- Is this all right?

109
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,730
Yeah, this is perfect.

110
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,509
So...

111
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,873
What's the deal, huh?

112
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:59,783
- My sister is quite all of a sudden a widow.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,287
She says you and Bobby had some work.

114
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:03,612
Bobby said it was work.

115
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:06,750
Work that involved him
getting shot and killed,

116
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,021
but not you getting shot and killed.

117
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,188
No, I just got him the car.

118
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:13,664
- I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck does that mean?

119
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:17,703
Well, Bobby said that he needed
to rent a car, but that he...

120
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:21,297
This was Friday night

121
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:25,174
and he didn't have a credit card,
so I told him that I would rent him a car.

122
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,215
And I owed him some money.
You know. That's it, I swear. It's...

123
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:31,049
I'm so sorry.

124
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:33,645
- So what? You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

125
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:36,348
Because if Bobby wanted a car,
he would have fucking stolen one.

126
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:39,551
Chris, go fucking wait outside.

127
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,355
Let me handle this.

128
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:51,702
You got a driver's license?

129
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,298
- A what?
- You know, the...

130
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,172
The driver's license you show
when you rent a car?

131
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:58,403
Yeah.

132
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,173
- Let me see it.
- Yeah.

133
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,840
All right, sure.

134
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,475
Here.

135
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:10,051
- Henry Hanson.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:12,121
This is your address, right?

137
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,022
Yeah, sure.

138
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,594
<i>I'm going to be straight with you, chico.</i>

139
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:20,092
<i>You mind if I call you chico?</i>

140
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,827
People call me Hank.

141
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,062
Bobby was a piece of shit.

142
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:26,605
I know it, you know it. That's not the point.

143
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:31,610
The point is that piece of shit
was the father of my sister's child.

144
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,176
And he was paying the bills.

145
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,441
And now he's dead.

146
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,882
And I'm thinking,
who's going to pay all these bills?

147
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:41,215
I'm so sorry.

148
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,346
<i>Sorry ain't going to pay the bills, chico.</i>

149
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,947
I know, I know.

150
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,618
We need to negotiate a settlement,
so make me an offer.

151
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:53,865
Ten grand, done. It's 10 grand.
I consider us even.

152
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,958
If you don't like 10, I can make it 15.

153
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:58,560
- No.
- My sister wants me to kill you.

154
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:02,365
Or I could call the cops.

155
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:04,767
But I don't like cops.

156
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:07,938
And the cops ain't going to pay
my sister's bills.

157
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:12,080
So, I think a settlement
is pretty fair all-around.

158
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,088
<i>- Day after tomorrow, chico.
- Can I?</i>

159
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:21,024
Here. 8:00.

160
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,828
You fucking crazy?

161
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,963
I was hoping that you had
something left over from the settlement.

162
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:38,635
Lend you money? You owe me $2,000.

163
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,906
Shocked to shit you'd even ask.

164
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:42,174
Martha,

165
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:47,150
I'm in serious trouble.

166
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:50,180
I don't give a shit
what kind of trouble you're in.

167
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,555
The next time you show up here,
better be to pay me.

168
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,632
Listen, tell Danielle I love her.

169
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:04,469
If you loved her,
you'd pay her fucking child support.

170
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:45,004
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a wonderful person.

171
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,977
Wonderful woman.

172
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:49,114
She was a wonderful woman.

173
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:53,085
God bless you.

174
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,923
There's no way I can make this scene, Andy.

175
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,122
He was always such a baby.

176
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,269
<i>Yeah.</i>

177
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:24,407
- Hey, Gina.
- I can't really talk right now.

178
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,380
<i>Andy needs me. I got to go.</i>

179
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:27,919
Gina, Gina.

180
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:37,890
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?

181
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,432
- Not till noon, can I help you?
- Yeah, yeah.

182
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:44,436
I returned a car last Saturday
and I guess I forgot something.

183
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,165
Hanson?

184
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:50,101
That's right, Hanson.
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure it was a CD.

185
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,404
Hang on.

186
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:56,947
Here we go, Mr. Hanson.

187
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:00,419
- Great.
- I just need to see some ID.

188
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,482
Yeah, you know, I...

189
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,158
I lost my license.

190
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:13,599
You have a credit card,
the one you used to rent the car with?

191
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,502
Yeah.

192
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,965
- Yeah, this one.
- All right.

193
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:22,870
Okay, great.

194
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,308
- Thank you.
- Take care.

195
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,910
<i>- Hello?
- It's me.</i>

196
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,784
Andy, Jesus! Fuck, man, we got problems.

197
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,509
<i>Hi, Andy.
This is Jake at the office.</i>

198
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,613
Really sorry to bother you,
but the auditors are coming tomorrow.

199
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:45,517
<i>They've noticed a few problems.</i>

200
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,958
<i>It's pretty urgent,
so give a call when you get this.</i>

201
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:54,492
You're going to have to get
some sleep tonight.

202
00:14:57,904 --> 00:15:00,600
Have you given any thought to the store?

203
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,978
I mean, you're going to have to give it
some consideration. It's just gonna...

204
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:18,483
I could open it up for you, you know,
while you're at the hospital.

205
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,385
A few hours a day.

206
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,293
So people know you're still there.

207
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:29,498
I should burn the goddamn place down.

208
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,106
Andy, this is Jake.

209
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:45,343
Now I hope you're checking your messages
because we have a real mess here.

210
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,286
<i>The auditors say that
there's two terminated employees</i>

211
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,323
<i>from your department still drawing checks.</i>

212
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:54,416
<i>And there's something about
unpaid O ASDI taxes.</i>

213
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,921
<i>Look, you need to call us...</i>

214
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:03,830
I got to go to the office tomorrow.

215
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:07,998
There's a problem.
I'll go in the morning. I should be back later.

216
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:09,368
Okay?

217
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:12,104
His mother's dying,
and he's going back to work.

218
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,236
Yes!

219
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,848
Pick up the phone.

220
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,757
I know you're there,
pick up the phone, you fucking faggot.

221
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,457
Andy, I'm here.

222
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,165
What are you doing here?
You don't have an appointment.

223
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,533
- You know the deal, you can't just show up.
- I know, I'm sorry.

224
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:41,038
Come back in an hour, tonic water.

225
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,242
My mom's dying.

226
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:21,006
Bummer.

227
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,714
Next time, make an appointment.

228
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:43,729
Stupid piece of shit.

229
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:46,397
Stop talking to me like that.

230
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:49,669
What the fuck?

231
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:53,603
Are you going to get tough?

232
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:56,246
Are you going to hurt me?

233
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:00,616
Why was there even a gun?

234
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,881
Why was there even a fucking gun?

235
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:06,356
I gave you all the information you needed.
Why was Bobby Lasorda even there?

236
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:09,758
- Why the fuck?
- I didn't think I could do it alone.

237
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,565
I should fucking kill you.

238
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:34,547
How are we going to fix it
so your shit don't fall on my shoes?

239
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:39,086
So, think now, who else knows?

240
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,319
"Commit her body to the earth.

241
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:45,398
"For we are dust and to dust we shall return.

242
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:50,594
"But the Lord Jesus will change
our mortal bodies to be like his in glory.

243
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:54,168
"So let us commend our sister to the Lord. "

244
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,024
She hated it when I barbecued.

245
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:47,253
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be
what you wanted me to be.

246
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:51,954
I've never been very good
at talking about feelings

247
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,899
or showing you
that kind of affection or support.

248
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:00,768
I'm sorry.

249
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:05,273
I wasn't able to be the father you wanted.

250
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:10,845
But I guess I wanted you
to be better than me.

251
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:13,781
And I thought that if I push...

252
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:23,488
It may not mean anything to you,
but I want you to know

253
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:27,055
that I really do love you.

254
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:32,361
And I'm... I'm sorry.

255
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,667
I'm just so sorry.

256
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,677
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be
the son you wanted.

257
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:44,574
You did the best you could.

258
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:48,319
Still, yeah.

259
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:51,150
Manage to seem to still like Hank.

260
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:54,122
He was a lot more of a fuck-up than I was.

261
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,227
- He was the baby.
- Yeah.

262
00:20:57,163 --> 00:21:00,132
- He needed us more.
- Yeah, he needed you more.

263
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:02,994
You sure it wasn't his cute looks
or his puppiness?

264
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,534
You were the first.

265
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:10,000
The first always has it rougher.

266
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,701
Yeah, so I'm told.

267
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:18,979
You know, the four of you,
I never felt like I was part of the club.

268
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:23,115
Beautiful birds of a feather.

269
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,756
You sure I'm your son?

270
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:46,844
Gina and I have got to get back to the city.

271
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:12,831
Andy?

272
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:16,605
My dad.

273
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,378
Andy.

274
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:25,575
Okay.

275
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,285
Why don't we pull over?

276
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:47,967
My dad.

277
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:54,506
Oh, God.

278
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:02,649
It's not fair! It's not fair!

279
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,824
All my life I've been afraid
of becoming like him. All my life!

280
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:10,725
All my life with you, and it's not fair.

281
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:14,230
He can't just say he's sorry
and make it all go away.

282
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:15,323
It's too late.

283
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,800
It's not that easy!

284
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:20,270
It's not fair! It's not fucking fair!

285
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:26,343
No, Dad.

286
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:29,939
Oh, God!

287
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,281
He can't do that!

288
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:42,619
Andy.

289
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:56,575
Andy.

290
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:26,470
- I'll be back in a bit.
- Where are you going?

291
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:31,239
I'll be back soon, I just got to...
I got to deal with some stuff.

292
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,902
What's going on?

293
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,013
What if you come home and I'm not here?

294
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,247
You got some place you got to be?

295
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,027
Your boss called
and he wants you to call him right away.

296
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:09,468
Are you in trouble?

297
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:15,604
They just miss me.

298
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:19,912
Where are you going?

299
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,393
Something has to change.

300
00:26:30,196 --> 00:26:33,688
- What do you mean?
- I mean that this just isn't working.

301
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:37,567
- What's not working?
- The life that we have.

302
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:42,832
It was really bad before Rio
and now it's even worse.

303
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:46,207
You never tell me anything
that's going on anymore.

304
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:47,973
I don't understand.

305
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,675
Neither do I.

306
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:55,386
What was that in the car yesterday?

307
00:26:58,758 --> 00:27:00,157
I could help.

308
00:27:01,594 --> 00:27:03,391
I don't need any help.

309
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:35,116
Do you realize
that I've been having an affair?

310
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:41,226
What's that supposed to mean?

311
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:44,392
Means I've been fucking another guy.

312
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:50,639
Every Thursday, me and your brother, Hank.
We get together and we fuck.

313
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:54,470
Not only that, he loves me.

314
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:58,948
And he still finds me attractive.

315
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,484
All the time.

316
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,618
Not just on vacation.

317
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:09,487
Hank?

318
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:15,063
Yeah, Hank.

319
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:20,866
Aren't you gonna say anything?

320
00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:27,446
Are you gonna get angry?

321
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:45,058
- Where are you gonna go?
- I was just gonna go to my mother's.

322
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:47,924
How're you gonna get there?

323
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,835
I was gonna take a cab.

324
00:28:58,644 --> 00:29:01,909
I could really use some, some money.

325
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:10,478
I'll go to the bank later.

326
00:29:11,424 --> 00:29:12,482
Here.

327
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:45,549
<i>Hi, you've reached Gina and Andy.
Leave a message.</i>

328
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,922
<i>Please hang up
and try your call...</i>

329
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,881
Come on.

330
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:14,769
Last person I ever thought I'd see again
as long as I lived.

331
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:16,341
Charlie Hanson.

332
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:21,109
You're still a crook?

333
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:23,938
You come all this way to insult me?

334
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:30,785
Did you hear anything about a holdup
at the Westchester Shopping Mall?

335
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,051
What would I know about Westchester?

336
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:37,595
That's just for upstanding citizens
such as yourself.

337
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:38,822
Have you heard anything?

338
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:42,332
Why would I hear anything about anything?
I sell diamonds.

339
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:44,163
- And fence them.
- Never!

340
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:50,106
Did you hear of a young guy
called Bobby Lasorda?

341
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:51,870
Wrong tree, Charlie.

342
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:56,278
A couple of punks shot my wife in a holdup.
She's dead.

343
00:32:58,584 --> 00:32:59,846
I'm sorry.

344
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:02,216
I don't give a shit
about your little side business,

345
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:05,347
I don't care about anything anymore,

346
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:08,153
except finding the guy who did this.

347
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,057
Do you know anything?

348
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,630
I remember when Charlie Hanson
started out on the streets.

349
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:21,070
Young and cocky, good cutter.
A long time ago, Charlie.

350
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:25,438
You always hated my guts,
you called me a crook,

351
00:33:25,544 --> 00:33:28,172
but you didn't know shit
about how the world works,

352
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,613
or what some people will do for money.

353
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,312
I guess,

354
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:37,051
now you know, Charlie.

355
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:47,659
The world is an evil place, Charlie.

356
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:54,268
Some of us make money off of that,
and others get destroyed.

357
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,039
He walked in here,

358
00:33:58,143 --> 00:34:00,839
he looks a little bit like you, Charlie.

359
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:05,549
He walked in here and I almost knew him,
right off the bat.

360
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:27,131
<i>Hello.</i>

361
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,529
It's me.

362
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:32,770
<i>Andy, Jesus, man, we got problems.</i>

363
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:35,307
What do you mean, problems?

364
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:39,578
Bobby's girlfriend's
got a fucking brother, okay.

365
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:41,050
And the guy is blackmailing me, all right.

366
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:46,356
<i>He said he's gonna go to the cops, all right,
or kill me if I don't pay him $10,000.</i>

367
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,484
All right, all right.

368
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:52,063
Just stay there, I'll be right over,
I'll figure something out.

369
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:56,066
<i>- Andy, this guy isn't fucking around.
- All right, I'll figure something out.</i>

370
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:30,188
Andy, Jake needs to see you.

371
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:31,990
They're all in the conference room
with the IRS guys.

372
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:33,086
They're going all the way back

373
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:35,291
- through your accounts.
- Just fuck 'em, I got to go to my dad's.

374
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,465
I'm gonna have to tell them you were here.

375
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:33,118
For God's sake, say something.

376
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:41,957
Okay.

377
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,630
We're in trouble.

378
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:51,403
The worst trouble imaginable.
You're aware of that, right?

379
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:55,609
So, why don't we try and fix it?

380
00:37:57,249 --> 00:38:01,117
There's almost no choice,
but you're gonna have to follow my lead.

381
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,381
No questions, no hesitations.

382
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:07,054
I've done that before, all right,
and that's how come I'm standing here,

383
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,990
with my life going down the fucking toilet.

384
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:10,561
Fuck you, fuck you, I'll do it alone.

385
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,926
You can sit here and wait till you go to jail

386
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,896
and take it up the ass
for the rest of your fucking life.

387
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,730
Let's do it already, what's your idea?

388
00:38:19,938 --> 00:38:21,929
Sorry, what's your idea?

389
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,714
What's Bobby's girlfriend's name?

390
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:33,651
Chris. Yeah, Chris.

391
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:35,379
Chris.

392
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:39,218
Call Chris, tell her to get her brother
over to her apartment.

393
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,054
- What for?
- We'll meet him.

394
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:46,025
He figures we owe him $10,000,
we have to resolve it.

395
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:47,928
Resolve it how?

396
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,465
Play it by ear, see what happens,
maybe we pay him.

397
00:38:53,572 --> 00:38:56,040
He's never gonna let us off the hook.

398
00:38:56,141 --> 00:39:00,237
All right, we're gonna be paying him back
for the rest of our lives.

399
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:05,646
Hey, you finally figured out
something for yourself.

400
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,587
Let's just get the money, see what happens.

401
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:15,322
Where are we gonna get $10,000?

402
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:19,427
No, that might be easier.

403
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:25,867
Call Chris.

404
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,532
Taxi!

405
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,897
Andy, Jesus Christ! You're gonna kill him.

406
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:33,998
Come on.

407
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:37,208
Shit.

408
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:58,828
Come on.

409
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:04,101
Hold the bag. Hold out the fucking bag!

410
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:08,266
Hold it open like this. Hold it open like that!

411
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:10,102
I got it, I got it.

412
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,115
- Oh, shit, do you want these?
- Just put it in the bag!

413
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:20,013
Put it in the bag!

414
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:24,355
- Out.
- Got it.

415
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:40,734
Oh, my God, Andy.

416
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:42,329
- Did you touch anything?
- Did you go crazy?

417
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,772
- Did you touch anything?
- Are you fucking nuts?

418
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,810
- Did you touch anything?
- Wait, you didn't have to kill him, all right.

419
00:41:46,912 --> 00:41:49,745
He's not gonna go to the cops. All right?
He's a drug dealer.

420
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:53,112
Yeah, I guess he'll just go
to some other dealers and suppliers

421
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,812
and that's all we need,
is 10 South Americans chasing us

422
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:58,947
for the rest of our lives.
Did you touch anything?

423
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:00,684
I don't think so.

424
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:03,158
- You don't think so?
- I don't think so, no!

425
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:06,128
- No, I didn't touch anything!
- Think, God damn it, you think!

426
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:08,131
- I don't... I don't like this, Andy!
- Did you touch anything?

427
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:10,599
- I don't like...
- Shut up! Shut up!

428
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:16,232
- Did you touch anything?
- No.

429
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:18,707
Are we good?

430
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:21,105
Let's go.

431
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,205
<i>You got the money, chico?</i>

432
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:26,243
I don't like wasted trips.

433
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:31,572
You don't look happy.

434
00:43:31,683 --> 00:43:33,617
Mind if I call you groucho?

435
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:36,545
No, I don't mind.

436
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:45,056
Like what you're seeing?
- Yeah, a lot.

437
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:48,499
- Stand up. Stand up!
- All right, all right.

438
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,626
- Turn around.
- All right, all right, all right.

439
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,607
So how we gonna do this?

440
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:00,777
Gladly pay you the money, got plenty of it.

441
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:03,211
How do we know you're not gonna bleed us
for the next couple of months?

442
00:44:03,315 --> 00:44:05,715
I just want enough to take care of Chris.

443
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:09,651
That's nice, my brother
wouldn't take care of me like that.

444
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:12,985
Hey, what do you say, Chris,
should I trust this guy?

445
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,617
- Yes.
- Speak up. What?

446
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:18,161
Yes.

447
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:19,855
I don't think so.

448
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,464
No, Andy, don't, don't, don't...

449
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:28,671
- What did you say?
- No, you can't do that, I won't let you.

450
00:44:28,773 --> 00:44:30,104
- You won't let me?
- No, no more,

451
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,608
you kill her, you're gonna have to kill me.

452
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,440
Not such a bad idea.

453
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:40,411
You know, in fact, it's a pretty good one.

454
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:51,027
You know I know.

455
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:54,789
What do you know?

456
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:58,095
I know.

457
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:05,439
I'm sorry.

458
00:45:06,011 --> 00:45:07,706
I fucked it all up.

459
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,746
Just do it.

460
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,744
Do it.

461
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:17,015
Go ahead.

462
00:45:18,523 --> 00:45:19,683
Come on.

463
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:23,318
You'd be doing me a favor.

464
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:27,859
Come on.

465
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:44,849
Get the hell out of here.

466
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,124
Get the hell out of here! Go!

467
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:02,324
Go!

468
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:18,309
Hank! Hank!

469
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:41,034
<i>Move out of the way,

Hi, Mr. Hanson.

472
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:52,368
Stick your head in. If he's awake now,

473
00:47:52,477 --> 00:47:55,002
you can spend
a couple of minutes with him.

474
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:38,422
Dad?

475
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:45,385
I never meant to hurt her.

476
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:47,960
I just needed money.

477
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:53,603
There wasn't supposed to be any gun.

478
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:58,602
She wasn't supposed to be in the store.
Everything just went wrong.

479
00:49:06,618 --> 00:49:08,609
It's okay, Andy.

480
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:17,691
It's okay.

481
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:14,443
Nurse, the heart monitor
cut out for a second.

482
00:50:14,552 --> 00:50:18,113
It does that, don't worry.
If it happens again, just press reset.

483
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:47,578
Dad.

484
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:44,960
Nurse!
