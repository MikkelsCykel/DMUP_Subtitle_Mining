00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,270
- How was it?
- I played this game. Called "Stay Alive."

2
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Seriously, man,
the sickest shit since Fatal Frame.

3
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,710
It was creepy. Really creepy.

4
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,900
Are you gonna make it over here? Can you
come over? You wanna come over?

5
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
Dude, look, I'll come up this weekend,
we'll burn it solid.

6
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Late.

7
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,700
- Shit, man. Don't you knock?
- All right. Whoops.

8
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,900
- Shut the door, perv.
- I found you guys in the game. You got it good.

9
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,400
We haven't played for hours.

10
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,800
OK.

11
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
This is not real. Don't freak.

12
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,700
- Hello?

13
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,100
- Hello?

14
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Rex?

15
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Sarah?

16
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
Rex! No!

17
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,500
Please!

18
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh!

19
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,400
- That was fast.
- Hi. How are you?

20
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,920
- Did you take care of the marina report?
- I was just about to.

21
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
Oh, don't bother.

22
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,400
He wants to see you right away,
and he's in one of his moods.

23
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,700
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Oh, merci. darling.

24
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,500
Hi.

25
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,300
- I was just gonna...
- Over a month.

26
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,530
That's how long
I've been working on this.

27
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,100
Right? That's, uh...

28
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,800
That's 100... that's 100 hours.

29
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry. I'll finish
the marina report as soon as possible.

30
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,270
The ma... The what?

31
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,180
- Marina report?
- Yeah.

32
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,860
Oh, man.

33
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
Hm.

34
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
- Hutch.
- What?

35
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,000
You know what?
Have a seat. Enjoy yourself. OK?

36
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,400
All right, listen to me now, OK? I hired you
for one reason, and one reason only.

37
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Now, the walk-through says
I dump the ammo and the boss dies.

38
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,700
I'm sorry. We're not still talking
about Silent Hill 4, are we?

39
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,220
Yes.

40
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,700
OK. Damn. All right. Uh... I don't know what
else to tell you. You got the hyperblaster?

41
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,450
Do I look like an asshole?
Yes, I have the hyperblaster.

42
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Right, OK. Yeah, dump it.

43
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,300
I mean, it's got unlimited ammo,
nullifies the... Hey, can I get tomorrow off?

44
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,450
Let me think about that.

45
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,700
No, no, no.
I need it to get to the final boss.

46
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600
Beat her up.
It's the way God intended.

47
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,300
You know, Hutch, if you put as much effort
into clerking as you did into gaming,

48
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,920
you could end up like me someday.
You know that, right?

49
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
OK.

50
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,700
All right, you can take tomorrow.
How do I do it?

51
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,200
It's easier to kill her
without the blaster.

52
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,200
So lose it right before going down the
stairs. She'll die on her own. Game over.

53
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,200
All right. OK. Hey, man,
are you hip to this PDA sex thing?

54
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,000
- I haven't got into that.
- You've got a phone call, Hutch.

55
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,300
Thank you.

56
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,800
I think that's a vegetable.

57
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Hello?

58
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
What?

59
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Oh, Hutch. I'm so glad that you came.
It means so much to me.

60
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Today we lay to rest
Loomis Crowley...

61
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,700
- Did you just take a picture of me?
- I did.

62
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,300
There are so many crying faces
at this funeral and you seem the saddest,

63
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
but you weren't crying,

64
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,700
so I took a picture.

65
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,000
- You and Loomis must have been close.
- Yeah, we were close.

66
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,400
I mean, we were so close, but...
Did you know Loomis?

67
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,900
Kinda.

68
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,100
I grew up with Sarah back in Georgia. I was
supposed to hang out with her that night.

69
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,850
Really? Yeah, so was I.

70
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,600
I always thought I'd be taking pictures
on her wedding day, not her funeral.

71
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,500
- Looks like you're up.
- Emma. Hi.

72
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,250
- Hi.
- How are you? God, look at you.

73
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,000
You're so grown-up.
How are you doing?

74
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm OK. Um, here.

75
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,700
This is your brother's bag.
You don't want this?

76
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,400
No. Mom and Dad won't let me play those
video games. They were gonna toss 'em.

77
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,300
You know, they're too violent.
Besides, he would want you to have 'em.

78
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,500
Come here. Take care, all right?

79
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
OK.

80
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,100
Here. If you need to talk,
that's my number.

81
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
- Hey, sunshine.
- Hey.

82
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,000
Didn't think you'd be back so soon.

83
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Give us a kiss.

84
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,800
- Sorry, Hutch. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to believe you know.

85
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,100
Tragedy, Hutch.
I tell you, bro, first your parents, now this.

86
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,200
God dealt the straws
and gave you a short one, man.

87
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
You know, Phin,
the problem with your mouth

88
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,900
is that stupid insensitive shit
comes out of it. You're an idiot.

89
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,700
Be strong - that's all I'm saying. You know
what I mean, bro? You're a rock. I love you.

90
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,500
- I love you too.
- Alright. Who talks to their brother like that anyway?

91
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,100
- Somebody with an idiot for a brother.
- Oh, my God, you're a terrible person.

92
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,800
So, do they know what happened yet?

93
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,200
All I know that he is urm.. He was murdered -
him and two of his friends.

94
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
- That's awful.
- What's in the bag?

95
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
- Erm.. Video games, pictures, crap like that.
- From Loomis?

96
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Yeah.

97
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,400
- No shit! Is this you two?
- Yeah.

98
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,300
Look at that.

99
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,000
Lighter works.

100
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,300
- Gorgeous.
- Dude, you can keep that if you like it.

101
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,100
- I'm sorry, Hutch.
- You must have been adopted.

102
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,300
Thank you, Loomis.

103
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,000
- So he was a real gamer, huh?
- Yeah.

104
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,600
- Any good titles in the bag?
- I'm not sure. Check it out.

105
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Goddamn, y'all.

106
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,700
Stay Alive? Never heard of it.

107
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,100
Yeah, that was the game
he was playing out the night he died.

108
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
He asked me to come over and play.
I totally blew him off.

109
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,000
- Hutch, come on. You didn't know.
- I know. It's just...

110
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,900
- How'd he get his hands on it?
- He did some beta-testing.

111
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I beta-tested for a while. It's awesome
at first, then it's goddamn monotonous.

112
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,100
- Let's burn a round for Loomis.
- Are you an idiot?

113
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,400
I just told you, that'd become weird.
That was the last thing he was doing before he died.

114
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Hey, sack up, bro.

115
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If Loomis was indeed testing this game,
that means it is barely legal.

116
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah, this could be nice.

117
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
- Hey.
- Jesus Christ!

118
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,200
Can Hutch come out and play?

119
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,600
Swink,
you scared the crap out of me, man.

120
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,100
Why, yes, I'd love to come in.
Thank you for asking.

121
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
I wanna make sure we're all set up.

122
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,300
So, uh...

123
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,300
I'm sorry, you know,
about your friend and all.

124
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,500
It...

125
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
stinks.

126
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,200
Thanks, man.
Look, it's all good. No worries.

127
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,800
It'll be good to hang out with you guys,
get my mind off things.

128
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Hey. Ooh.

129
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,200
Dollface, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

130
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Hey, you made it.
October, fellas, this is Abigail.

131
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,200
She's kind of a friend of Loomis's.
She's gonna hang out for a while.

132
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,600
- What's up, mama?
- What's up? I gotta pee.

133
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,700
- Oh, yeah. It's right down the hallway.
- Oh, sorry.

134
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
- All right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

135
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Girl has got body karate going on.

136
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,800
Anyone who says size doesn't matter
never played a third-person shooter.

137
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,000
You're a whore.

138
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,500
- Here.
- No.

139
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,900
- What did you say?
- Hey.

140
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,700
God, that thing is gay.
And it smells.

141
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,200
- Don't worry, I'll get your back.
- Sweet Sebastian Bach, I wanna play.

142
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,300
- Bossman hooking up?
- Miller, you signed in? You there?

143
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,700
Yeah, I'm here.

144
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,200
Yeah now, Loretta called my wife, told her
I got caught up in a partner meeting.

145
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,300
All right, guys. Enough chatter.
The name of this game is Stay Alive.

146
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,900
We don't know much else,
other than we're not supposed to have it.

147
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Sit back down.

148
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Bro!

149
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Let's do it.

150
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,200
- Dude.
- Put your hands on it.

151
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
- Disgusting.
- Touch it.

152
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,600
She's stubborn.
Isn't letting me get to the game.

153
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Maybe you're supposed to read
that prayer right there.

154
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
- Just a thought.
- Voice-activated? No way.

155
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,000
- That's next-generation technology.
- OK.

156
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,600
"Come to me, clouds."

157
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
Whoa.

158
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,300
- What?
- It's... it's like a séance or...

159
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Can we skip this bullshit cinematic
foreplay? I wanna butter this muffin.

160
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,800
- OK. Let's go. Everybody say this, right?
- OK.

161
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,700
"Come to me, clouds.

162
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,900
"May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.

163
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,500
"Let the cover of night bear witness
and destroy those who resist

164
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,100
"so they shall harm me not.

165
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,400
"Let the blood of many cleanse me,

166
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,800
"preserving beauty eternal, I pray you."

167
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,000
Welcome.
If you're listening to this.

168
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
it means you've made a grave mistake.

169
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
You spoke the words.
and soon you will die for it.

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,400
At this very moment. the evil of this place
courses through your veins.

171
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,700
You have been marked for death.

172
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Your choice has brought you here.

173
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
to Gerouge Plantation.

174
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
200 years ago.
Countess Elizabeth Bathory

175
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,400
opened Gerouge
as a finishing school for young...

176
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,700
- Gerouge.
- You've heard of it?

177
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Yeah. Do you remember that grandma used to tell
us if we didn't get home before dark, we'd get taken off...

178
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,600
Yeah, but do you remember Grandma
used to wear panties on the outside?

179
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,800
Seriously, though, I know this, guys.
I've heard this story.

180
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,200
What happened to those girls
was so depraved

181
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,500
that all accounts were stricken
from public record.

182
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,400
The evil of Gerouge has been reborn.

183
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,000
Your salvation lies
beyond the gates of this plantation.

184
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,700
Your only chance is this:

185
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,100
uncover the horrible truth about
Gerouge Plantation and stop the evil.

186
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
But. in order to do that.

187
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,200
you must stay alive.

188
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
- My God.
- I'm starting to get a little creeped out.

189
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
- Sh!
- Shut the hell up.

190
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,500
- Where the hell are you going bro?
- Just trying to figure it out man.

191
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
- What is that?
- Whoa.

192
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,300
- You guys feel them?
- Hell, yeah. Feel it in my pants, baby.

193
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
- Must mean we're close to something.
- Or something's close to us.

194
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
God, you better pull your weapon, bro.

195
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,800
- How about somebody do something. Swink?
- No, I'm good.

196
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,500
How do you kill her?
She's already dead. Look out!

197
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,100
When fear cripples you.
when death's shadow surrounds you.

198
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,330
drop a rose.

199
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,800
It will help you stay alive.

200
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,700
Right. It'll give us a chance
to escape ghosts we can't face.

201
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Yeah, the undead can't cross
the twig of a wild rose.

202
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,800
That is what you learn when you read
too much goth chick-lit. Lay off the incense.

203
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,500
And the game's fun,
but it kind of moves along at a snail's pace.

204
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,800
Left, go left, go left.
Left! On your left! On you left!

205
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,200
Left! Left!
Goddamn it, you noob!

206
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,800
OK. and you eat my nails.
and you eat my nails.

207
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,400
Go round the mausoleum. man.
Nice. And eat this.

208
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,450
Come on! Sweet Jesus, these dead bitches
are coming out in droves.

209
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,450
Miller. the Bathory tomb.
in front of you.

210
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,900
Do not close the door. man.
Do not close the door. No! Oh. my God!

211
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Hello, Mumsy.

212
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,300
- Whoa, whoa. What's that?
- What's... where?

213
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,770
- Right there. Is something in that wardrobe?
- Oh, nice eye.

214
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,850
Thank you.

215
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,100
- Congrats, Abs.
- It's a secret room or something.

216
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,500
- Is that a diary?
- Yeah.

217
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,200
The one from the beginning
with the prayer in it.

218
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,800
- Miller. are you OK?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

219
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,100
Are you in those tunnels again man? Because there is
actually no action down there. The doors are locked.

220
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Well, they're open now.
You know, I'm exploring, tearing shit up.

221
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,100
- Ownin' fools.
- "Ownin' fools"?

222
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,000
- I'm telling you, my controller is vibrating.
- You'd better drop a rose.

223
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Now I'm out of... I'm out of...
I'm out of goddamn roses, man.

224
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,600
- Tell us what you see before you book it.
- Some sort of sick torture room or...

225
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,000
God, man.
I just saw a flash of dead girls, or...

226
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,800
Goddammit, man.

227
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,600
- Man, she got me.
- One of the girls?

228
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,500
Some woman, and I think it was the dame
from the painting. You know, that countess.

229
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
You know, I didn't even
get a chance to fight her, man.

230
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,100
-OK, where's the torture chamber?
- I went through a secret entrance you know.

231
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,500
Hey, are you gonna try
and get back in the game?

232
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Well...

233
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Hey, is somebody out there?

234
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,600
- Miller. who are you talking to man?
- I don't know.

235
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,400
Probably some goddamn rent-a-cop
trying to scare the shit out of the living.

236
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,200
You know what they say. You play
the game too long, you start seeing shit.

237
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,700
- You know, or have seizures.
- Games could cause seizures.

238
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,300
Perceptive of reality on the other hand,
has yielded some very interesting studies.

239
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,900
- And you've read them all?
- I have. It seems the longer you play,

240
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,700
the more your mind
perceives the game world to be a reality.

241
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,400
You know, It's really interesting, but it's only a theory of course.
But then there's is, you know, retinal memory, which...

242
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,800
That is so fascinating, sweetie,
but I'm feeling like we should call it a night.

243
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,200
Yeah, some of us
have gotta be at work.

244
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,600
All right.
Miller. you can rejoin us. then.

245
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,300
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll check my schedule.

246
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Thanks again for hanging, you guys.
I really needed it.

247
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,400
- To Loomis.
- To Loomis.

248
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
To Loomis.

249
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,600
All right. OK. OK.

250
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Perceptive reality.

251
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,000
- Hutch!
- Loretta.

252
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,600
- What's going on? What's going on?

253
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,800
- What's going on?
- It's Miller.

254
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
Miller?

255
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,520
Miller. Miller!

256
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,100
Hey, it's a crime scene.
You have to clear out son.

257
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,800
Can I get a damn curtain over here?

258
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,250
- You don't understand, I just spoke to him a few hours ago.
- Whoa. A few hours ago?

259
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,500
- Get off me.
- All right, buddy. Come on. Come on.

260
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,100
Thanks.

261
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,600
I know this kind of thing ain't easy, son.
I'm gonna try to be quick about it.

262
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,000
You were here
with Mr. Banks last night?

263
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,200
Uh, no. I was at my house.
We were playing a video game.

264
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,900
Oh.

265
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,400
His wife said that he was working late.

266
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, sorry. What I meant was, he was
playing from here and I was at my place.

267
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,100
- Just the two of you?
- I was with four friends, you know. We were online.

268
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Uh-huh.

269
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,300
- Make sure we get those names.
- Roger that.

270
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,800
- Do you live close by?
- Yeah, uptown. Off Magazine.

271
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Oh, yeah?
That's only ten minutes away.

272
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,700
You see, those figures could place you
at the scene of the crime.

273
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Charlie, chill.

274
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,200
- I just wanna know what happened to him all right?.
- All right, now.

275
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,300
OK, if you ever need to give me a call,

276
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,800
my name is Detective Thibodeaux.

277
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,900
I may need to speak with you again.

278
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And I'm sorry about your friend.

279
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,200
Thanks.

280
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
All right.

281
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,900
Sweet shit! Get a load of this!

282
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,000
I think I've found bossman's body.

283
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,600
- Oh, God!
- That's off-putting.

284
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,200
- Didn't you just say Miller was stabbed today Hutch?
- Man, I can't look at this.

285
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,200
Yeah, I think I'll have to quit
hanging around with you, brother.

286
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,100
Hutch I'm sorry. Phin, if you had any less sense,
you'd be half a penny.

287
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,450
Now shut the goddamn game up.

288
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
- Well, because we found Miller's body in it?
- It is a horror survival game.

289
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,000
I mean I hate to be a dick, but I think
you guys are overreacting just a little bit.

290
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
- Would you show some respect, man?
- Respect?

291
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,600
You pay respect to gamers by gaming,
so let's boot it up. To Miller.

292
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,500
- You know what suck man. You're not playing for Miller or Loomis.
- You didn't even know those guys, right?

293
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,500
Listen, If you wanna curl up in the fetal position
for the rest of the day, its fine, but don't expect me to.

294
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,800
And, as for you,
I just met you yesterday, so kiss my ass.

295
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,100
- Phin!
- What?

296
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,800
Look, why don't you guys get out of here
and let me play in peace?

297
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,600
Peace.

298
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,000
Hey, take it easy.

299
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,000
Are you OK?

301
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,200
- Yeah, I'm just having a hard time, you know?
- Yeah.

302
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,200
So Abigail, what's your story?
We don't know much about you,

303
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,800
other than you can't game for shit.

304
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
Well, I grew up in Georgia.

305
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,400
My dad's an architect and my mom's
a kindergarten schoolteacher.

306
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm going to Princeton in the fall.

307
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,900
Sounds like you've got
a perfect little family back home.

308
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't know about perfect.

309
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,600
- Uh...
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

310
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,200
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

311
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,700
I've got a thing with fire.
It's a long story. No big deal.

312
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,100
What's up?

313
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Finding Miller's body in the game...

314
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Look, I'm no gamer, but there are only so
many ways you could die in a video game.

315
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,300
It's all just really bad timing.

316
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,000
Not really. In a sense, the timing is bad
because he overresponds to deaths.

317
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:28,100
When you think about it, the coincidence of finding Miller's
game body and his real body was perfect.

318
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:28,900
That's why we're freaked out.

319
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,200
It's better in single player anyway.

320
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,000
Dickheads.

321
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,400
All right, Countess, let's go.

322
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
There you are.
Oh, you hate mirrors. I forgot.

323
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,900
- Oh... You can't break this one.

324
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,600
Maybe timing had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was inevitable.

325
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,100
Possible homicidal replication
on a sociopathic level.

326
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
Where are you going?

327
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Loomis said his friends were playing that
video game the night they died, hours before, Now Miller.

328
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,400
What are the chances of all of them being
murdered right after playing that video game?

329
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Jesus, if Phineus is playing that game...

330
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,700
- Hutch! Come on, honey. You've gotta relax.
- It's just bad timing.

331
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
But, Swink said
what about timing has nothing to do with it.

332
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,600
Did I say that? I have a penchant
for big theories. Don't listen to me.

333
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,900
Phineus!
Phin! Oh, my God!

334
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:37,500
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm pulling this bitch. What's it look like?

335
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,800
- What if Loomis and Miller...
- Was more than a coincidence?

336
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,400
They both played the game
and then they died, so...

337
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,200
obviously the video game
killed them, right?

338
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,300
- Are you serious, man? Listen to yourself.
- Phin.

339
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,300
I was ready to bite it anyway.
Hey Swink, check this mirror I found.

340
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,400
I flipped it over. The back works like a mirror,
but it won't break like the other one.

341
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,500
I think it's made out of polished silver something.
I don't know. You guys don't have one.

342
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,000
We all know you've been through a lot, and you know I love you,
but you're freaking everybody out now.

343
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,500
I know. Yeah.

344
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,700
Nice.

345
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,200
"No distinguishing marks."

346
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,200
Had a broken banister.

347
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
"Adjoined twin blades."

348
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,500
This is why I'm missing
my G4techTV weekend wrap-up?

349
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,000
Hot sugar.
I though we had this conversation.

350
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,400
Call me crazy, call me paranoid,
I don't give a shit. Just look at this.

351
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,100
- Why isn't Phineus showing?
- He said he'd be here, so he'll be here.

352
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,700
OK. So we all saw
that Miller was stabbed to death.

353
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,200
The cops think he was stabbed
with shears. Loomis's friends too.

354
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,100
Sarah - her body was drained of blood.

355
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,400
The police report said Loomis's neck
was broken, and he was hung in the game.

356
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,000
They all died
the same way they died in the game.

357
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
This can't just be some coincidence.

358
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,100
I don't like this at all.

359
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,300
I think you're right.

360
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,500
You know I told you I heard
the story of Gerouge from my grandma?

361
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,600
This Elizabeth Bathory chick
was sick and twisted - and very real.

362
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,600
Guys, every detail of this game
is based on her real life.

363
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The tower,
the cemetery, the torture chamber.

364
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,200
She'd hunt for victims in a black carriage.

365
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,500
She'd gut them with silver shears. The
shattered mirrors, why were they broken?

366
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,300
She couldn't stand to see herself get old.
All facts.

367
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,900
All I care about is finding out
what happened to Miller and Loomis,

368
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and you are not helping.

369
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,800
As punishment, they walled the bitch up
in her tower alive - and here's the kicker.

370
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,300
The last thing she said
was that one day she'd be back.

371
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,700
So what if she's back and killing us
one by one after we die in the game?

372
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,000
This is insane. Listen to yourself.

373
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,300
You don't want to listen to me right now, fine. All
I care about is: Where the hell is Phineus?

374
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:48,300
# Close your eyes,
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams

375
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,900
# Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams

376
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Funky.

377
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,400
Is anybody out there?

378
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,700
Phin, are you OK?

379
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,500
- Yeah. I'm awesome.
- Phin, it's Hutch. Where are you?

380
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,700
I was on my way,
but my whip got stuck out on River Road.

381
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,000
- I'm just south of Binky's Adult Store man.
- I'll drive.

382
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,800
- Who's that? Abigail?
- Yeah.

383
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,000
- What's up, mama?
- What's up?

384
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,500
Hey Swink, when you were talking
about perceptive reality trash,

385
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,000
were you talking about
hearing or seeing things, or both man?

386
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,100
Both. It's bizarre.
You see, retinally speaking...

387
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,400
Shut up. Listen, I've not tripped out like this
since I ate that matzo ball at Bible camp brother.

388
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,300
Hey. Phin. hang on.
We're coming to get you.

389
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,600
Let's go.

390
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,500
Phin you didn't die in the game remember.
I'll be right there.

391
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,500
That's right!
I didn't die in the game, baby.

392
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Hey.

393
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,500
Wait a minute.
In the game, she only comes at night.

394
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
Is anybody out there?

395
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,100
OK, we're close.
Look for his car.

396
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,600
Stop, stop, stop. Stop! Wait.

397
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Phin!

398
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Phin.

399
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,000
Jesus. Phineus died
exactly the same way he died in the game.

400
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,600
Need to tell me something?

401
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,600
This is...

402
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,300
This is gonna sound crazy,

403
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,200
but this game, Stay Alive,

404
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,200
is about the Gerouge Plantation

405
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,500
and a woman, Elizabeth Bathory.

406
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,100
- I think I know that ghost story, yeah.
- OK. Phineus was run over by a carriage in the game.

407
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Miller... Miller died the same way
he died in the game too.

408
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,900
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, kid.
- I got this game last week from a friend.

409
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,300
Him and two of his friends were murdered
the same way they died in the game.

410
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
Now, explain that.

411
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,300
Right.

412
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,700
That's the Crowley case,
over in Church Point.

413
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,600
And you lived with that family, right?
After what happened with your folks?

414
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,700
Yeah.

415
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,700
You talked to that Crowley kid
the night he was murdered?

416
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,200
You know I did, Detective.

417
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,800
- You see, technically, anybody can hack into...
- Shut up.

418
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
Let's take a walk.

419
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,000
- Let's see what got you so scared.
- I don't think you...

420
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
Shut up.

421
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,700
- How do you do this thing?
- You have to read that.

422
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
All right.

423
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,500
"Come to me, clouds.
May you rise as..."

424
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,900
There must be a connection.

425
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,500
- Oh, yeah, there is, Hutch.
- Look, I already told you...

426
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,900
I'm telling you.
Friend or no friend, game or no game,

427
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,900
next time I see you on a crime scene,
I'm gonna be force to take you in.

428
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I wonder how you would feel
if that was your friend.

429
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,900
- Someone you cared about, Detective.
- I would let the cops do their job.

430
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Hey!

431
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,900
Hey, don't play that game.

432
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,300
Hey! Come on! Come on.

433
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,500
I just think
it would be better if no one plays.

434
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,100
Well, I guest I can see how at your tender age,
something like this game might put scare on you.

435
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,900
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.

436
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,000
All right.

437
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,800
I'm gonna look into this,
but you're gonna have to go home, Hutch.

438
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
Why don't you lock that kid up?

439
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Well if I just rode him up on a carriage
and mowed down the girl's brother?

440
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,000
Well, this video game business
sounds like bullshit.

441
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,900
That's great.
That's just really stupendous.

442
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,300
I know it! We all know it!
Something's happening, something bad!

443
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,300
Swink, shut the hell up!

444
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,000
You're not helping, man.

445
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,100
Why did you have to bring that game
into our lives, Hutch?

446
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,400
Why?

447
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,400
October.

448
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,300
My brother was all that I had.

449
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,300
That kid meant everything to me,
and now he's gone.

450
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
October...

451
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,800
I didn't know.

452
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,900
I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

453
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,500
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

454
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,000
Neither do I.

455
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,900
So we have to do something.

456
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,500
Hutch, I want you to go and find out
everything you can about this game.

457
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,800
OK. I can start with Loomis's house.

458
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,700
I need to stay with Swink
and take care of things for Phin.

459
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Are you OK?
Are you sure you're up to this?

460
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,100
Hutch, somebody ran my brother down
in a horse-drawn carriage.

461
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,500
I'm gonna find whoever did it
and hurt them.

462
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,400
OK.

463
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,700
Abigail, I want you to stay with Hutch.
But if anything happens to him...

464
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,500
I don't play that game,
not for a second.

465
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,400
Hey, a little help here?

466
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,900
Let me guess.
Your wife and kids are driving you nuts.

467
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,600
Need something to take the edge off?
Something with a high frag-count.

468
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,300
- Do I look 12, man?
- I take it you don't play, then.

469
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,700
Well, I retired after I won
the Greater Louisiana Q*bert tournament actually.

470
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,300
- Oh, Q*bert, huh? Great.
- Yeah, listen.

471
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,500
I need information
on a horror game called Stay Alive.

472
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,200
Stay Alive? Never heard of it.

473
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,000
Maybe it's underground.

474
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,800
- Do you know who made it?
- Some basehead in his mom's attic.

475
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,400
You know, a game is just an extension
of the mind that created it.

476
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,900
You wouldn't play a game develop
by Charlie Manson won't you?.

477
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,900
No. Probably not.

478
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,100
Maybe you already have.

479
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Yeah. Yeah, I got nothing.

480
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,500
It's probably some sort of
underground game or something.

481
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,600
Yeah, right.
Hey, so, listen,

482
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,600
I'll talk to you in a little bit,
all right?

483
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,200
I think she must have left
at least one of these windows open.

484
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,700
- How do you know that?
- I had told you I lived with the Crowleys for a while.

485
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,500
Oh, yeah.

486
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:47,300
Yeah, it was like, you know,
Loomis's house just felt like home.

487
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Yeah, I used to kinda run here
when things got, you know...

488
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,000
- You don't have to talk about it.
- No.

489
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,400
My dad went a little nuts,

490
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,300
thought my mom was sleeping around,
which she wasn't.

491
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,100
He figured
if she wasn't gonna be with him,

492
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
she wouldn't be with anybody,

493
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,300
so he set the place on fire.

494
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,300
Just torched it.

495
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,300
The firemen barely got me out alive,
but my mom...

496
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
She was still in bed
when they found her.

497
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,400
I tell myself if I'd been a little older
or a little braver or whatever,

498
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,900
I would've stopped him.

499
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,200
I didn't move.

500
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,900
When he gets out, he'll be 76.

501
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,500
Ain't nothing like family.

502
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,700
This window's open.

503
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,000
So that's why you're scared of fire?

504
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,100
That's why I hate fire.

505
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,100
- I'll go around to the front door, OK?
- OK.

506
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
Come on.
Come on, come on.

507
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,300
Let's check out Loomis's room.

508
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,500
What could we find in here
that the cops haven't already found?

509
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,200
They didn't know where to look.

510
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
Huh.

511
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,430
What?

512
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,600
What is it?

513
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,500
It's the game company
Loomis tested for, that's where he got the game.

514
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,700
Scary.

515
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,900
I found the address for the game company.
I need you to tell me where 1420 Cypress Road is.

516
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Not a problem.

517
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,100
Let's see. Take the Belle Chasse Highway
to Breaux Bridge, near Spanish Lake.

518
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,300
Look, we're heading to the game developer.
We gonna find out, what they...

519
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,900
Hutch, I've been reading this book
called The Malleus The Demonium.

520
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,100
- Maleus The what?
- It means "The Witches' Hammer."

521
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,300
It was a handbook for witch hunters
in the Inquisition. It says if we find her,

522
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,900
we need to put three nails through
her heart, neck, and then forehead.

523
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
The nails are gonna put
her human spirit back into her body,

524
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,100
and then - this is really,
really important, you guys -

525
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,800
"An undead soul is only cleansed
by burning its blood."

526
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,500
So you realy think her ghost
could've been brought back from the death?

527
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Hutch, It's like a séance. A strong enough spirit
can be brought back with the proper text.

528
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
I just can't believe this is happening.

529
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,800
The detective Charles King
was brutally murdered today at Clearwater Mall.

530
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,300
October?

531
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Sources say
this murder may be linked...

532
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,200
Oh, my God!
The cop, King, he's dead.

533
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,300
What?

534
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,500
- Guys, we've got another problem.

535
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,300
Oh God, Oh God. The police are here.

536
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,400
OK, OK, We turning around.
Meet us at Loomis's.

537
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,100
- Loomis's house?
- He's right.

538
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,000
- Come on, if you don't wanna go to jail, we to go now Swink.
- Jail?

539
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,600
Now! Come on!

540
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,400
Give it to me.
Come on.

541
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,200
Toss the apartment.

542
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,400
What have we got?

543
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,700
- You remember her diary?
- Her diary?

544
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,500
Yeah, in the game.

545
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,100
- What if that's it?
- What?

546
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,200
- The proper text.
- That would mean that...

547
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,800
This is not about some kind of ghost.

548
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,800
I mean, do you realy expect me to believe we conjured up
her evil spirit with a game voice activated séance?

549
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,600
- To start, we all had to recite that prayer.
- That just... It's highly unlikely.

550
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,200
What is it, Swink?

551
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,800
October and I were talking about this kind of stuff.
I don't know. Maybe she's onto something.

552
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,700
- Why is the game on?
- What?

553
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,300
The game.

554
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,700
I didn't turn it on.

555
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,200
I told you not to play.

556
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,400
- Where's October?
- She's out smoking.

557
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,500
But you said if we didn't play the game we'd be fine.
Right Hutch? Right? I thought those were the rules.

558
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,700
I don't know what the rules are Swink.
Maybe there aren't any rules.

559
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,600
October!

560
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,400
It's not possible.
I didn't play. None of us did.

561
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,300
- If nobody played the game, that means...
- The game's playing by itself.

562
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,200
October!

563
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,800
October!

564
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,900
Shit!

565
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,000
No!

566
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,500
Let me go!

567
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,000
- October!
- October!

568
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,700
October!

569
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,200
Help me!

570
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
October!

571
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,600
Let me go!

572
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,900
- Open the window! Come on!

573
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,200
Come on!

574
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,100
Go fuck yourself.

575
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,800
Come on.

576
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,000
The door!  It's open.
October!

577
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,200
Oh, no! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

578
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,600
You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.

579
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,000
I can fix this. I can fix this. No, no, no, no.

580
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Goddammit!
Please, don't do this to me!

581
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,900
- I shouldn't have left her alone.
- This isn't your fault, Swink.

582
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This is all my fault.

583
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,900
You should've left
when you had the chance.

584
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,300
Your life was perfect before this.

585
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
My dad's not an architect.

586
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,100
- What?
- My dad's not an architect.

587
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,500
My mom doesn't teach first grade.

588
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,900
- You mean kindergarten?
- Whatever. I'm not heading off to Princeton.

589
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Pretty much
everything I said was bullshit.

590
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,100
- So this van is...
- Home sweet home.

591
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:14,500
I hate telling people the truth and
watching them get embarrassed for asking.

592
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,500
We gotta end this.

593
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,400
We gotta stop it.

594
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,900
- I don't think we have much time.
- You're right. We don't have a lot of time.

595
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,600
We need to find her body.

596
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,000
Which means
we need to find her tower.

597
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,200
Whoever made this game
knows everything about Elizabeth Bathory.

598
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,400
They're the ones who are gonna know
exactly where her plantation really is.

599
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,300
Hey! Swink, what are you doing?

600
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,600
It's realy obvious we have to stay alive
in the game until we end this.

601
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,000
- One of us has to play.
- Swink, If you die in the game...

602
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,900
Something won't let us stop playing.
Am I right?

603
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,700
So if it's gonna play with or without us,
at least I can use myself as a decoy.

604
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,300
I can protect us.

605
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,500
Let's go.

606
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,000
- All right, buddy, you know what to do.
- Stay alive.

607
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,200
Game time.

608
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,800
This thing is gay.

609
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,800
This is where
they made Stay Alive?

610
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,900
It seems like
a strange place to make a game.

611
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,100
Come on. Let's go.

612
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,700
Hello?

613
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,200
Hold on.
I'm gonna check it out, OK?

614
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,300
Wait here.

615
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,800
Oh, my God.

616
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,400
Holy shit.

617
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,100
Oh Thank God, man.
Please tell me you haven't died in the game already.

618
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,000
- No, we're fine.
- The place is deserted.

619
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,800
- OK, I need you to get to the back door of the house.
- I'm not really sure where that is.

620
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,500
- What room are you in?
- Some kind of parlor or something.

621
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,300
All right. Hold on.

622
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,300
- You're looking at two entries in that room right?
- Yeah.

623
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,300
Move through the archway,
not the doorway, back into the hall.

624
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:44,600
There should be a staircase
to the right and the kitchen to the left.

625
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,100
What's going on, Swink?
How do you know all this?

626
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,700
Just pay attention. All right, go through
the kitchen and out the back door.

627
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,200
Just keep walking
until you see the steps with the statues.

628
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,800
- Do you see the iron gates?
- Uh. yeah. I see them.

629
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,700
Just like the game.

630
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,400
Oh, Jesus Christ.

631
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,100
This is Gerouge Plantation.

632
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,300
We're in the bitch's backyard.

633
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,200
Elizabeth.

634
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,100
- What does this mean, Hutch?
- It means her body's up in that tower.

635
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,700
No shit.

636
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,300
Elizabeth's diary.

637
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,100
All these girls. She killed them all.

638
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,700
Swink, Abigail is in trouble. I need to get upstairs.
Which way do I go?

639
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,000
Uh...

640
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,100
You can go inside. It's faster to take
the staircase around the side.

641
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,600
OK.

642
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,600
It's locked! It's locked.
I need a crowbar or something.

643
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,400
Do you see one on the step?

644
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,000
You gotta be kidding me.

645
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
- Which way?
- Right, to the bedroom.

646
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,900
Aw, come on, Swink.

647
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,000
- I can't get in. It's locked.
- Wait. Wait. I have a key.

648
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,600
- This is...
- Insane. Now go!

649
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,800
Hutch!

650
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,700
- I don't think I'm gonna make it. You got to help me.
- I know. I see her.

651
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,300
Let me try something.

652
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,400
It's all right. It's all right.

653
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,200
It's OK.
It's all right. It's OK.

654
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,900
What happened?
Are you guys all right?

655
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,800
Yeah. You saved her life, man.

656
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,500
- Goddamn sweet!
- So. what now?

657
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,400
We need three nails. And one last thing.
Remember what October said.

658
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,700
The way to cleanse a witch's soul
is to burn her blood.

659
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,800
Oh! Wait Hutch. The roses. If you're gonna go
up there, you can't forget the wild roses.

660
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,800
- You never know, and I bet...

661
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,400
No! No!

662
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,500
Hell, yeah!

663
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,200
Swink!

664
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,400
Come on, you bitch.

665
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,100
Oh, shit.

666
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,800
Bitch, that's cheating!
I'm not dead yet.

667
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,800
Go!

668
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,800
- Swink!
- Swink!

669
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,100
- Swink!
- Help me!

670
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,100
Get away!
Get away from me!

671
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,500
Swink!

672
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,900
Hutch, I'm sorry.

673
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,300
OK, we're gonna need a hammer.

674
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,700
- Come on.
- Quick!

675
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,900
Open the door!

676
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,200
Hutch, come on.
Come on! Hutch!

677
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,300
Thanks, Swink.

678
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

679
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,600
It's OK. It's all right.

680
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,800
OK?

681
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,400
- All Right. I'm gonna go first. Stay right behind me.
- OK.

682
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,600
- Wait. Did you hear that?

683
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,800
OK. All right. All right, all right.

684
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,900
Come on.

685
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,300
This way. This way.

686
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,600
There should be a second door in here.

687
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,400
This should be the tower.
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

688
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,100
Hutch!

689
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,300
- It won't open.
- Oh, no! Open it!

690
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,400
OK. OK, wait, wait, wait. Let me think.
Let me think. I can get this open.

691
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,400
- How?
- I don't know. Just give me a second.

692
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,900
- Hutch. Hutch!
- It's just a... What?

693
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
We don't have the time!

694
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,600
Just think about it.
You gotta finish this.

695
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,200
No.

696
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,400
- Listen.
- I'm not leaving you.

697
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,600
Hutch.

698
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,200
I want you to go.

699
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,400
You're our only chance.

700
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,500
OK?

701
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,500
- This can't be happening.
- Well, it is.

702
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,500
I won't let her take you.

703
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
I know.

704
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,900
You be careful of that.

705
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,400
OK.

706
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,500
He loves me,

707
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,300
he loves me not.

708
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,500
He loves me,

709
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,100
he loves me not.

710
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,700
He loves me,

711
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,600
he loves me not.

712
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,000
He loves me...

713
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,600
Go away!

714
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,700
Go away!

715
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,200
No! Go away!

716
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,900
Hutch!

717
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:30,500
The broken mirrors - why are they scatered? 
Because she couldn't stand to see herself grow old.

718
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:36,200
It won't break like the others.
I think it's made out of silver or something.

719
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,300
Mom!

720
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,100
- Hutch!
- Come on! Move!

721
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,400
Come on, hurry.
Move! Come on, man!

722
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,900
- Move!
- Hutch!

723
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,300
Come on.
Come on, man! Come on!

724
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,400
Come on! Come on, Hutch!

725
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,500
Killer.

726
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,100
Come to see me, clouds.

727
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,400
May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.

728
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,900
Let the cover of night bear witness
and destroy those who resist

729
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
so they shall harm me not.

730
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,600
Let the blood of many cleanse me.

731
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,100
preserving beauty eternal.

732
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,700
I pray you.

733
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:11,700
