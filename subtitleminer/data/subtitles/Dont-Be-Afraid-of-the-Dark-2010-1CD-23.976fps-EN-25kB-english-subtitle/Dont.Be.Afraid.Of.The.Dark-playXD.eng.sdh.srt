Arthur Machen. Welsh.

711
01:04:36,749 --> 01:04:38,455
He believed
in fairy folk,

712
01:04:38,543 --> 01:04:42,661
these ancient entities from the
netherworld, predating mankind.

him extensively.

to take one human life

every time they emerged
to replenish their ranks.

Many of these creatures
fed on the bones,

a good idea.

807
01:11:46,429 --> 01:11:48,135
Mr. Jacoby, I am so
glad you could make it.

- Charles.

- Hello, Alex.

810
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:53,303
It's a pleasure.
Come on in.

811
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:57,015
The house looks
absolutely fantastic.

812

You've done

813
01:11:58,691 --> 01:12:00,898

823

Yeah, I'm sure
she probably saw

832
01:13:16,018 --> 01:13:17,303
your photographs
and copied them.

us this evening.

It means a great
deal to us.

853
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:23,495
Every aspect of this restoration
has followed the exact specifications

854
01:14:23,586 --> 01:14:26,749
and materials used in the
original construction of the house,

855
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:30,756
including the wood assembling
techniques, the layout in the kitchen,

856
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:33,087
even the lacquering process
for all the timber.

857
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:36,675
It's something Kim and I are very
proud of, and I'm sure all of you,

858
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:39,261
with your vast
array of expertise,

859
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:41,850

the attention to detail.

even the furniture
that you're sitting on,

862
01:14:48,861 --> 01:14:52,774
has all been meticulously
chosen, reassembled or restored,
