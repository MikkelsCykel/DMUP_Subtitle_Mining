00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,081
Sorry. What was your name again?

2
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,091
Packy.
Packy?

3
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,889
Yeah.
Are we lost, Packy?

4
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,794
Damn it! Damn it!
I had this nailed before.

5
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,663
I swear. Dude, we're gonna find it.
Don't worry about it.

6
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,133
So you're driving for the picture?

7
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,068
Donny's my cousin.
You know, Donny?

8
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,403
Ah, yeah.

9
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,602
I'm kinda like the all-purpose
kind of guy.

10
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,271
Your cousin?
Yeah.

11
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,782
And this is his first picture.

12
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,283
Yeah, you know.

13
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,152
I guess that thing we did
in Bartoli's back yard doesn't count.

14
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,589
This is like his first film. Movie.

15
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,820
Is he good with actors?
Does he like actors?

16
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,790
Uh--

17
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,960
You're kinda like the first actor
I've ever met, so--

18
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,196
But I know he's fucking
so psyched that you're doing this.

19
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,932
You're playing the store manager.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,702
Well, now, I haven't committed yet.

21
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,674
This is just research, you know?

22
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,238
Just take a look at the location.

23
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,840
Research, get a feel for the character.

24
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,284
So, Donny says you haven't
worked in, like, four years

25
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,718
or something like that.

26
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,187
Well, not four.

27
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,955
It's a long fucking time, right?

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,893
Well, I mean, you know,
I've had--

29
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,327
It's not like I haven't had offers.

30
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,831
So you're back!
You're fuckin' back in business.

31
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,197
How does it feel?

32
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,329
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call this "back."

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,601
Not "back" back, you know?

34
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,109
Not like "comeback" back.

35
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,248
Just a little independent thing.

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,875
Oh.
Nicely under the radar.

37
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,252
I mean, if it flies, fine.

38
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,324
And if it doesn't,
it won't even count.

39
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,250
It's like a blow job.

40
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,297
Yeah. Like a cinematic blow job.

41
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,663
No shit.

42
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,660
All right, this is so--

43
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,933
This is so fucking uncool, I know.
But I'm driving, so fuck it.

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,534
I mean-- Hey, would you mind
just doin' a little bit for me?

45
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,975
Any part. Any part is fine.

46
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,639
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

47
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,719
The thing--
The book on tape?

48
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,754
You did this so well.
Come on. Any part.

49
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,346
Anything, really.

50
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,061
Uh, no, no, no.

51
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,094
<i>Chapter four.</i>

52
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,129
Wait, wait.

53
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,257
<i>Her ivory hand grasped firmly,</i>
<i>the door swung open</i>

54
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,994
<i>with the hush of luxury.</i>

55
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,229
<i>And there--</i>
I never did a book on tape.

56
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,070
Here you go!
<i>Her brim swept up,</i>

57
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:33,077
<i>her eyes filled with the glory,</i>
<i>the spectacle that was Titanic.</i>

58
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,411
Man.
It's not me.

59
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,144
Modest motherfucker.

60
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,720
I'm telling you, it's not me.

61
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,618
<i>The soles of his leather--</i>
Of course it's you.

62
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,782
What else you been doin'
for the past four years?

63
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,053
That's not me, man.

64
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,461
All right, first of all--

65
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,230
I would never--
I would never go that way.

66
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,098
I would never choose those rhythms.

67
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,170
You know what I'm saying?

68
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,207
You get a scene like that,
you don't drop into those rhythms.

69
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,072
You don't play the obvious.
You always go under.

70
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,669
Run it by me again.
You want to play it again?

71
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,510
Yeah.

72
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,949
<i>Her brim swept up,</i>
<i>and her eyes filled--</i>

73
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,520
No, see, he's all
caught up in his reading.

74
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,317
He's totally disconnected.

75
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,948
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't have a--

76
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,389
"Earth received her step.

77
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,329
"Brim up,

78
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,699
"her eyes encompassed the glory,

79
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:36,366
the spectacle, that was <i>Titanic."</i>

80
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,774
Oh, my God! What?

81
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,699
So. This is--
Ground Zero.

82
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,969
You gonna remember how we got here?

83
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,382
Yeah, I'm down with the map,
so it's no big deal.

84
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,782
So, how do you wanna--

85
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,819
How do you want to handle this?

86
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,618
Sneak me in
through the back, maybe?

87
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,190
For what?

88
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,227
This is fine.

89
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,732
So, how long do you need?

90
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,868
You don't stay?
No, I run.

91
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,202
Frickin' Porta Potties in Brea,
wherever the heck that is.

92
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,833
You remember which way we--

93
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:49,347
No, I'm fuckin' with you, man.

94
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,282
I'm just-- It's a joke.
All right.

95
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,354
An hour or so should do it.

96
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,979
Okay.

97
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,225
Now, you will be coming back?

98
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,160
Yeah. Hey, good field trip, all right?

99
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,823
And man, seriously--

100
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,129
<i>Put it back.</i>

101
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,208
<i>Yes, you. Put it back.</i>

102
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,277
<i>You're not gonna take it.</i>
<i>You never do.</i>

103
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,104
<i>Stop squeezing the shit out of it</i>
<i>and put it back.</i>

104
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,475
<i>I'm watching you, cabrón.</i>

105
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,628
You gonna pick it or do I?

106
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,267
Your mama didn't teach you how to count?

107
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,671
Let's go.

108
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,167
Fine. More for me.

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,018
Lee.

110
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,879
Come on.

111
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,087
$16.60.

112
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,894
Get a milk.

113
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,706
<i>Vamos.</i>

114
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,080
Oh. Oh. Shit.

115
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,494
<i>Lee!</i>

116
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,000
Can you not do that?

117
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,627
Sorry. I was just--
Watching, I know.

118
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,898
I saw you come in.

119
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,234
Is this bothering you?

120
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,468
I mean, am I bothering you standing here?

121
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,377
You are three feet from my face.

122
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,971
Sorry.

123
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,310
Well, where should I--

124
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,918
$24.50. No receipt.

125
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,792
Oh.

126
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,269
Give me that.

127
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,102
How do you do that?
The numbers?

128
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,976
How do you--
You know before they even--

129
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,605
I'm terrible with numbers.

130
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,312
You got prices, you got totals.

131
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,819
How many can there be?

132
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,848
Do you have to train for that?

133
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,621
I mean, to remember all that?

134
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,254
Some special training?
Yeah. Right.

135
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,202
I'm too A.D.D.
I could never--

136
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,139
So you--
You really anticipate, right?

137
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,475
Oh, I mean, you're good.
You're really good.

138
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,376
Wow.

139
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,142
Does the manager
have to be that good?

140
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,240
I mean, with the numbers?

141
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,119
What about the other one?
She that good?

142
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,315
I mean, she's not
pulling in the customers.

143
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,226
Why, no. Not while she sits on her ass!

144
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,557
But then, I guess you don't have to
work if you're fucking the manager!

145
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,761
Kiss it.

146
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,735
Bitch.

147
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,002
That <i>puta</i> gets the gold lane
and does shit,

148
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,840
and I carry the floor.

149
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,846
You tell me how smart I am.

150
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,782
I wasn't aware there
were lane distinctions.

151
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,785
You are looking at them.

152
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,015
Ten items or less.

153
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,882
You been standing there.

154
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,359
You see one jerk not try
to push the count, huh?

155
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,486
Always a fight.

156
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,122
So, this is the less desirable lane.

157
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:52,034
This? This is where
checkers come to die.

158
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,872
Look at this. Look at--

159
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,000
Even the register sucks.

160
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,638
In Italy, they give long receipts
to pretty woman as a come-on.

161
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,841
Toll-takers on the highway.

162
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,475
Sort of a projection of length,
if you know what I mean.

163
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,648
Why are you here?

164
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,351
I was hopin' to see the manager.

165
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,360
But I guess he's not here.

166
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,158
I don't know.
Why don't you ask <i>her</i>?

167
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,098
No, no. It's okay.
It's cool.

168
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,465
What did you want with him?

169
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,505
I'm just doing a little research.

170
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,630
You're a cop?

171
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,868
No! Ha! No, no.

172
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,136
I'm-I'm--
Shitting you.

173
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,178
I know who you are.

174
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,647
You do?
You are in that Ashley Judd movie.

175
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,480
You saw that?
Blockbuster over there.

176
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,486
Only shit we see.

177
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,422
Yeah, well, I'm--
Mm, I know.

178
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,426
And you are?
Your name again is--

179
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,721
Did I tell you?
No, of course not.

180
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,164
Research for what?

181
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,166
A project.

182
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,933
What the hell does
that mean, "a project"?

183
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,703
Uh, film. You know.

184
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,301
Little-- Uh, nothing
I've committed to.

185
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,074
Just--
A movie.

186
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,446
Yeah.
Then why don't you say so?

187
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,481
Scarlet. That's your name.
Scarlet.

188
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,022
Yeah.

189
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,591
Yeah. Good strong name, Scarlet.

190
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,593
Beautiful name.

191
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,128
It's the lead in a movie name.
Scarlet.

192
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,999
What would you
possibly learn here?

193
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,435
Everything. Everything.
What?

194
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,269
Well, for instance, do you know...

195
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,208
that you change hands
every other customer?

196
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,644
You got this rhythm thing going.
Are you aware of that? Hmm?

197
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,716
Are you shitting me?
No!

198
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,342
No, it's just details.
It's all detail.

199
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,717
That's all character is, behavior.

200
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,447
You have to build it.

201
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,718
For instance, this blouse
that you're wearing here

202
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,453
under this smock?

203
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,791
That's a choice, right?
That's specific.

204
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,388
What does it say to us,
to the audience?

205
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,763
It says that she's here
but she's not here.

206
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,631
She's doing it,
but on here own terms.

207
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,329
You see what I'm saying?

208
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,929
Or, it's very uncomfortable.
What have we got here.

209
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,372
Some sort of a poly blend?

210
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,010
Hard to say.
It's not wool, is it?

211
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,411
I don't do well with wool.
Sweat like a motherfucker.

212
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,779
Manager doesn't have
to wear wool, does he?

213
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,317
Might have a problem with it.

214
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,123
Are all actors like you?
Sadly, no.

215
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,757
Oh, Jesus. Lee.

216
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,662
Lee!

217
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,826
Is that him?
Is that the manager?

218
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,403
Oh. Oh, the vest is great.

219
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,099
He's a standby. Deaf as a post.

220
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,176
Deaf!
Yeah, he's-- Oh, shit.

221
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,472
How am I supposed
to get out of here?

222
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,270
<i>Put it back!</i>

223
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,049
Hello?

224
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,785
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

225
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,728
<i>Hello?</i>

226
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,457
<i>Scarlet!</i>

227
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,659
<i>What are you doing?</i>

228
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,761
<i>You're doing a wonderful job, Scarlet.</i>

229
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,205
<i>Customers, please note</i>
<i>the outstanding work</i>

230
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,142
<i>being done by our employee</i>
<i>in the 10 items or less lane.</i>

231
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,643
<i>And you'll find there's no waiting</i>
<i>in aisle number one,</i>

232
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,048
<i>where our full service checker</i>
<i>is currently sitting on her ass.</i>

233
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,178
Hey, fuck off.

234
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,474
Why the hurry?

235
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,415
Because. I was supposed to
get out of here 15 minutes ago.

236
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,419
And if I just leave Lee here,

237
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,148
the place will probably
get robbed again.

238
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:22,290
Robbed?
Like, "robbed" robbed?

239
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,294
Where do you think you are?

240
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,626
Really?

241
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,326
I'm sick of taking care
of these children.

242
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:34,337
But wait.
Are you going now?

243
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,670
Don't stay too long.
The next shift doesn't speak English.

244
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,574
Well, wait a minute. Couldn't
you stay a few more minutes?

245
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,909
I gotta go.
Just five more minutes.

246
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,281
Aren't you supposed
to get picked up?

247
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,947
There's some little
autobus that comes, or--

248
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,320
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know where the kid is.

249
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,893
He was supposed to be here
an hour ago.

250
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,293
You think he's coming?

251
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,422
Do I know him?

252
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,434
Well, what if he's lost?
So call him.

253
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,305
I-I forgot my cellphone.

254
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,967
Darn. So did I.

255
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,704
Use the pay phone,
like the rest of America.

256
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,578
Well, see, the thing is, I--

257
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,277
I don't have a phone number for him.
The little P.A. guy, he left,

258
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,285
and he didn't give me
a phone number--

259
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,049
He told me he was
gonna find me here.

260
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,181
So no ride.

261
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,781
No.

262
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,918
And there's no one you can call?

263
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,393
No. I don't know the--

264
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,727
I mean, it's just a shitty little
production company, you know?

265
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,892
I haven't even committed yet.

266
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,903
So call home.
You do have a home?

267
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,939
See? See?

268
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,507
A clear mind.
Yeah.

269
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,014
Thank you.

270
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,412
Oh.

271
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,327
What?

272
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,459
I don't remember the number.

273
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:14,138
We had the phone numbers changed
a week or so ago, but--

274
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,470
For security,
and I-I don't remember.

275
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,975
You don't know
your number?

276
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,635
What are you, 12?

277
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,304
You don't know your
own phone number?

278
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,279
Not this week.

279
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,912
Can't you call a cab?

280
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,449
Think they'd take a card?

281
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,951
Diner's Club?

282
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,321
Are you kidding?

283
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,487
What?
The rates are terrific.

284
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,825
Jesus.

285
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,422
What do you people do
when you get in trouble?

286
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,001
Who do you normally call?

287
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,535
Manager.

288
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,002
Agent!

289
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,275
Hi. It's me.

290
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,376
The other me.

291
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,009
Ye--

292
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,144
Oh.

293
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,617
Oh.

294
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,256
Okay. Thank you.

295
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,538
Hi.

296
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,733
Is he in?

297
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,839
Really?

298
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,072
When?

299
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,175
Oh.

300
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,343
Right. Okay.
All right. Yeah.

301
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,650
Thank you.

302
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,157
What?

303
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,394
It's no good.
They're all gone.

304
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,592
It's a Jewish holiday.

305
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,793
Today?

306
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:54,269
Tomorrow.
They've... stretched it.

307
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,706
Then who were you talking with?

308
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,970
The, uh-- the switchboard.

309
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,069
So, everyone else?

310
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,408
Gone.

311
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,176
They're all Jewish?

312
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,841
They are today.

313
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,485
Look... I don't know
what to tell you.

314
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,752
I got to be somewhere.

315
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,623
I'm-I'm already late.

316
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,595
And I got shit I got to do first, and--

317
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:27,165
And if I leave you,
you're gonna get yourself killed.

318
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,070
I can't believe this.

319
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,702
Okay. Shit.
Okay, we'll get you home.

320
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,610
But I got shit I got to do first, so...

321
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,774
you're just going to have
to come with me.

322
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,914
Hold this.

323
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,819
Ah, that's a hell of a trick.

324
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,523
Quick change between scenes.

325
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,499
Me, I can't put on two socks in an hour.

326
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,126
Oh, that's good on you, that blue.

327
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,898
That's my secret, you know?

328
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,531
Brings out that youthful glow
in you, blue does.

329
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,041
Huh, that's not after-school wear.

330
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,544
What, a quick stop at the Red Onion?

331
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,080
Is that the action here?

332
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,447
A little wrinkled here.

333
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,950
Oh, damn it!

334
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,781
You forgot something.

335
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,653
What did you forget?

336
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,190
Fucking keys.
You forgot your keys?

337
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,384
Not mine.

338
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,290
You forgot somebody else's keys.

339
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,419
Whose keys did you forget?

340
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,497
My ex-husband's.

341
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:30,193
Oh, you're not old enough
to have an ex-husband.

342
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,270
How old are you?

343
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,339
Twenty-five.
How old are you?

344
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,499
Old enough to have an ex-husband.

345
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,440
So, you took his keys?

346
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,172
His keys. My car.
Ah.

347
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,846
How long were you married?

348
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,111
Still am.

349
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,245
You're still--

350
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,720
Can't afford the divorce yet.

351
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,814
Ah.
Okay.

352
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,984
So, why the split?

353
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,020
Well, what do--

354
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,619
what do you think?

355
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,894
Uh, married too young
or grew separately as people?

356
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,263
What?

357
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,394
He fucks other women
and takes my car.

358
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,494
Got it.

359
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,773
<i>Yo, ese!</i>
What's up, Hollywood?

360
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,146
Hey, man! How you doing?

361
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,151
Whoo hoo hoo!

362
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,584
See that?

363
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,587
Haven't done a movie in four years.

364
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,855
Ha! Star Mobile.

365
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,592
God, I feel at home already.

366
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,076
This your neighborhood?

367
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,908
Nice. Real... texture.

368
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,075
What do you think a place
goes for around here?

369
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,051
I always wanted to get a place,
you know, in the city...

370
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,884
that's just for meetings.

371
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,514
Where are we again?

372
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,561
This your place?

373
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,059
No.
No.

374
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,735
Oh, check stand number one.

375
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,312
I need my keys.

376
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,775
Hmm. Tell Bobby I want my keys
and the fucking cash he owes me.

377
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,319
Tell him yourself.

378
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,513
Damn, it stinks.

379
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,314
The manager.

380
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,325
What the fuck are you doing here?

381
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,827
Hey, you're supposed to be on the floor.
Who the fuck is watching Lee?

382
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,487
I don't know.
Why don't you call the manager?

383
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,826
Give me my keys.

384
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,133
Who's this?

385
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,463
This is--

386
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,800
Hey. No, no.
I know who he is.

387
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,339
What the fuck is he doing here?

388
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,467
Research.
Re-- research?

389
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,169
What, on you?

390
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,940
What are you,
the new Ashley Judd?

391
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,106
No, asshole.
It's a project.

392
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,708
Oh, a project, huh?
Like a class project?

393
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,721
No, it's nothing I've committed to yet.
I'm just-- just--

394
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,381
He can't get home, Bobby.
He needs a ride.

395
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,423
Give me my keys.

396
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,152
He can't call someone?

397
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,727
They're all Jewish.

398
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,122
So they don't drive?

399
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:18,032
Well, what she's trying to say is,
um, I-I forgot the numbers.

400
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,831
See, we had a little
security issue at home

401
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,462
and we changed
all the phones and--

402
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,440
Scarlet, Scarlet, what the
fuck's with the getup?

403
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,009
Huh? Don't-- don't tell me.

404
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,011
You're going on that
fuckin' interview.

405
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,547
Interview?
You've got an interview?

406
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,311
Scar, baby,
we talked about this. Okay?

407
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,148
You really think anybody's gonna
take some grocery hump seriously?

408
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,983
I mean, you've never even
seen the inside of a fuckin' office.

409
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,784
I'm sorry.

410
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,155
I thought she was the grocery hump.

411
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,661
Hey, at least someone got pregnant.

412
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,665
That cash was mine.

413
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,867
Now give it to me and give me
the keys to my car.

414
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,275
You know, I saw you walk out with that
load under your arms the other night.

415
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,812
You're gonna pay that back, right?

416
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,474
I did. For three years.

417
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,019
Hey, Scarlet...
how's the Green Card coming?

418
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,023
Hey, Lorraine, have another
beer for the baby, huh?

419
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,990
Come on.
Come on, babe.

420
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,631
Give me my keys.

421
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,130
Bobby, give me the keys.

422
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,296
Hey, come on. Don't.
Give me the keys.

423
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,338
Bobby, give me the keys.

424
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,740
Ow! Ow! What the fuck?

425
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:35,902
Get the fuck off me!

426
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:36,946
What?
<i>Mi dinero.</i>

427
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,278
Ow! Ow! God damnit!

428
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,908
Fuckin' bitch!
Get off me!

429
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,850
Get the fuck off me!

430
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,683
Ow! Ow! That fuckin' hurts!
That hurts! That hurts!

431
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,356
Here, take it!

432
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,483
Fucking get the fuck out!

433
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,695
I'm all right.
<i>Cabrón.</i>

434
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,764
I'm all right, baby.

435
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,060
I'm good.

436
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,100
Th-- they're not armed, are they?

437
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,704
You fuckin' bitch!

438
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,608
Oh! Hoo!
Oh, my.

439
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:16,085
Uh, maybe the prudent thing at this point
is ask if you're, uh, okay to drive?

440
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:20,624
You see an old Pontiac?
Green, like her eyes?

441
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:21,783
Uh...

442
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:22,860
Yeah. Right behind us.

443
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,293
Good.

444
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,489
No!

445
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,801
You motherfucking cunt!
You motherfucker!

446
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,636
Fucker!
What do you think?

447
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,902
Go again?

448
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,205
Fuck you!
I-I'd say you're good.

449
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,474
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

450
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,880
Fuck you, bitch!
You motherfucker!

451
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,953
Aren't you going to do something,
you fucking pussy?

452
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,077
Get off the floor!

453
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,094
Fucker!

454
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,959
What? What's the matter?

455
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,500
Look at this.
The whole thing was a mistake.

456
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,627
That's nothing. Nothing.

457
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,433
This is a fix.
It's a-- it's a wardrobe change.

458
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,304
Don't worry about it.
What time was th-- the thing?

459
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,501
Who's it with?
Who--

460
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,840
What are we auditioning for?

461
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,573
And how am I supposed
to get you home?

462
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,239
Fuck that. That's later.

463
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,941
What time's the thing?

464
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,212
At 4:00.
4:00. All right.

465
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,221
We got to get out of here,
'cause we got time to stop and--

466
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,620
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's hit it.

467
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,862
Okay, now, this is what,
this interview?

468
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,865
It's--

469
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,731
It's stupid.
Aw, come on now.

470
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,472
I don't know.

471
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,168
Secretary.
Perfect.

472
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,005
Office secretary.

473
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,045
Perfect.

474
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:54,346
It's, I don't know,
construction company or something.

475
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,751
That's perfect.
That's-- You're perfect for it.

476
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,585
You don't even know me.

477
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,385
Let me tell you something.

478
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,121
I may not know my phone number.

479
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,822
I might not even know
what fucking day it is,

480
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,262
but I know people.

481
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,335
I mean, the minute I see somebody,
I know how to cast them.

482
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,597
I see the role.

483
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,163
Don't you do that? Hmm?

484
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,800
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I said to myself,

485
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,176
D.A.'s office, E.R. intern,
office manager.

486
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,475
Secretary.

487
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,607
Same thing, better billing.

488
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,085
I mean, I saw you four steps ahead
of everybody else in that supermarket.

489
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,179
I saw you holding down
the work of three people

490
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,451
because you know you're better
than everybody else.

491
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,992
Am I right? Huh? Huh?

492
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,722
So what's a secretary but somebody
who does the work of three people

493
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,263
while some other schlub
gets the credit?

494
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,390
You know where
we're headed here?

495
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,990
No.

496
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,900
Then shouldn't we stop and...

497
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,870
maybe ask for directions somewhere?

498
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,907
No directions.
No directions.

499
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,943
I never ask for directions, okay?

500
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,102
Ah, see?

501
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,043
Perfect character choice.

502
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,809
Self-sufficiency.
Rely on no one.

503
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,578
You remember
where you got this blouse?

504
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,380
Uh...

505
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,251
No. <i>Sí.</i>
Well, yes or no?

506
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,880
Quick.
<i>Sí</i>, I think so.

507
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,253
Okay, take us there.
Okay.

508
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,792
And don't stop for lights.

509
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,521
We got shit to do.
Let's get to work.

510
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,028
Okay.

511
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,443
This is amazing.

512
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,143
It's Target.

513
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,652
Fantastic.

514
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,351
<i>Target team member to home furnishings.</i>

515
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,518
<i>Target team member</i>
<i>to home furnishings, please.</i>

516
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,722
<i>May I have a Target team member</i>
<i>in infant wear.</i>

517
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,731
<i>Please, a Target team member</i>
<i>in infant wear.</i>

518
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,927
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Tch. Oh, no.

519
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,931
Look at these prices!
Yeah.

520
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,771
How can they afford to do this?

521
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,843
I have to tell the office
about this place.

522
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,245
Hmm. It's a well-kept secret.

523
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,181
Ah!
What?

524
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,647
Designer t-shirts, eight dollars?

525
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,920
Do you know what this cost?

526
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,015
Huh?

527
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,652
You-- How much
do you think this cost?

528
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:22,255
Oh, it's La Perla maxi-blend, right?

529
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,527
I'd say 80.

530
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,726
A hundred.
Oh.

531
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,929
A hundred.
Oh, that's pathetic.

532
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,063
You paid a hundred dollars
for a t-shirt.

533
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,936
Oh, God, no.
Not me.

534
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,067
Wardrobe department,
the last movie I was on.

535
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,042
I get all my underwear
through them.

536
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,943
But let me show you
what you're paying for.

537
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:37,980
What?

538
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,640
Clint Eastwood taught me this.

539
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,652
See how the shirt cuffs right there
at the middle of the muscle?

540
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,278
Look at that.
Huh, see?

541
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,152
Mm.
Makes me look 30, doesn't it?

542
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,316
Huh? Taller?

543
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:52,829
Why is it you people make all the money
and work so hard not to spend it?

544
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,023
Well, that's the game.

545
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,725
I haven't shopped retail in years.

546
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,893
You have to learn these things
when you're younger.

547
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,595
Oh, my God.

548
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,799
Look at the thread count on these.

549
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,877
- Magic Cloths two-pack for $21.99.

550
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,946
We're gonna go ahead
and give you the second one for free.

551
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,776
Like I said,
that's our standard package.

552
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,783
And until we run out of these mops,
just let me know right now--

553
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,819
and I know you want one
and you want one too--

554
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,912
we're gonna go ahead and give
you that mop and that package

555
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,890
absolutely free today as a bonus gift.

556
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,622
So, like I said, "buy one, get one"
is our standard package

557
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,788
until we run out of the mops.

558
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,695
Just let me know right now.
And I know you want one.

559
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,563
Here, we're gonna go ahead
and give you that mop.

560
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,166
Mm-mm, no.

561
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,973
Mm-mm.

562
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,903
Mm, no, no, no.

563
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,412
What?

564
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,539
The blue was working for you.

565
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,914
Don't throw the baby out
with the bath water.

566
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,352
What is wrong with this?

567
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,424
Everything.

568
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,116
All right, forget the color.

569
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,626
Look at the shoulder construction.
You don't need help like that.

570
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,696
You've got fantastic shoulders.

571
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,527
You go in there with this,
you'll look like a linebacker.

572
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,761
You're too young
to remember that picture.

573
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,532
Spent months trying to make me
look like a sister.

574
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,266
You think I can
buy off the rack?

575
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,705
Hell, no.

576
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,277
Couldn't even squeeze
myself into a 14.

577
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,869
We had to do some
very careful work.

578
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,745
By the time we were done,
even the grips wanted to do me.

579
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,716
Here. Try this on.

580
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,518
Mm-hmm.

581
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,665
Damn.

582
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,817
Oh, that is wonderful.

583
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,891
Wonderful.

584
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:05,122
Oh, the Mizrahi.
Very tasty.

585
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:10,696
Mm, might want to shorten
the waist just a little.

586
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,893
Mm-hmm.

587
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,062
Dynamite. Dynamite.

588
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,232
Look at you ladies.

589
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,207
You're gonna get some
tonight, for sure.

590
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,045
Is there anyone you don't talk to?

591
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,915
Why? I engage people.

592
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,818
I'm a connector.

593
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,221
Human interaction,
it's the spice of life.

594
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,190
Pardon me, Tracey?
Mm?

595
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,524
That's my daughter's name.
Imagine that.

596
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,221
Same name as my daughter.

597
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,822
I bet they spelled it
wrong too, didn't they?

598
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,231
They forgot the E.

599
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:49,705
Well, Tracey with an E...
What pretty eyes.

600
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,298
Where could we find
the cosmetics department?

601
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,672
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.

602
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,769
Now, now, a little schmutz
isn't gonna hurt.

603
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,245
Pick up those eyes
a little bit, hmm?

604
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,280
Where?

605
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,681
On the left, just past
the auto parts.

606
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:02,775
Thank you.

607
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,946
I-I just love <i>Barbershop</i>.

608
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,547
So did I.

609
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,386
Now let's go raid the testers.

610
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,726
It's been years since I bought
new makeup for my wife.

611
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,595
And the rest of this.
Hmm?

612
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,362
How you plan on paying?

613
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,509
Go ahead and say it.

614
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,044
Thank you, Diner's Club.

615
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,670
Once more.

616
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,516
Thank you, Diner's Club.

617
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,676
Good!

618
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,878
Oh...

619
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,080
What time is it?

620
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,248
Never mind. Never mind.
We're okay.

621
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,985
We'll have to do something here.

622
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,492
This is no good.
This is terrible.

623
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,526
What?

624
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,153
We can't pull up
to an audition looking like--

625
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,424
Interview.

626
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,328
Same pitch, better billing.

627
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,025
No, you've got to make
an impression.

628
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,036
You pull up, you're on the runway
before you can put it in park.

629
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,765
Oh, this is no good.
This is filthy.

630
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,431
It's a car.

631
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,372
It's your entrance.

632
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,707
Look, offices have windows.
Windows.

633
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,212
They see you coming,
that's it; you're on.

634
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,340
Now, you cannot
take the stage half-cocked.

635
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,712
We've got to get this to wardrobe.

636
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,513
Open up. Open up.
Come on.

637
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,875
Which one's yours?

638
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,750
That one's mine.
I mean, I'm with that one.

639
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,607
I got it.
I got it this time.

640
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,114
I got it.

641
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,684
All right.

642
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,820
Good job.

643
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,618
Thank you.

644
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,823
Come on.

645
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:08,823
