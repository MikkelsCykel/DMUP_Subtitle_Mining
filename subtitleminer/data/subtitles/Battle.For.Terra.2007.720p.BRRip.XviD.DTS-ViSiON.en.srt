00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:38,495
Cloud sailers.
New toy cloud sailers.

2
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,670
Sora. Tumi.

3
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,967
Welcome.

4
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,597
Roven, Tumi's still sick.

5
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,401
Let's have a look.

6
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,999
- Present.
- Kima?

7
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,233
Present.

8
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,672
- Tulo?
- Present.

9
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:46,106
- Tumi?
- Present.

10
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,435
Senn?

11
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,334
Senn?

12
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:53,873
Mala?

13
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:55,306
Mala?

14
00:04:58,342 --> 00:04:59,739
Come on, Senn!

15
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,741
It's only a race if you keep up.

16
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:09,635
Is it my fault you keep cheating?

17
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,970
I don't cheat.

18
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,176
Not all the time.

19
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,267
Classic Mala.

20
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:26,400
Great. All right.

21
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:27,738
Very funny.
Where are you?

22
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,435
Bye!

23
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:36,003
That was really funny.
You got me... again.

24
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,804
Do you hear that?
Is it me?

25
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,571
I think it's coming
from right below... us!

26
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:56,308
See? She doesn't think
much of your flying, either.

27
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:06,177
Beautiful.

28
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,136
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

29
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,146
Turn around and go home?

30
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,113
Hey, Mala? Mala?
Probably not a...

31
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,646
Wind tunnel!

32
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:00,946
Mala, pull up!

33
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:03,309
Senn, throw the anchor!

34
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,937
Mala!

35
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:13,842
Come on! Come on!

36
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,672
Are you thinking what I'm thinking now?

37
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,215
'Cause clearly it's time to go back.

38
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,677
Mala, where are you going?

39
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,409
Are you crazy?

40
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:53,540
Mala, you know this place is forbidden.

41
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,715
Wasn't the wind tunnel enough?

42
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:00,375
And the huge, crazy sky whale?

43
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,744
Finally, you've come to your senses.

44
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:09,715
Let's go back now, okay?

45
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,511
Senn?

46
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,345
What is that?

47
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,184
Mom, what's that?

48
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:53,115
Tumi, come inside.

49
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,880
A new god!

50
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:21,416
A new god in the sky.

51
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:28,676
Go home.
The elders will check on you.

52
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,820
Keep moving.

53
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:39,410
Move along.

54
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,747
All is well.

55
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,411
It has begun.

56
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:48,680
Is everyone safe here?

57
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,516
Is there anything that you need?

58
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,452
So, you think it's a god?

59
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:45,285
It could be one of those large rocks.

60
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,220
The kind that fall from the sky
from time to time.

61
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,722
It will be whatever the elders tell us it is.

62
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,654
I bet I could see what it is.

63
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:53,952
I bet I could make something
to help me look closer.

64
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:56,489
Mala, you know that's forbidden.

65
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,614
But why?
It wouldn't hurt anybody.

66
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,214
Inventions that are not approved
by the elders

67
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,779
are against our teachings.

68
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,290
Then maybe our teachings are wrong.

69
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:07,881
Mala! Go to your room.

70
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,686
Right now.

71
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,422
Getting closer.

72
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,594
What is that?

73
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,123
No.

74
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,856
Sound the alarm!

75
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,630
Everyone, take cover!

76
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:29,296
Mala?

77
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,922
Everyone, get to your homes.

78
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:33,258
What is that?

79
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:37,231
Mala! Where are you?

80
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:38,729
Mala!

81
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,392
It's a miracle!
They are gods!

82
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,128
- Yes. Take me.
- No, wait!

83
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:00,528
Mala!

84
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,758
- Over here!
- You see that?

85
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,093
- Where are you?
- I'm ready!

86
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,791
Tumi! Tumi, where are you?

87
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:09,594
- I am ready!
- I knew this day would come.

88
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,063
- Take me!
- Over here!

89
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,565
- Over here!
- Over here!

90
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,121
Mommy? Mommy?

91
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,790
Mom, where are you?

92
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,024
- Oh, no!
- Take me!

93
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,657
- Everyone please!
- Where's my daughter?

94
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:24,858
Mala?

95
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,456
Father.

96
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,329
I'm coming!
Father, look out!

97
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,662
No! Please!

98
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,359
Let him go! Take me!

99
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:38,400
It's my fault! Please!

100
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:42,190
Take me! Over here.

101
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:43,256
Please.

102
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,527
Fine.

103
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,090
I'll do it my way.

104
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,124
Come on, take me.
Take me.

105
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,334
Stay where you are!

106
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:21,332
Get away from me...

107
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,135
you monster.

108
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:55,038
Please remain in your homes.

109
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,237
Remain in your homes
for the time being.

110
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:09,706
Stay home!

111
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,238
Everything is under control.

112
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,805
Stay home.

113
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,769
Are you okay? Where's Roven?

114
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:45,777
He was taken by the gods.

115
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,003
Please, Doron, we have to help him.

116
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:49,601
They are not gods.

117
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,303
They are invaders, pretenders.

118
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:53,844
Dangerous.

119
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:55,707
What about my father?

120
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:57,143
How will we get him back?

121
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:59,507
We will do the best we can, Mala.

122
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:02,170
For now, stay inside.

123
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:16,374
Don't touch that!

124
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,242
Lieutenant Stanton, speak to me.

125
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:20,471
Are you still operational?

126
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:24,178
Stop it.
Now, now, now.

127
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,440
There's no need for violence.

128
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,343
Can't we communicate verbally?

129
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:31,277
You speak our language? How?

130
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,245
I have been programmed
with the basic forms

131
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:34,404
of your vernacular, yes.

132
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,003
Does he speak our language?

133
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,546
What? No. No, no, no.
Now listen...

134
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:40,240
I need to talk to him.
Can you teach me his language?

135
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,472
Priorities first. He's dying.

136
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:45,105
Teach me or I won't help.

137
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,409
Lieutenant Stanton won't like this.

138
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:52,206
Hold still. Now, don't blink.

139
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:03,175
My head.

140
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,806
It's full of words.

141
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:08,508
What language is this?
How did you do that?

142
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,774
A simple organic data download.

143
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:14,212
Now, please, you must help,
or he will die.

144
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:15,475
Where do I begin?

145
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,515
Lieutenant Stanton requires oxygen,

146
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,343
a gaseous chemical element.

147
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:22,381
Colorless, odorless, tasteless.

148
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:23,938
Vital for respiration.

149
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:28,381
We need to seal this room
and construct an air generator.

150
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,813
We must identify
an oxygen-gathering plant

151
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:33,247
and incorporate it into this assembly.

152
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,339
Please gather all available plant life.

153
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,814
Hurry. He's beginning to suffocate.

154
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,147
Please initiate the procedure.

155
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:36,118
We did it!

156
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:48,480
What the...

157
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:50,212
Giddy?

158
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,310
Where am I?

159
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:55,409
In a dwelling used
by the natives of this world.

160
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:56,645
I'm a prisoner?

161
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,152
I would say a guest.

162
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,311
Then let's not overstay our welcome.
Get me Earth Force.

163
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:04,012
Negative.
My transmitter was damaged.

164
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:07,178
Great. The ship.
How's my ship?

165
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:10,618
Neutronic conductor overloaded,
stabilizing gears fractured.

166
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:13,414
Yeah. But can she fly?

167
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:14,578
Negative.

168
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:19,582
Giddy, it's one of them.

169
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:22,711
This female's parental unit
was taken by our scout ships.

170
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:25,686
My name is Mala.
Can you help me save my father?

171
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:28,186
Lt... It speaks our language?

172
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,084
Giddy taught me your language.

173
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:31,587
You taught it?

174
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,348
Hey, Giddy,
I never authorized that.

175
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:38,854
My apologies, but it was hard for you
to issue the proper authorization

176
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:41,752
due to your asphyxiation.

177
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,845
Are... Are you being sarcastic?

178
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,320
Impossible, sir.

179
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:47,252
That is not a feature of my programming.

180
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,678
A rescue mission.

181
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:03,014
Bring my father home, please!

182
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,620
Lieutenant Stanton!

183
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,487
Jim, come inside.

184
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,649
Stop!

185
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:17,848
Your lungs can only
withstand this atmosphere

186
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:19,685
for approximately 27.6 seconds.

187
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,586
- Hurry!
- Give or take.

188
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:23,021
- I can't breathe.
- Oh, no.

189
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,283
No!

190
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:29,617
Hold on! I'm coming!

191
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,452
Hold on!

192
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,814
No!

193
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:40,813
Come on.

194
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,789
Come on.

195
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:49,819
Mala, hold on.

196
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:51,983
Help is on its way.

197
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,222
Giddy, pull!

198
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:44,349
Please, forgive him.
He is frightened.

199
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,983
I scare him?

200
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,821
Everything different scares them.

201
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:49,827
They should've never left home.

202
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:53,850
I regret to say they have no choice.

203
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:57,257
This was their world... Earth,

204
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,657
a planet of plenty...

205
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:03,420
but not without its limits.

206
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:05,290
Eventually, humans exhausted

207
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:07,827
their world's natural resources.

208
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:10,191
Two neighboring planets...
Mars and Venus...

209
00:25:10,262 --> 00:25:11,887
were terraformed.

210
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,587
Colonies were established.

211
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:17,594
Two centuries later, the colonies
demanded independence.

212
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,060
It meant war.

213
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:22,490
War.

214
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,154
All three planets were destroyed.

215
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:28,093
Everything was destroyed.

216
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:30,254
The survivors had only one choice:

217
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,158
To travel beyond their solar system

218
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:35,491
to the nearest life-supporting planet
they could find.

219
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:39,290
The journey lasted several generations
and led them here.

220
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,955
They named this planet Terra.

221
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:11,489
Your home?

222
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:19,353
You made this? For me?

223
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:26,861
Synchronous rotations,
balance in the focal points.

224
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:29,659
This is really good.
Where did you learn to do this?

225
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:33,528
All I did was put the pieces together.
They felt right.

226
00:26:33,598 --> 00:26:36,792
You're a natural.

227
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:38,660
Synchronous rotations.

228
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:42,790
Stabilizing gears fractured!

229
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,024
You can...

230
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,793
Help me repair the ship,

231
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:48,832
and I'll take you to your father.

232
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:51,788
Deal?

233
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:36,998
According to my holographic blueprint,
this device meets all required specifications

234
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:40,159
for space travel, approximately.

235
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:46,225
Well, it's not exactly titanium,

236
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:49,359
but if this thing holds,

237
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,662
I can go home.

238
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,668
Remember, we have a deal.

239
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:01,593
What is this?

240
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:04,635
The Ceremony of Life.

241
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:07,862
We thank life for what it brings.

242
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,902
Even if it brings you war?

243
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,459
Earth Force recruited me when I was eight.

244
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:18,628
They recruit every kid on the Ark.

245
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:21,828
Intensive training, hand-to-hand combat,

246
00:28:21,904 --> 00:28:24,166
flight simulation.

247
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:27,362
Be prepared, always on the ready.

248
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:30,960
The best, the finest,
the last line of defense.

249
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:36,033
You wouldn't understand.

250
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:38,127
You only know peace.

251
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,026
Senn.

252
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:46,730
- What are you...
- I had to see you.

253
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:49,169
You've locked yourself up for a week.
What's going on?

254
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:51,795
- Huh?
- Look, I know how you must feel.

255
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:54,394
- But I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

256
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:57,029
I just... I need a little time.
Please go.

257
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:59,367
Mala, the Ceremony of Life started.
Are we still going together?

258
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,195
What's that noise?

259
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,261
- Did you make a new toy for Tuki?
- Senn, wait.

260
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:06,236
I knew you were working on something.

261
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,702
- Mala, run!
- Stop! Stop! You're killing him!

262
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:17,904
- I'll take him...
- No!

263
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,062
I'm okay now.

264
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:25,196
- Please, listen.
- It's one of them!

265
00:29:25,273 --> 00:29:28,671
- I know.
- What? You know?

266
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,036
- We can't let him go.
- He's my friend!

267
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:33,073
- He'll betray us.
- That's enough!

268
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,867
Mala, what... what have you done?

269
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,633
He said he would save my father.

270
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:38,865
Senn.

271
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,667
Senn!

272
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,572
She protected us, Giddy.

273
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:47,505
She defended us against her own kind.

274
00:29:47,574 --> 00:29:49,563
"She"?

275
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:52,039
You said "she," not "it."

276
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:55,699
We have to go.
He'll be back... with company.

277
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:08,037
- What's wrong, Senn?
- It's Mala.

278
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:10,267
It's Mala.
She's protecting one of them.

279
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:13,239
There's one of those invaders
in her house.

280
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,230
They were just here.

281
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:34,774
Did she build that?

282
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:39,636
I believe she did.
Search the home.

283
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:42,401
Find them.

284
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:01,138
Hey, all clear.

285
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:20,275
The elders say a long time ago,

286
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,640
we were apart from nature.

287
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,142
We almost died.

288
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,978
But now we're together,

289
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:31,136
forever, in life.

290
00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:33,235
Fascinating.

291
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:49,909
What are those big things
up in the sky, Mom?

292
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:54,535
Look!

293
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,078
Mala!

294
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,972
Stop it! I'm over here!

295
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:09,103
Cease fire!

296
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,471
Damn it! Stop!

297
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,178
Hold your fire! I'm over here!

298
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,672
Why? Why are they doing this?

299
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:36,181
I don't know.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

300
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,715
Are you sure this is the place?

301
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:16,305
It was right here.

302
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,780
Traces under the recent snow layer
suggest our craft

303
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,611
has been relocated from its position.

304
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:26,241
Someone took it.

305
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,850
Mala, come on! Keep up!

306
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,480
Strange.

307
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:58,711
This whole place kind of gives me the creeps.

308
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:02,080
The strangeness is increasing.

309
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:18,048
What is all this?

310
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,515
Lieutenant Stanton, all signs indicate
the trail leads through there.

311
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,819
Those cloud sailers...
what are they doing?

312
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:54,047
Not celebrating life, that's for sure.

313
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,917
War.

314
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:27,784
I guess our species have
more in common than we thought.

315
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,313
Hey, come on.

316
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,515
- Where are we going?
- Hitching a ride.

317
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:16,551
All right! There's my baby.

318
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:19,988
Looks like they're trying
to figure out how it works.

319
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:22,183
Cockpit's still locked, though,
so we got a chance to...

320
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:23,587
Jim...

321
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:26,453
Put down your weapon.
You're surrounded.

322
00:36:26,524 --> 00:36:28,490
Oh, no.

323
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:33,022
- Stop! Back off, or I'll kill her!
- Jim!

324
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,580
- Jim!
- Play along.

325
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,147
No! What are you doing?

326
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:38,316
- Jim!
- Giddy, now!

327
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:40,221
- On my way.
- No! Let me go!

328
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:45,891
I said get back!

329
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:57,418
Come on, Mala.
They can't see you.

330
00:36:57,493 --> 00:36:59,924
- You can stop fighting now.
- You said you'd kill me.

331
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:01,583
It was just an act, Mala.

332
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,592
I was just pretending.
I wouldn't hurt you.

333
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,024
Honestly.

334
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:06,388
Stop him!

335
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:09,254
- Hurry, Giddy! Hurry!
- Coming.

336
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,816
Open the hatch.

337
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,087
Thank you.

338
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,051
You can do it.
Come on. Hold it together.

339
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:26,552
Come on, baby. Come on.

340
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:32,020
- Not good?
- No. Very not good.

341
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:36,587
- What the...
- Uh-oh.

342
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,059
- Time to go?
- Come on. Just one spark.

343
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:59,061
All right! There we go!

344
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:00,924
Come on, Giddy.
We're going home.

345
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:06,589
Hold tight, okay?
This could be a bumpy ride.

346
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:51,463
Your people... they made this?

347
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:54,928
Yeah. Don't let her looks fool you.

348
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,691
She hasn't aged too well.

349
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:01,424
Central Control,
this is Lieutenant James Stanton.

350
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:03,657
Requesting permission to land.

351
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,754
Lieutenant Stanton.

352
00:39:04,832 --> 00:39:07,094
Nice of you to finally find
your way back to us.

353
00:39:07,165 --> 00:39:10,097
Just had myself
some shore leave, that's all.

354
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:12,960
You're cleared for landing in Deck A.

355
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:14,362
Alert! Alert!

356
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,660
We have depressurization on Deck C!

357
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:18,698
Seal the hatches!
Hull breach!

358
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:21,425
No. Not again.

359
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,857
Welcome to my world.

360
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:41,895
Activate cockpit shield.

361
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,888
Hold on, Mala.

362
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,398
You have to stay here, okay?
It's not safe.

363
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:53,523
Jim, I didn't come all this way to hide.
I have to find my father.

364
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,930
I understand.
I'll take you to him, I promise.

365
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,092
But you have to trust me.
I'll be right back.

366
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,997
Please try not to touch anything, Mala.

367
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:16,991
How did you survive your crash?

368
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:21,433
After my ship went down,
I woke up to find I'd been rescued and...

369
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,127
By whom?

370
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,634
A native.

371
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:26,895
Are the natives hostile?

372
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:28,298
No.

373
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:30,357
Do they have weapons?

374
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:32,230
Yes.

375
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:35,598
Advanced weapons?

376
00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:47,992
"I'll be right back," he says.

377
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:35,528
Oh, no! Mala!

378
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:43,271
Hey, Jim. I missed you, bro.

379
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:45,168
Stewart.

380
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,000
I thought you were a goner.

381
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:50,765
Come on. It takes more than
one rough landing to kill me.

382
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,135
Mom and Dad would be really proud of you.

383
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:56,764
You're the man of the hour, Jim.

384
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,203
I mean, even General Hemmer
wants to meet you.

385
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:00,898
Hemmer?

386
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:02,700
12 dead.

387
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:04,898
A dozen human beings.

388
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:07,996
One tarnished, worn-out security seal

389
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:12,028
way past its recall date, and gone...

390
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:15,129
12 valuable, productive lives.

391
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:17,730
How much longer do we have to wait

392
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:21,261
while this tomb crumbles around us?

393
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,329
When will this council give me the authority

394
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:26,202
to do what must be done?

395
00:42:26,273 --> 00:42:30,036
Your plan calls for nothing less
than the conquest of Terra...

396
00:42:30,107 --> 00:42:33,937
an alien world, an occupied world.

397
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:35,973
My plan, Mr. President,

398
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,836
is the only way to salvage our species.

399
00:42:38,907 --> 00:42:41,703
We are dying.

400
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:44,707
We are the last relics of humanity.

401
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:47,332
The future depends on us.

402
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:55,039
We will have no future
if we repeat the mistakes of the past.

403
00:42:55,108 --> 00:42:57,699
We have superior technology and firepower,

404
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,105
impenetrable defenses.

405
00:43:00,175 --> 00:43:03,164
The mistake would be not to act.

406
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:06,231
Your plan's under consideration, General.

407
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:08,537
We will vote on it.

408
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:12,336
Vote! I ask for action, they vote.

409
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:14,773
What can we expect from civilians, sir?

410
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,832
You're a good soldier, Stewart,

411
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:19,966
and, I understand,
a brother of a war hero.

412
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:22,941
Thank you, sir, but I'm no hero.

413
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,907
At ease, Lieutenant.

414
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:28,238
You're the first man
to distinguish himself in this conflict.

415
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,538
Congratulations.

416
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,098
I've had my eye on you for a while.

417
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:36,200
James Stanton, 32nd Airborne.

418
00:43:36,276 --> 00:43:38,004
How many left in the 32nd?

419
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:39,406
Eight, sir.

420
00:43:39,476 --> 00:43:42,272
One short of a baseball team.

421
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:44,003
Let me guess.

422
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:47,100
Oxygen leaks, faulty fuel lines.

423
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,234
Engine failure?

424
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:53,107
Tired of watching comrades die for nothing?

425
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:57,337
We've come a long way.
Terra is our prize.

426
00:43:57,411 --> 00:43:59,502
A jewel hanging in space.

427
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:03,102
It has real water,
not that chemical junk, and ground.

428
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:07,076
God, I'd like to feel steady ground
under my feet one day.

429
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,509
Kids born on the Ark
have never seen a blade of grass

430
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:13,101
or heard a bird sing.

431
00:44:13,178 --> 00:44:14,939
Have you met the enemy?

432
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,773
I have encountered
the native Terrians, yes, sir.

433
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:20,069
What are they like?

434
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:22,169
They're an interesting species, sir.

435
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:24,677
They're peaceful and they're intelligent.

436
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,143
Their lives are filled with art and music.

437
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:29,270
I meant, can they fight?

438
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:32,039
They're not going to hit us
with paintings, are they?

439
00:44:33,313 --> 00:44:35,870
- I believe they can fight, sir.
- Good.

440
00:44:35,946 --> 00:44:37,969
Then they'll die with honor.

441
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,568
Giddy.

442
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:21,212
Don't be afraid.
I'll get you out of here.

443
00:45:47,516 --> 00:45:49,880
Mala.

444
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,041
Father!

445
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,673
Father, I'm so sorry.

446
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:56,113
I'm gonna get you out of here.

447
00:45:58,283 --> 00:45:59,839
Hey! A floater!

448
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:04,882
This is General Hemmer. Report.

449
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,075
We have a Terrian floater in Section D, sir.

450
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,207
Mala.

451
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:12,082
Get her!

452
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:16,074
I love you.

453
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:26,543
Father! Father!

454
00:46:30,618 --> 00:46:32,516
Father, no!

455
00:46:48,818 --> 00:46:50,750
Here is your proof that Terrians

456
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:53,148
are a hostile, murderous species.

457
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:56,014
Two more human lives lost.

458
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:58,018
According to Lieutenant Stanton's report,

459
00:46:58,085 --> 00:47:00,176
the Terrian was seeking its parent,

460
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:02,048
one of the abductees.

461
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,108
The lines have been drawn.

462
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:07,346
We are human, they are alien.

463
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,011
Do not take sides against your own species.

464
00:47:10,086 --> 00:47:12,678
General, our species has other options.

465
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:15,310
We need time to explore, to think,

466
00:47:15,386 --> 00:47:17,352
before we rush headlong into...

467
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,443
We have no more time.

468
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,714
I have waited patiently
for this council to act,

469
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:27,719
but our people are tired of dying
in the rotting hull of this ark!

470
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:32,083
Therefore, I am assuming command.

471
00:47:32,154 --> 00:47:34,211
The council is hereby dissolved.

472
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:36,809
You do not have the authority, General!

473
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:41,217
If I sin, let future generations judge me.

474
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:43,845
But mark this: Only thanks to me

475
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:46,352
will there be any future generations.

476
00:47:50,155 --> 00:47:52,985
Hey, Jim, where you going, man?

477
00:47:53,055 --> 00:47:55,044
- This is wrong.
- Wrong?

478
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:57,246
- General Hemmer says...
- How can you follow him?

479
00:47:57,322 --> 00:47:59,686
- We're soldiers.
- I obey my commanding officer.

480
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:02,118
Hey, we obey the council.

481
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:05,518
Lieutenant Stanton, I would like you
to join the attack force.

482
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:08,783
Respectfully, sir, I refuse.

483
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:10,845
You're our only war hero.

484
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,717
It's your duty to lead the way.

485
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,778
I lived with the Terrians, sir.

486
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:16,651
They're more like us than you can imagine.

487
00:48:16,722 --> 00:48:18,484
Would it change your decision if I told you

488
00:48:18,556 --> 00:48:23,250
we only have air on the Ark
for another two months?

489
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:27,881
This is mankind's last hope...
the terraformer.

490
00:48:27,957 --> 00:48:30,855
Currently, it provides
sufficient oxygen for the Ark.

491
00:48:30,923 --> 00:48:32,684
Once rooted in Terra's surface,

492
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:36,280
it will convert the planet
to breathable air within seven days.

493
00:48:36,357 --> 00:48:38,584
Seven days, Jim.

494
00:48:38,656 --> 00:48:41,452
Very Biblical, don't you think?

495
00:48:41,524 --> 00:48:44,547
The Ark will have residual air left
for several more weeks,

496
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:46,715
but within that timeframe,

497
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,723
we will have won ourselves a planet.

498
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,586
What about the Terrians?

499
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:53,022
End hologram.

500
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,779
What?

501
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:57,051
Hello?

502
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:58,419
Mala!

503
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,422
Hello?

504
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,389
The alien cannot see or hear us.
Don't worry.

505
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:06,083
The air is pressurized
for Terrian atmosphere.

506
00:49:06,158 --> 00:49:07,885
It can breathe.

507
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,720
A human, however, cannot.

508
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:12,781
Anybody there?

509
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:15,290
Hello?

510
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:16,346
Stewart?

511
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:22,188
Where's Jim?
Do you know who Jim is?

512
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,020
- Where are we?
- Stewart!

513
00:49:25,092 --> 00:49:27,956
- I can't breathe.
- Somebody help me!

514
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:30,752
- Why?
- A test, son.

515
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:33,257
The ultimate test.
Whose side are you on?

516
00:49:33,326 --> 00:49:34,451
Please, say something!

517
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,682
Stop! You're killing him!

518
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:40,055
No. You are.

519
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:42,387
Press that red button,
and you can save him.

520
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:45,085
A demonstration of the terraforming
technique will commence.

521
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,024
Your brother will breathe.

522
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:50,059
The Terrian will not.

523
00:49:50,126 --> 00:49:51,785
Hello! Somebody, please help!

524
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,383
There's gotta be another way.

525
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,290
There isn't. Us or them.

526
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,883
- Somebody, he's suffocating!
- Decide.

527
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:01,893
I can't breathe.

528
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,358
Somebody, please help!

529
00:50:21,027 --> 00:50:22,926
Get away from me!

530
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:25,018
What's happening?

531
00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:34,685
Help! I can't breathe!

532
00:50:37,262 --> 00:50:39,023
Help!

533
00:50:39,095 --> 00:50:40,924
I can't breathe!

534
00:50:40,995 --> 00:50:43,154
I c...

535
00:50:43,229 --> 00:50:45,991
Giddy, save Mala.

536
00:50:46,062 --> 00:50:47,494
Confirm order.

537
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:50,222
Save Mala.

538
00:50:52,562 --> 00:50:53,858
What's that robot doing?

539
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:56,293
- Otham. Cotters.
- Get down!

540
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,758
Mala, your respirator.

541
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:06,088
Giddy.

542
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,095
This way.

543
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:14,129
- Mala.
- You?

544
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:17,095
I'm sorry.

545
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,497
Mala, hurry.

546
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:26,853
- Giddy...
- Follow me.

547
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,692
- Over there!
- This way has a far lower mortality rate.

548
00:51:29,764 --> 00:51:31,423
Stop 'em!

549
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:51,253
Mala, use the control stick.
Fire missiles... now!

550
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:03,089
Incoming missiles!

551
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,257
Mala, stay calm.

552
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:22,933
We're falling too fast!

553
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,224
Prepare to eject.

554
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,425
Mala, grab onto my tail.

555
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:37,689
Oh, no!

556
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:26,497
Hey. About time you joined us.

557
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:31,458
Although, now that you're awake, um,
I don't really know what to say.

558
00:53:31,536 --> 00:53:35,230
I never should've told Doron
about the invader.

559
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:38,826
Mala, you're my best friend,
and I should've trusted you.

560
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:40,130
I'm sorry.

561
00:53:40,203 --> 00:53:42,135
I'm sorry, too.

562
00:53:46,604 --> 00:53:49,331
- Where's Giddy?
- The creature you were with?

563
00:53:49,403 --> 00:53:51,063
It's being held captive by the elders.

564
00:53:51,137 --> 00:53:52,796
I have to save him.

565
00:53:52,871 --> 00:53:55,598
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

566
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,829
He's a tool of the enemy.

567
00:53:56,904 --> 00:53:59,836
I can't release him,
but I can take you to him.

568
00:54:03,071 --> 00:54:05,037
What is this place?

569
00:54:05,104 --> 00:54:09,002
Our past and possibly our future.

570
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:10,367
Warships?

571
00:54:12,238 --> 00:54:16,603
We came close to destroying ourselves.

572
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:21,400
A small group of survivors
formed the eldership.

573
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:24,767
They vowed to keep the past a secret

574
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:28,271
and build a peaceful future.

575
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:31,533
But even gentle beings
must defend themselves when attacked.

576
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,538
We've been watching the newcomers,

577
00:54:39,606 --> 00:54:43,437
but we know nothing of their plans
or intentions.

578
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:52,333
You're the only one who has
been inside and returned.

579
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:55,600
No, I'm not the only one.

580
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:57,764
Please, help.

581
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,738
- Giddy!
- Honestly!

582
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:02,637
- What are you doing to him?
- We must dissect it to see how it works.

583
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:06,367
- Oh, dear.
- He is my friend. He saved my life.

584
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:09,271
Actually, Lieutenant Stanton saved your life.

585
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:12,432
- He ordered me to protect you.
- Jim?

586
00:55:13,907 --> 00:55:16,806
- I must say, this is not very pleasant.
- Leave him alone!

587
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:19,340
We need information on the enemy's
strength and numbers.

588
00:55:19,407 --> 00:55:23,237
- This machine might hold the answer.
- So ask him, don't torture him.

589
00:55:23,307 --> 00:55:25,865
Will you help us?

590
00:55:25,941 --> 00:55:27,497
I cannot.

591
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,097
Earth Force created me.

592
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:31,334
Jim commanded you to protect me.

593
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:34,238
- Will you disobey his orders?
- Negative.

594
00:55:34,308 --> 00:55:37,706
But if Earth Force invades,
they'll destroy all life on this world,

595
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,900
including me.

596
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:42,373
Affirmative.

597
00:55:42,442 --> 00:55:46,772
So the only way to protect me
is to help us defeat Earth Force.

598
00:55:47,942 --> 00:55:51,238
Well, if... Mala, l...

599
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:54,298
Lieutenant Stanton...

600
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:57,604
Your logic is tricky, difficult to compute.

601
00:56:00,909 --> 00:56:02,398
I will protect you.

602
00:56:11,143 --> 00:56:13,938
Hey, Jim, look, I'm sorry
about what happened

603
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,600
in the enviro-chamber,
but Hemmer said...

604
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:17,938
How can you defend him, even now?

605
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,033
He said it was the only way

606
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,974
that we could be sure of your loyalties.

607
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:27,575
Sir!

608
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:31,141
My apologies, sir.

609
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:34,699
I believe the Terrian must have
reprogrammed my robot

610
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:36,402
during our captivity.

611
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:40,773
Like you said, interesting species.

612
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:44,072
Full of surprises.

613
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:47,372
We've got a few surprises
up our sleeve, too.

614
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,240
You're on the terraforming campaign,
Lieutenant.

615
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:53,277
- That's an order.
- Sir!

616
00:56:58,112 --> 00:57:00,169
I don't know what happened
to you on Terra,

617
00:57:00,246 --> 00:57:02,269
but this is war,

618
00:57:02,346 --> 00:57:05,073
and I'd feel a lot better
knowing you had my back.

619
00:57:05,145 --> 00:57:07,407
I've always looked out for you, kid.

620
00:57:07,479 --> 00:57:09,342
I always will.

621
00:57:09,412 --> 00:57:12,901
Question is, will Hemmer?

622
00:58:09,882 --> 00:58:12,848
The aliens breathe something called oxygen,

623
00:58:12,915 --> 00:58:14,904
so our atmosphere is poisonous to them.

624
00:58:14,982 --> 00:58:16,505
We must strike early while we...

625
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:18,639
And that's where the terraformer should land.

626
00:58:18,716 --> 00:58:21,273
The formations of oxygen
can spread more rapidly

627
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:24,247
to the native population centers,
neutralizing them.

628
00:58:24,315 --> 00:58:27,281
Air filters here and here

629
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:29,338
can alter your atmosphere into oxygen...

630
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:31,211
Before the enemy can strike the terraformer,

631
00:58:31,283 --> 00:58:35,874
we must engage and destroy
their primitive aerial attack force.

632
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,749
Men and women of Earth Force,

633
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:46,146
you hold the entire future of our species
in your hands.

634
00:58:46,216 --> 00:58:48,205
Brothers and sisters,

635
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:50,476
we are engaged in a struggle for survival.

636
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,914
Not only our own, but for our world.

637
00:58:53,984 --> 00:58:58,746
Every living being on our planet
depends on us.

638
00:58:58,817 --> 00:59:02,477
If we fail, we fail them, too.

639
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:06,544
Your actions over the next few hours

640
00:59:06,618 --> 00:59:09,413
will either win ourselves a new home

641
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:11,916
or doom us to extinction.

642
00:59:11,985 --> 00:59:14,473
I believe... I must believe

643
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,414
that in our darkest hour,

644
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:20,008
the very qualities which made us great
will make us strong...

645
00:59:20,085 --> 00:59:25,211
that love and mercy can triumph
over hate and violence once more.

646
00:59:25,285 --> 00:59:28,274
Be loyal, be brave.

647
00:59:28,352 --> 00:59:33,478
Remember who you are
and what you fight for...

648
00:59:33,552 --> 00:59:35,381
Terra!

649
00:59:37,852 --> 00:59:41,579
- Hey, take care of yourself up there.
- You, too, Jim.

650
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:22,245
- Are you ready?
- No, not really.

651
01:00:45,022 --> 01:00:46,147
Return fire!

652
01:00:54,055 --> 01:00:55,043
Down!

653
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:58,088
The Terrians are flying new ships
with more powerful weapons.

654
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,280
No one said we wouldn't
suffer casualties, Lieutenant.

655
01:01:01,356 --> 01:01:04,481
Any soldier that dies today
will live on in history.

656
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:05,544
Press on.

657
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:20,651
Closing in on target.

658
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,713
Closing. Closing.

659
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:29,550
It's a trap!

660
01:01:37,624 --> 01:01:40,784
There's too many! I need backup!

661
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:51,890
They're coming straight at me!

662
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,890
Help! I need help!
I need backup!

663
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:18,788
- Launch terraformer.
- Aye, sir.

664
01:02:28,993 --> 01:02:29,981
No.

665
01:03:00,327 --> 01:03:02,589
Brace yourselves, men.

666
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:15,688
What is that?

667
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:25,491
Now.

668
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:36,286
Senn?

669
01:03:36,363 --> 01:03:38,295
It's really happening.

670
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:50,522
0.5% of oxygen produced.

671
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:55,824
1%, 3%, 5%.

672
01:03:55,897 --> 01:03:58,659
Half a million cubic pounds
of oxygen generated.

673
01:03:58,731 --> 01:04:00,060
Accelerate.

674
01:04:03,497 --> 01:04:06,122
Concentrate your forces
on destroying that machine.

675
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,788
Follow me!

676
01:04:12,564 --> 01:04:15,724
Gunfighters approaching on your left.

677
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:17,992
Mala, watch out.

678
01:04:22,265 --> 01:04:23,754
Senn, I need help!

679
01:04:29,164 --> 01:04:30,960
Mala, don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

680
01:04:40,332 --> 01:04:42,923
Production up to 7%.

681
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:45,397
Minor damages on filters G through M.

682
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:47,728
- Accelerate.
- Sir?

683
01:04:48,866 --> 01:04:51,855
Sir, production of oxygen
at an advanced rate could be risky.

684
01:04:51,933 --> 01:04:53,126
Do it!

685
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,262
That's it! You're damaging it!

686
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,060
General, we've lost air filters A through F.

687
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:05,531
Production is down.

688
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,997
Divert resources to the remaining filters.

689
01:05:08,066 --> 01:05:10,396
Accelerate to maximum.

690
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:12,626
If we compress the terraforming process,

691
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,598
we'll be leaving ourselves
extremely vulnerable to combustion.

692
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:17,326
That is a direct order!

693
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,264
- Follow it!
- Sir, yes, sir.

694
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,300
Second wave, attack!

695
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:25,231
Phase 1 up to 25%.

696
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:28,733
1.2 million cubic pounds of oxygen generated.

697
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,358
But the terraforming filters
are under a lot of strain.

698
01:05:31,434 --> 01:05:33,798
How long before the process is completed?

699
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:36,891
In 12 minutes, the chain reaction
will be irreversible.

700
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:38,627
Hang in there, beautiful.

701
01:05:43,368 --> 01:05:45,596
Call in the reinforcements.

702
01:05:45,668 --> 01:05:49,066
Orders received, General.
We're on our way.

703
01:05:49,135 --> 01:05:52,067
Lock and load, people.
It's crunch time.

704
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,293
I can't shake this guy!

705
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:08,760
Hang in there, Jim.
I got this one.

706
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:16,426
Jim, are you okay?

707
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:18,594
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a scrape.

708
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,162
I've got a clean shot.

709
01:06:29,137 --> 01:06:30,568
Mala, hostiles from above.

710
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:40,328
Sir, we're decimating the Terrian resistance.

711
01:06:40,404 --> 01:06:41,734
Good.

712
01:06:41,804 --> 01:06:45,236
Keep production at maximum.
Let's finish this.

713
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:20,864
I see an opening. I'm going in.

714
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:30,095
- Mala, I can't shake 'em!
- Hold on. I'll be right there.

715
01:07:42,873 --> 01:07:44,930
No! Senn!

716
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:56,170
No! No!

717
01:08:01,641 --> 01:08:02,937
No!

718
01:08:07,008 --> 01:08:09,838
Enemy fighter on my tail.
I need backup.

719
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:13,333
Hang tight. I'm on my way.

720
01:08:14,475 --> 01:08:17,703
Sir, 90% of oxygen dispersed.

721
01:08:17,775 --> 01:08:20,207
Five minutes until completion of campaign.

722
01:08:28,175 --> 01:08:30,334
- You?
- Oh, no.

723
01:08:37,509 --> 01:08:38,907
Jim, where are you?

724
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,209
Just hold on, Stewart.
I'm almost there.

725
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:47,266
Mala? What?

726
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,503
Jim, what are you doing?
Just shoot!

727
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,673
I can't hold on much longer! Shoot!

728
01:09:29,212 --> 01:09:31,734
What are you doing, Jim?

729
01:09:37,379 --> 01:09:40,243
Wait, wait, wait! Jim!

730
01:09:40,312 --> 01:09:43,745
Incoming, sir!
It's one of ours!

731
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:46,471
Stanton?
Pull away. Pull away!

732
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:50,269
Fire at that ship!

733
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:37,077
Come on!

734
01:12:49,587 --> 01:12:52,178
- Congratulations, Mala.
- Good job.

735
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,476
Mala! Mala!

736
01:13:01,488 --> 01:13:03,113
Senn!

737
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:07,115
- Mala.
- I thought you were dead.

738
01:13:07,187 --> 01:13:09,881
Oh, me, too.
I mean, you, too.

739
01:13:09,954 --> 01:13:13,751
You did well, Mala.
Very well.

740
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:15,616
It wasn't me.

741
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:17,950
He saved us.

742
01:13:18,022 --> 01:13:19,988
He saved us all.

743
01:13:20,055 --> 01:13:24,511
But now they have no food,
no water, no air.

744
01:13:24,588 --> 01:13:28,146
There's nothing for them to do
but just wait for the end.

745
01:13:28,222 --> 01:13:30,745
Never lose hope, Mala.

746
01:13:30,822 --> 01:13:33,686
There are always alternatives.

747
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:59,281
- Hey, Senn.
- Hey, what?

748
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:01,618
Race you.

749
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:05,088
I knew you were gonna say that.
I don't know why I even answered.

750
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:16,088
