00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,295
Yeah, I know that...

2
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:56,692
and for every 9 stocks
that fell, 8 advanced...

3
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,892
stop acting like it's
fucking Black Friday.

4
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:02,465
Yeah... alright, well then,
why don't you go back with that...

5
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:06,170
huh, what's his name? That... huh, asshole
who talked you into going on with Enron.

6
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:08,742
Yeah...

7
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:11,210
you know what?
Fuck you, too.

8
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,659
Della?

9
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,762
Della, honey?

10
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:38,834
What?

11
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:41,028
What's the matter?

12
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,038
What's the matter?

13
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:46,303
Honey, you wanna tell me
what it is you do all day?

14
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,642
- What do you mean?
- Well...

15
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:56,143
Honey,
look at the goddamn place, okay?

16
00:04:56,986 --> 00:05:01,477
There's kid-shit all over the place,
wall to goddamn wall.

17
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,351
We do the best...
we do the best we can, I mean...

18
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:10,017
The best you can? Why don't you
just do what I tell you to do?

19
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,812
- Stop.
- Can I ask you a question?

20
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,802
- What in the hell happened to you?
- Stop.

21
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:16,502
You don't even try
to put yourself together anymore.

22
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:20,907
I don't know what you
want me to say? We've got kids.

23
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:25,337
Look, I want you to hear this,
I want you to keep the house clean!

24
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,643
Oh... god.

25
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:33,808
Terry got an "A" in math.

26
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:36,153
- Goddamn it, Della!
- Don't.

27
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:38,890
- Don't what?
- No! It's her favorite doll.

28
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:40,993
- What?
- You'll have to fix her.

29
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:42,426
I have to what?

30
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,963
- You'll have to fix her.
- I will have to what?

31
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,259
You'll have...

32
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:50,757
That's all you worry about.
Is these kids.

33
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:56,669
I will have to what? Would you look
at me when I'm talking to you?

34
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:58,371
Stop it!

35
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:03,879
Why don't you stop it? And don't you
tell me what the fuck to do! Okay?

36
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,346
- Stop it.
- You understand me?

37
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:08,575
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?

38
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,942
Don't break my arm.

39
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,846
Don't tell me what to do!

40
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:27,290
Why you fuck with me? And you do
that every fucking time?

41
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,464
So, what're we supposed to do now?

42
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:41,072
I'm... um...

43
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,637
I'm out of wrapping paper.

44
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:53,679
It's okay.

45
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:56,481
Come on, it's okay.

46
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,436
Okay, it's okay!
How are you doing?

47
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:11,666
I want a Nintendo Wii
for Christmas, mom.

48
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:14,866
It's only a few hours
till Christmas.

49
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:17,813
- Can I get an American Girl doll?
- Oh, guys.

50
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:20,013
You wrote your letters
to Santa already.

51
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:23,243
I don't think another letter
will make it to the North Pole.

52
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:28,721
- We will be okay, right?
- We're always okay.

53
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:30,856
We're always okay.

54
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:34,154
- No matter what happens.
- No matter what happens.

55
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:41,933
Okay.

56
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,133
Alright...

57
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:45,528
Okay... I'll be back
in just a little while, okay?

58
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,204
- Okay.
- Alrighty.

59
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:51,007
Now, promise me one thing, that...
Listen... listen, hey, you... you...

60
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,709
you have to brush your teeth.

61
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,940
And I want you in the bed
after your treat, all right?

62
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,245
- Okay
- Okay...

63
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,174
I'll see you later.

64
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,442
Mom!

65
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,255
I made a secret drawing for you.

66
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:09,953
- Oh, I love your drawings.
- Don't look at it yet!

67
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,191
Okay. I'll save it for later.
How about that?

68
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:17,663
Bye, sweetie.

69
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:05,413
And you can kiss my ass, Kenneth.

74
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:38,844
Hi, Meghan.
It's Della Myers.

75
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,642
<i>Hi.</i>

76
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,384
<i>Are you calling about Spanish?
It's been cancelled.</i>

77
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:45,584
No, no, I knew about that.

78
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,788
It's about next week's
mechanics class.

79
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:53,424
Would you just pass on to Mike,
that I won't be there just this once?

80
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:55,327
<i>No problem.</i>

81
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,021

- Great.</i>

- Hey, what's up, Cassie?</i>

83
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:31,960
<i>I'm over at the mall. What is
it we need to get for Pilates?</i>

84
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:36,015
One of those rubber bands.
I'm headed over there myself.

85
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:39,834
<i>Do yourself a favor. Turn around.
It's hell over here.</i>

86
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,093
Hey, my cell's dying.

87
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,000
You know, I... I... damn!

88
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:46,905
You know, I left... I left
the charger in the other car.

89

<i>Silly you. Let me pick you up
something. Save you the trip.</i>

- Are you sure?</i>

91
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:54,880
No, no... it's okay.

92
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:59,350
Cassie... um, can we meet...
huh, for a drink?

93

<i>You still there?
Your phone is breaking up.</i>

94
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,287
Damn.

95
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:17,431
You're kidding me.
My God!

96
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,651
Damn it!

97
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,251
Damn!

98
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,656
Come on.

99
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,391
You think you're gonna
take my spot, think again!

100
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:52,490
<i>I've been waiting now
for 3o minutes! It's Christmas!</i>

101
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,005
Excuse me. You know where
I can find a parking space?

102
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,605
I mean this is ridiculous!

103
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:02,275
Ma'am, there is absolutely
nothing close by.

104
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,542
Even the valet's backed up.

105
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,877
- You might wanna try further up.
- Where? Over there?

106
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:10,373
Yeah...
Now, please keep it moving.

107
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,141
Let's go. Come on.

108
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,049
Go!

109
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:28,396
Come on!

110
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,423
Jerk!

111
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,166
What a jerk!

112
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,558
Over there.

113
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:04,400
Smile.

114
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:05,871
Good girl.

115
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:07,303
Merry Christmas!

116
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:20,676
- Would you like to try Chanel No. 5?
- No, thank you.

117
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:22,676
<i>We're breaking up,
you hear me?</i>

118
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,947
- Can I help you with that?
- No.

119
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:04,657
No, I was just looking.
Thank you.

120
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,363
Hi.

121
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:12,921
Could I have a hot tea, please?

122
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:17,464
And one chocolate biscotti.

123
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:20,028
Huh, milk with dark chocolate?

124
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,008
No, just the tea.

125
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,407
Name?

126
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:26,440
Oh, Della.

127
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,173
Two "L"s.

128
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,610
2 dollars and 65 cents.

129
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,058
Thank you.

130
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,039
Della?

131
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,473
Is that you?

132
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:03,777
Lynn? Lynn Monroe.

133
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:07,475
- Hi.
- I haven't seen you since college!

134
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,082
Right.

135
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,983
You married that handsome jock
and we never heard from you again.

136
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:16,956
You live around here?

137
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:20,193
We just bought this divine house
in Pleasant Valley. You know it?

138
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:21,825
Yes, I do.

139
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:25,196
It's perfect for the kids.
They practically walk to school.

140
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,831
We've got a great backyard.

141
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,799
We're thinking
of putting a pool in it.

142
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,959
They'll love that!

143
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:33,900
Enough about me.
How are you?

144
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:36,039
Fine.

145
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,203
I have two children,
Terry and Tammi... Twins.

146
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,345
Oh...

147
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:45,316
We're celebrating tonight.
David just been promoted.

148
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,743
So I... had to buy this
gorgeous black teddy.

149
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,752
Oh...

150
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:53,277
It is... It's gorgeous.

151
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:56,858
- It's been nice talking to you.
- You too.

152
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:59,020
I've got to get my hair done.

153
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:01,596
- See you later.
- Yes.

154
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,163
See you.

155
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,626
Mitch!

156
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,301
Here you are.

157
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,704
- Which one would you like?
- That one.

158
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,280
That one?

159
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,282
That one?

160
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:07,078
That's the one?

161
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:09,792
- Thanks.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

162
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:11,383
Merry Christmas!

163
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,593
- Hello.
- Hi.

164
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:28,039
21 dollars and 69 cents, please.

165
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:31,170
- There you go.
- Thank you.

166
00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:38,582
I'm sorry.
It's been declined.

167
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,482
Do you have another card?

168
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,487
Um... no, I don't.

169
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:45,855
Um...

170
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,555
Seventeen...

171
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:52,389
twenty-one...

172
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,390
There.

173
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,203
<i>It's Christmas Eve,
and the mall is now closed.</i>

174
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:02,136
<i>Happy Holidays, everyone.</i>

175
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:15,111
 This day is borne a Savior
Of a pure, virgin bride 

176
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:21,181
 To free all who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might 

177
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:26,625
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy 

178
00:22:27,862 --> 00:22:31,363
 Oh, tidings 

179
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:37,460
 Of comfort and joy 

180
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,525
Shit.

181
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:12,595
Shit. What now?

182
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:17,602
Excuse me?

183
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,697
I've got a gun.

184
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:23,169
How's about I aim it
at your pussy first?

185
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:31,316
Why don't you just back the car up?

186
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:33,250
That's not gonna happen.

187
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:37,457
What... what're you doing? Or what're
you playing? I don't know this game.

188
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,923
Trust me, it's not a game.

189
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:42,561
That's right, how about you
shut up, bitch, and eat a dick?

190
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:45,831
When you're done eating, we're gonna
staple your bitch-mouth and close it.

191
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:47,263
Right, Chuckie?

192
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:53,503
"Chuckie"? Is that for real?

193
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:56,573
At least your parents
had a sense of humor.

194
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,308
I don't have any parents.

195
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,968
I named myself.

196
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,344
Do you have a beef
with us, honey?

197
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:05,459
Because slipping an insinuating
note underneath my wipers...

198
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,950
is an invitation to war
to me and my soldiers.

199
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:11,154
You had to park
like an asshole now...

200
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:13,087
we wouldn't be
standing here, would we?

201
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:15,389
- Watch your mouth, lady!
- Get away from me!

202
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,085
You know you're just digging
your grave deeper.

203
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,594
- Where you going?
- Fuck you!

204
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:24,498
- No way, fuck you.
- No, fuck you!

205
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:26,332
Is any trouble here, ma'am?

206
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,536
Not if these punks
move their car!

207
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:30,469
Yeah, what's the deal, Barney Fife?

208
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,668
Okay, boys. Let's back the car up
and let the lady out.

209
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,603
How's that sound, squirt?

210
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:40,541
No, we're not in the mood.
In fact...

211
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,048
why don't you mind
your own fucking business...

212
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,949
go direct some traffic
or something, huh?

213
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,749
I'm gonna make this my business.

214
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,790
Now, why don't you kids, pile back
into your piece-of-shit car...

215
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,057
and get the fuck out of my mall?

216
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,890
Didn't you hear what I said?
You hear me?

217
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,047
You hear me, daddy?
Get the fuck outta here!

218
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:01,931
- Put the gun down.
- Get the fuck outta here!

219
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:04,597
- Put the gun down!
- I said, get the fuck outta here, bitch!

220
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:07,695
- Put the gun down!
- You want me to put it down?

221
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:10,028
Make me, bitch!
I said make me...

222
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,906
- Shit.
- Motherfucker.

223
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:32,379
She's getting away!

224
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:39,498
<i>Fuck, man! She's probably on the
phone with 5-0 already, Chuckie!</i>

225
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:42,939
What the fuck!
We're going down for this shit!

226
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,439
Don't worry about it, nigga.
Don't worry! Don't worry!

227
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,263
Don't fucking call me "nigga", Chuckie.
You ain't earned the right.

228
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,863
That goes for all you niggers.

229
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:51,141
Huey, Huey, take it easy, we got it.

230
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:52,810
Take it easy.
We got it!

231
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:55,081
The world's like this.
Come on, get in, get in the car!

232
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:56,080
Now.

233
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:58,481
Move over, Thomas!
Come on! Move!

234
00:25:58,482 --> 00:26:01,883
- The cop went down hard.
- Goddamn it, Thomas. Shut up!

235
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:49,759
My God.

236
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:20,920
Oh, God.

237
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,755
Hell, no.

238
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:26,468
- Damn!
- What?

239
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:29,062
My new Keds they're all dirty, man!

240
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:40,114
Get up there and push!

241
00:29:40,115 --> 00:29:43,310
The car's got nowhere else to go, Chuckie,
the road ends just up ahead.

242
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:46,482
There's nothing but half build
houses and trees.

243
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:49,122
Ditch the car, man.

244
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,021
We've got a witness on the loose.

245
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:53,592
Trust me.

246
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:56,331
You won't hear a peep outta little
miss red, after tonight, alright?

247
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,631
She's going down, execution style.

248
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:00,463
What if she's gone already?

249
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,133
She's not gone.

250
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,404
There's no place for her to go.

251
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,634
<i>Damn. She took out that barrier.</i>

252
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:23,108
<i>It's gonna be impossible to
find her, even if she is around.</i>

253
00:30:23,787 --> 00:30:25,845
<i>Come on, guys. Let's go!</i>

254
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:29,590
Maybe we can hotwire the truck.

255
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,886
I think, I'll find you now, cunt!

256
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,827
Well, we're caught up with them things,
like... like in a soap opera.

257
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,088
We need to just bail, blast out of town,
act like we was never even around.

258
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:18,937
- Vingh, get over here.
- How much "Kill" you been smoking?

259
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:21,791
Come on, man. No one cares
about a fucking Rent-A-Pig!

260
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,609
He's just collateral damage
to the people at the mall.

261
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,276
She's the only witness!

262
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:28,410
Come on, if we hit the road
right now...

263
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:30,945
we could be miles away
before they find you.

264
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:33,183
We could be sipping cold beer
swimming in the Atlantic,

265
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,883
just like you promised me.

266
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:38,086
Huey, come here.

267
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:40,721
Come here.

268
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:46,495
Remember how I broke
you outta that home?

269
00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:49,054
I was there for you, right?

270
00:31:49,055 --> 00:31:50,063
I was there.

271
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:52,053
You trust me, right?

272
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,957
- Right?
- Yeah.

273
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:59,939
All we gotta do is find that bitch...
and we're outta here, I promise. okay?

274
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,274
That's it.

275
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:02,866
There's her Ford!

276
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:18,724
Somebody tell her mom
to lay out her black dress.

277
00:32:18,725 --> 00:32:20,257
Why? Is she dead?

278
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:22,027
No, I looked,
she went through her trunk.

279
00:32:22,028 --> 00:32:23,255
She's here.

280
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:25,323
She's hiding somewhere.

281
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:29,857
She left her purse.
It's all in here. Her cell phone.

282
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,701
<i>Where are you?</i>

283
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:35,036
<i>- Her battery gave out.
- We're gonna find you!</i>

284
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:37,666
There she is!

285
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,729
Go that way! That way!

286
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:03,460
Fuck!

287
00:33:05,098 --> 00:33:07,498
- You see her down there?
- No, man.

288
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:11,529
- She must have gone around.
- She vanished.

289
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:14,096
Check each one of these houses.

290
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:18,001
Split up. Spread out!

291
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,414
Della!

292
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,498
We know who you are!

293
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:48,325
You can't hide, honey.

294
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:11,521
We're not gonna give up,
till we find you, Della.

295
00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:17,562
You're trapped, Della.

296
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:22,991
We're gonna find you!

297
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:39,137
Where's Little Red Riding Hood?

298
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:53,593
You all hear that?
Check the house next door!

299
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,062
Move it!

300
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:29,950
Yeah.

301
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,748
Ah'ha...

302
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:56,150
There she is!

303
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:59,342
- Hey there, we got you.
- You're dead, bitch.

304
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:01,052
Time to say goodbye.

305
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:02,552
Hey!

306
00:36:02,553 --> 00:36:03,952
Shh...

307
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:07,087
You hear that?
Did you hear that?

308
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:10,988
The sound of the waves!
You hear that? Sounds good, right?

309
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:14,229
Yeah, Chuckie.
Sounds great.

310
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:20,471
Don't worry.

311
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,373
When we're done with you, we'll send
you back in your junk to mister...

312
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:28,847
You won't play nice?
You fucking wanna play?

313
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:31,146
Back off! Hold back!

314
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,008
Give me a minute.

315
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:39,353
I'm sorry about that.

316
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:42,184
I'm sorry.

317
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:44,849
You okay?

318
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,763
Chill out.

319
00:36:47,764 --> 00:36:49,457
You all right?

320
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,359
Hey, settle down!

321
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:53,093
Settle down!

322
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:56,428
You all right? Settle down.

323
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:59,499
You must be wondering,
how we know your name?

324
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:04,601
You messed up, Della.
You left your purse in the car.

325
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,442
Give me that.

326
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:15,346
Your photo
doesn't do you justice.

327
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:16,924
He's right.

328
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:20,518
- You look better in person, ma'am.
- You do.

329
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:22,749
You look good.

330
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,025
You're not gonna
need it anymore.

331
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:43,474
What's in that box, Della?

332
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:45,874
Huh?

333
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:48,316
What's in the box?

334
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:51,353
What's in the box, girl?

335
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:54,856
What's up, Chuckie? Do you think
she's carrying some cash?

336
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:57,081
Some jewelry or something?

337
00:37:57,493 --> 00:37:58,960
I don't know.

338
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:01,019
I don't know.

339
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,824
Maybe she cashed in
her life savings.

340
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,329
Planning on running away?

341
00:38:07,903 --> 00:38:09,570
Start a new life?

342
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:11,072
Is that it, Della?

343
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:13,837
You got enough scratch
in there to buy us off?

344
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,135
Huh?
Open the box.

345
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,836
Open the box!

346
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:20,113
- Open it!
- Okay.

347
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:22,714
Why don't you take the box.
We're gonna kill her anyway.

348
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:23,714
No...

349
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:26,445
I'll open up the box.

350
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:35,354
You know what, man?

351
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:37,961
She ain't got nothing.

352
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,894
Just take that pussy
and get going.

353
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:45,834
I got her!

354
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:48,005
Go down here!

355
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:49,437
Look out, Huey!

356
00:38:54,411 --> 00:38:56,431
- What the fuck, nigga?
- Shut up!

357
00:38:56,432 --> 00:38:58,881
- What, Chuckie?
- I said, shut up!

358
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:01,414
Don't use the N-word.

359
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:03,843
You ain't representing.

360
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:08,890
Huey?

361
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:10,590
Huey?

362
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:14,127
- What did you do?
- What'd you mean?

363
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,058
<i>- Yeah...
- Stop fucking around.</i>

364
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:21,124
- Hey!
- Huey?

365
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,006
- What's up, brother?
- Please, forgive me.

366
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,939
Quit goofing around.

367
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,807
Huey?

368
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,997
Hey!

369
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:35,807
Huey?

370
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:37,807
Hey, Huey.

371
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:42,475
What's up?

372
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:46,956
Oh, Fuck!

373
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:49,390
Fuck! Fuck!

374
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:53,090
Huey?

375
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:56,833
- Huey?
- Hey, man, come on!

376
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,270
What the fuck did you do?
Get off him!

377
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,970
- I didn't kill him.
- Huey?

378
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:03,006
You fucking
stepped on his face, fucker!

379
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,406
Don't fucking touch me!

380
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:07,933
- I didn't kill him! She did.
- Get the fuck off!

381
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:12,442
God! Huey!

382
00:40:13,215 --> 00:40:16,513
- I'm gonna get that bitch!
- You let her go!

383
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:19,150
You piece of shit!
Where the fuck is she?

384
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:35,699
Fuck.

385
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,952
<i>Della!</i>

386
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:38,547
<i>Della!</i>

387
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:50,831
<i>Della!</i>

388
00:42:28,268 --> 00:42:29,931
Della!

389
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:03,931
Della!

390
00:43:52,068 --> 00:43:53,831
<i>Della!</i>

391
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:43,272
 I guess you are right
When we talked in the heat 

392
00:44:43,273 --> 00:44:48,092
 There's no room for the weak
No room for the weak 

393
00:44:49,597 --> 00:44:52,793
 Where will it end? 

394
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,463
 Where will it end? 

395
00:44:57,037 --> 00:44:59,936
 Where will it end? 

396
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,301
 Where will it end? 

397
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:24,082
 This is the room
The start of it all 

398
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:28,063
 They're talking to you
I remember it all 

399
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:31,662
 I've seen the night
Filled with blood and pain 

400
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:35,503
 And the bodies obtained
And the bodies obtained 

401
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:37,801
 And the bodies obtained 

402
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,133
What're you doing?

403
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:48,145
It's a tribute.

404
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:49,906
A gesture.

405
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:54,449
 Where will it end? 

406
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:57,952
That'll wake up every
fucking cop in Podunk county!

407
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:02,126
It's for him.

408
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:04,957
It's for Huey.

409
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:35,647
I didn't mean it, Huey.

410
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:39,384
What did you say?

411
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:42,795
What?

412
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:45,328
I... I didn't mean to kill him.

413
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:48,901
Get away from him.
Get the fuck away from him!

414
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:52,861
Get the fuck away from him!

415
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:57,803
Get away from him!
Get away! Get the fuck away!

416
00:46:58,178 --> 00:47:00,612
- Get away!
- Fuck you!

417
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:06,116
<i>I'm gonna fucking get you!</i>

418
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:08,213
Do you hear me, Della?

419
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:10,181
I'm gonna fucking get you!

420
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:43,881
God.

421
00:47:59,867 --> 00:48:02,630
MOMMY WE LOVE YOU

422
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,993
God.

423
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,793
<i>Della!</i>

424
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:47,437
<i>Della?</i>

425
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:10,293
- Wait.
- Huh?

426
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:11,761
It's "Bulgari".

427
00:49:11,997 --> 00:49:15,167
- What's "Bulgari"?
- It's a perfume, dude.

428
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:18,192
It smells more
like that No. 5 shit.

429
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,638
- "Chanel".
- No, it's "Bulgari".

430
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,732
My dad's bitch bathes in it.

431
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,192
It's blood.

432
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,557
It's her blood.

433
00:49:52,602 --> 00:49:54,261
Maybe she's hurt.

434
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:06,001
This way.

435
00:50:11,118 --> 00:50:13,449
Go, go, go!

436
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,453
<i>Watch out, dude.</i>

437
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,162
<i>Look out!</i>

438
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:31,199
Damn!

439
00:50:45,116 --> 00:50:47,178
- Oh, shit!
- What happened?

440
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:49,674
I stepped in the fucking stream!

441
00:50:55,759 --> 00:50:58,993
- That is raw.
- Who cares, man?

442
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:01,859
Nobody gives a shit
if we live or die.

443
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:05,734
Quit playing with the fucking flashlight.
We are stumbling around in the dark!

444
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:08,463
He who finds it, shines it, Chuckie.

445
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,397
- Let's go!
- Where the hell is she?

446
00:51:11,406 --> 00:51:13,965
- Shut up and move it!
- Damn!

447
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:16,773
Let's go, guys. Come on!

448
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,602
There she is!

449
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,352
Don't let her get away!

450
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:39,060
Huey?

451
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:40,922
Is that you, Huey?

452
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:43,429
I saw him
in those trees, right there!

453
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,041
Sure you did.

454
00:52:03,952 --> 00:52:06,079
Son of a bitch!

455
00:52:08,257 --> 00:52:11,425
I'm gonna get you now, bitch!

456
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,431
You're ain't putting
anything over on me!

457
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,005
You fucking bitch!

458
00:52:33,145 --> 00:52:34,975
Son of a bitch!

459
00:53:02,371 --> 00:53:04,428
Time's up, you bitch.

460
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,417
God!

461
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,256
Thomas!

462
00:54:02,257 --> 00:54:03,659
Shhh...

463
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,091
Quiet.

464
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,561
Thomas is gone, Chuckie.

465
00:54:13,968 --> 00:54:15,493
I can feel it.

466
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:20,269
He's probably got her strung up
on her Penada by now.

467
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:23,733
There's something over here.

468
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:26,235
Looks like a body.

469
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:36,586
It's a tree stump,
you dumb Wonton.

470
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:06,746
Thomas...

471
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:21,424
She's gonna kill both of us too.

472
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:23,485
We're all gonna die here.

473
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:29,935
No gun can kill
a spirit gone bad.

474
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:33,196
She's gone bad.
She's gone bad.

475
00:55:34,642 --> 00:55:36,073
Gone bad.

476
00:55:38,913 --> 00:55:41,003
I'm gonna get this girl.

477
00:55:49,988 --> 00:55:51,749
I'm sorry.

478
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,722
I'm so sorry.

479
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:11,364
Where are you, God?
Where are you? Where are you?

480
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:15,769
All I wanna do
is see my babies!

481
00:56:18,713 --> 00:56:22,843
Where are you?
Where are you?

482
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:34,928
Fuck.

483
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:37,955
Fuck, fuck!

484
00:57:19,468 --> 00:57:20,957
Over there, Chuckie!

485
00:57:29,877 --> 00:57:31,401
You're going down!

486
00:57:38,785 --> 00:57:40,309
Slow down, bitch.

487
00:57:42,256 --> 00:57:45,383
- Fuck off.
- Get outta my way, Vingh!

488
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:48,518
Get up!

489
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:52,923
- Get up Vingh!
- She's going now!

490
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:25,855
I don't feel so good, Chuckie.
I think I got hypothermia.

491
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:27,554
You'll be fine.

492
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,659
It ain't natural how she
keeps getting away every time.

493
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,897
Let's get this over with.

494
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,001
You go up there.
I'll cover you.

495
00:58:37,171 --> 00:58:40,333
I ain't going up there without
a gun. End of story.

496
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,572
I never pegged you for a pussy.

497
00:58:44,311 --> 00:58:47,982
Even when Thomas called it,
I always defended your ass.

498
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,948
<i>No one ever called me a pussy.</i>

499
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:51,788
<i>She couldn't weight more than 120.</i>

500
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:54,601
If you'd fuck her,
you could break her in half.

501
00:58:54,636 --> 00:58:57,413
- Thomas never called me a pussy!
- Okay, fine.

502
00:58:57,789 --> 00:58:59,691
You don't wanna go? Don't go.

503
00:58:59,692 --> 00:59:03,888
I'm going up, I'm gonna go get
this bitch for Thomas, for Huey.

504
00:59:20,976 --> 00:59:22,410
If you go up.

505
00:59:22,747 --> 00:59:24,577
I'm gonna go around the side.

506
00:59:32,787 --> 00:59:34,719
On power...
No limits.

507
00:59:42,398 --> 00:59:44,362
On power...
No limits.

508
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:02,159
<i>Vingh?</i>

509
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:05,859
<i>Vingh?</i>

510
01:01:32,267 --> 01:01:33,859
<i>Vingh?</i>

511
01:01:34,267 --> 01:01:35,859
<i>Vingh?</i>

512
01:02:40,222 --> 01:02:41,746
Della?

513
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:54,766
Della?

514
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:17,855
<i>It's just you and me left now.</i>

515
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:24,360
I saw a little trail
of your blood back there.

516
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:28,698
You must be hurt.

517
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:38,701
I'm hurting, too.

518
01:03:40,643 --> 01:03:42,736
<i>You busted my collarbone.</i>

519
01:03:45,814 --> 01:03:47,872
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

520
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,746
I can smell your sweat.

521
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:00,655
I can smell your blood.

522
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:07,632
I know you're close.

523
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:23,143
After what went down tonight,
you and me got a special bond, Della.

524
01:04:25,584 --> 01:04:28,018
You might as well come out now.

525
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:34,951
<i>You want a cigarette?</i>

526
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:40,357
<i>I'll save one for you,
for when you decide to come out.</i>

527
01:04:44,933 --> 01:04:47,367
<i>You are one tough bitch!</i>

528
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,505
And that is hot.

529
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,805
Well, well.

530
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:08,848
And they're really cute.
Twins, huh?

531
01:05:10,123 --> 01:05:13,386
<i>A woman's purse can
tell her whole life story.</i>

532
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:21,126
You sure you don't want
a cigarette now, huh? Della?

533
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:23,967
Honey?

534
01:05:25,236 --> 01:05:29,798
Now I know where they live.
Maybe I'll stop by and say hi.

535
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:31,798
No... No...

536
01:05:35,746 --> 01:05:38,339
I figured that'd help
to find your voice.

537
01:05:40,285 --> 01:05:41,750
Don't worry.

538
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:44,082
I wouldn't hurt them.

539
01:05:45,556 --> 01:05:48,115
It's wrong to hurt kids, right?

540
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:51,525
The game's over, Della.

541
01:05:53,629 --> 01:05:55,060
You won.

542
01:06:19,586 --> 01:06:21,519
You took him from me, Della.

543
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,681
He was like my little brother.

544
01:06:33,398 --> 01:06:36,197
All he ever wanted to do
was see the ocean.

545
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:40,362
But he never got to see it.

546
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:46,232
No, he never got to go.

547
01:06:50,714 --> 01:06:52,703
They're all gone now.

548
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:08,991
Let's see here.

549
01:07:10,298 --> 01:07:12,288
Monday, Pilates.

550
01:07:13,434 --> 01:07:15,662
Tuesday, Spanish.

551
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:19,704
Wednesday, Mechanics?

552
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:27,170
Thursday, Friday...

553
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:31,679
Face it, Della.

554
01:07:32,919 --> 01:07:35,648
You're no suburban housewife.

555
01:07:40,225 --> 01:07:42,589
You bought into the big lie.

556
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:46,323
You even tried to live it.

557
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:50,431
Husband...

558
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,433
house...

559
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,301
security...

560
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,204
every woman's dream.

561
01:08:00,908 --> 01:08:02,672
But not yours, Della.

562
01:08:04,746 --> 01:08:07,440
You know there's no
such thing as security.

563
01:08:17,992 --> 01:08:21,120
I reckon I know what you've been
dreaming about, Della.

564
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:24,491
What you've been aching for...

565
01:08:24,698 --> 01:08:26,960
all these lonely years.

566
01:08:28,969 --> 01:08:30,833
The wind in your hair.

567
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:34,004
The dirt of life
between your fingers.

568
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:37,942
Taking what you want from life.

569
01:08:39,844 --> 01:08:41,334
Right, Della?

570
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:45,973
Don't tell me you
haven't thought about it.

571
01:08:47,886 --> 01:08:49,647
It's in your blood.

572
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:54,623
I bet your husband
doesn't treat you right, does he?

573
01:08:56,492 --> 01:08:58,358
He takes you for granted.

574
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,627
You can't go back to that, Della.

575
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,827
You don't wanna go back to that.

576
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,703
Let's go pick up your kids.

577
01:09:15,844 --> 01:09:17,276
Right now.

578
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,504
And we'll get rid of him.

579
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:24,016
You can do it.

580
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:27,050
I can do it.

581
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:29,850
Della!

582
01:09:38,564 --> 01:09:39,997
It's okay.

583
01:09:48,364 --> 01:09:49,997
Della!

584
01:09:55,364 --> 01:09:56,997
Della!

585
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:03,283
Come here.

586
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:21,828
Hell of a night, huh?

587
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:34,828
Hey! Hey!

588
01:10:42,421 --> 01:10:43,980
Close your eyes.

589
01:10:46,025 --> 01:10:47,617
Close your eyes.

590
01:10:53,932 --> 01:10:55,797
You're amazing, Della.

591
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,493
So beautiful.

592
01:11:58,623 --> 01:12:00,817
You've been a bad girl.

593
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:03,995
I don't care.

594
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,295
You're a bad girl.

595
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:19,973
Fuck me.

596
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,308
Fuck me.

597
01:17:53,441 --> 01:18:00,743
 You can count on me 

598
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:10,955
 Please have snow and mistletoe 

599
01:18:10,956 --> 01:18:16,689
 And presents under the tree 

600
01:18:22,367 --> 01:18:28,463
 Christmas Eve will find me 

601
01:18:31,475 --> 01:18:36,707
 Where the love light gleams 

602
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:46,514
 I'll be home for Christmas 

603
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:54,253
 If only in my 

604
01:18:54,254 --> 01:18:57,626
 Dreams 

605
01:19:03,503 --> 01:19:06,801
<i>You wanna tell me where in the
hell you've been all night, honey?</i>

606
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:09,433
Don't ever call me that again.

607
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:10,941
What?

608
01:19:13,179 --> 01:19:16,739
<i>You can't even take
your shoes off at the door?</i>

609
01:19:17,016 --> 01:19:18,880
<i>The Japanese do it!</i>

610
01:19:19,485 --> 01:19:20,916
<i>I do it.</i>

611
01:19:59,887 --> 01:20:02,547
I see you got wrapping paper.
What'd you get me?

612
01:20:10,730 --> 01:20:12,993
What did you get me at the mall?

613
01:20:16,335 --> 01:20:17,927
Nothing.

614
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:23,130
 In every dream home
A heartache 

615
01:20:24,176 --> 01:20:27,109
 And every step I take 

616
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,913
 Takes me further from heaven 

617
01:20:35,619 --> 01:20:38,110
 Is there a heaven? 

618
01:20:40,324 --> 01:20:43,257
 I'd like to think so 

619
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:50,062
 Standards of living 

620
01:20:51,834 --> 01:20:54,598
 They're rising daily 

621
01:20:56,171 --> 01:20:59,607
 But home, oh, sweet home 

622
01:21:01,009 --> 01:21:03,739
 It's only a saying 

623
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:09,210
 From bell-push to faucet 

624
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:14,048
 In smart-town apartments 

625
01:21:15,022 --> 01:21:17,921
 The cottage is pretty 

626
01:21:19,626 --> 01:21:23,093
 The main house a palace 

627
01:21:24,696 --> 01:21:29,835
 Penthouse perfection
But what goes on? 

628
01:21:29,836 --> 01:21:32,135
 What to do there? 

629
01:21:32,136 --> 01:21:35,037
 Better pray there 

630
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:46,547
 Open-plan living 

631
01:21:48,351 --> 01:21:51,685
 Bungalow ranch-style 

632
01:21:52,822 --> 01:21:56,255
 All of its comforts 

633
01:21:57,492 --> 01:22:00,621
 Seem so essential 

634
01:22:01,996 --> 01:22:05,227
 I bought you mail order 

635
01:22:06,499 --> 01:22:10,127
 My plain-wrapper baby 

636
01:22:11,205 --> 01:22:14,195
 Your skin is like vinyl 

637
01:22:15,643 --> 01:22:18,611
 The perfect companion 

638
01:22:20,313 --> 01:22:23,747
 You float in my new pool 

639
01:22:25,251 --> 01:22:28,448
 Deluxe and delightful 

640
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:32,987
 Inflatable doll 

641
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:37,655
 My role is to serve you 

642
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:42,265
 Disposable darling 

643
01:22:43,701 --> 01:22:46,862
 Can't throw you away now 

644
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:51,902
 Immortal and life-size 

645
01:22:52,742 --> 01:22:56,142
 My breath is inside you 

646
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:00,572
 I'll dress you up daily 

647
01:23:02,317 --> 01:23:05,911
 And keep you till death sighs 

648
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,914
 Inflatable doll 

649
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:14,557
 Lover ungrateful 

650
01:23:16,263 --> 01:23:19,560
 I blew up your body 

651
