00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,387
- You guys...
how long were you dating?

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,139
- About a year.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,348
- And you met in college, right?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,391
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,226
It was about
seven years ago.

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,353
But I'm more... I'm friends
with Jack, you know.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,985
- He used to take a frying pan
and just put cheese in it.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,653
And he'd roll it up.

10
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,697
- Is this true?
- It's absolutely true.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,699
You've said that before.
- It's absolutely true.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,327
- He'd call it... he's like,
"Oh, I made my cheese log."

13
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,746
- I needed a wheelchair.

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:43,542
So one night, we went
to an emergency room entrance,

15
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,170
and we stole a wheelchair
and took it out back.

16
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,713
And he was pushing me
down the hill.

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,964
- Tom did that?

18
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:53,093
- Yeah, it was... he knew
that I needed a wheelchair.

19
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,597
- He used to have one of those,
uh, those sunfishes,

20
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,891
you know, the boats
that have the one...

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,059
- The one sail?
- The one sail.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,727
Yeah, yeah, free version.

23
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,353
He would go out,
and he would be gone

24
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,688
for, like, six or seven hours.

25
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,106
And we'd be, like,
really worried,

26
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,484
because we couldn't see him
from the shore.

27
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,735
- What was that band called?

28
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,029
- It was a band called Bigfoot.

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,405
- No, it was...

30
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,533
- 'Cause he was
a marine biologist.

31
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,743
He liked big fish.

32
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,578
- Well, yes, but the thing is,
there was a name

33
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,080
attached to the wheelchair.

34
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,915
So it was for someone.

35
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,583
- Yeah, we've been friends
for a long time.

36
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,669
- Yeah.

37
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,673
- Mark was one of these guys who
would, like, walk into a room.

38
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,634
You know, like we could be
at a party.

39
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,302
You could have the one person
in the room,

40
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,512
playing you, for example.

41
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,138
Like, no one was talking.

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,767
- No, but there's something
to be said for just somebody

43
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,393
who just makes people
feel comfortable.

44
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,436
- He did.
He did.

45
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,152
- We were just walking down
the street.

46
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,784
- Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

47
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,994
- You got it.

48
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:05,499
- Trying make this, like,
a respectable event.

49
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,294
Uh, I...

50
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:14,424
uh, it's been a year.

51
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,801
And, uh,

52
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,594
I thought it was
really important

53
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:21,306
that we do this for Tom.

54
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,394
It's so hard to eulogize someone
who you look up to, you know,

55
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,730
'cause Tom was amazing.

56
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,107
He was the best fucking guy.

57
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,733
I mean, he was a better friend
to all of us

58
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,943
than we were to him.

59
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,112
I mean, at least,
that's how I feel.

60
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,446
I just think back.

61
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,823
We were roommates at UW.

62
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,867
And, like, I remember, like,

63
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,162
at one point,
sara came to visit me.

64
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,416
And he moved all of his stuff
into the common room

65
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,625
to sleep there.

66
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,835
No, and he really...

67
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,170
and I was like,
"It smells bad."

68
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,088
And he was like, "No"___
He was like, "No, no, no.

69
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,340
I'm gonna do it
so you can have sex."

70
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,093
And I was like,
"we're not having sex."

71
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,970
I would... and he was like,

72
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,305
"But I'm optimistic, you know."

73
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,348
And so I...

74
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,517
and he was just so generous,
you know.

75
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,227
He was just...
he was the best.

76
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,730
And I was just thinking today,
I mean,

77
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,691
I saw Hotel Rwanda came on TV.

78
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,862
And he... he and I saw it
together in the theater.

79
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,865
And the day after it came out,

80
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,119
he started donating time at
the shelter in downtown seattle.

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,495
That's what he was like.

82
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,955
You'd sit there
thinking about it,

83
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,081
and he would do it.

84
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,249
And just cheers... you know,

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,709
I just want to say "cheers"
to that.

86
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,919
Cheers.

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,212
- To Tom.
- To Tom.

88
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,922
- Cheers.

89
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,715
- Tom and I were big
into movies,

90
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,802
you know, growing up.

91
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,970
Actually, Tom and I, like,

92
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:46,225
had a seminal
movie experience together

93
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,810
not dissimilar
from Hotel Rwanda,

94
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,896
except it was with
Revenge of the Nerds.

95
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,608
And it was fascinating.

96
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,069
It sort of...

97
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,570
it changed him,

98
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,909
um, 'cause Tom
was not like you know him

99
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,203
when he was younger.

100
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,498
Tom was...

101
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,375
he was the bully,

102
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,461
I found out, like, when I went
to pick him up from school.

103
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,339
And, um, he was
quite emotionally

104
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,757
and physically manipulative.

105
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,385
And when I watched him watching
Revenge of the Nerds,

106
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,053
just something clicked in him,

107
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,721
which was, he was learning
that, like,

108
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,392
the bullies and the assholes
end up last,

109
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,560
and the nerds
and the nice guys win.

110
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,146
And his little brain
started clocking away

111
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,564
and going "Oh, fuck.

112
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,108
"If I'm gonna gain favor
in this world,

113
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,276
"I'm gonna be nice.

114
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,027
"I'm gonna be altruistic.

115
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,571
"I'm gonna watch Hotel Rwanda
and volunteer at a shelter,

116
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,115
"'cause girls will like that.

117
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,324
"I will get laid.

118
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,450
"I'll get better job.

119
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,910
I'll succeed forward
in the life"___

120
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,203
- I don't think
that's what it is.

121
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,371
- But the purist vers...

122
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,831
- I don't think that
that's accurate.

123
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,957
- Al?
Hey, Al?

124
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,458
I know you spent
some time with him

125
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,627
in the last couple of years,
but I... but he's my brother.

126
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,671
- I just think you're gonna hold
someone to something

127
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,631
that happened when they were
fucking 14 years old

128
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,133
or whatever he was
when that happened.

129
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,135
- If we're gonna toast the man,
let's toast the man.

130
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,304
Let's not eulogize somebody like
a fucking bullshit...

131
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,472
- Just the way you're saying
it is just like he's a dick.

132
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,308
And it's like, he wasn't a dick.
He was amazing.

133
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,684
- You're calling my brother
a dick?

134
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,019
I'm not calling my brother
a dick.

135
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,603
- Jack!

136
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,980
- I'm just saying,

137
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,442
let's not do what everybody does
at a funeral

138
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,360
or a commemoratory ceremony

139
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,321
where we just say,
"Uh, they were amazing,

140
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,322
and they were generous,"

141
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,698
'cause that's fucking bullshit.

142
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,033
And it's a dishonor to the man.

143
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,659
- So cheers.

144
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,578
- No, I think
I'm gonna finish, Al,

145
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,829
'cause I'm his brother.

146
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,706
If we're gonna raise our glass,

147
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,249
I want to raise our glass
to the man.

148
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,419
You know half of the man,
and I know the whole man, okay?

149
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,338
Who was fucking beautiful.

150
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,507
He knew how to make himself work
and weave in the world.

151
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,842
And I think
that's fucking great.

152
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,510
And I would never call him
a dick for that,

153
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,137
so fuck you
for saying that.

154
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,889
But let's raise a glass
to the whole man.

155
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,057
Cheers.

156
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,475
Thank you.

157
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,898
Cheers.

158
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,117
So, anyway, I was...

159
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,577
we should say something.

160
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,121
But does anyone
want another drink?

161
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,331
Or, uh...

162
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,005
Oh, boy.

163
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,720
- How'd that go for you?

164
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,305
When you wrote it,

165
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,601
how did you see that
actually playing out for you?

166
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,023
I will say this.

167
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,733
Some parties are forgettable.

168
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,735
You know what I mean?

169
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,238
But I got to say,
this party...

170
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,074
- Had great guacamole
and amazing public speaking.

171
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,742
- Great public speaking.

172
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,452
They'll remember it.

173
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:57,207
- You got to stop.

174
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,126
You know that, right?

175
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,921
- Oh, this is...
this is that moment...

176
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,756
- This is your intervention.
- Isn't it?

177
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,717
This is...
this is hard Iris.

178
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,761
- I miss you.

179
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,014
I miss my friend.

180
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,558
I know you're sad.

181
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,186
I'm sad too.

182
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,729
- Yeah.

183
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,611
You know what I always
think about?

184
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,823
I think about, like, you're...

185
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:35,954
that must have been so hard
for you to leave Tom.

186
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,624
That fucking guy loved you.

187
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,834
Man.

188
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,669
You are so...
but you were right,

189
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,963
and you were so brave,
and you were so right.

190
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,256
- It wasn't right with us.

191
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,176
- No, it wasn't right
with you guys.

192
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,804
But that's okay.

193
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,639
Can I tell you something?

194
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,517
I turned down the Trinity job.

195
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,978
- Why?

196
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,855
- I don't want to go to Trinity

197
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,523
and show them who I am
right now,

198
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,650
because they'll never
hire me again.

199
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,528
And so that almost means,
like,

200
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,905
I don't want to go another party

201
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,490
and show them
who I am right now.

202
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,116
And I don't want to go to a girl

203
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,451
and show her who I am
right now... -

204
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,578
- You're a mess.

205
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,372
- Well...

206
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,000
- I've been watching you
for a year now,

207
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,169
and whatever you're doing,

208
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,463
and whatever you think
is helping you,

209
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,715
I have a responsibility
as your friend

210
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,467
to tell you
that it's not.

211
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,843
- I knew this was coming,
by the way.

212
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,844
- Okay.

213
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,346
- Just tell me what to do.
- Okay.

214
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,389
- That's basically where I'm at.
Just tell me what...

215
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,599
- Okay, all right.

216
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,184
- You know better than I do.
You know I...

217
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,644
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.

218
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,853
- I know.
I have a plan.

219
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,021
- You have a plan?

220
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,356
- I just want you
to hear me out.

221
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,191
It's just a plan right now.
- I love your plans.

222
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,235
- You might not love this one,
but just hear me out.

223
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,528
- But I don't have any plans.

224
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,696
- Um, that's the good news.

225
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,824
You know, uh, you know that
nice red bicycle that you have?

226
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,825
Yes.

227
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,536
- Yikes.
- Sorry.

228
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,038
What you're going to do...

229
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,915
you're gonna dust off
Old Red,

230
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,542
you're gonna wheel him
out of the shed,

231
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,544
and you're gonna get on a ferry.

232
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,128
I'm sending you
to my dad's place.

233
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,965
You know my dad's place
on the island?

234
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,466
It's beautiful in the winter.

235
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,136
It's idyllic and crisp
and peaceful and...

236
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,430
- Like, by "beautiful" you mean,
"rainy and cold."

237
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,140
- I'm sorry;
I got so distracted,

238
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,017
'cause all I heard was
pissing and moaning.

239
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,394
- Right.
Sorry, I started pissing.

240
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,229
I'm not pissing.
I'm not pissing and moaning.

241
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,440
I'm done.
I'm done.

242
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:32,362
- You just need
some head space, okay?

243
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,364
- Okay.
- Okay.

244
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,330
So then you're gonna take
a right on a road

245
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,623
called Dunhill Road.

246
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,667
And the house is right
at the end of the street.

247
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,127
And it's the only house
on the lane.

248
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,461
- Okay.

249
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:52,007
Um, I mean, seriously,
I'm just going not... -

250
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,758
like, what am I doing out here?

251
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,094
- You just sit there,
and you look out at the water,

252
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,804
and you think
about your life.

253
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,264
- Really?
I'm just gonna sit?

254
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,432
- You're just gonna sit.

255
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,850
There's no TV.
There's no internet.

256
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,226
There's nothing.
It's just you.

257
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,686
- Do they have forks,
'cause I might...

258
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,729
- They have a couple...

259
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,063
we have a couple of forks,
yeah.

260
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,690
- I might need to stab myself
in the face.

261
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,901
- Will you please come visit me,
please?

262
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,821
- No, Jack.
I can't.

263
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,616
This is... I can't anyway,
'cause I'm slammed.

264
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,620
But I can't because this is...
this is for you, you know.

265
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,664
Don't make me feel bad
about sending you off.

266
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,791
- All right, I'm gonna go have
the greatest time ever

267
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,084
doing nothing.

268
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,629
And if I don't come back
within a week,

269
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,631
bring a razor
and deodorant.

270
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:46,770
♪ ♪

271
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,582
Clang!

272
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,133
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

273
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,384
Oh, shit.

274
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,804
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

275
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,263
Hi, hi, I'm...

276
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,973
- Ahh!
- Okay.

277
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,976
I think I have the wrong house.
And I-I...

278
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,313
Hey, Hannah!
You're Hannah!

279
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,648
Oh, my God, I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

280
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,067
I'm Jack.
I'm Iris' friend Jack.

281
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,777
- You're Jack?

282
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,403
- Yes, I'm so sorry
I freaked you out.

283
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,322
- Holy fuck!
- Sorry.

284
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,824
- Are you kidding me?

285
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,451
What are you doing, like,
creeping around my house?

286
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,245
- I was looking for the key.
And I'm so sorry.

287
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,455
I didn't... I didn't even see
anything, so it's fine.

288
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,207
- Fuck me.

289
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,625
- Sorry, that's my fault.

290
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,168
That's...

291
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,351
Anyway, not to beat
a dead horse,

292
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,519
but just to be super clear,

293
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,979
I was looking
for the key out front,

294
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,189
and I thought maybe
it was on the side.

295
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,899
You know, and that's really...

296
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,278
- Ring the bell.
Just ring the bell, dude.

297
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,321
- Yeah, but I didn't know
anybody was here,

298
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,739
so why would I ring
the bell?

299
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,741
- You know what?
Just... let's drop it, okay?

300
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,244
It's just...
it's done.

301
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,913
- Anyway, sorry.

302
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:38,501
But look, you obviously
came here to, what,

303
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,794
get some alone time,

304
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,796
and I'm clearly barging in.

305
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,923
So I don't know, I'll just get
a cheap hotel, I think,

306
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,341
and it'll be fine.

307
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,343
- No, it's fine.
You can... you could stay.

308
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,845
Yeah, it's fine.

309
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,763
Stay.

310
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,140
- I don't want to intrude.

311
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,850
I really don't.

312
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,101
- Look, Iris invited you up.

313
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,519
You're a guest.

314
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,230
You're welcome to stay.

315
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,899
- You sure?

316
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,692
- Yeah, I'm sure.

317
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,027
There's plenty of room.

318
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,488
I'm sure we won't even
run into each other.

319
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,865
Are you hungry?

320
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,743
There's bananas.

321
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,037
- Those are bananas?

322
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,497
- Well, they're dehydrated.

323
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,583
- Oh, okay.

324
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,002
I'm good.
Thank you.

325
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,504
But yeah, if you're okay,
I'm... I will crash.

326
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,298
- Okay, I'm okay.
Stop saying, "Are you okay?"

327
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,050
- Well, I just want to make sure
you're okay.

328
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,469
Um, what... is there a bedroom
I should take?

329
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,348
- Yeah, just go past
where we had the standoff,

330
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,725
and it's the first bedroom
on the right.

331
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,562
- Oh, past the... the creepy guy
with the bike helmet?

332
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:45,568
- Yeah, where the crazy lady
was brandishing the oar.

333
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,153
- She was scary.

334
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,446
I hope she's gone.

335
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,614
- Good night.

336
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,990
- Do you think
we'll see her again?

337
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,533
- Maybe.

338
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,866
Can I come in?

339
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,047
- There's glasses
on the windowsill,

340
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,215
you know,
if you want to join me.

341
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,717
- You sure?
- Yeah.

342
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,053
- Thanks.

343
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,309
One thing in common
with your little sister.

344
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,061
- What, the lush factor?

345
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,396
- Ah, the self-aware
lush factor.

346
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,398
- Oh.
- Very important.

347
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,401
Big difference.

348
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,114
So you're on an island.

349
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:59,368
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and you're drinking by yourself.

350
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,579
- Yeah.

351
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,416
- What's going on?

352
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,709
- Really?

353
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,753
- I'm not good for small talk,

354
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,590
so I apologize
if I'm, uh, barging through

355
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,258
the doors of your privacy
right now.

356
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,511
- Yeah, it's okay.
You kind of are, but, it's...

357
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,054
- I am.
I apologize.

358
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,597
Let's talk about your slippers.

359
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,433
- Okay.
Let's talk about my slippers.

360
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,394
- Your slippers are awesome.

361
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,861
- I just walked out
on a seven-year relationship.

362
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,947
- Whoa.

363
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,827
- Hence the tequila.
- Hence the tequila.

364
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,126
- What's your story?

365
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,544
Mm, nothing really.

366
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,129
I just kind of had
a shitty year.

367
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,966
You know, thought it'd be nice
to have a little sabbatical,

368
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,176
get some alone time.

369
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,594
- Okay, good place for it.

370
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,887
- Good place for it.

371
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,930
- Obviously.

372
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,598
- Getting the alone time.

373
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,017
But I got to say,
not so terrible

374
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,645
to have a drinking buddy.

375
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,064
- Yeah.

376
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,443
- You are not
what I expected, Hannah.

377
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,446
- How so?

378
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,491
- You are, uh...
I don't know.

379
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,620
Just not how Iris
described you to me, I guess.

380
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,664
- How did she describe me?

381
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,000
- She... well,
if you don't know already,

382
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,169
she worships you
and looks up to you

383
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,545
and thinks you are amazing.

384
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,672
And she loves you.

385
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,840
- Yeah?

386
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,341
- It's true.

387
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,718
- What else?

388
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,844
- Well, I don't...

389
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,053
- Give me the dirt!
Come on!

390
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,680
- What am I supposed to say?
She loves you.

391
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,931
She thinks you're amazing.

392
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,516
- Well, I love her.
I think she's amazing.

393
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,018
- Well, good.
Well, drink your drink.

394
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,145
- You drink your drink.
Don't tell me to drink my drink.

395
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,189
- Well, I'm drinking my drink.
You drink that one.

396
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,650
Watch this.

397
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,820
- Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

398
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,197
- Wham!
Okay.

399
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,656
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?

400
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,950
- Now you're talking.
I had a brother.

401
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,206
- That's right.

402
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,249
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

403
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,918
- I knew that.
- Don't.

404
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,419
- That's... I'm sorry.
That's my bad.

405
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,464
- Why are you sorry?
- I don't know.

406
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,924
- There's nothing
to be sorry about.

407
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,134
I used to have a brother,
and I don't anymore.

408
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,969
And that's what it is, you know?

409
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,554
It's like,

410
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,223
it is what it is,
and it sucks.

411
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,977
And it... you know, it was,

412
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,896
you know,
it was terrible, obviously.

413
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,689
But, um...
but I'm good.

414
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,733
And, um, thank you for that.

415
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,276
But it's not necessary.

416
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,405
- To your brother.

417
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,741
- To your sister.

418
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,452
And her sister, being you.

419
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,495
- That would be me.

420
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,121
- Yeah.

421
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,414
- I guess
I better drink then.

422
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,541
- Come on.

423
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,002
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm.

424
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,420
- I can't.

425
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,964
- Look, if we're gonna
drink to someone

426
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,799
as awesome as your sister
and my dead brother,

427
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,050
we're throwing
the shit back.

428
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,593
- Okay.
- Come on, wham it.

429
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,262
Mm!

430
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,471
There it is.

431
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,764
- Holy shit.

432
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,267
- Yet another similarity
with you and Iris.

433
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,851
I can talk her into drinking
anything.

434
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,645
I can't believe you let me
talk you into that.

435
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,146
That's really great.

436
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,439
You want another one?

437
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,486
♪ ♪

438
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,029
Okay, my best friend
is your sister.

439
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,489
- Right.

440
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,616
- It's like a kind of in-law,
of sort, that makes us.

441
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:30,121
You know what I'm saying?

442
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,290
- What are you talking about?

443
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,125
- I'm doing...
- Yeah, no, no, no, go, go, go.

444
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,209
I cut you off when you were

445
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,711
actually going
with something good.

446
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,629
- I'm drawing
a brilliant parallel.

447
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,798
Go again.

448
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,050
Going down.

449
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,512
Getting weird with the...

450
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,434
All right,
let me tell you something.

451
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,269
- Yeah!

452
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,603
- All right,
it's not that I was...

453
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,730
I was in love with her.

454
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,273
I was totally fucking
in love with her.

455
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,691
But what I was in love with

456
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,485
was the potential that
she was holding that was me.

457
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,737
- Right.
- Does that make sense?

458
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,863
- Right.

459
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,156
- That's what I was
in love with.

460
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,324
- Right, right.
- Was that.

461
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,908
- And then I started
to realize, like,

462
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,330
it was like I gave her
all my, like, zhuzh,

463
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,331
all my good stuff.

464
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,415
Is this making any sense?

465
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,666
- Yeah.
You shouldn't do that.

466
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,418
- And, like... and she
wouldn't give it back.

467
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,587
So, like, as the... as the...
as, like, the years went on

468
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,089
and everything went on,
I was just, like...

469
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,966
this is gonna sound
so fucking melodramatic.

470
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:29,221
I was, like, this fucking,
like, little fucking bird,

471
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,348
like, in a cage.

472
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,141
And finally she came over
and unlocked it,

473
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,268
and I just sat there.

474
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,644
- Wow.

475
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,063
- I sat there
for three more months

476
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,023
when she was hooking up
with a...

477
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,570
Ugh, this woman, girl,
who's so much younger than me.

478
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,738
And I just couldn't...

479
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,448
I just sat there
and waited for her

480
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,367
to be attracted
to me again

481
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,162
or to just look at me
like I was, uh...

482
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,455
- Whoa.

483
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,415
We're gonna stop
this conversation.

484
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,917
I got a sense of it, okay?

485
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,460
And here's the deal.

486
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,212
I've made a decision.

487
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,546
Pam is a fucking moron.

488
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,672
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

489
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,174
- She's not really, but...

490
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,342
- No, here's the deal.

491
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,928
Look, for her to have
given you the sense

492
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,304
in some way that you're not,

493
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,265
like, young enough
or good enough or pretty enough

494
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,644
or just enough in general
is fucking bullshit.

495
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,687
- It is, right?
- It's bullshit.

496
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:23,567
Because what I see
across from me is...

497
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,152
you have to...
you're gonna have to let me

498
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,779
descend here for a second;
can I descend?

499
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,905
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

500
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,240
I have to tell you something,

501
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,950
and I don't want you
to take it the wrong way.

502
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,827
It's to prove a point, okay?

503
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,328
But it's about your butt.
So when I...

504
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,205
What?

505
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,290
- When I...
when I went to look for...

506
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,834
- You are a fucker.

507
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,085
- I am.

508
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,295
- You were fucking peeping
in the fucking windows.

509
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,547
You're a fucker.

510
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,756
Give me some more.

511
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,091
You are a fucking...
go ahead...

512
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,009
yeah, no, I want to hear
your confession.

513
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,261
Confess.

514
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,429
- I tried to find the key.

515
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,471
I went around the door,

516
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,848
all innocent
up until that point.

517
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,099
Innocent, innocent, innocent.

518
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,600
Looking for the key,
total innocence,

519
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,685
total innocence.

520
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:02,106
Your butt.

521
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,274
- Pervert.

522
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,692
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

523
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,943
- But you made me that way.

524
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,278
- I made you that way?

525
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,113
- 'Cause your butt is
fucking awesome, okay?

526
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,156
- Can you not?

527
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,449
- 'Cause it's, like, super soft.

528
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,783
- How do you know
it's super soft?

529
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,784
- 'Cause I could tell.

530
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,411
- You're so fucking weird...

531
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,704
- I know.
- And drunk right now.

532
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,747
- I know.
I looked at it for a while.

533
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,624
I got a good sense of it.

534
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,959
And let me tell you
another thing

535
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,003
that's even more inappropriate,

536
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,797
but it's super safe
'cause you're a lesbian.

537
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,177
If I were differently equipped

538
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:35,973
or you were
differently inclined,

539
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,559
this night might go
a very different way.

540
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,894
- Really?

541
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,604
- I'm just saying...
- Are you just saying?

542
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,816
- I would be super open to that
in a whole other universe...

543
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,318
- Okay.

544
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,947
- Because... and this is just
serving to prove my point of,

545
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,992
like, you shouldn't feel
not awesome

546
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,037
because she was
not interested in you.

547
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,663
There will be a lot of people...

548
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,665
- Well, I didn't say
she wasn't interested in me.

549
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,042
The fucking thing
ran its course.

550
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,126
But anyway, go ahead.

551
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,252
I like it.
I like it.

552
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:12,134
- To your gorgeous,
supple, soft,

553
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,638
sexy motherfucking butt.

554
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,017
- And all the other things
that I might be thinking about

555
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,186
except for the fact that
I'm not thinking about them.

556
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,564
- I'm just saying...
- Anyway, the point is, you,

557
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,941
you're never going to be happy

558
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,651
if you're eating
this fucking bird food.

559
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,402
You think... - you know why
you feel like a bird?

560
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,029
- I love that food.
- You feel like a bird?

561
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,697
Okay, what the fuck is this?
It's a turd.

562
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,865
You can't eat these things.

563
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:39,537
I am here, Dr. Jack,
to fix you, okay?

564
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,957
So I'm gonna make you round,
tall filet, super awesome.

565
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,583
Grocery store.
Cook it medium-rare.

566
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,377
- I can't do it.
- With the butter.

567
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,879
- I can't eat meat.
You can make me something else.

568
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,464
- Okay, I'll make you
something else.

569
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:55,636
I'll make you a super
awesome steak medium-rare

570
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,680
with the butter
and the blue cheese

571
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,391
and the truffle oil drizzled
over the French fries.

572
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,184
And I'm gonna put this plate
in front of you.

573
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,894
And it's gonna be
totally different.

574
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,854
It'll be a change of pace.

575
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,107
But you are out of the cage now,
my friend.

576
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,985
And if you want to fucking fly,
you're gonna start with a steak.

577
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,444
That's all I'm saying.
- Let's do it.

578
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,029
- All right, we're going
to the store...

579
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,114
- No, let's do it.

580
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,574
- I'm gonna fucking cook you
a meal.

581
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,617
- Hey!

582
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,082
All right.

583
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,877
I'm gonna take you up
on your offer.

584
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,671
- What are you doing?

585
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,964
- I haven't, uh,

586
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,049
been on that bicycle
in quite some time, but...

587
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,843
- What are you... what?

588
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,388
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

589
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,057
Are you serious?
- Yeah.

590
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,435
I'm single.
You're single.

591
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,604
- I'm single.

592
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,772
- I mean, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.

593
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,733
- No, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.

594
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,776
- No, we shouldn't do it.
You're a straight guy.

595
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,987
- I'm looking at your boobs.
- It might be too much.

596
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,239
It might be too much for you.

597
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,116
Too much for you to handle.

598
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
What?

599
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,789
- You're serious.

600
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,957
- I don't know.

601
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,584
I mean,
I'm game if you're game.

602
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,213
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

603
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,050
- Get rid of this.
Get rid of this.

604
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,926
Holy shit.

605
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,984
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

606
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,903
Shit, shit, shit, I don't have...
I don't...

607
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,906
I didn't bring a...
I don't have a condom.

608
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,158
Well, I didn't...
I thought I was gonna be alone.

609
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,202
- Condom!

610
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,955
- Oh, fuck.

611
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,207
Saran Wrap?

612
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,625
- I think I know where
there's one.

613
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,503
- Okay, oh, all right.

614
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,381
Uh...

615
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,383
Um...

616
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,513
Okay.

617
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,273
Wait, wait, wait.
Stay right there.

618
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,733
Don't move, don't move,
don't move.

619
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,859
I got to show you something.

620
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,528
I've always wanted to do this.

621
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,029
Okay.
You ready?

622
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,448
- Yes.

623
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,826
- Ta-da!

624
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,494
- All right.
- You're very underwhelmed.

625
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,954
Okay, never mind.

626
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,914
- Wait.
All right.

627
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,249
I'm gonna do it.

628
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,626
- Whoa, you're really
going for it.

629
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,044
- Is that on?

630
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,338
- Uh, snap it.
Snap it.

631
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,423
Okay, good.

632
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,716
Give me this.
Give me this.

633
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,134
Okay, sorry.

634
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,387
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

635
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,680
Okay.

636
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,099
- Let me get these off.

637
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,018
- Yeah.
- Okay.

638
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,396
- Wow.
Wow.

639
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,564
Okay.

640
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,610
- Okay.

641
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,778
- Oh, my God.

642
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,573
- Oh, shit, you're amazing.

643
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,749
- Oh, sorry.

644
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,792
Wait a second.

645
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,919
Oh, shit.
I squealed.

646
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,088
Sorry.

647
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,345
- Did you...
okay.

648
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,347
- Yeah, sorry.

649
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,600
That was...

650
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,561
it wasn't supposed to be
that fast.

651
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,565
- Oh, good.

652
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,941
- I can... I can help, uh...

653
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,067
- No, it's okay.

654
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,277
- Finish for you, if you want.

655
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,403
- Oh, no.

656
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,404
Thank you.

657
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,114
- You sure?
- Yeah.

658
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,158
- Okay.
- Ow, you're on my hair.

659
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,951
- Sorry.

660
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,745
- All right, um...

661
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,915
Well...

662
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,295
You want to snuggle?

663
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,339
- Yeah.
- Okay.

664
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,633
- Go for it.
- Okay.

665
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,927
- Maybe not that close.

666
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,261
- We should get some...

667
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:10,599
we should get some water too
before we go to sleep.

668
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,059
- Okay.

669
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,397
- Good night.

670
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,069
Thank you.

671
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,369
- She's here, she's here,
she's here, she's here.

672
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,620
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

673
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,873
Oh, ew!

674
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,292
Oh, shit.

675
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,501
Fuck.
Where'd it go?

676
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,878
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?

677
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,256
Where'd it go?

678
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,507
Okay, you have to get up.

679
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,925
Iris is in the driveway.

680
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,386
Dude, she's in the driveway.

681
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,554
Give me some tissues.

682
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,557
Give me some tissue.
Come on.

683
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,225
Okay.

684
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,602
Very important, okay?

685
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,769
She cannot know about this.

686
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,771
I am running or something.

687
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,231
You are sleeping.

688
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,816
And we're good, okay?

689
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,234
Just...

690
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,572
- What?

691
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,454
- Jack?

692
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,930
What the fuck is that?

693
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,476
- Hey, Bean.

694
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,769
- Oh, my God.

695
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,937
- What's up?

696
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,772
- Puppet?
What the fuck?

697
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,274
Oh, my goodness!

698
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,777
What are you doing here?

699
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,986
- Oh.

700
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,529
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.

701
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,240
I didn't know
you were going to be here.

702
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,284
- Yeah, it's a long story.
- Did you just wake up?

703
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,327
You okay?

704
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,496
These are cute.
These are really...

705
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,206
- Holy cow!

706
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,583
- And you've met...
oh, Jesus Christ.

707
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,626
- What?

708
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,127
- What have you come as?

709
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,754
- I was on a run.

710
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,964
- Here she is.

711
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,507
- Hannah showed me
a great path, and...

712
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,758
- Jane Fonda.

713
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,926
- Oh, cut it out.

714
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,302
- Oh, yummy.
You're sweaty.

715
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,720
- Oh, what are you doing here?

716
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,972
What is going on?

717
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,139
- Did you meet my sister?

718
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,557
I've been wanting you
to meet her.

719
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,725
- I did.
We met last night.

720
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,061
Yes, we did.
- How nice is this?

721
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,355
I've been wanting you guys
to meet for so long.

722
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,649
Haven't I been talking about it?
And it's weird.

723
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,526
It's weird that you haven't met,
so I love it.

724
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,819
- I know.
It's crazy.

725
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,945
How... what... - why are you...

726
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,446
how did the...
what are you doing here?

727
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,115
- I got off work.
I just was, like...

728
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,908
they moved a shoot
and then axed another one,

729
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,326
so I was, like, "Peace out.

730
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,286
I'm gonna go
and annoy my friend."

731
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,122
- That's so great!

732
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,790
- This is amazing
that she's here as well.

733
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,250
- I know.

734
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,335
You were like, "Go up
for a solo sabbatical except"___

735
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,378
- I know.
I know.

736
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,838
You're supposed
to have alone time,

737
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,631
and now you're, like,
double whammy!

738
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,175
- Two of them here.

739
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,510
- That was a big run.

740
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,053
- Yeah, it was really good.

741
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,638
- Yeah.
I need to pee.

742
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,140
I'm literally
gonna pee my pants.

743
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,183
I got you provisions and stuff.

744
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,519
I love that you're here.

745
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,646
Where did you guys sleep?

746
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,525
- That was a bit much.

747
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,152
It's, like, pouring off
your head.

748
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,948
- So... yeah.

749
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,040
- Hey.
- Hey.

750
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,291
- Took my room.

751
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,209
- I hate my room.

752
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,627
- You do hate your room.

753
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,212
Don't be weird
and change the sheets.

754
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:13,383
It's fine.

755
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,052
- I broke up with Pam.

756
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,887
- What?

757
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,764
Holy shit.

758
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,390
Why...
when?

759
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,600
- A couple of days ago.

760
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,061
I got up here yesterday.

761
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,103
I hitchhiked up.

762
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,438
- You didn't hitchhike up.

763
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,440
Please don't hitchhike.
It's so dangerous.

764
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,233
Shit.

765
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,860
- I had no idea that...

766
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,986
are you all right?

767
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,571
Please don't change
the sheets.

768
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,740
- I want to change the sheets.
- Don't change the sheets.

769
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,909
- Let me change the sheets.
I want to change the sheets.

770
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,663
- I want to talk to you about...

771
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:49,628
I had no idea you guys
were having trouble.

772
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,090
Hannah.

773
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,718
Why didn't you call me?

774
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,345
- I don't know;
I knew we were in trouble

775
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,971
when we weren't
being physical anymore.

776
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,598
But, I mean,
that was totally my fault.

777
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,767
I was just so fucking angry
with her all the time.

778
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,769
- Yeah, of course you were.
She's suffocating.

779
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,229
- No.
Well, she was suffocating.

780
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,230
- She was suffocating.

781
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,689
- No, but it was me too.

782
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,359
It was because
I was buying in to this...

783
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,902
I was...

784
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,654
what did I say to you
last night?

785
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,240
I had a good metaphor
for it last night.

786
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,866
- Did you guys talk
about this last night?

787
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,909
- Yes, I was shitfaced,

788
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,285
and I was
pouring out my heart.

789
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,622
- You know what?
I am gonna need some herbs.

790
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,624
Would you mind getting something
from the garden?

791
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,334
- Do you need it right now,
or do you want to...

792
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,128
- It would be great
so that it could marinate.

793
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,420
- What?

794
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,548
- I do feel like sooner
rather than later would be good,

795
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,674
just so they can marinate.

796
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,925
- Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

797
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,802
Um, but I want to know...
I want to know what the...

798
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,886
- I'll remember where I was.

799
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,929
- I didn't know any of this,

800
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,139
what the breaking point...

801
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,849
- It's not the kind of stuff
you talk about.

802
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,142
- I know.
- Yeah.

803
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,643
- All right,
what do you want me to do?

804
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,978
- Um, real quick.

805
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,479
I've been thinking,

806
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,565
since the bottle of tequila
was pretty much empty,

807
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,025
I think the way we pitch it is,
you were here drinking,

808
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,986
and I came in, and we talked
for, like, 20 minutes.

809
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,320
Then you went to bed.

810
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,947
I stayed up
finishing the tequila.

811
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,991
And then that way, it's like,
we hung out a little bit

812
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,492
but not so much
that it's suspicious.

813
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,369
You know what I'm saying?
Is that cool with you?

814
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,996
- What are you talking about?

815
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,665
I mean, seriously,
what are you talking about?

816
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,042
- Okay,
don't you think we both agree

817
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,794
it's better
if Iris just doesn't know?

818
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,379
- Why?

819
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,175
- Because she's your sister,
and I'm her best friend...

820
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,342
- Yeah?
- And it's weird.

821
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,635
- Weird, what?

822
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,012
Well, it's weird
that we had sex.

823
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,680
I mean, I'm not particularly
proud of it.

824
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,265
But I don't think
she would give a shit.

825
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,892
- What do you mean
you're not proud of it?

826
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,894
- Come on.
Whatever, anyway, go ahead.

827
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,854
You want me to make up a story

828
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,814
to throw her off the track

829
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,983
so that she doesn't know
that we had sex?

830
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,985
- That sounds terrible
when you say it like that.

831
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,028
- Right.
- Okay?

832
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,487
- Do you have a thing
for my sister?

833
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,697
- I knew
you were gonna say this.

834
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,324
This is why I didn't want
to say anything.

835
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,742
I do not have a thing
for your sister.

836
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,993
- You have a thing
for my sister.

837
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,453
- I don't have a thing
for your sister.

838
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,621
Here's the deal.
- Okay.

839
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,039
- I think it would be bad
for all of us

840
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
if Iris knows about this.

841
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,416
I'm not just thinking...

842
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,460
- You are freaking me out
on so many levels right now.

843
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,670
- You don't think she'd be upset
if you told her we had sex?

844
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,214
- I don't think
she would give a shit, no.

845
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,548
- Wow.
- I hate to break it to you...

846
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,633
Hi!

847
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,759
- Hey!
I've got sage as well.

848
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,093
I don't know if that's any good.

849
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,554
- Uh, sage is great actually.

850
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,722
Perfect.
Thank you.

851
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,057
- So what was the point when...

852
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,642
what was it
when you decided that...

853
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,769
- You know what? I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

854
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,145
- No.
But I haven't heard any of it.

855
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,563
- I'm starting to get
so irritable,

856
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,065
because it's just
a bad topic.

857
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,858
- Let's listen to some music.

858
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,943
Why don't we do that?

859
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,944
- I'll put some music on.

860
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,862
- Yeah, let's do music.

861
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,031
That sounds good.

862
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,077
- Did she tell you about
the Pam thing last night?

863
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,119
- What's that?

864
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,204
- Did she tell you about Pam?

865
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,247
- We touched on it.

866
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,123
- How's this?
- It's okay.

867
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,251
- Can you not talk about me
when I'm in the same area?

868
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,544
- I'm just saying,
I think I'm a little upset

869
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,422
that this guy is, like,
all clued up on your breakup

870
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,757
and I don't know anything.

871
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,384
- Here's the deal.
New rule.

872
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,262
No talking behind anybody's
backs in this house, all right?

873
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,514
- All right.
- Um, we don't do that.

874
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,099
- Okay.
- Yeah, good.

875
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,476
- Okay, I know you don't want
to talk about it anymore.

876
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,811
That's fine.

877
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,020
- Yeah.
- That's totally fine.

878
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,105
- Let's just move on.

879
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,815
- All right.
- Sounds good to me.

880
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,281
This place is incredible.
- Mm-hmm.

881
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,866
- I know you said at some point
it was renovated, but...

882
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,952
- You don't understand
how beautiful this place was.

883
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,287
- You don't understand.
It was...

884
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,955
- I mean, it was insane.
- It was beautiful.

885
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,874
- It was just so pure
and gorgeous,

886
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,960
and then Marilyn came in
and just eradicated

887
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,545
any memory of us.

888
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,630
And, so the house, yes,
is very beautiful...

889
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,382
- Without the stink of us.

890
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,134
- Yeah.

891
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,886
- But Marilyn's only got
a couple more years left.

892
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,138
- It's two and a half, three.

893
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,514
- Two and a half,
three more years.

894
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,474
- Yeah, I think so.
- What, are you...

895
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,560
I'm sorry, what?
Three to go?

896
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,146
- The ten-year itch.
- Mm-hmm.

897
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,107
- Okay, he was with her mum
for ten years,

898
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,276
had an affair with my mum,
who was his secretary.

899
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,278
- Got your mom Lenora pregnant.
- Yes.

900
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,821
- Married her.

901
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,823
- Moved to London.
- Moved to London.

902
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,575
- Got bored of Lenora,
and then he moved on.

903
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,036
And then he kind of philandered
around for, like, seven years.

904
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,413
- He went through
his crazy Warren Beatty phase.

905
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,290
The funny thing, though,
about those years,

906
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,167
when he was so bad
with the ladies,

907
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,044
he was so good with us,
because that was...

908
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,295
- He wasn't.

909
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,796
- No, but that was, like,
six summers

910
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,256
that it was just
the three of us here.

911
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,716
- I know, but you were okay
with that.

912
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,967
I had no respect for that.

913
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,303
He just went... he dodged
from one to the other,

914
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,679
and it was gross.

915
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,930
- That's so crazy.

916
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,391
So he would just, like,
date all these women,

917
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,934
like, for short periods
of time

918
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,519
with not a lot
of emotional investment?

919
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,937
- Yeah, it was horrible.

920
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,231
- And they were very similar,
and then he would just move on?

921
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,524
- Yeah.
- God, that's just weird.

922
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,859
Who does that?
Oh!

923
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,736
And the patterns emerge!

924
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,363
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

925
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,366
Skinny Jeans George,
skinny Jeans Harry,

926
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,700
skinny Jeans vinnie.

927
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,536
Vinnie lasted
for at least two weeks.

928
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,788
He was one of the longer ones.

929
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,289
- I don't like dating.
You know that.

930
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,540
I don't like dating.

931
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,709
I don't like the...
I don't like it.

932
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,127
I get bored.
I don't like it.

933
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,670
- Do you know how
the Iris dating scheme

934
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,671
works these days?

935
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,507
No, you don't.

936
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,217
- Okay, this is basically
how it works,

937
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,593
I mean, in a nutshell.

938
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,513
So they come in
with the skinny jeans

939
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,474
that... yes, skinnier than these,
by the way.

940
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,394
Then we've got
the rocker stud belt,

941
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,020
the Converse, no socks,

942
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,982
tongue open, no shoelaces,
the swoopy haircut.

943
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,151
- Which you have right now,
by the way.

944
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,529
- Well, I have it
'cause I have hair problems.

945
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,905
These guys are young enough.

946
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,698
They should not be swooping.

947
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,784
It starts out
usually on a Friday,

948
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,452
'cause she met him
at a coffee shop.

949
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,913
Saturday night, we go to either
Fleet Foxes or Band of Horses...

950
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,706
- I like Fleet Foxes.

951
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,834
- Or some sort of
Light in The Attic show.

952
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,919
And then she takes them
to the greasy spoon breakfast

953
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,504
the next morning.

954
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,381
She's like, "I'm such
the greasy spoon girl,"

955
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,299
and then they get
very, very excited about her.

956
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,552
And the next weekend they call,
and she does coffee.

957
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,845
And then it's done.

958
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,721
- And why are you
almost defending them?

959
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,932
You hate all of the guys
that I've been out with.

960
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,517
You've hated all of them.

961
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,643
- Well, the problem is...

962
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,186
- I get very bored.
You know that.

963
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,729
- You have great taste in life,

964
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,857
and you have
terrible taste in men.

965
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,317
- You have terrible taste
in clothes.

966
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,652
- Of course I do.
I never said...

967
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,821
- Those denim shorts are
a horror show.

968
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,115
- Don't... don't talk about
the jean shorts.

969
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,908
Don't, don't.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

970
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,493
- The fact that
you've somehow managed

971
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,079
to get the inner seam higher
than the outer seam

972
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,539
is so creepy.

973
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,249
- God is in the details.
I'm sorry.

974
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,834
- I never want to see
those things again.

975
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,712
- Remember the guy who asked you
to cut your bush?

976
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,299
Remember?

977
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,800
The guy that you
were hooking up with

978
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,260
that told you to trim
your bush and...

979
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,720
- Okay, we're good.
- No, no, no.

980
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,180
She came home in tears,

981
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,806
because she was hooking up
with this guy.

982
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,183
Remember that guy?

983
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,934
And she had a little poof
in her underwear.

984
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,644
- Okay, you know...

985
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,189
- And she's like, "I didn't know
I'm supposed to trim my bush.

986
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,649
- I was so embarrassed.

987
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,485
- And I was, like,
the bad older sister

988
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,777
'cause I didn't tell her.

989
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,945
- What the fuck are you doing?

990
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,280
I didn't.
It was...

991
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,242
- Anyway, that's the only
boyfriend story I remember.

992
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,412
- You suck.
That is so wrong, by the way.

993
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,538
- What?
- That's very wrong.

994
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,998
- These are the guys...

995
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,750
- Okay, we're good,
we're good, we're good.

996
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,210
We're done.
We're done.

997
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,378
Okay?

998
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,838
- Okay, we're done.

999
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,257
I'm just gonna eat another vat
of mashed potatoes.

1000
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,051
- How are you liking
those mashed potatoes?

1001
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,178
- They're outrageous.

1002
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,387
- Yeah?
They taste good?

1003
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,639
- Mm-hmm.

1004
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,307
- How vegan do they taste
to you?

1005
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,188
Come on.

1006
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,607
I put a dollop of butter in.
That was it.

1007
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,858
Don't rinse out.
Come on.

1008
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,527
You've been plowing through
those things.

1009
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,861
Do you know why
they tasted good?

1010
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,613
Because they have dairy in them.
That's why.

1011
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,532
- Why would you do that?
- Because I felt like it.

1012
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,284
- That's five pounds of fear
right there that I just ate.

1013
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,037
- It was meant to be a joke

1014
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,539
just 'cause...
to see if you liked it.

1015
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,873
- It was meant to be a joke.

1016
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,500
- I mean,
it's just so not cool.

1017
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,043
- Okay, okay.

1018
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,336
You're right.
It's not cool.

1019
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,796
Are you allergic to butter,
though?

1020
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,258
- No, I'm emotionally allergic
to butter.

1021
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,093
- I'm sorry.
It was just a little bit.

1022
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,844
It was just a tablespoon.

1023
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,388
I like butter
in my mashed potato,

1024
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,890
and that was all it was.

1025
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,770
- All right.
- Don't, Hannah.

1026
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,065
- That was delicious
and inhumane and...

1027
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,650
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

1028
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,277
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1029
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,653
- I love you,
but I don't like you.

1030
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,988
- All right.

1031
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,739
- Thank you, Jack.

1032
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,741
- Good night, Hannah.

1033
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,965
- Hannah?

1034
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,966
- Hmm?

1035
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,427
Hello.

1036
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,637
- I'm sleeping.

1037
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,139
- I know.

1038
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,515
I can't sleep.

1039
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,146
It's because I'm so excited
that you're here.

1040
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,606
- Well, try.

1041
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,607
- What?

1042
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,608
- Try.

1043
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,318
- I can't.

1044
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,450
- Do you want to talk?

1045
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,493
- Mm-mm.

1046
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,120
- Go to bed.

1047
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,122
- I can't.

1048
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,666
- Well, sleep here, but, shh.

1049
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,000
- Okay.

1050
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,300
Can I just have one question?

1051
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,928
- Hmm?

1052
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,097
- Do you like Jack?

1053
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,811
- Yeah, he's all right.

1054
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:50,978
- Hmm?

1055
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,189
- I said he's all right.

1056
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,692
- What do you think of him?

1057
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,277
- I don't know.

1058
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,446
I just met him.

1059
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,864
- Yeah, but, you know,

1060
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,660
you're very good
at working people out.

1061
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,958
- I don't know.
He seems like a nice guy.

1062
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,126
- Mm-hmm.

1063
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,212
- He's a good cook.

1064
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,380
Asshole.

1065
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,716
- Sorry about the potato.

1066
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,555
I hate that bush story.

1067
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,597
- I'm sorry about that.

1068
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,725
- I, like, hate it so much.

1069
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,728
It's so, so embarrassing.

1070
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,854
- It's a good story.

1071
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,149
- Yeah, for you.

1072
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,778
- I don't know.
He's funny, I guess.

1073
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,989
- He's very funny.

1074
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,492
- And full of himself.

1075
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,244
- Well, it's because
he's nervous, though.

1076
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,414
He just gets a little posture-y
when he's nervous.

1077
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,793
He's really smart.

1078
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,964
- So do you like him?

1079
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,592
- Yeah, he's my friend.

1080
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:10,266
- No, I mean, do you like him
like him?

1081
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,937
- Yeah.

1082
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,069
I think I'm in love with him.

1083
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,952
- Wow.

1084
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,455
- Yeah.

1085
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,500
Do you think that's weird?

1086
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,503
- No.

1087
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,636
No.

1088
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,764
- Because of Tom,
I think it might be weird.

1089
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,144
- I don't know.

1090
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,242
- He made this, like,
really drunken pass at me once.

1091
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:13,871
And it was right after
I broke up with Tom.

1092
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:20,294
And it was completely
embarrassing, but...

1093
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,799
He was so upset
the next day,

1094
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,845
you know, mortified.

1095
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,847
And...

1096
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:40,064
And I was kind of happy
that it happened.

1097
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,822
So I guess I thought then
that I shouldn't...

1098
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,740
shouldn't tell him.

1099
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,247
Do you think that
I should tell him?

1100
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,545
No.

1101
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,380
- No, not no.

1102
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,799
Uh-uh...

1103
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,677
- He's so sweet.

1104
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,557
- I think you should sleep
on it.

1105
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,893
- Sleep on it?

1106
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,227
I thought you were gonna say,

1107
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,979
"I think you should
sleep with him."

1108
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,733
- That's my usual advice.

1109
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,654
- I just think
I might fuck everything up,

1110
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:34,160
because maybe
we know each other too well,

1111
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,453
you know?

1112
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,748
And he'd be totally
weirded out, and...

1113
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,421
- sleep on it.

1114
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,422
- Okay.

1115
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,842
- In your own bed.

1116
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,177
- Okay.

1117
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,014
- I'm exhausted.

1118
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,682
- Okay.

1119
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,727
- I love you.

1120
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:05,524
It's nice to see you.

1121
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,318
- So good to see you,
Peanut.

1122
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,453
- Okay.

1123
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,856
- Hi, stink Bomb.

1124
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,983
- Hey.

1125
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,651
How are you?

1126
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,319
- What are you doing?

1127
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,445
- Just chilling.

1128
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,322
Reading.

1129
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,032
- Are you not sleeping?

1130
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,158
- I can't sleep.

1131
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,660
Can you not sleep?

1132
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,955
Here.

1133
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,915
Thanks.

1134
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,001
- Yeah.

1135
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,676
- What do you think of her?

1136
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,723
- I think she's great.

1137
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,057
You know, I really like her,

1138
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:25,021
and she seems great.

1139
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,608
Do you not like her?

1140
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,112
- No, I just said I like her.

1141
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,405
I do.

1142
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,615
- Did you... what did you guys
do last night?

1143
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,369
- We, um...

1144
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,831
Nothing.

1145
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,833
You know, it was just,
like, small talk,

1146
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,710
getting to know
each other a little bit.

1147
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,714
And it was nice.

1148
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,801
- Do you think
that she's pretty?

1149
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:02,558
- I think she is
empirically attractive.

1150
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,479
- What?

1151
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,066
- "Technically speaking she is,
uh, pretty attractive."

1152
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,026
- Whatever.

1153
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,486
She's a pretty girl.
Yeah.

1154
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,862
- She's really pretty.

1155
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,489
- She's a pretty girl.

1156
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,573
- This is her room.

1157
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,574
Do you know that?

1158
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,575
- This is her room?

1159
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,785
- You're in her room.

1160
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,578
- That's weird.
Why'd she put me in here?

1161
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,331
She hates this room.

1162
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,376
- Maybe that's why
she put me in here.

1163
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,504
- She does.
She really hates this room.

1164
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,924
She hasn't even unpacked.

1165
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,008
- Wow.

1166
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,676
- Yeah, that's all her stuff.

1167
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,803
Shit.

1168
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,348
- What is that?

1169
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,682
- This is all her paintings.

1170
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,684
I don't know if she even knows
they're here.

1171
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:50,439
She hasn't picked up a brush
in years, but...

1172
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,066
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

1173
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,609
These are all
from around here.

1174
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,821
And this is a nudist beach

1175
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,114
on the other side
of the island.

1176
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,240
- On this island?

1177
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,241
- Yep.

1178
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,618
- That's crazy.

1179
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,453
- Anyway...

1180
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,081
- Anyway.

1181
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,801
I got to tell you something.

1182
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,344
- What?

1183
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,602
- I...

1184
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,151
- What?

1185
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:43,159
- I am too old to ride bicycles
to islands.

1186
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,121
- Anyway,

1187
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,666
that's my big confession
for the night.

1188
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,827
You just put your foot
in my face,

1189
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,953
you son of a bitch.

1190
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,996
- What?

1191
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,331
- You just put your foot
in my face.

1192
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,415
- No, I didn't.

1193
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,666
- You did.

1194
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,795
- Shit head.

1195
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,829
- Hey.

1196
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,002
- You were right.

1197
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,422
- About what?

1198
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:24,718
- It's just, um,
better if she doesn't know.

1199
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,095
Cool?

1200
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,514
- Yeah, that's...
that's good for me, yeah.

1201
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,610
- Just like that.

1202
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,113
- Ew, it's a gloopy.

1203
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,197
- I prefer "eye booger."

1204
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,282
- Oh...

1205
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,741
- What are... what are we
in for here?

1206
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,951
- Hmm?
- What are we in for here?

1207
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,244
- I have no idea.

1208
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,746
- Are you guys ready for
the best gluten-free, vegan,

1209
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,082
soy-free pancakes
you're ever gonna eat?

1210
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,458
- Mmm.

1211
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,543
- Absolutely.

1212
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,420
- Seriously,
these are delicious.

1213
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,462
- They look really good.

1214
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,839
- You can have a little
sad pancake.

1215
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
- There's the little man.

1216
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,174
- Look, two little
sad pancakes.

1217
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,302
- Oh, he is a little sad.
I'll make him happy.

1218
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,470
- Tell me if you miss
anything,

1219
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,180
'cause I would be very surprised
if you do.

1220
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,265
- Okay.

1221
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,474
- Um... oh!

1222
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,767
Maple syrup.

1223
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,770
- Maple syrup.

1224
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,444
- Oh, shoot.

1225
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,196
Okay, you know what?

1226
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,949
No maple syrup, but we do have
cashew butter.

1227
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,950
- Mmm.

1228
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,993
Amazing.

1229
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,161
- They're good?
- Mm!

1230
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,662
- Oh, my God.
I'm so excited.

1231
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,913
- That's great.
- So good.

1232
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,582
- They're actually even good
without it.

1233
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,168
But I will try it with.

1234
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,169
See how we do.

1235
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,503
- I put that stuff on
everything.

1236
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,504
It is delish.

1237
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,589
- Yeah?

1238
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,677
Mmm.
Good.

1239
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,803
- They're good?

1240
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,805
- Very good.
- Very good.

1241
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,432
- I'm so happy
you guys like them.

1242
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,641
I mean, do you miss it?

1243
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,226
Do you even miss the butter
and the milk?

1244
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,604
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

1245
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,528
- They're terrible.

1246
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,530
No, they're not.

1247
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,032
- They're so bad.

1248
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,242
- They're so good, right?

1249
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,410
Aren't they good?

1250
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,037
- I think "terrible"
is an extreme word.

1251
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,081
I think that
they are challenged,

1252
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,248
but they are...

1253
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,625
- I think it's
a very good effort.

1254
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,709
- It's not.

1255
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,877
You know what it is?

1256
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,587
The flax seeds
didn't do a good job.

1257
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,631
I put flax seeds in
to replace the egg,

1258
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,758
and usually I use coconut oil,
but we didn't have any.

1259
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,051
And it's just...

1260
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,886
- Well, you didn't have
the right ingredients.

1261
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:31,887
- We didn't.

1262
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,180
- This is what I think.

1263
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,348
We'll have a second round.

1264
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,391
- Okay.

1265
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,892
- You get all
the right ingredients.

1266
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,019
I'll make my pancakes,
you make yours,

1267
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,521
and we'll have, like,
a pancake-off.

1268
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,732
And then whoever wins will win,
like, a...

1269
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,859
- Trip to, uh, IHOP.

1270
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,902
- A trip to IHOP.

1271
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,404
But make sure you bring
your passport,

1272
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,988
'cause it's international,
you know.

1273
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,073
- Right.

1274
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,369
Well done.

1275
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,662
Sorry, you guys.

1276
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,913
- Don't be sorry.

1277
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,166
- Do you know what
I'm so excited about?

1278
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,127
- What?
- You.

1279
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,378
- What do you mean?

1280
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,754
- I'm happy you've left her.

1281
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,423
I think that's what
I'm trying to say.

1282
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,757
- I think I'm happy too.

1283
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,676
- I've kind of missed seeing
your face like this.

1284
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,761
It's the first time I've seen
you look really happy

1285
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,805
in a long time.

1286
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,682
That's awesome.

1287
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,933
Despite the terrible pancakes.

1288
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,270
- You do.
It's really lovely for me.

1289
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,607
I've missed you, you know,
seeing you.

1290
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,734
Fuck Pam.
- Fuck her.

1291
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:31,196
- Fuck Pam.

1292
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,073
- Fuck Pam.
- Fuck Pam.

1293
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,950
Or don't fuck Pam.

1294
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,577
Fuck someone else now.

1295
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,081
You can do anything
you want now.

1296
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,166
That's the thing.

1297
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,375
It's really exciting.

1298
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,918
You can go traveling now.

1299
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,003
You're not stuck in...

1300
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,337
- I can.
I was thinking about that.

1301
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,422
- You can go to India.

1302
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,132
You can find yourself,
like Lenora.

1303
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,134
You can do whatever you want.

1304
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,302
You can have a baby now.

1305
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,803
A baby?

1306
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,972
- She's always wanted them.
She's always wanted them.

1307
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,307
- That's right where
my mind goes.

1308
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,225
Let me go have a baby now.

1309
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,811
- No, I've been thinking
about it, that she's...

1310
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,146
she's always wanted one
as well.

1311
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,981
She has actually always wanted
a baby.

1312
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,649
You should try.

1313
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,692
Now is your time.

1314
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,152
I mean, were you trying?

1315
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,529
Were you even trying?

1316
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,780
- Yeah, I mean, we had...

1317
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,449
you know, we'd been
talking about it.

1318
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,159
- She never wanted them,
though.

1319
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
- But she said she did.

1320
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,661
- Yeah, she said was gonna...

1321
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,122
she said she was gonna relent
at some point.

1322
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,999
And I don't think she ever
wanted them.

1323
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,169
And you have such
an opportunity now, you know?

1324
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,795
- Yeah.

1325
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,589
- Okay.
Are you embarrassed a bit?

1326
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,633
It's probably embarrassing,
in front of Jack.

1327
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,176
- No. No.
It's just... yeah.

1328
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,302
I mean...

1329
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,054
We just...
it wasn't on the table.

1330
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,514
At the end of the day,
it wasn't...

1331
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,351
uh, wasn't to be,
so moving on.

1332
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,519
- All right,
I'm just saying

1333
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,062
that there's
tons of stuff you can do.

1334
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,522
- Travel.

1335
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,649
- No, but you... there's...
don't change the subject.

1336
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,526
This is what you want.

1337
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,152
There's sperm donors.

1338
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,153
There's like...

1339
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,279
- Christ.
- Yeah.

1340
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,656
- It's expensive.

1341
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,116
- But what I'm saying now
is that there's, like...

1342
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,284
you can go online.

1343
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,577
There's sperm donors.

1344
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,037
There's sperm in the air.

1345
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,998
You just grab a dude
and preg yourself up.

1346
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,210
- That sounds horrible.

1347
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,712
- Pick a guy.
Any guy.

1348
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,382
It would just be one night,
and then you're done.

1349
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,802
- I'm gonna get some coffee.

1350
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,136
Would you like a refill?
- Mm-hmm.

1351
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,555
- Hannah, would you like
something?

1352
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,098
- Ah, yes.
Thank you.

1353
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,224
Refresh, please.

1354
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,392
- Coffee?
Okay.

1355
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,393
Good.

1356
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,561
I'll be right back.

1357
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,441
I need to talk to you.

1358
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,910
- Let's go for a walk.
- Okay. Good.

1359
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,246
Um, we're going to go
for a walk, Jack-Jack.

1360
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,165
You're gonna stay here
and think about your life.

1361
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,626
Come on, Hannah.

1362
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,627
- I'm going for a walk.

1363
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,878
- Hey, hey.

1364
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,006
Hey, hey, quick.

1365
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,926
Um, just wanted to check in
with you real quick.

1366
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,388
So I don't know exactly
how to put this,

1367
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:05,058
but it definitely was
a little weird.

1368
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,602
I didn't know about you

1369
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,063
and your relationship to,
like, wanting a baby and stuff,

1370
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,607
which is great, obviously.

1371
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,233
But, in terms of, like,
the whole, like,

1372
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:16,236
"Oh, just grab a guy,
and there's sperm everywhere,"

1373
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,447
like, it definitely made me
think for a sec.

1374
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,407
Our first night...

1375
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:23,243
I hate to even bring it up,
but I feel like I should just...

1376
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,786
- We used a condom.

1377
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,540
- That's true.

1378
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,583
Yeah, you're right.

1379
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,710
Sorry.

1380
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,794
Sorry.
Are we good?

1381
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,171
Okay, thanks.
Sorry about that.

1382
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,255
I didn't mean to...

1383
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,298
- see you later.

1384
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,299
- Backtrack.

1385
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,801
I just felt like
double-checking.

1386
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,095
Safety first.

1387
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,475
- Yeah, and the thought of it
is scary,

1388
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,934
and it's all
of those things.

1389
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,770
And if I'm gonna do it,

1390
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,647
I just feel like
I should just tell him.

1391
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,983
And I thought about it
all night.

1392
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,779
And we slept in the same
fucking bed, you know.

1393
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,823
And it's just the comfort
and the ease that we have.

1394
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:05,744
I just don't believe
that just evaporates.

1395
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,995
I hope, anyway.

1396
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,373
I just feel like I've got
to take this leap.

1397
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:13,168
And I was lying there
last night,

1398
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,504
and I couldn't
get to sleep.

1399
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,005
And he's snoring next to me,

1400
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,340
and I'm, like,
"Just tell him.

1401
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,508
Just fucking tell him."

1402
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,177
You know, I just...

1403
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,179
I just have to.
I think it's time.

1404
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,598
And I don't even know
what he's gonna think

1405
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,641
or what he's gonna say.

1406
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,727
I just feel like
I've got to stop

1407
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,897
feeling so passive about things,
you know?

1408
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,065
What's the matter?

1409
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,068
Why are you being so quiet?

1410
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,039
- You don't think
I should do it?

1411
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,292
- No, I have
to tell you something.

1412
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:40,839
And I have to tell you something
before I tell you something.

1413
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,424
The first thing
that I'm gonna tell you,

1414
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,967
you're going to have
a big problem with.

1415
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,136
So I think I'm just
gonna tell you.

1416
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,345
- Okay.

1417
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,361
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1418
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,404
Oh, my God.
Oh.

1419
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,588
- Iris!

1420
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,302
- Jack!

1421
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,637
- Whoa, whoa.

1422
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,305
What's going on?
What's going on?

1423
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,890
- You fucked my sister.

1424
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,976
You fucked my sister!

1425
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,436
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1426
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,854
- Look, I'm so sorry.

1427
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,023
- You were here for one night.
She's a fucking lesbian.

1428
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,066
- It was a total mistake.

1429
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,567
You should never
have known about it.

1430
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,027
I'm so sorry,
but there's something

1431
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,445
much bigger at work here...
Hannah!

1432
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,322
- Iris, I'm so sorry.
- Tell her about the condom.

1433
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,740
Hannah, tell her
about the condom.

1434
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,659
- What's he talking about?
- Tell her.

1435
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,743
I found the condom!

1436
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,411
- What'd you do?

1437
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,871
Why were you looking
for the condom?

1438
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:55,997
What's going on?

1439
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,207
- Well, well, why?
You know why?

1440
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,959
Because she poked holes
in the condom.

1441
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,377
- Can you just shut up
for one second?

1442
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,795
- No, you poked holes
in the condom.

1443
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,004
It's a fucking rain shower!

1444
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,172
She tried to steal my sperm.

1445
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,549
- I didn't try to steal
your sperm.

1446
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,675
- Well, then, what was that?

1447
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,177
- Did you poke holes
in a condom, Hannah?

1448
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,512
- No.
Yes.

1449
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,513
- Why?

1450
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,598
- No, I was trying...

1451
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,891
I was trying to get pregnant.

1452
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,643
- With Jack?
- Yeah.

1453
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,811
- No.
Not with Jack.

1454
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,396
With someone.
- Oh, my God.

1455
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,565
- Jack, you didn't even...
you weren't even gonna know.

1456
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,774
- Oh, I wasn't going to know?

1457
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,359
- It was going
into a little plastic sack

1458
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,569
and get thrown
into the trash.

1459
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,570
- Exactly!

1460
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,737
Where sperm belongs

1461
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,573
so it doesn't become
a fucking baby

1462
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,866
that I don't know about!

1463
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,868
- Okay, so this...
let me just clear this up.

1464
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:39,374
You potentially could be
pregnant with his baby.

1465
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,209
Is that what...
is that what you're telling me?

1466
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,252
- I don't know.

1467
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,920
- Holy shit.
Holy shit.

1468
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,380
You had to pick him,
didn't you?

1469
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,132
You had go pick Jack.
- I didn't pick him.

1470
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,425
- All the guys.

1471
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,468
All of the guys,
and you had to go and pick him.

1472
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,304
- I wasn't trying to pick him.
I was just...

1473
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,805
- Why?
Why did it have to be him?

1474
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,724
- I didn't know you were
in love with him!

1475
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,686
How could I know you were
in love with him?

1476
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,442
I would never have done that.

1477
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,068
I don't want to hurt you.

1478
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,904
I didn't know.

1479
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,032
What are you doing?

1480
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,575
- I don't know.

1481
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,536
I just wanted a baby.

1482
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,122
I'm sorry.

1483
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,582
Fuck.

1484
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,000
I fucked up.

1485
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,543
- Fuck.

1486
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:43,438
I am a really bad person.

1487
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,525
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

1488
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,568
- No.

1489
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,071
I don't want to talk to you,
Jack.

1490
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,411
- Hey, hey.

1491
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,541
- I really think your face
is going to annoy me right now.

1492
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,042
I don't want to talk to you.

1493
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,044
- My face always annoys you.

1494
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,845
- I'm so sorry.

1495
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:03,143
- Why did you do that?

1496
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:13,194
Did you not think that
that would be weird for me?

1497
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,155
Did you not think that, like,

1498
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:20,577
even if I hadn't found out
that that would be weird thing,

1499
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:25,540
that you'd have to carry that
and still be friends with me?

1500
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,209
- It's weird.

1501
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,211
It's definitely weird.

1502
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:37,802
But it's, like, I...

1503
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:41,181
I slept with your sister,

1504
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:46,728
and you slept with my brother.

1505
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,900
And I don't know.

1506
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:57,405
I don't even...

1507
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,740
This is just
so confusing.

1508
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,868
There's a lot happening
right now.

1509
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:05,121
But I can't...

1510
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,750
I can't come between you
and your sister, okay?

1511
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,877
That is not something
I can ever do.

1512
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:15,298
- I can't even think about her
right now.

1513
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,343
- She...

1514
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,554
- I don't want anything to do
with her right now, okay?

1515
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,435
- I just know I saw her
when you left the room,

1516
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:32,774
and she loves you,

1517
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:33,983
and she's sorry.

1518
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,616
You can never understand
how important

1519
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:46,996
the bond is that you have
with your sister.

1520
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:50,125
You will never understand
the way I do.

1521
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:57,882
I could never live with myself
if I knew, in some way,

1522
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:02,303
I might be coming between you
or the cause of any of that.

1523
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,683
And what I did was a mistake,

1524
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:12,313
and it's the worst fucking
mistake I have ever made.

1525
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,819
But I didn't...

1526
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:24,909
Oh, fuck.

1527
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,631
I didn't sleep with your sister

1528
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,341
'cause I wanted to sleep
with your sister.

1529
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,677
I slept with your sister

1530
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,097
because I can't be with you.

1531
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,775
I have to go.

1532
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,696
- Where are you going?

1533
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,241
- I don't know.

1534
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,078
- You gonna come back?

1535
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,171
I made some potatoes
if you want some.

1536
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,030
- Iris?

1537
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,532
- Yeah?

1538
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,410
- I'm sorry.

1539
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,007
- Morning.

1540
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:51,397
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do,

1541
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:54,442
you know, if there's a baby?

1542
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,992
- Not really.

1543
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:16,464
- 'Cause I was just thinking

1544
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:20,551
that I wouldn't want you to...

1545
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,554
feel alone,

1546
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:27,308
you know?

1547
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,978
And if you wanted any help

1548
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:35,691
that that would be
something I could do.

1549
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,701
You know that I could help you
raise the baby.

1550
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,335
I have a spare room.

1551
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:02,635
- Are you sure that's what
you'd be up for,

1552
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,178
want to do,

1553
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,681
could bite off?

1554
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,476
I don't know.

1555
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:13,354
- Yeah, I think it is.

1556
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:20,528
I could do the 3:00 a.m. Feed,
you know?

1557
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:24,657
I don't know.

1558
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,201
I've just been thinking
about it.

1559
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,787
It's whatever you want.

1560
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,585
- I think I'd like that.

1561
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:37,670
- Yeah?

1562
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,671
- Yeah.

1563
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,926
Thanks,

1564
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:48,848
just, you know,
for the offer, even,

1565
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:51,559
even if there is no baby.

1566
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,021
- It's okay.

1567
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,710
- Warm up?

1568
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,256
- Yeah.

1569
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,510
I'm sorry.

1570
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:28,262
- It's okay.

1571
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:56,207
- Here comes
the milk police car.

1572
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:59,376
- Here comes
the milk race car.

1573
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:08,803
- Whoever has the sun,
turn it on!

1574
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,654
- Fuck.

1575
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,519
Fuck!

1576
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:38,434
Fuck you.

1577
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:43,439
Fuck you!

1578
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,845
- I think if you see
two together, it's good luck.

1579
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:16,013
- The crows?

1580
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:20,184
- Yeah, and one
is a spirit guide.

1581
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:38,953
- Hi.

1582
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:39,995
Hi.

1583
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,874
I have something I want to say
to you guys, okay?

1584
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,880
I'm unemployed,

1585
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,632
and I'm financially unstable,

1586
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:57,805
and I am emotionally, at best,
precarious,

1587
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,974
at worst, a cripple.

1588
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:04,436
And I'm not in a place
in my life

1589
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:08,816
to be any sort
of father figure, potentially.

1590
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:12,152
And I'm certainly,
as your best friend,

1591
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:15,781
no one I would recommend
as a boyfriend.

1592
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,452
And that sucks,

1593
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:25,040
because you...

1594
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:27,918
might be carrying my baby,

1595
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:33,257
and I'm in love
with your sister.

1596
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,431
But...

1597
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,481
I'm tired of being dead,

1598
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:51,483
and I want
to come back to life.

1599
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:58,198
So if there, you know,
is a baby in there,

1600
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:02,870
you absolutely
should have that.

1601
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:07,416
And I would love to help
if you want me...

1602
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,002
not pushy, just available,

1603
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:13,881
be it friend or uncle
or dad-ish,

1604
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,050
on some level.

1605
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:20,554
And you.

1606
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:27,603
I don't deserve you.

1607
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:31,315
But I would give you

1608
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,943
every fucking thing
that I have.

1609
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:42,659
And if you guys would consider
having me,

1610
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,579
I'm asking for a shot.

1611
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,886
- I love you.

1612
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:02,638
- And I love you.

1613
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,100
- Come here.

1614
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,102
Come on.
- Come on.

1615
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,645
- Come on.
Don't be silly.

1616
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,105
Come here, sperm stealer.

1617
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:02,322
- Okay.
- Okay.

1618
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,700
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right.
