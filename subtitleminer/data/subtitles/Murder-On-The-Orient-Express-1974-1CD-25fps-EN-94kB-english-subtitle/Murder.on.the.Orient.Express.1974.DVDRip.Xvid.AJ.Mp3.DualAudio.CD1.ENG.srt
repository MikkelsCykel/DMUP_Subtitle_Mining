1
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:52,318
- Your ticket, please.
- Oh, yes.

2
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,512
- Welcome aboard, Miss Debenham.
- Thank you.

3
00:06:55,723 --> 00:07:00,092
<i>Bosporus Ferry will shortly depart</i>
<i>from Istanbul Sirkeci Station,</i>

4
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,852
<i>connecting with the</i> Orient Express.

5
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,690
Here's your ticket,
Monsieur Poirot.

6
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,563
I'm afraid you've still got another hour.

7
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,032
Well, then, please do not wait.

8
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:15,902
Not wait? After all you've
done for us, Monsieur Poirot?

9
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,302
My general's orders were to
ensure your safe departure.

10
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,003
He also wished me
to thank you again

11
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:24,514
for saving the honor of the British
garrison in Jordan.

12
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,720
The brigadier's confession
was opportune.

13
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,355
I say, how did you do it?

14
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:33,288
Was it the old thumbscrew,
you know, the rack?

15
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:38,294
Yes. Well, you'll be able to rest
as soon as you get to Stamboul.

16
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,524
The...

17
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:44,569
The church of Santa Sofia
is absolutely magnificent.

18
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,672
You have seen it?

19
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,307
No.

20
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,369
Come on.

21
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:57,178
Move. Come on.

22
00:07:57,385 --> 00:08:00,218
Get up. Come on.

23
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:02,347
Chop-chop.

24
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:13,759
I hope we did the right thing booking
you into a hotel on the European side

25
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:15,902
rather than the Asian side.

26
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:20,164
I have no prejudice against
either continent.

27
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:25,105
The... The crossing
should be pleasant.

28
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:28,145
The Bosporus is always calm.

29
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,678
You have crossed by the ferry?

30
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,577
No.

31
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:47,261
Welcome, Colonel Arbu...

32
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,493
Arbu... Arbut...

33
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,729
Arbuthnott.

34
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:59,035
<i>The Bosporus Ferry will shortly</i>
<i>depart for Istanbul Sirkeci Station,</i>

35
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,413
<i>connecting with the</i> Orient Express.

36
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,291
Not now.

37
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:16,429
Not now. When it's all over.
When it's behind us. Then.

38
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,969
What a funny little man.

39
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,402
Obviously a frog.

40
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,942
It can be important.

41
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:47,917
...between East and West, where you
can eat the finest Oriental food.

42
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:50,886
Good evening, sir.
This way, please.

43
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:55,892
<i>Ecco finalmente un amico</i>.

44
00:10:56,096 --> 00:11:00,089
Monsieur Poirot.

45
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,529
Bianchi.

46
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:04,704
How are you, my friend?

47
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,374
- Good to see you.
- You have saved me from apoplexy.

48
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:10,806
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

49
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,777
You have not dined well.

50
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:17,383
The skewers are of better quality
than the kebab.

51
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:20,281
The bottle is more
distinguished than its wine.

52
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:23,820
And the coffee.

53
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:27,183
Fortunately, I have been called
to London. I leave tonight.

54
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,191
- On the <i>Orient Express</i>?
- How else?

55
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:34,197
<i>Evviva</i>! I have a traveling companion.
<i>Eccellente</i>.

56
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:37,529
Well, where shall we dine?

57
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,540
I am desolate, Monsieur Poirot.

58
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,153
There is not one single first-class
sleeping berth on the entire train.

59
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:59,354
- What? In December?
- In December, signor.

60
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,085
Has Bulgaria declared war on Turkey?

61
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,287
Are the aristocracy fleeing
the country?

62
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:05,726
I am a director of the line,

63
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,867
Monsieur Hercule Poirot
is not only a detective

64
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:11,231
of international fame and distinction,
but he is also my personal friend.

65
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:13,429
Signor Bianchi, Monsieur Poirot...

66
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:15,438
Courage, my friend,
we'll arrange something.

67
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:17,133
<i>Andiamo</i>!
We must go. Come on.

68
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:05,684

Mrs. Hubbard.
It's always an honor to greet you.

It's unbelievable, signor.
All the world elects to travel tonight.

88
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,041
Nonetheless, you must find room
for Monsieur Poirot here.

89
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,813
Monsieur Hercule Poirot?

90
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:16,109
- The famous...
- Precisely.

91
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,113
And he is also a personal
friend of mine.

92
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,017
Please be so good as to direct...

<i>Plats nummer sju</i>.

<i>Sju</i>...

95
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:37,564
Something is lost?

96
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:40,331
My little medal of St. Christopher,

97
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,907
to bring me luck and deliver...

98
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,010
Deliver me from evil.

99
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,448
Madame. Madame, lucky tooth
from St. Augustine of Hippo.

100
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:49,881
Madame. Madame, lucky tooth
from St. Augustine of Hippo.

101
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,712
- Lucky Buddha, madame?
- Madame, lucky Buddha.

102
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:59,189
Thank God, my St. Christopher.

103
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,520
St. Christopher.

104
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,913
You see, my friend has been
urgently called to London

105
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,713
on a matter of
international importance,

106
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,618
and I have given him my
personal assurance

107
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:34,885
that you will secure an accommodation
for him on the coach to Calais.

108
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,859
- But, Signor Bianchi, I have already...
- Hector...

109
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:42,001
Excuse me, excuse me, gentlemen,
but Mr. Ratchett has reservations,

110
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:44,432
and we'd be grateful if we could
board immediately.

111
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,398
Mr. Ratchett.

112
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,838
Welcome to the number ten.

113
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:53,203
Mr. Beddoes, the lower berth
in number one.

114
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:56,314
Mr. McQueen, the lower berth
in number four.

115
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:59,542
- The upper berth is...
- As arranged.

116
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:03,784
Now, Pierre, it is cold.

117
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,289
Now we can place Monsieur
Poirot in the number 16,

118
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,188
which is always kept vacant.

119
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,159
It is taken, signor, by a Mr. Hardman.

120
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,188
Then as a director of the line,

121
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,301
I command you to place
Monsieur Poirot

122
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:19,495
in what we know to be the empty berth
above Mr. McQueen's number four.

123
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,731
Monsieur.

124
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:25,969
At least you can get two tips.

125
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:44,321
- Pardon, monsieur.
- Sorry.

126
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:50,367
- Pardon.
- Excuse me, signor.

127
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:07,744
Well, my second husband,
Mr. Hubbard, would have raised hell.

128
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:10,616
No place for my makeup bag,
no ice in my drinking water,

129
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:13,315
and the hot water burps as it
comes out of the faucet.

130
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:15,318
Pardon.

131
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:27,567
Have courage, my friend.
It is the last compartment but one.

132
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:29,742
Pardon.

133
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,116
No.

134
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,619
I think there's a mistake.

135
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,655
<i>Je crois que vous avez</i>
<i>fait une erreur</i>.

136
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,884
Mr. McQueen, there is no
other berth on the train.

137
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,687
Monsieur Poirot has to come in here.

138
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:51,386
Voilà, monsieur, all is arranged.

139
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,896
Yours is the upper berth,
the number four.

140
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,329
We start in one minute.

141
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:58,026
I apologize if I have
incommoded you here.

142
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:00,639
However, it is for one
night only at Belgrade Station.

143
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:03,275
Oh, I see. At Belgrade,
you're... You're getting off.

144
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:41,094
Better than the hotel?

145
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:43,701
I shall probably keep
the menu as a souvenir.

146
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:50,670
Hector, I ordered three Islamic
13th-century, perforated pottery bowls

147
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:52,435
and six beakers.

148
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:56,377
They delivered only five beakers,
and one of the bowls arrived chipped,

149
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,483
which it was not when I paid for it.

150
00:22:58,685 --> 00:22:59,947
Through the nose.

151
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:04,021
- Send a telegram from Belgrade.
- Yes. Yes, Mr. Ratchett.

152
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:06,822
What's the matter? You look tired.

153
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:10,295
- I slept badly.
- Yeah, why?

154
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:15,261
The Belgian in the upper berth snored.

155
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:19,404
Really? Any other
unanswered letters on file?

156
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,308
Only the anonymous ones.

157
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:25,137
We can't answer those, can we?

158
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:28,444
You'd better go catch up
on your sleep...

159
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:32,778
...before the Belgian gentleman
gets back to your compartment.

160
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,378
Go on.

161
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,342
Hi. My name's Hardman.

162
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,953
Call me Dick.

163
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:12,647
- Foscarelli. Call me Gino.
- How are you?

164
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:16,089
Beddoes.

165
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,229
Mr. Beddoes.

166
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:23,798
For the pen of a Balzac.

167
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,235
For three days, all these people,
these total strangers,

168
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,536
meet in a single train whose
engine controls their destiny.

169
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:37,709
Yes, I know. We are both
envious of the husband.

170
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,612
Is...?

171
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,617
Is the husband as British
as his tweeds?

172
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,813
Oh, heaven forbid.
He's a hot-blooded Hungarian.

173
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,619
If you but look at his wife,
he will cease to be a diplomat.

174
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,489
Thank God we are not young.

175
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:05,237
My second husband said
always to ask for change in dollars

176
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:06,844
or at worst, sterling.

177
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,810
So for Pete's sake,
what's a drachma?

178
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:12,576
It is... What do you call it...?
The currency...

179
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:15,482
My second husband also said,
"Take a book of food tickets, Mama,

180
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:17,657
"and you'll have no problem,
no problem at all."

181
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:19,085
That just isn't so.

182
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:21,226
First there's this ten-percent tip. Five
would've done the steward more...

183
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:22,952
I think Miss Ohlsson has a headache.

184
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:25,688
Would you forgive us if we went back
to the compartment, Mrs. Hubbard?

185
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,127
Gladly, if you must.

186
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,824
If you need aspirin,
I always carry it on my person.

187
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:31,595
I mistrust foreign drugs.

188
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:35,070
You must excuse me,
Mrs. Hubbard is upon us.

189
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:39,100
What's the matter with him?
Train-sick or something?

190
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:44,181
Some of us, in the words of the divine
Greta Garbo, "want to be alone".

191
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:56,555
And for dinner this evening?

192
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,823
You will have the goodness
to serve me the poached sole

193
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:02,001
with one new potato

194
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:06,832
and a small green salad
with no dressing. Hildegarde.

195
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:09,271
Who was that majestic lady?

196
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:13,412
- The Princess Dragomiroff.
- I have heard.

197
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:31,925
Pardon me, sir.

198
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,396
I wonder if you could
oblige me with a light.

199
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,592
Certainly.

200
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:39,270
Thank you.
My name is Ratchett.

201
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,373
Do I have the pleasure of speaking
to Mr. Hercule Poirot?

202
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:45,237
The pleasure possibly, Mr. Ratchett,
the intention certainly.

203
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:46,776
You asked me for a light.

204
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,312
I offered you one,
and you have not used it.

205
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:53,246
One can deduce that without
acute mental exhaustion.

206
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:55,648
That's wonderful. Sit down, sir.

207
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,345
- For a moment.
- Just for a moment.

208
00:26:57,557 --> 00:26:59,718
Thank you very much.

209
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,350
Well, Mr. Poirot.

210
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:04,554
- Poirot.
- How's that?

211
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:07,528
- Poirot.
- Oh, Poirot. Right.

212
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:13,036
I just wanted to say that in my country
we also come quickly to the point.

213
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:20,271
I want you to take a job on for me.

214
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,538
It means big money.

215
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:24,410
Very big money.

216
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:29,281
What is the case, or, as you put it, the
job which you wish me to undertake?

217
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:32,356
Mr. Poirot, I'm a rich man.

218
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,518
Naturally, men in my
position have enemies.

219
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:38,856
Only one.

220
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:40,657
Now, what the hell
do you mean by that?

221
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,132
Merely that when a man is in a position
to have, as you say, enemies,

222
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:49,331
it does not usually resolve
itself into one enemy only.

223
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,841
Oh. Oh, sure. Sure. I appreciate that.

224
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,412
What is your profession?

225
00:27:56,082 --> 00:27:57,515
I'm retired.

226
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,742
- From what?
- Business.

227
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:02,379
What sort of business?

228
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:04,621
Baby food.

229
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:07,384
But what does that matter?
What matters is my safety.

230
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:08,822
You are in danger?

231
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,223
My life has been threatened,
Mr. Poirot.

232
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:15,529
My secretary can show
you two letters on file.

233
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,704
And I... can show you this.

234
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:25,473
I sleep on it.

235
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,812
Mr. Poirot...

236
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:32,444
...5,000 dollars.

237
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,679
No?

238
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:37,652
Ten thousand?

239
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,556
Fifteen thousand.

240
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:43,192
Mr. Ratchett, I have
made enough money

241
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:46,297
to satisfy both my needs
and my caprices.

242
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,090
I take only such cases now
as interest me,

243
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:55,400
and to be frank, my interest
in your case is... dwindling.

244
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,653
<i>Belgrade Station</i>.

245
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:48,452
<i>The</i> Orient Express <i>will</i>
<i>depart in five minutes</i>.

246
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:54,761
Monsieur Poirot.

247
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:57,835
I am transferring Signor Bianchi's
luggage to the Pullman.

248
00:29:58,037 --> 00:29:59,561
He's giving you
his own compartment.

249
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:01,330
But you cannot sit up all night.

250
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:04,442
My dear friend,
do not concern yourself.

251
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,771
Since you are going to England,
it is better for you

252
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,572
to stay on the through coach
to Calais.

253
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:10,544
Now, Pierre has made me
very comfortable.

254
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,583
There is no one in the Pullman
but one Greek doctor. <i>Ecco</i>.

255
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:17,347
- Such generosity deserves my thanks.
- <i>Buon riposa</i>.

256
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,181
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Pierre,

257
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,017
- could I have some clean towels and...
- Yes, monsieur.

258
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,988
Who are my new neighbors?

259
00:30:54,193 --> 00:30:57,060
To the left, monsieur,
the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson,

260
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:00,255
shares seven and eight with
the English lady, Miss Debenham.

261
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:03,128
And to the right, in number ten,
is Mr. Ratchett.

262
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:05,065
And where is the loquacious
Mrs. Hubbard?

263
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:07,000
I should like to get some
sleep tonight.

264
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,003
Beyond Mr. Ratchett,
in the number 11.

265
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,971
She is still too near.

266
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:13,145
Good night, Mr. Beddoes.

267
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,203
Pardon.

268
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:23,016
Who is it?

269
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:25,816
It's me, sir, Beddoes,
with your sedative.

270
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:30,594
Come in.

271
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,026
Thank you, Pierre. Good night.

272
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:42,333
Good night, monsieur,
and pleasant dreams in number nine.

273
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:45,776
- How many drops?
- Of the valerian?

274
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:49,038
- Two, sir, as you said.
- OK.

275
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,308
No, no. Put it on the table.

276
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,483
And tell Mr. McQueen I want
to see the text of the telegram

277
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:03,992
he sent from Belgrade.

278
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,427
Very well, sir.

279
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:20,342
He wants you.

280
00:32:52,612 --> 00:32:54,170
Come in.

281
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:29,209
<i>La belle Comtesse</i>.

282
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,369
<i>Ce n'est rien</i>.
<i>C'était un cauchemar</i>.

283
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:38,574
<i>Bien</i>, Mr. Ratchett.
May you now have pleasant dreams.

284
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,128
<i>C'est le silence de mort</i>.

285
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:18,181
Snowdrift. <i>Mon Dieu. Quelle nuit</i>.

286
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,627
So now there's a man in my room.

287
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,160
I woke up in the dark
three minutes ago,

288
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:27,855
and there was a man hiding
in this compartment. I sensed it.

289
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:30,001
What's more, I know who he was
because I absent-mindedly

290
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:32,329
nearly walked through
his open door earlier this evening.

291
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:33,766
"Madame," said this Mr. Ratchett,

292
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:36,339
"If you'd done this 20 years ago,
I'd have said come in."

293
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,033
Twenty years ago?
Why, I'd only have been 15.

294
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:45,882
If there should be a reoccurrence,
do not hesitate to ring, madame.

295
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,325
<i>Enfin c'est le comble</i>.

296
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,707
<i>Evidemment, j'ai une crise de nerfs</i>.

297
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,497
It's me, sir, Beddoes,
with your pick-me-up.

298
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,409
Your amber moon, Mr. Ratchett.

299
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:10,229
Your passkey.

300
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:18,207
The chain.

301
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,117
Pierre, touch nothing.

302
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:35,219
Where are Signor Bianchi
and the Greek doctor?

303
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:37,055
In the dining car, monsieur.

304
00:37:37,263 --> 00:37:39,197
Fetch them at once.

305
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:00,178
Well, can't you tap
the telephone wires?

306
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:02,786
- Or fire a rocket, or something?
- This is not a ship, madame.

307
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:05,582
- Where exactly are we?
- We are between Vinkovci and Brod.

308
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,282
- But in what country?
- In Yugoslavia.

309
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,758
The Balkans.
What else can you expect?

310
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:13,397
Snow is God's will.
And all is for the best.

311
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,864
Yeah, but how long do you think before
we can start getting out of here?

312
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:18,730
As soon as the stationmaster
at Brod sees

313
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:21,532
that we do not arrive on time,
he will send...

314
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:27,401
Dr. Constantine,
Monsieur Poirot wants to see you.

315
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:30,013
And you too, Signor Bianchi.

316
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:32,275
Forgive me, ladies and gentlemen.

317
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:35,784
Only God's forgiveness is important.

318
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:39,822
<i>Ich mochte meine Prinzessin</i>
<i>benachrichtigen</i>.

319
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,754
Signor Bianchi
and Dr. Constantine.

320
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:47,694
Mind the broken glass, gentlemen.

321
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:56,071
Pupils still slightly dilated.
Could've been drugged.

322
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:59,142
- Was drugged.
- With what?

323
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,976
There's a smell of valerian,
which is harmless,

324
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:05,741
but something must've been added.

325
00:39:06,185 --> 00:39:09,621
- May I close his eyes now?
- I wish you would.

326
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:14,918
Why did he lose so much blood?

327
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,253
- Can I pull back the bedclothes?
- By all means.

328
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:27,696
Mr. Ratchett has been
frontally stabbed

329
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,876
ten, 11, 12 times.

330
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:32,907
- Oh, <i>Dio</i>.
- <i>Mon pauvre</i>.

331
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:35,740
If you must go whoop-whoop,
please go whoop-whoop

332
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:39,975
not to windward, but to leeward.
Help him, Pierre.

333
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,119
There is something in the pocket.

334
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:46,723
Permit me.

335
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,426
- His watch.
- The time of death.

336
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,533
I can definitely say
that death occurred

337
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:59,135
between midnight
and 2 in the morning.

338
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:01,568
That would fit.

339
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:08,712
I myself heard him cry out and ring for
the conductor at 20 minutes to 1.

340
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:10,811
When Pierre arrived, he apologized

341
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:14,076
and said he had been
having a <i>cauchemar</i>.

342
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,550
A nightmare.

343
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:23,258
Then I heard him
use his washbasin.

344
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,424
And that is the last thing known.

345
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:33,633
I beg of you, monsieur.
You cannot refuse.

346
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,399
But it is the duty
of the Yugoslavian police.

347
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:41,706
Oh, what, monsieur, to question
my passengers on my line? Never.

348
00:40:41,914 --> 00:40:44,781
Now you must solve the mystery.

349
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,646
When we get to Brod, if we ever do,

350
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:50,481
we present the police with
a <i>fait accompli</i>.

351
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:54,785
We say that a murder has occurred.
There is the criminal.

352
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,690
I should like
the Pullman coach reserved

353
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,557
for the investigation's headquarters.

354
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:01,995
It will be at your disposal.

355
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,761
And a plan of the Calais coach
with the names and locations

356
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,562
- of all the people in it.
- Yes, it will be there.

357
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:08,797
And the passports of all
the passengers concerned.

358
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,236
Yes, you can even have mine.

359
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:13,434
I go to make a special
announcement now. <i>Grazie</i>.

360
00:41:13,646 --> 00:41:15,876
Bring all the passports
to Monsieur Poirot.

361
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:18,242
Are there any other
passengers on the train?

362
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,580
In the Pullman coach,
nobody but myself and Mr. Bianchi.

363
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:31,557
<i>Alors</i>.

364
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:34,426
Then we must concentrate
on the Calais coach.

365
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:40,162
Where, in my amateur opinion,
the murderer is with us now.

366
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:46,671
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please, please, patience.

367
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,177
You must have patience.
Now, you will all get the chance

368
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,544
to state your views to Monsieur Poirot
at his own good time.

369
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:56,187
- Now, please...
- It is not good time. It is bad time.

370
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:59,846
God's laws have been bust,
thou shalt not kill.

371
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,256
And why was I not notified at once,
Signor... Mr. Bianchi?

372
00:42:03,462 --> 00:42:08,695
- I was his nearest associate.
- And I was nearest to his murderer.

373
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,303
You mean you saw the man?
You can identify the murderer?

374
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:15,132
I mean nothing of the kind.

375
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,070
I mean there was a man
in my compartment last night.

376
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:21,144
It was pitch-dark, of course,
and my eyes were closed in terror.

377
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:23,280
Then how did you know it was a man?

378
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:27,714
Because I've enjoyed very warm
relationships with both my husbands.

379
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,980
- With your eyes closed?
- That helped.

380
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:33,692
- Excuse me.
- Anyway, the man smelt of tobacco.

381
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:35,757
Mr. McQueen,
Monsieur Poirot would be grateful

382
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:38,259
for a few minutes of your time.

383
00:42:40,365 --> 00:42:41,889
- Excuse me.
- Don't you agree the man

384
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,661
must've entered my compartment
to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?

385
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:48,431
I can think of no other reason,
madame.

386
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,302
Pierre, your passkey.

387
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,573
<i>Voilà, monsieur</i>.

388
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:58,944
And will you discreetly procure
me a lady's hatbox,

389
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:01,278
one of the big, old-fashioned kind,

390
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:05,218
perhaps from the
Princess Dragomiroff's maid?

391
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:07,958
Give me five minutes, doctor.

392
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,128
Mr. McQueen, I regret
to have kept you waiting,

393
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:13,264
but there has been much to establish.

394
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:16,596
Please be seated. Now,
Mr. McQueen, I should be grateful

395
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,396
for anything you can usefully tell me.
What, for example, is...?

396
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:22,836
Let's get just a couple
of things straight first, Mr. Poirot.

397
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:26,374
Who, for example, are you,
and what is your status here?

398
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:28,477
Excuse me.

399
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,773
Monsieur Poirot is a detective,

400
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,952
officially delegated to investigate
this case by me.

401
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,486
Let us proceed with the matter in
hand. Your relationship with Ratchett?

402
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:39,122
I'm his... I was his secretary.

403
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,019
- For how long?
- A year, give or take.

404
00:43:41,226 --> 00:43:43,626
- Where did you meet?
- In Persia.

405
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,595
He was collecting Gorgan pottery
with considerable success.

406
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,064
And I was trying to collect oil
concessions, you know,

407
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:52,237
with so little success
that I went bankrupt,

408
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:54,064
and he offered me the job. I took it.

409
00:43:54,273 --> 00:43:58,004
- And since then?
- Well, we've traveled around.

410
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,041
He was hampered
by not knowing any languages.

411
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:02,270
I acted more as his courier
than as his secretary.

412
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:04,108
It was a pleasant enough job.

413
00:44:04,316 --> 00:44:07,376
What part of America
did Ratchett come from?

414
00:44:07,586 --> 00:44:09,247
I don't know.

415
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:12,981
The fact is, he never talked
about his background.

416
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,355
- Why, do you think?
- Well, I used to...

417
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:19,531
Well, I began to believe
that he had left America

418
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:21,221
to escape something, you know.

419
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,029
Or someone. And until a couple
of weeks ago, I think he succeeded.

420
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,465
And then?

421
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:29,402
Well, he began to get these
anonymous letters,

422
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:33,044
threatening letters, like these.

423
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,677
"I kill killers."

424
00:44:40,118 --> 00:44:42,109
"Prepare to die."

425
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:45,951
- How brief.
- But in a sense, how complicated.

426
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:51,260
Last night, I noticed you dispatching
a telegram from Belgrade Station.

427
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:53,790
That's right.
Let's see, he sent for me

428
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:56,866
to see the text
right after we left Belgrade.

429
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,766
And then he went...
Yeah, it was the last I ever saw of him.

430
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:03,806
Were there any other
threatening letters?

431
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,274
Yeah, but none that
I was allowed to read.

432
00:45:06,478 --> 00:45:08,446
He used to... He used to burn them.

433
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,145
That explains...

434
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:11,907
What?

435
00:45:13,518 --> 00:45:16,043
My interest in hatboxes.

436
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,092
Precisely what I needed.

437
00:45:25,364 --> 00:45:26,922
Doctor, first the wounds.

438
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:29,225
- You counted a dozen?
- Yes.

439
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:35,335
Five are deep,
of which three are lethal.

440
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:39,809
The rest are shallow.

441
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:41,377
And two...

442
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:46,008
...are so slight as to be
mere scratches.

443
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:48,152
What does that suggest?

444
00:45:48,353 --> 00:45:54,155
That there were two murderers,
a strong man and a weak man?

445
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:56,520
Or a weak woman.

446
00:45:56,728 --> 00:46:01,324
Or a strong man stabbing
the victim both strongly

447
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:05,333
and weakly in order to confuse us.

448
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:09,598
At least we know that
by the time of the murder,

449
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:17,214
Ratchett was too drugged to cry out
or defend himself with this.

450
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:18,644
But how did you guess...?

451
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,479
I didn't. He showed it to me
when he offered me $15,000

452
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:25,179
to be his bodyguard and I refused.

453
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,391
Ought I to have accepted?

454
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:38,760
Now, let us consider the ashtray.

455
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:41,667
Two different matches.

456
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:43,773
A smoked cigar.

457
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:46,206
- A pipe cleaner...
- And this.

458
00:46:51,116 --> 00:46:53,812
- The initial H.
- That should not be hard to identify.

459
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,011
I wonder, Christian name or surname?

460
00:46:57,422 --> 00:47:00,391
We must wait until
we examine the passports.

461
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:03,152
Bianchi, doctor,

462
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:11,565
has it occurred to you that there
are too many clues in this room?

463
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:17,608
Let us proceed by examining what
I hope will prove to be the last of them.

464
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:21,210
The burnt paper.

465
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:28,309
I use it for the mustaches.

466
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,953
What has that to do
with mustaches?

467
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:33,181
To melt the wax.

468
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,244
Observe, memorize,
you are my only witnesses.

469
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,557
- A-l-S-Y A-R-M-S.
- What does that mean?

470
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:13,992
It means we know
the true identity of Mr. Ratchett.

471
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:17,998
And why he had to leave America.

472
00:48:22,674 --> 00:48:26,075
Do you remember
the Armstrong case?

473
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:32,546
Of course, the kidnapping of that
little American girl, and the killing.

474
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:33,979
Who does not?

475
00:48:34,186 --> 00:48:37,212
Do you remember the name
of the child?

476
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:40,016
<i>Certamente</i>. It was Daisy.

477
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:41,749
D.

478
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,121
D-A

479
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:47,594
l-S-Y.

480
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:52,499
Space, A-R-M-S.

481
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:55,332
Daisy Armstrong.

482
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,908
- And Ratchett was her murderer?
- Well, no, the actual murderer

483
00:49:00,112 --> 00:49:03,138
was tried, sentenced
and electrocuted.

484
00:49:03,348 --> 00:49:05,578
But he was only the number two.

485
00:49:05,784 --> 00:49:09,379
The subordinate of a boss whom,
at first, he was too terrified to identify.

486
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:12,819
Only on the eve of his electrocution
did he give the name of the boss,

487
00:49:13,024 --> 00:49:16,482
who by then had disappeared
with the ransom money.

488
00:49:16,695 --> 00:49:19,721
I remember feeling ashamed
that he had an Italian name.

489
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:21,558
Cassetti.

490
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:24,735
<i>Che mostro</i>. He had
a child's blood on his hands.

491
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:28,470
He had worse than that.

492
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:32,074
After the shock
of the body's discovery,

493
00:49:32,277 --> 00:49:36,577
Mrs. Armstrong gave premature birth
to a stillborn child,

494
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,716
and herself died in the process.

495
00:49:39,918 --> 00:49:41,886
Her husband, Colonel Armstrong,

496
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:45,284
once a brave officer in
the Scots Guard, shot himself,

497
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,822
and Mrs. Armstrong's personal maid,

498
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,484
who came wrongly
under suspicion of complicity,

499
00:49:51,696 --> 00:49:54,187
threw herself from her
bedroom window and she died,

500
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:56,731
so five deaths, five.

501
00:49:56,935 --> 00:50:01,463
Then I thank heaven that Giuseppe,
who spilt so much blood in his lifetime,

502
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,368
should have his own blood
spilt now.

503
00:50:18,523 --> 00:50:22,482
Excellent, Pierre. And could you
summon the passengers to me here?

504
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:25,424
One by one in this order except
for the Princess Dragomiroff,

505
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:30,124
who is not only of royal blood, but also
much older than she tries not to look.

506
00:50:30,335 --> 00:50:36,399
And, Pierre, since you are here
already, we can conveniently start

507
00:50:36,608 --> 00:50:38,405
by questioning you.

508
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:42,512
Your full name is Pierre Paul Michel.

509
00:50:43,615 --> 00:50:47,142
- Correct, monsieur.
- Two male saints' names.

510
00:50:47,352 --> 00:50:48,683
You must be greatly blessed.

511
00:50:48,887 --> 00:50:51,947
I've had my share
of good fortune, monsieur.

512
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:55,851
So... And of bad.
I note the cancellation

513
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:59,292
of your wife's photograph
nearly five years ago.

514
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,924
- She is deceased.
- She died, monsieur.

515
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:09,797
Of grief at the death
of our only daughter.

516
00:51:10,342 --> 00:51:11,969
From scarlet fever.

517
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:18,314
I am truly sorry.

518
00:51:21,786 --> 00:51:25,051
Let us talk of less
distressing matters.

519
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:28,317
On the night of the murder,
after we left Belgrade,

520
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:31,188
who were the last passengers
to retire to their compartment?

521
00:51:31,396 --> 00:51:33,421
Show me on the diagram.

522
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,534
About 1:30, I remember seeing
the English colonel say good night

523
00:51:37,736 --> 00:51:41,900
<i>to Mr. McQueen outside</i>
<i>number three and four</i>.

524
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:46,510
<i>I saw him walk back into his</i>
<i>compartment, number 15,</i>

525
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:48,076
<i>which he did not leave</i>.

526
00:51:48,813 --> 00:51:51,646
And after that,
did no one reemerge?

527
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:56,246
No, but there was one lady
who opened a door,

528
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:59,014
I don't know which, and walked

529
00:51:59,557 --> 00:52:00,922
<i>in the direction of the toilet</i>

530
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:03,492
<i>at the far end of the corridor,</i>
<i>next to the dining car</i>.

531
00:52:03,695 --> 00:52:06,789
- <i>Did you see her return?</i>
- <i>No, monsieur</i>.

532
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,397
It is possible
I was answering a bell.

533
00:52:10,902 --> 00:52:12,767
That reminds me of a final point.

534
00:52:12,971 --> 00:52:16,236
Much earlier, soon after 12:30,
you and I both heard Mr. Ratchett

535
00:52:16,441 --> 00:52:19,899
ring his bell several times and then
apologize for having had a nightmare.

536
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:32,121
<i>Ce n'est rien</i>.
<i>C'était un cauchemar</i>.

537
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:36,759
Who rang the second bell while
you were answering Mr. Ratchett's?

538
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:39,452
The Princess Dragomiroff, monsieur.

539
00:52:39,664 --> 00:52:42,758
She asked me to summon her maid.

540
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:46,800
Thank you, Pierre.
That is all for the moment.

541
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:59,114
He had the means to do it.
The passkey to Ratchett's room.

542
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:02,684
- And a knife borrowed from the chef.
- With whom he was in league.

543
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:06,345
Which he plunged repeatedly
and without motive into the body

544
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,253
of his suitably astonished victim.

545
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,363
Anyway, we know the door
was not only locked, but chained.

546
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,260
Mr. McQueen.

547
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:16,764
Since our last conversation,

548
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:20,699
I have learned the true identity
of your late employer.

549
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:22,964
You don't say.

550
00:53:24,209 --> 00:53:29,203
Ratchett was, as you yourself
suspected, merely an alias.

551
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,938
He was, in fact, Cassetti.

552
00:53:31,516 --> 00:53:34,713
The gangster who masterminded
the kidnapping and killing

553
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:36,978
of little Daisy Armstrong.

554
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:40,055
You had no idea of this?

555
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:42,357
Oh, no, sir.

556
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:48,931
If I had, I'd have cut off my right hand
so I couldn't type his lousy letters.

557
00:53:49,134 --> 00:53:50,931
And I'd have killed him with my left.

558
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:54,628
You feel you could've done
the good deed yourself?

559
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,733
It seems like I'm kind of
incriminating myself.

560
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:02,174
I should be more inclined
to suspect you, Mr. McQueen,

561
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,180
if you displayed an inordinate sorrow
at your employer's decease.

562
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:08,318
Sorrow?

563
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,989
My dad, my father,
was the district attorney, yeah,

564
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:16,990
who handled the Armstrong case.

565
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:20,130
Mrs. Armstrong and her husband
came to our house twice

566
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:22,561
for advice about the ransom money.

567
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:26,294
She was gentle and frightened.

568
00:54:26,604 --> 00:54:30,131
But not too frightened to take
an interest in a young man

569
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:33,572
who wanted to go on the stage.

570
00:54:34,913 --> 00:54:37,438
She even said she'd write to...

571
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:39,773
She died before
she got around to that.

572
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:43,078
She was as helpful
to me as a...

573
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,216
Well, a mother.

574
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:47,720
Forgive a Freudian question.

575
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:52,420
- Do you love your mother?
- I did.

576
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:56,191
She died when I was 8.
An impressionable age.

577
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,767
- Why do you ask?
- We shared a compartment

578
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,403
on the first night of our journey.

579
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:04,598
You cried out to your mother
twice in your sleep.

580
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,572
Did I?

581
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:09,542
I still dream about her.

582
00:55:09,981 --> 00:55:13,212
Go on. Tell me.
I'm emotionally retarded.

583
00:55:13,418 --> 00:55:14,851
Tell me that's why
I never married.

584
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:20,355
I am not here to tell you anything,
Mr. McQueen. You are here to tell me.

585
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:25,889
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, there's just one thing.

586
00:55:26,097 --> 00:55:28,088
How did you...

587
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:30,961
...figure out Ratchett's identity?

588
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:34,730
By a message found
in his compartment.

589
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,434
He'd have burnt that, though,
as I told you.

590
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,843
He did.

591
00:55:41,646 --> 00:55:43,511
Yeah, he did.

592
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,241
- Then how did you decipher...?
- With the help of a hatbox.

593
00:55:47,452 --> 00:55:49,682
Thank you, Mr. McQueen.

594
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,824
He did it.
He murdered Cassetti.

595
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:59,553
He practically confessed as much.

596
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:02,795
No, the psychology is wrong.

597
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:07,097
A sensitive, motherless boy
conceives a passion for a lady

598
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:10,035
whom he admires above all
for her gentleness.

599
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,677
Now, could McQueen,
admiring the gentleness,

600
00:56:13,878 --> 00:56:17,473
commit so foul a murder
without betraying the gentleness

601
00:56:17,682 --> 00:56:22,210
of what we might call
his fairy godmother?

602
00:56:22,554 --> 00:56:24,419
Godmother.

603
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:28,080
Now you have accidentally
said something valuable.

604
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:30,961
Come.

605
00:56:33,531 --> 00:56:37,627
Mr. Beddoes, this is not
an inquisition, only an inquiry.

606
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:41,202
When you took Mr. Ratchett
his valerian drops

607
00:56:41,406 --> 00:56:45,604
about 9:40 yesterday evening,
was he already in bed?

608
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,779
That is so, sir. Mr. Ratchett
always retired early on trains.

609
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,346
What were your duties before
leaving him for the night?

610
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:53,676
To place the valerian drops
within reach, sir.

611
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:55,613
- Beddoes.
- Sir?

612
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,311
Did you put this on my table
during dinner?

613
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:00,787
- No, sir.
- Then who the hell did?

614
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:03,153
I have no idea, sir.

615
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:04,923
May I ask what it is?

616
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:07,097
What it is, is none
of your damn business.

617
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,663
I wanna know how it got here.

618
00:57:12,937 --> 00:57:15,167
- Will there be anything more, sir?
- There will.

619
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:17,705
Tell Mr. McQueen
I wanna see him, now.

620
00:57:18,443 --> 00:57:20,570
Very well, sir.

621
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:23,513
At what time would you like
to be called in the morning, sir?

622
00:57:23,715 --> 00:57:25,307
Not before 10.

623
00:57:25,516 --> 00:57:26,744
Very good, sir.

624
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,718
- Was that usual?
- Oh, quite, sir, yes.

625
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:31,786
His breakfast was his amber moon.

626
00:57:32,123 --> 00:57:34,421
He never rose
until it had had its full effect.

627
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:37,951
So you instructed Mr. McQueen

628
00:57:38,162 --> 00:57:40,255
and then returned
to your own compartment,

629
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:41,693
the number one and two,

630
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:46,063
whose upper berth was occupied
by Signor Foscarelli.

631
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,363
Oh, yes, sir, the Italian person.

632
00:57:48,573 --> 00:57:51,542
- Does he speak English?
- A kind of English, sir.

633
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:54,576
I think he learned it
in a place called Chicago.

634
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:56,303
Did you talk together much?

635
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,277
Oh, no, sir. I prefer to read.

636
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:07,313
Hey, what are you reading,
Mr. Beddoes?

637
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:11,083
<i>Love's Captive</i>,
by Mrs. Arabella Richardson.

638
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:13,024
Is it about sex?

639
00:58:13,231 --> 00:58:16,394
No, it's about 10:30, Mr. Foscarelli.

640
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:24,171
I like that.
"It's about 10:30."

641
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:27,673
- And after that you went to sleep.
- Oh, no, sir.

642
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:32,612
Not until 4 in the morning.
Unfortunately, I had the toothache.

643
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:34,252
- And your companion?
- He snored incessantly.

644
00:58:34,252 --> 00:58:36,083
- And your companion?
- He snored incessantly.

645
00:58:36,487 --> 00:58:41,390
One final point. How did you come
to be employed by Mr. Ratchett?

646
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:43,651
Through Maibaums, sir,
the big agency in New York.
