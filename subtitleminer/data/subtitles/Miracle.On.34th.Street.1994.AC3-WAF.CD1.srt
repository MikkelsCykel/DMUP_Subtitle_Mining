00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:55,486
- Ask him.
- Shh.

3
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:01,563
- Ask him.
- Shh!

4
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,162
Look at him, grandpa.
Ask him!

5
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,339
Ryan, that's enough.

6
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:15,726
Uh, I'm sorry.
He, uh...he thinks you're Santa Claus.

7
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,297
I am.

8
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:29,763
Merry christmas.

9
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,478
Uh, merry--Merry christmas.

10
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,287
Nuts.
I should have got his autograph.

11
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,028
Dashing through the snow

12
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:49,180
In a one-horse open sleigh

13
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,014
O'er the fields we go

14
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:55,009
Laughing all the way

15
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,826
Bells on bobtail ring

16
00:02:57,826 --> 00:03:00,604
Making spirits bright

17
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,529
What fun it is to laugh and sing

18
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,910
In a sleighing song tonight

19
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,419
oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

20
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,253
jingle all the way

21
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:15,033
oh, what fun it is to ride

22
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,460
in a one-horse open sleigh

23
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,809
hey, jingle bells, jingle bells

24
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,698
jingle all the way

25
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:26,210
oh, what fun it is to ride

26
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:30,413
in a one-horse open sleigh

27
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:35,215
What is the problem?

28
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,573
Your Santa Claus is wearing
a topcoat and a fedora.

29
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,569
Ya-ha! Ha ha ha ha!

30
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,905
That's not my Santa Claus.

31
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,904
Right. Now...throw it out...

32
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:55,711
Bring it up right up high,
and down she comes!

33
00:03:58,107 --> 00:03:59,837
It's just in the wrist, you see.

34
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:03,916
It's really quite simple, you know,
when you get the knack.

35
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,582
Now then, why don't you--

36
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:13,638
o.k., pops, come on. It's my turn.
Give me the whip.

37
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:14,979
What have you been drinking?

38
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,205
Just something to keep me warm.

39
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,990
You are intoxicated, sir.

40
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,708
And you're a pain in the butt.

41
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,866
You are a disgrace.

42
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:26,535
You have any idea how many children
are watching you?

43
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:27,389
Give me back the whip.

44
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,186
Let me tell you something--
when you put on this suit,

45
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:34,856
you represent something that has
great significance to millions of people

46
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,348
all over the world.

47
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:42,987
Now, I could overlook your
poorly-manufactured jacket

48
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:45,993
or even your ludicrously
unbelievable beard.

49
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:46,469
Hey!

50
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,336
Or perhaps your
phonily-padded tummy,

51
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:53,704
but I will not tolerate
public drunkenness.

52
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:56,291
You should be ashamed of yourself.

53
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:58,069
Can I get a cop over here?

54
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:00,897
That's a very good idea. Officer!

55
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:03,455
Hey, wait a minute, you.

56
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,950
Mrs. Walker! Mrs. Walker!

57
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,299
Mrs. Walker, we need your help here!

58
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,403
Your sense of occasion is something--

59
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:15,770
If you're not with the parade,
get back on the sidewalk.

60
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,814
I need to see whomever's in charge
to alert them to this man.

61
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:21,532
Kiss my--

62
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:23,263
Oh, easy! Take it easy!

63
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,548
Gramps, come on, hey.

64
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:26,643
Let's go for a little walk.

65
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,556
That man's a degenerate.

66
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,964
It's time to go right up in the old office.

67
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,179
Ha ha!

68
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:45,726
Little drafty there.

69
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:49,386
Hey, let's just watch the parade, o.k.?

70
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:50,585
Come on.

71
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,942
O.k. Settle in here.

72
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,106
Oh!

73
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,929
Oh, my god.

74
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:06,275
Get this costume fixed.
O.k. We'll show this guy how to do it.

75
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:09,492
Whoa!

76
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,412
Aah!

77
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,289
Oh.

78
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,264
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

79
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:26,986
Merry christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

80
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:48,591
Sir! Excuse me.

81
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:51,233
- Hello. I-I'm Dorey walker.
- Oh.

82
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:54,644
Director of special projects for
c.f. Cole's department store.

83
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:58,860
My pleasure. As a matter of fact,
I was looking for you.

84
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:03,089
There's no doubt you saw
your Santa Claus is inebriated.

85
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,456
I know. He has created
such a terrible problem.

86
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:09,882
Millions of children are watching here
and on television.

87
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:13,643
They're expecting to see Santa Claus,
and now we don't have one.

88
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,156
That is a terrible problem.

89
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:20,829
Would you do it?
Would you be our Santa Claus?

90
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,792
Uh, me?

91
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,882
Well, do you have any experience?

92
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:28,640
Well...just a little.

93
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,021
Great. I'm sure you'll be fine.

94
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,740
Isn't there someone else
that you could ask?

95
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,877
Sir, the parade has started already.

96
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,653
It's you right now, or else

97
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,549
There's no Santa in the cole's
thanksgiving day parade.

98
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,539
Might I perhaps have a moment
to think about it?

99
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,845
Don't worry about a thing. Just...
be yourself.

100
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,876
Now, dasher!
Now, dancer!

101
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,212
Now, prancer and vixen!

102
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:17,817
Now, comet! Now, cupid!
Now, donner and blitzen!

103
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:18,844
Hey!

104
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:31,039
Merry christmas.
Merry chris--

105
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,101
This Santa Claus is fantastic.

106
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:36,745
Did he sign a contract?

107
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:38,373
There wasn't any time.

108
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:40,502
Myrna's going to have him sign
after the parade.

109
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:44,632
She'll have him fill out his employment
papers, and he'll start in the morning.

110
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:48,822
He insisted upon wearing
his own Santa suit.

111
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:51,158
He has his own Santa suit?

112
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,118
Apparently.

113
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:55,822
Well, if it's horrible, we'll make him
wear one of ours.

114
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:58,846
I'm going home.

115
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:01,397
You're not going to watch the parade?

116
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:04,671
No. I think I've had quite enough
for one day, thank you.

117
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,190
I will see you in the morning.

118
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:08,670
O.k. Chin-chin.

119
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,079
Merry christmas.

120
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:19,708
Susan?

121
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:47,003
We can see the parade from his window,

122
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,275
so put on something comfortable
And come on over.

123
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:54,228
P.S., Mr. Bedford put the turkey
in the oven.

124
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:57,010
He said you forgot to sew up
the turkey's bottom.

125
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:59,310
The stuffing will all fall out,

126
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,084
but he told me not to say anything
Because he loves you,

127
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,772
and he wants to kiss you, and he thinks you're

128
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,252
The most beautiful woman in the whole world!

129
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:19,709
Do you know how much it costs
to make this parade?

130
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:25,163
Uh, a million dollars. $2 million?

131
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:28,584
1.6. It's probably a big mistake.

132
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:32,347
Some guy's going to buy cole's
and turn it into a junk store.

133
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:36,648
That's not going to happen.
Two banks just came in and rescued cole's.

134
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:37,991
You better check your sources.

135
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:41,535
But cole's has to pay them back plus interest.

136
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,450
If they don't sell a lot at christmas,
you can forget about it, pal.

137
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:51,458
Well, I think you should ask Santa Claus
to give cole's an interest-free loan For christmas.

138
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,113
What do you think about that?

139
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,498
That's a good one

140
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,675
Well, you know what?
It might happen.

141
00:10:57,675 --> 00:11:01,484
Santa Claus,
he does some pretty amazing things.

142
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:06,216
Bryan, you know what? I know.

143
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,293
You know what?

144
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,563
The secret.

145
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:10,294
What secret?

146
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:15,004
Santa Claus.
I've known for a long time.

147
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:20,551
He's not real.

148
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:26,045
Says who?

149
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,740
My mom.

150
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:45,252
Hi.
I believe you have something of mine.

151
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:49,561
About 4-foot tall, brown hair,
talks like she's 64 years old?

152
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,021
Hey.

153
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:56,475
Hi. / Hi.

154
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,466
So, what do you think?

155
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:03,355
It's a good one.

156
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,905
Yeah? Did Santa Claus come by yet?

157
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:09,841
Nope. Is it Tony falacchi again?

158
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,715
No. Tony had to leave.

159
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:13,395
Bombed?

160
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:14,786
Yes.

161
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:16,863
It's the pressure.

162
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:22,879
But I got this new guy, and
he really looks like the real thing.

163
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,433
Maybe he is.

164
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:32,252
Are you still coming to dinner?

165
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,795
Am I still invited?

166
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,829
Yes.

167
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,939
Then I'm coming.

168
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,704
Honey, run home and put the camera stuff away.

169
00:12:38,705 --> 00:12:40,578
I'll put the stuff away. You keep watching.

170
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,951
Let her finish watching the parade. Come on.

171
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:47,181
Santa hasn't even come by yet.

172
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:52,664
Well, as soon as Santa does come by,
I would like for you to come home.

173
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:54,220
Sure.

174
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,522
That's the end of the parade, anyway.

175
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:00,174
There's nothing else to see except
guys cleaning up horse poop,

176
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:02,635
And that doesn't thrill me at all.

177
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:10,497
Hello!
Merry christmas!

178
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,067
- Hello?
- Jack?

179
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,551
Yes, sir.

180
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:39,746
I've been watching the parade.

181
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:41,509
It looks bigger than last year.

182
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:44,894
What is the crowd estimate?

183
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:47,477
Well, sir, cops say over a million.

184
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:49,974
Last year was about 750.

185
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:54,347
Have marketing come up with a giveaway,
something free.

186
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:58,032
I don't want a crowd outside
cole's in the morning.

187
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,813
I hate to say this, Mr. Lamberg.

188
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:03,667
Cole's has got one hell of a
Santa Claus this year.

189
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:07,406
If I didn'tknow better,
I'd say he was the real article.

190
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,581
Keep an eye on this, Mr. Duff.

191
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:15,620
These small, seemingly insignificant,
sentimental anachronisms

192
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,844
can be surprisingly potent.

193
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:24,258
I don't want my plans damaged by
an elderly cherub in a red suit.

194
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:26,226
I'm on it, sir.

195
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:32,628
Bye-bye.

196
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:44,645
There we go.

197
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,792
- Ooh. Ooh. Ahh. Ahh.
- Happy thanksgiving.

198
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,414
- Happy thanksgiving.
- Happy thanksgiving

199
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,496
You know, this is kind of like TV,

200
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:58,119
except I need a brother and a dog,

201
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,849
And Bryan would be the dad--

202
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,547
Mr. Bedford.

203
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:03,441
He said to call him Bryan.

204
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:05,259
Only if it's o.k. with your mom.

205
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:07,853
It's fine.

206
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:11,112
Bryan would be the dad, you'd be the mom.

207
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:14,570
We'd need either a fat person
who's our cook

208
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:16,882
or a neighbor who's
Always at our house.

209
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:21,616
You know, that's not very interesting.
Let's talk about something else.

210
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:22,733
For the chef.

211
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:25,286
Oh, in the loosest sense of the word.

212
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:27,446
In every sense of the word.

213
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:32,214
The vegetables are catered.
So is dessert.

214
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,123
Thank you, Susan.

215
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,534
You're welcome.

216
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:42,124
Do we give blessings in this house?

217
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:45,491
Not unless my grandparents are here.

218
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:48,636
Would you mind if I did it?
It's a tradition with me.

219
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:49,742
No. That's fine.

220
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:55,826
We give thanks for thfood before us

221
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:59,791
and the closeness
Of the people we love,

222
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,809
and we pray that these gifts
We so gratefully receive

223
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,182
will be shared with those less
fortunate than ourselves.

224
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,082
Amen.

225
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:10,606
Amen.

226
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,510
All right. Let's eat.

227
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:16,756
I slaved all day.

228
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,080
You really outdid yourself.

229
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:54,711
One of my elves is married to
a fellow called Daniel.

230
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,308
Do you know what you want for christmas?

231
00:18:56,308 --> 00:19:02,163
I want  a peter pollywog
patrol frog that swims and blows up.

232
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:04,373
Gosh, that sounds great

233
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:08,211
Can mother have a word with Santa, please?

234
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:12,342
Yes, of course. Just a minute.

235
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:15,270
Don't make me look bad.
Them things cost 70 bucks.

236
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,787
He just looked at them.

237
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:19,506
I tell you what.

238
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:22,812
Shopper's express have got them
on sale at 34.Lamberg

239
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:26,707
with a $5.00 rebate.
Now that's reasonable enough, isn't it?

240
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,256
Yeah. Thanks.

241
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:30,562
But let me ask you a question.

242
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:33,094
Since when is cole's sending
customers someplace else?

243
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:37,462
I don't think it matters where the toys are sold
as long as it makes the children happy.

244
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:40,777
I'm sure the people here believe the same.

245
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:43,986
Yeah. Yeah, that's the spirit.

246
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:46,588
Thanks, Santa. Thank you.

247
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,097
- Merry christmas.
- Merry christmas.

248
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,483
Now then, young man,
if you're a very good boy

249
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,371
And do exactly what your mummy tells you,

250
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:58,857
you're going to have a peter pollywog
for christmas.

251
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:01,009
Ha ha ha ha ha.

252
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,260
Bye, Santa.

253
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:06,534
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Daniel.
Merry christmas.

254
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:08,425
Come on, then. Come on.

255
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,106
You the boss?

256
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:18,122
I'm general manager of the store.

257
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:21,865
My kid asked Santa for a barf gun.
The Santa said he'd get it for him.

258
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,880
They're by the elevator.

259
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,309
And they're 90 bucks
without batteries or barf.

260
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,192
Prices do go up.

261
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,243
Apparently not at bargain village.

262
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:32,810
52.50.
They throw in the batteries.

263
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,463
I find it hard to believe cole's could be
undersold by that much.

264
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,412
Where did you get your information?

265
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:40,448
From your Santa Claus.

266
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:46,814
But if you go out of here,
turn to the right...

267
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:47,498
Excuse me?

268
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:49,836
Santa's telling everybody
where to shop.

269
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:54,342
If you don't got it, it's too expensive,
he's saying where to get it at the right price.

270
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:57,017
- You're serious?
- Absolutely.

271
00:20:57,017 --> 00:20:58,758
Madam, will you excuse me for a moment?

272
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,736
Tell Santa he made me a cole's shopper.

273
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:04,519
I'm coming here for everything
but toilet paper.

274
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,219
Any store that puts the parent ahead
of the buck at christmas deserves my business.

275
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:12,467
Tell Mr. Cole his Santa Claus
ought to get a raise.

276
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:22,646
You want me to go with you to the chairman

277
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:27,239
and pitch an idea
That you got from Santa Claus?

278
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,537
If cole's doesn't have what you're looking for,

279
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,019
we'll find it for you,

280
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,749
Even if it means sending you somewhere else.

281
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,251
how does that sound?

282
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:39,690
It sounds like a great way
to go out of business.

283
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,715
Know that house in the country
where we do the catalog shoot?

284
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,059
You wanted to buy it.

285
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,068
Yes.

286
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:49,170
If this works, we're probably
looking at a bonus.

287
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,133
And if he hates the idea?

288
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:54,484
We're no worse off.

289
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:56,121
If we don't turn this store around,

290
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:58,699
we're all out--
From the chairman to the janitor.

291
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,507
Let's do it.

292
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:22,377
I...like it.
It's bold. It's fresh.

293
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:26,526
It will drive victor lamberg nuts.

294
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:36,336
It's beginning to look a lot like
christmas

295
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:40,166
soon the bells will start

296
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,470
And the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing

297
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:48,906
Right within your heart

298
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:54,341
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas

299
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:56,891
Why?

300
00:22:56,892 --> 00:23:00,367
Why didn't you think of this?

301
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:04,124
Now if this campaign is successful--
I know in my gut it will be--

302
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,625
Cole's will make lots of money.

303
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:10,196
The more money they make,
the harder it will be for me to buy them out.

304
00:23:11,788 --> 00:23:14,747
Now I want  something done about this.

305
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:29,872
O.k., go ahead.

306
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:35,869
This seems like a pretty pointless exercise, Bryan.

307
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:42,019
I thought as long as we were here,
might as well say hello to the old guy.

308
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,083
Why?

309
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:47,001
Let's just say for the sake of argument
that there is a Santa Claus

310
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,781
And that you don't believe in him.

311
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:54,212
Is it worth the risk that you might not
get anything for christmas?

312
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:55,812
Well, I didn't believe in him last year.

313
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:59,390
I still got everything i asked my mother for.

314
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:03,729
Yeah. You get a free candy cane?

315
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,519
I'm trying to limit my intake of sugar.

316
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:10,754
She can go see Santa now.

317
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:13,522
O.k., come on. Go ahead.

318
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:17,832
Nice to meet you.

319
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,391
Hello, sir.

320
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:27,446
Oh, how do you do?

321
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:29,694
Would you like to come sit on my knee?

322
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:32,146
Good. Up you come.

323
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:33,440
Now then, what's your name?

324
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,539
Susan elizabeth walker. What's yours?

325
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,714
Mine?
Ha ha ha ha.

326
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:41,068
Well, I have lots of names.

327
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,627
Uh, Kriss kringle,

328
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:45,407
Santa Claus, father christmas,
saint nicholas.

329
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:51,120
If you were in holland, I'd be sinterklaas,
or in italy, le befana.

330
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,493
I have to speak many languages
because, of course, I travel a great deal.

331
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:01,487
That's russian.

332
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,423
That's swahili.

333
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,211
My mother's Mrs. Walker.

334
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:11,460
She's director of special events for cole's.

335
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:12,484
Uh-huh.

336
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:17,121
She runs the parade.
I know how this all works.

337
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:19,335
You're an employee of cole's.

338
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:22,837
That is true.

339
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:25,398
But you're a very good Santa Claus.

340
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,683
Your beard's stuck on real tight.

341
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:31,664
Usually the store Santa Claus
whiskers are too loose.

342
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,115
Yours look realistic.

343
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,346
That's because they are real.
You give them a tug.

344
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:39,039
Whoo! Ha ha ha.

345
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,091
Are you convinced?

346
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:41,194
Mm-hmm.

347
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:42,404
Good.

348
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:44,862
This isn't the regular Santa suit, is it?

349
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:48,370
Oh, no. This is the real Santa suit.

350
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,463
It's very nice.

351
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,324
I agree. Lovely.

352
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:55,961
Gold buttons, gold thread.
It's as real as me.

353
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:00,516
Well, you ask your daddy if I'm real.

354
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,064
I don't know where he is.

355
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:03,983
Well, he's--

356
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:08,215
That's my friend Mr. Bedford.

357
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:10,218
I don't have a dad anymore.

358
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:21,285
Ha. Well, now,
what can I get you for christmas?

359
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:22,841
Nothing, thank you.

360
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:24,589
Nothing?

361
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,487
My mother buys my gifts

362
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:31,330
if I don't  want something too stupid
or dangerous or...

363
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,865
Hi, mom.

364
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,613
Hi. It's nice to see you.

365
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,893
Susan,
you've taken enough of this man's time.

366
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:53,372
There's a long line of customers,
and they do come first.

367
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:59,343
Nice to meet you, Susan.

368
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,146
Nice to meet you, too.

369
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:04,654
Bye-bye.

370
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:12,187
Nonbelievers.

371
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:14,126
Right.

372
00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:23,243
If I felt that it was important for her
to see Santa Claus,

373
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,473
I would be happy to take her.

374
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:28,720
I didn'tsee any harm in her saying hello
to an interesting old man.

375
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:34,161
Well, there is harm.
I tell her that there is no Santa Claus,

376
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:39,354
so you bring her down here,
And she sees thousands of gullible kids,

377
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:42,644
and she meets an actor  a very good actor,
mind you?

378
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:45,628
with a real beard and a beautiful Santa suit,

379
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:50,694
Sitting smack dab in the center
of a child's fantasy world.

380
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:58,670
So, who does she believe, the myth or...
the mom?

381
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,432
Listen, I just got some mistletoe.

382
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:12,016
Why don't we go back to my place
and try it out?

383
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:13,889
No.

384
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,563
I don't  think so.

385
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:25,523
O.k. I'm here. I can help.
All you have to do is ask.

386
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,969
Well, actually, there is one thing.

387
00:28:30,023 --> 00:28:32,835
Would you mind taking Susan home?

388
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:37,686
Sure.

389
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:21,217
I'm working at cole's.

390
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,194
All I have to do is to be myself.

391
00:29:26,924 --> 00:29:30,640
There you are. Ha ha.
That's it.

392
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:33,453
Very good. Very good.

393
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:34,615
Excuse me.

394
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:36,113
Oh.

395
00:29:36,113 --> 00:29:37,295
Good evening.

396
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,627
Good evening.

397
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,116
My name is jack duff.

398
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:40,949
How do you do?

399
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:43,025
And this is alberta leonard.

400
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:44,044
How do you do?

401
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,191
Pleasure.

402
00:29:45,192 --> 00:29:49,284
Nice to meet you both. I'm Kriss kringle.

403
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:51,289
Well, Mr. Kringle,

404
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,905
we're with shopper's express,
the department store.

405
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:57,165
Yes. You've got the peter pollywog on sale.

406
00:29:57,165 --> 00:29:58,884
Right.

407
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:01,328
Yes, we do.

408
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,930
We want you to be our main Santa Claus.

409
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,878
We have over 7,000 stores worldwide,

410
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:09,302
but you would be the number one guy.

411
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,376
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

412
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,767
but the people at cole's have already hired me.

413
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:17,064
In fact, I've signed a contract.

414
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,667
If you'll excuse me, it's getting a bit late.

415
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:22,940
Give you a ride?

416
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,237
I can walk. It's probably out of your way.

417
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:27,396
Where are you going?

418
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:33,196
4th street, the mount carmel senior center.

419
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,911
We're going right by it.

420
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,517
It's on our way.

421
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,831
Thank you so much.

422
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:41,718
Um, bye-bye, prancer.

423
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:43,272
Bye-bye, dancer.

424
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:52,496
So tell me, Santa.

425
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:57,004
How does one guy get to every house
around the world in one night?

426
00:30:57,004 --> 00:31:01,632
Ah, yes. Well, now
that is a vexing question, isn't it?

427
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:06,671
You see, if you could slow time down
so that a second became a year,

428
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:10,973
A minute became a century,
and an hour became a millennium,

429
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:14,312
Well, you could manage it quite easily,
couldn't you?

430
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:17,297
I remember before--Well,
100 years ago,

431
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:19,427
before the population explosion,

432
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:21,323
I could manage
To deliver all my goods

433
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:25,227
and have enough time left over for a
late supper, A nap,

434
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:28,486
and a round of golf
with the easter bunny.

435
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,732
He winters in new zealand, you know.

436
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:38,641
Thank you so much.

437
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,978
Thank you both very much indeed.

438
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:45,091
Merry christmas to you, miss leonard.

439
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:47,613
Merry, merry christmas to you, Mr. Duff.

440
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:48,472
Same to you, Santa.

441
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:51,291
Thank you very much.
Good night.

442
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:01,030
He's completely out of his mind.

443
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,711
Imagine--cole's hiring a guy
as nutty as that.

444
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,661
Could become a problem for them.

445
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:10,961
I know what you mean.

446
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,840
The easter bunny.

447
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:24,364
Nice to meet you.

448
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,321
Bye-bye now.

449
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:29,718
You don't think he's nuts, do you?

450
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,430
Hmm?

451
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,441
Well, he believes he's Santa Claus,
absolutely believes it.

452
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:36,443
Maybe that's why he's good at it.

453
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:37,946
What difference does it make?

454
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:40,075
Look at our stocks.
They're through the roof.

455
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,536
Sales are up 70% over last holiday.

456
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:44,766
In a week,
this company has turned around.

457
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:49,390
We could go the other way just
as fast if this guy does anything wrong.

458
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:50,254
What's he going to do?

459
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:52,087
We don't know.

460
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:56,121
If the fate of the company rests
on one very unstable old man,

461
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:59,892
You're celebrating our return
just a little too soon.

462
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:01,510
I'm not worried.

463
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:12,576
Hello, little one. How are you? Come.

464
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,244
Uh, she's deaf.

465
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:19,142
You don't have to talk to her.
She just wanted to see you.

466
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:20,583
Thank you.

467
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:41,225
You are a very... Beautiful young lady.

468
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:43,121
Ha ha ha ha.

469
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,648
What's your name?

470
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:51,146
Sami?

471
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:54,830
That's a beautiful name.

472
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,006
Ha ha ha ha.

473
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:03,860
Now I tell you what.
Do you know Jingle bells?

474
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:06,180
Yes.

475
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:10,486
jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way

476
00:34:10,486 --> 00:34:16,270
oh, what fun it is to ride
on a one-horse open sleigh

477
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:18,696
Ha ha. Oh, very good.

478
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:31,366
Darling,
what would you like for christmas?

479
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,883
A doll and a bear?

480
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:36,073
Well, you shall have them.

481
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:41,516
Sami, I wish you a merry... Christmas.

482
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:46,565
&nbsp;

483
00:34:46,565 --> 00:34:48,462
Thank you. Thank you.

484
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:53,956
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

485
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,420
Something's driving me crazy,
and I can't sleep.

486
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,127
What's on your mind?

487
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,127
Santa Claus.

488
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:29,961
Mr. Kringle? Why, what about him?

489
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,648
He talked sign language with a kid today.

490
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:37,688
Well, that was considerate of him.

491
00:35:37,688 --> 00:35:41,281
It's weird how he knows
so much about toys and kids.

492
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:43,818
He speaks russian and swahili.

493
00:35:45,554 --> 00:35:49,614
Well, he must be quite a learned man.

494
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:55,683
He looks exactly like every
picture of Santa Claus I ever saw.

495
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:59,457
Yes, I know. That's why I chose him.

496
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:04,602
You're positive he's not
the real Santa Claus?

497
00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:08,637
I thought that we talked about this.

498
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:10,871
You understand what he is.

499
00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:12,456
What if we're wrong?

500
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:16,090
That would be extremely rude.

501
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,263
Well, we're not ong sweetheart.

502
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,294
But all my friends believe in Santa Claus.

503
00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:24,632
Well, most children your age do.

504
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:29,434
How come I don't ?

505
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,527
Because you know the truth,

506
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:36,029
and truth is one of the most important
things in the world.

507
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,286
To know the truth and to always
be truthful with others

508
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:43,842
and, more importantly, with yourself.

509
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:52,488
Believing in myths and fantasies
just makes you unhappy.

510
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:56,604
Did you believe in Santa Claus
when you were my age?

511
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:58,102
Yes.

512
00:36:58,102 --> 00:37:01,807
Were you unhappy?

513
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:07,137
Well, when all the things that I believed
in turned out not to be true,

514
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,916
yes, I was unhappy.

515
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:16,273
Would it be o.k. If I thought about this more?

516
00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:19,608
Do I have to not believe in Santa Claus
right away?

517
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:23,429
Come here.

518
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:32,768
You have the right to believe
whatever you want to believe.

519
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:38,842
Now, I've told you the truth,
but if I'm wrong, I will be glad to admit it.

520
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:42,507
I'll tell you what. You ask Mr. Kringle

521
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:45,980
for something that
you would never ask me for,

522
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,113
And if on christmas morning
you don't get it,

523
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:54,530
you will know Once and for all
the honest truth about Santa Claus.

524
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,564
That's a very clever idea.

525
00:37:57,382 --> 00:38:00,100
Thank you.
Think you can get some sleep?

526
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,186
- Yep.
- Yeah? Give me a kiss.

527
00:38:04,624 --> 00:38:07,725
Good night.
I love you.

528
00:38:07,725 --> 00:38:09,284
I love you.

529
00:38:09,285 --> 00:38:11,108
- Good night.
- Good night.

530
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:37,380
christmas christmas

531
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,978
well, it's christmas time, pretty baby

532
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,373
and the snow is
Fallin' on the ground

533
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:48,701
christmas christmas

534
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:52,272
well, it's christmas time, pretty baby...

535
00:38:52,272 --> 00:38:54,609
Barkeep! Reload on this.

536
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:57,541
Hey. Hey!

537
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:59,540
Can I get another beer?

538
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,907
Boy, that cole's, they dealt me the high, hard one.

539
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,620
I did a good job for them last year.

540
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,075
This year they give me the--the royal fist.

541
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:12,675
They didn't have grounds
on which to dismiss you.

542
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,898
That broad that runs the parade every year--

543
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:17,219
One of these college kids
with a 3 ounce brain

544
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,954
and 50 tons of attitude--

545
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,682
She hires some wacko right off the street
to take my place.

546
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:27,442
Some wacko?
Tell me about him.

547
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:29,447
He's a loon.

548
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,280
We got thousands in this city.

549
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,788
I'll say.

550
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,725
Never had one of them
take my job, though.

551
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:39,986
Tony, did you have any contact
with this old guy?

552
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:43,620
The guy come up on the float, right in my face.

553
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,122
He got aggressive with you.

554
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:49,340
He tried to whack me over
the head with his cane.

555
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:51,394
He tried to whack you with a cane?

556
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:52,725
Isn't that what I just said?

557
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,651
Tony, this'll make you feel better.

558
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,163
Got a little job I want  you to do for me.

559
00:40:12,232 --> 00:40:16,671
What, uh, what kind of job
you have in mind?

560
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:17,686
You'll see.

561
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:31,264
Just be yourself.

562
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:34,935
Don't even think about the camera.
You'll be just fine.

563
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:36,663
Right.

564
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:40,012
I must confess, I don't know
why they're making such a fuss about me.

565
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:43,765
This is the holiday season,
and you're Santa Claus, right?

566
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:47,167
To many, but to others I'm an old man
with a white beard.

567
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:49,960
But you're still the symbol of the season.

568
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:54,493
You think I'm a fraud, don't you?

569
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,759
Fraud is a bit too strong a word.

570
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,362
But you don't believe in me.

571
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:02,890
I believe that christmas is for children.

572
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:05,601
Your daughter doesn't believe in me, either.

573
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:09,599
I don't think that there's any harm in
not believing in a figure

574
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,034
that many do acknowledge
to be a fiction.

575
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:17,658
Oh, but there is.
I'm not just a whimsical figure

576
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:20,705
who wears a charming suit

577
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:23,786
And affects a jolly demeanor.

578
00:41:23,787 --> 00:41:28,506
You know, I..I...I'm a symbol.

579
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:32,356
I'm a symbol Of the human ability
to be able to suppress

580
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:41,431
the selfish And hateful tendencies
that rule the major part of our lives.

581
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:46,621
If...you can't believe, if you can't accept

582
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:50,878
anything on faith,

583
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:54,538
Then you're doomed for
a life dominated by doubt.

584
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:05,177
I like you very much, Mrs...

585
00:42:05,178 --> 00:42:08,370
Mrs. Walker, you're a fine woman.
And, you know,

586
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:14,439
I think you'll make an excellent test case
for me, you and your daughter.

587
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:17,353
If I could make you believe,

588
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:20,899
then there'd be some hope for me.

589
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:25,707
If I can't... Well, I'm finished.

590
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,657
Shall we go?

591
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:46,228
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

592
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:51,683
I'm Kriss kringle, and I'm at cole's
department store in new york city.

593
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:53,521
Good morning, america.

594
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:07,080
No. Mr. Kringle's time is extremely limited.

595
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,382
Sorry. Mr. Bedford's on line three.

596
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:12,744
No. He can't do private sessions.

597
00:43:12,744 --> 00:43:16,661
Can you hold for just a moment? Hang on.

598
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:21,230
Hi. Bryan, I have the mayor's office on hold.
What's up?

599
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:26,507
If I can arrange a really, really good
Babysitter for tonight,

600
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:28,359
you want to do some shopping
and have dinner?

601
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,262
Well, I'm not sure when I...

602
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:32,951
I don't know if I can get celia tonight.

603
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:36,159
I'll take care of it. See you at 7:00?

604
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,648
Well, I-I-I'm not sure what--o.k.

605
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:42,410
Fine. 7:00. Bye.

606
00:43:47,385 --> 00:43:49,761
Whoa! Who is this one?

607
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:50,819
This is dancer.

608
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:55,052
He's a bit slow, do you see?

609
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,192
Poor old dancer.

610
00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:02,829
Oh. Good evening, Mrs. Walker.

611
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:06,154
Good evening...Mr. Kringle.

612
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:09,504
Nobody at school is going to believe
this one, huh?

613
00:44:09,504 --> 00:44:13,574
Well, if you have to have a babysitter,
who's better qualified?

614
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:16,848
Yes.

615
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,290
Pretty, isn't it?

616
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,349
There really has to be something
you want for christmas.

617
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:17,123
I'm very good at
keeping secrets, you know.

618
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:19,751
Come on. Tell me.

619
00:46:49,821 --> 00:46:52,536
What's this?

620
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:07,994
Gosh.

621
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:15,179
That's what I want  for christmas--

622
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,528
a house, a brother, and a dad.

623
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:21,510
That's all I ever want.

624
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:29,582
If you're really Santa Claus,
you can get it for me.

625
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:35,092
If you can't, you're just a nice man
with a white beard like my mother says.

626
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:37,284
Oh, Susan.

627
00:47:37,285 --> 00:47:40,268
Just because every child doesn't get his
or her wish doesn't mean

628
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:42,356
There's not a Santa Claus.

629
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:44,317
I thought you might say that.

630
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:49,691
Did you?
Yes. Well...

631
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:51,392
A house is a very big order--

632
00:47:51,393 --> 00:47:53,962
And very expensive.

633
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:59,486
And a baby, well a baby takes
almost a year to, uh, to, uh...

634
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,028
nine months. More if the lady's late.

635
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:05,071
Less if the baby's a preemie.

636
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:11,372
Right. And a father. I mean, uh...

637
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:14,697
No one can give anybody a father.

638
00:48:14,698 --> 00:48:19,202
If Santa Claus really can make reindeer
fly and go up and down people's chimneys

639
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:24,430
and make millions of toys
and go around the world in one night,

640
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,609
he could get somebody a house

641
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:31,307
and a brother...and a dad. Right?

642
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:38,005
Right. Right. Yes. I suppose he...
he could.

643
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:45,645
I don't think I'll ever get those things,
so it's no big deal.

644
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:53,168
Oh. Well, um, perhaps
I could keep this paper. Could I?

645
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:54,224
Sure.

646
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:57,537
Well, good night, little angel.

647
00:48:57,537 --> 00:48:58,699
Good night.

648
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,158
Good night, Susan.

649
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,017
Good night, Mr. Kringle.

650
00:49:13,021 --> 00:49:16,611
A family for christmas.
I don't think so.

651
00:49:21,788 --> 00:49:24,470
No, really. I mean...

652
00:49:24,471 --> 00:49:26,460
see, that wasn't so bad, huh?

653
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,731
I had a great time.

654
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:31,455
You need to get out.
You need to forget work...

655
00:49:31,456 --> 00:49:34,590
- I should've listened to you earlier.
- Come out with me.

656
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,820
You understand why I didn't.

657
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,436
Sometimes I think I do .
Sometimes I think I don't .

658
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:44,258
Well, you are a very patient man.

659
00:49:44,258 --> 00:49:47,376
Most guys are gone
after a few months of me.

660
00:49:47,377 --> 00:49:49,581
So you admit that you're rough on men.

661
00:49:49,581 --> 00:49:51,595
No, not just rough on men.

662
00:49:53,544 --> 00:49:56,984
Yeah. I admit it. I'm careful.

663
00:49:56,985 --> 00:50:00,879
At this point in my life, I really don't need
to be disappointed.

664
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,918
Do you want one of your
christmas presents early?

665
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:13,206
I got you a christmas present,
and I want to give it to you.

666
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:14,264
What is it?

667
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:18,794
Do you want it early?

668
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:20,049
Yes.

669
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:32,211
What is it?

670
00:50:33,057 --> 00:50:34,516
Open it.

671
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,175
It's an engagement ring.

672
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:07,899
If I've given you a...
false impression of this relationship,

673
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,232
I'm very sorry.

674
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,298
Are you serious?

675
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:23,194
Have I ever given you any sign
that I wanted to marry you?

676
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:26,578
No.

677
00:51:26,578 --> 00:51:32,693
Then, tell me, whatever possessed you
to make a presumption?

678
00:51:32,694 --> 00:51:36,339
You know, I've done everything
I could to try to make you happy.

679
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:38,754
I love your daughter
like she's my own.

680
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:42,088
I loved you, getting nothing in return.

681
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:45,250
Never asking for anything in return.

682
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:49,874
I put my faith in you.

683
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:58,834
Well, if that's true,
then you're a fool.

684
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:43,508
- Taxi, please
- Certainly.

685
00:52:55,316 --> 00:52:57,039
Mr. Bedford.

686
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,933
Kriss.

687
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:00,142
How was your night as a babysitter?

688
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,908
Oh. Very pleasant.

689
00:53:03,908 --> 00:53:05,436
Susan's a good kid.

690
00:53:05,436 --> 00:53:11,657
Yes. Delightful. Delightful.

691
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:12,918
Well, how was it?

692
00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:17,153
I gave her an engagement ring.

693
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:20,435
Ohh. Ooh!

694
00:53:22,495 --> 00:53:24,405
She didn't like it very much.

695
00:53:24,405 --> 00:53:28,169
Well, perhaps your timing
wasn't particularly good.

696
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,157
Oh. Not at all.

697
00:53:31,157 --> 00:53:36,115
She...she's a sad sort of person, isn't she?

698
00:53:36,115 --> 00:53:39,797
It's a pity, really.
She's very kind...

699
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:45,267
but she's terribly careful about her emotions.

700
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:50,517
What I know about Dorey is pieced together
from fragments of a dozen conversations.

701
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:52,320
She was married in college,

702
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:54,497
he had a drinking problem,

703
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:59,537
And right after Susan was born
he took off and hasn't been heard of since.

704
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:04,306
She's filled with these, these bitter thoughts.

705
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,302
The worst part is she's dragging
Susan into this with her.

706
00:54:07,303 --> 00:54:11,488
Ah, yes. Well, Susan is struggling with it.

707
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:15,012
But I get the feeling that she does want
to believe in me, you know.

708
00:54:15,012 --> 00:54:16,514
She's a good girl.

709
00:54:16,515 --> 00:54:20,505
She's loyal to her mother's wishes.
I can't fault that.

710
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:24,281
Of course, if I can't convince the mother,

711
00:54:24,282 --> 00:54:27,486
I have no hope of convincing the child.

712
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,464
The tooth fairy told me that.

713
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:37,823
Well, your cab's here, Kriss.

714
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:45,660
I always wondered what guys
who have to return engagement rings
Say to the sales clerk at the jewelry store.

715
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:50,579
Now I don't want to know.

716
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:55,784
I'm sure in your line of work
you can find some lucky guy to give this to.

717
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,881
That's very generous of you,

718
00:54:59,882 --> 00:55:05,220
but I don't think this ring will ever fit anyone
Other than Mrs. Walker.

719
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:07,701
I'm sure you'll find somebody.

720
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:09,444
- I'm sorry.
- It's o.k.

721
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:11,284
I'll get over it.

722
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:12,681
Will Susan?

723
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:21,881
Well... I know what you want
for christmas now.

724
00:55:21,881 --> 00:55:23,733
I'll see what I can do.

725
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:25,484
- Good night.
- Good night.

726
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,909
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye!

727
00:55:55,844 --> 00:55:58,622
Come on.
It's your turn to go up now.

728
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:01,699
Hello.

729
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:04,704
What do you want for christmas?

730
00:56:05,184 --> 00:56:07,502
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please step aside?

731
00:56:07,503 --> 00:56:10,467
This is for the children.

732
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,551
Hot little helper you got here, huh, Santa?

733
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:19,632
She the one that puts the, uh...
twinkle in your eye?

734
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:26,395
Hey, kids, you see that guy up there?

735
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:28,073
He's not really Santa Claus.

736
00:56:28,074 --> 00:56:30,054
He doesn't even live at the north pole.

737
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:35,332
He lives in a nursing home on 140th street!

738
00:56:35,332 --> 00:56:37,389
You know what he is?

739
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:41,891
He's a big... Fat...Fake!

740
00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:51,116
Just a fake.

741
00:56:52,228 --> 00:56:53,943
Ho ho ho.

742
00:56:54,943 --> 00:57:04,943
