1
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,956
Did you blow
the candles out downstairs?

2
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,793
Yeah.

3
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,338
Look at this.

4
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:50,050
A Thanksgiving cornucopia
made of pie plates and spackle.

5
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,344
What the heck is a cornucopia?

6
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,555
lt's like a horn of plenty.

7
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,266
Oh, dear, can't it wait?

8
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:00,018
We just finished decorating
for Halloween.

9
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,191
-Well, good night.
-Night.

10
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:27,796
Go look!

11
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,522
Just a prank, that's all. Anton.

12
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:51,069
Our little Scooter would
never do something like that.

13
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:53,238
Quit calling him that baby name.

14
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:57,868
Anton would not scoot his behind
off the couch if the house was on fire.

15
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:01,663
God knows he didn't help me
with the Halloween decorations.

16
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,754
Did you hear that?
l heard something downstairs.

17
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:11,298
Well, the dog's out in the yard.

18
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,051
lt's probably just the cat.

19
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,139
Well, go see!

20
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:18,824
Hey, Bones.

21
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,459
Gary?

22
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,364
Anton?

23
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,427
Gary, you said you--

24
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:24,848
The house could burn down!

25
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:46,411
Wake up!

26
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,998
Anton, is that you?

27
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:22,739
If you'd like to make a call,
hang up and try again.

28
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:26,952
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

29
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:32,476
Hey, Mom! We're out of milk!

30
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,193
Mom, we're out of dog food!

31
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:03,423
Murder in Bolan.: Aa Special Report.

32
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:07,052
Four bodies have been found.
The killer is still at large.

33
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,054
Bolan is gripped with fear.

34
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:11,598
The killings spread
from a postal route...

35
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:15,227
... to the bowling alley and
now to our own Burger Jungle.

36
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,437
With Halloween only one day away...

37
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:21,400
...Bolan officials have set
a 9 p.m. curfew for all teenagers.

38
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:46,550
Hey. What's up, man?

39
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,927
-What's up with you?
-l'm dry.

40
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:52,389
-So?
-So why don't you bring me a dimer?

41
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:55,851
This ain't Domino's, you lazy bitch.
Come over and get it.

42
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,395
Come on, man. l'm comfortable.

43
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:01,356
Hello?

44
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,835
What's up, Anton?

45
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:26,089
Nice outfit!

46
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:38,977
Yeah? lf your mom had teeth,
she wouldn't suck dick so well.

47
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:40,562
What's your point?

48
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:43,607
What's up, Anton?

49
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,235
How's it going, brother?

50
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:48,320
Nice boxers.

51
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,323
Pass the chronic.

52
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:54,117
l'm sorry, man.
This bong is cashed.

53
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:56,453
You said he was holding.

54
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,289
l didn't say what l was holding.

55
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,130
That's messed up.

56
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:11,635
l hear if you combine nutmeg and
oregano, you can get pretty wasted.

57
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,846
All you do is smoke pot...

58
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,430
...and watch TV all day.

59
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:18,559
Don't get me wrong.
That's what life is all about.

60
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:22,104
But don't you think you should
have some ambition, a goal?

61
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:25,607
Yeah. l mean,
my dream life would be...

62
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:30,737
...to lie around and watch TV
while some hot broad delivers me food.

63
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,699
Until your parents
kick your oily ass out.

64
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:37,369
l haven't seen my parents
in a few days.

65
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:40,330
Maybe they're dead.
Party at Anton's.

66
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:41,915
What are you doing?

67
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,877
With a killer loose,
you can't rule out murder.

68
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:46,128
What killer?

69
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:47,921
Don't you watch the news?

70
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:49,840
l hate that fucking show.

71
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:52,676
Our little town is
in the national spotlight.

72
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,511
Local mailman, iced.

73
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,222
Barmaid at the bowling alley, iced.

74
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:59,266
You haven't heard about the twins?

75
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,477
They were jerking off
in the milkshake-maker again?

76
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:07,024
lced times two. Last night, when
they were working at Burger Jungle.

77
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:08,984
Damn.

78
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,488
Anton, here comes your woman.

79
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:17,409
He's got serious problems.

80
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:30,547
Molly's lived across the street
for, like, what, ever?

81
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:33,217
Tell her about your
obsession with her.

82
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:37,387
-Start by telling her your name.
-Yeah, man. She's waiting for you.

83
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:39,223
She's not waiting for me.

84
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:43,477
Would you stop being such a puss
and go, like, ask her to the dance?

85
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:44,853
What dance?

86
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:47,814
lf you'd been to school recently,
you'd know.

87
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:49,733
Halloween thing in the gym?

88
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:52,486
9:00 curfew?
No trick-or-treating allowed?

89
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,905
Dumb-ass dance is the only option.

90
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:56,156
You guys going?

91
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,326
Hell, no. Can you see us
in stupid-ass costumes?

92
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,078
Grooving to Hanson and Jewel?

93
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:03,872
What do we look like,
total losers, man?

94
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,168
l see your point.

95
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:12,422
She dropped her lyrics book.

96
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:16,134
She'll catch you reading that
over her shoulder in biology.

97
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:19,346
Her songs are badass.
She's like a poet or something.

98
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:24,017
Go bring it back to her.
Be like a knight in shining armour.

99
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:28,438
She'd be all grateful, invite me in,
offer me a drink, l'd accept.

100
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,232
She'd rip your clothes off...

101
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:33,485
...and make sweet love to you,
Red Shoe Diary-style.

102
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,030
-Right.
-Could happen.

103
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:39,741
Just go talk to her, man!

104
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:43,078
Maybe she'll think you're funny
or something.

105
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,164
You know what?

106
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,040
l think l'm going to.

107
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,543
You want to borrow some pants, chief?

108
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,545
First impressions and all.

109
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,046
You're a bud.

110
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,718
Think he's gonna do it?

111
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,929
So you gotta reach.

112
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,018
You're getting Cheezy Poofs everywhere.

113
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:08,312
You gotta open your mouth, man.

114
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,607
Lookie what l found.

115
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:13,275
l thought you were dry.

116
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:14,484
l guess not.

117
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:18,280
Fire me up.

118
00:14:53,982 --> 00:14:55,609
These are great.

119
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,918
My book!

120
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,087
Thank you so much...

121
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,089
...for returning it.

122
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:43,407
You're certain this is the right man?

123
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,451
Well, l'll tell you,
Sister Liquor--

124
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:48,996
That's LeCure.

125
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,416
-Debi's fine.
-All right, Sister Debi.

126
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,418
He's right here.

127
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:02,676
lt's gone!

128
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:04,553
Shit!

129
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,847
Missed it again.

130
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,894
Where did it go?

131
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:30,078
Beaver.

132
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,838
Bolan.

133
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,304
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

134
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,735
Holy shit!

135
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:46,655
Don't move!

136
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:48,448
Roll over!

137
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,200
Roll over!

138
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:54,955
Anton Tobias.

139
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:58,208
You got a reason
for prowling around here?

140
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,376
l live here.

141
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,920
Since when is it illegal
to grocery shop?

142
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:04,006
Hey, l know you guys.

143
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,718
You guys were seniors
when l was a freshman.

144
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,761
Let's talk about high school.

145
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,098
You and your stoner friends
zipping around on skateboards.

146
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,058
Thought you were too cool for us.

147
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,729
Did you even once invite us
to get high behind the gym?

148
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:20,564
You were dorks.

149
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:28,739
Either of you holding?

150
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:30,032
What?

151
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,327
l'm desperate. l know you can
get in the evidence room--

152
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,039
You asshole!
You're trying to score from a cop?

153
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:40,584
That's it.
Complete personal-effects search.

154
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:44,296
What's this?

155
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:47,007
Stupid, that's an asthma inhaler.

156
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,428
Empty your pockets, boy.

157
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:52,763
They're not my pants.

158
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,181
Let's go!

159
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:02,356
George found a new home.

160
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,485
What have we here?

161
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:08,529
Officer?

162
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:12,074
Smells like marijuana to me.

163
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:13,325
Write it up, Ruck.

164
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:14,701
What? lt's empty.

165
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,913
You can't cite me
for possession of a baggie.

166
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,292
Littering.

167
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:24,211
Maximum fine.

168
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:28,048
Two hundred dollars.

169
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:30,968
Right.

170
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:00,617
Oh, shit! The killer's here!

171
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:03,162
The killer's in my house!

172
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,694
Okay, Dukey.

173
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:39,865
Everything's gonna be okay.
Come on, come on.

174
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:45,037
Everything's going to be fine.

175
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:46,955
Yes, it is.

176
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:10,562
All right, boy.

177
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:17,152
He's not dead!

178
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,290
Duke! Come on, lay down!

179
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,708
Get down, Duke!

180
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:34,795
All right.

181
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,430
Hold on, Duke. Hold on.

182
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:49,101
Where's the phone?

183
00:23:57,442 --> 00:23:59,027
Run, Duke, run!

184
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:01,280
He's under the bed!

185
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,128
Mom?

186
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:21,717
Dad?

187
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,321
What's the matter?
Bad shrooms?

188
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:44,907
You got a fever? Here you go.

189
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:47,034
l'm going to show you.

190
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,085
Oh, man!

191
00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:02,424
l love this video. l didn't think
they could show it anymore.

192
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:04,551
Guys!

193
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,055
Someone killed my parents!

194
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:09,473
This is the best part.

195
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:14,520
Shake them, baby.

196
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,107
Look! Look!

197
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:22,528
-Shit!
-Yeah, you see?

198
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:28,575
Mr. Tobias?

199
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:29,952
Miss T.?

200
00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:38,210
ls this some kind of Halloween gag?
Your parents always go all out.

201
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:44,174
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my dad!

202
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:47,302
CPR, man. l saw it on Baywatch.

203
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:57,771
Check it out.

204
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:02,985
A clue.

205
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:44,902
''Ant''? They were killed by ants?

206
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:47,154
Please, don't be stupid.

207
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:48,989
Do you have an evil aunt?

208
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:51,992
Holy shit!

209
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:57,623
Are those ears?

210
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,791
Ear rings?

211
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,376
They're both lefts.

212
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:05,005
You know what that means.

213
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:07,883
Feldstein twins.

214
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,986
The killer was wearing your shirt.

215
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:34,117
The killer was wearing me.

216
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:39,873
l'm the killer.

217
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:45,504
l'm gonna call 91 1 .

218
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:47,673
What's the number?

219
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:56,139
There's something wrong
with my friend.

220
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,101
l think he took
some nutmeg or something.

221
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:04,898
Mick, buddy.

222
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,318
-l would remember something like that.
-You would.

223
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:10,487
l'm not the killer. You know?

224
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:14,408
Yeah, l know. But if O.J.
could get off, then l'm sure--

225
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,452
Do you want a beer?

226
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:19,079
-No, thanks.
-You sure?

227
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:39,016
Talk to me!

228
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:45,022
What the hell is happening to me?

229
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:53,530
Pnub, man.

230
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:55,866
l didn't do it.

231
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:00,829
Okay, l did it.
But it was an accident.

232
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,332
l can't believe
you told me to smoke that shit!

233
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:07,503
Okay, Anton.
l have to leave now.

234
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,255
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

235
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:30,984
lt's the basement!
You can't get out that way!

236
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,541
Why are you doing this?

237
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:47,084
l don't know!

238
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:49,586
lt's me, Pnub! Your buddy!

239
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:53,590
l know who you are.
l don't want to hurt you.

240
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:54,925
Then don't!

241
00:29:57,636 --> 00:29:58,887
lt's not me!

242
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:00,305
lt's my hand!

243
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:02,975
lt's like l have no control
over my hand!

244
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:11,608
l don't know how long
l can hold it. Run!

245
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:12,985
Get out of my way!

246
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:14,111
Just go!

247
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:20,075
lt's going to be okay.
l won't tell anybody.

248
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,451
l swear.

249
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:23,412
Everything will be cool.

250
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:24,663
Everything will be...

251
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,136
...cool.

252
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:21,094
What have l done?

253
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,640
What have l done?

254
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:19,736
Get out of here, Bones!

255
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:22,531
Git!

256
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,425
Bones?

257
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:52,769
Here, kitty, kitty.

258
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:25,928
Aren't you a little old
for ding-dong ditch?

259
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:30,390
Sorry about your bush.

260
00:33:34,728 --> 00:33:36,355
No problem.

261
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:42,402
What were you doing out there anyway?

262
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:49,993
Jesus, look at you!

263
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,749
l was looking for my cat.

264
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,251
We got in a fight.

265
00:33:58,252 --> 00:33:59,920
You sure got your ass kicked.

266
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:02,172
l did okay.

267
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:07,344
So you ran and hid in my bush.

268
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:12,850
l shouldn't be here.

269
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,977
l'm not myself today.

270
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:17,855
l'm someone completely different.

271
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:20,732
You're so shy.

272
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:22,150
lt's okay. l get it.

273
00:34:22,776 --> 00:34:25,988
So let's skip this chickening-out,
sneaking-around stage.

274
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:29,283
No, you don't understand. l'm--

275
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:36,290
Do you want to come inside and talk?

276
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:49,720
You never gave me a chance to thank you.
That book is important to me.

277
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:55,684
So...

278
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:59,605
...nothing cooler than
a chick bass-guitar player.

279
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,983
Especially one that writes
her own lyrics.

280
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,776
You read them?

281
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:09,823
l couldn't help looking in the book.
They're amazing.

282
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:12,743
Look, l even got
my favourites memorized.

283
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:14,745
Devil girl with nothing to lose

284
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:19,374
She got wind in her hair
Aand gum on her shoes

285
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:24,379
l was 1 3 when l wrote that.

286
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,048
Yeah, well...

287
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:27,758
...they're amazing.

288
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:29,343
Thanks.

289
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:47,486
l should not be here, Molly.

290
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:51,573
Safer in here than on the streets.
There's a killer out there.

291
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:57,079
That's exactly what l'm saying.
l'm dangerous.

292
00:35:57,579 --> 00:35:58,580
Oh, yeah?

293
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,833
How dangerous?

294
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:04,002
l'm not kidding.

295
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:06,213
l've done stuff, you know?

296
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,976
l'm impressed.

297
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:23,355
l never would've thought you'd have
the balls to just grab me like that.

298
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,191
Me either.

299
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:20,704
You're kinky.

300
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:23,665
That's me.

301
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:42,976
Move it, people! Let's go!

302
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:45,354
Some of us are
on serious missions here.

303
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:49,691
There's evil out there,
and I gotta kick its ass!

304
00:37:57,491 --> 00:38:01,411
Shit, my parents are home.
We'll have to pick this up later.

305
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:05,332
My parents might take offense to some
bloody boy banging their daughter.

306
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,708
Tomorrow.

307
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,336
-You want to see me?
-Come by at 7.

308
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:15,175
The curfew's annihilated our options,
but we can go to the dance.

309
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:18,136
l thought you said
the streets weren't safe.

310
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:20,639
l'll protect you.

311
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:50,794
Dearly beloved...

312
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,007
...we're gathered here today
because you're all dead.

313
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:57,551
And it's my fault.

314
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:00,804
Mom, Dad...

315
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:03,974
...what can l say? l mean...

316
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,643
...you brought me into this world...

317
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:10,814
...you put a roof over my head,
you fed me until l killed you.

318
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:17,070
lf you look at it that way, l haven't
been a good son, but l'm really...

319
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:19,490
...really, really sorry.

320
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:21,700
And wherever you are...

321
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:25,787
...l just want you to forgive me...

322
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:28,415
...because l'm gonna try to change.

323
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,172
Mick...

324
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:36,882
...Pnub, guys....

325
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:41,929
You guys were the greatest.
l'm never going to forget...

326
00:39:42,137 --> 00:39:47,267
...the way we sat around all day,
watched TV and got really stoned.

327
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:50,062
And all those other times
where we just....

328
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,151
l guess that's all we did.

329
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,741
Amen.

330
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:18,632
Over here.

331
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,844
Anton, help me.

332
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:26,557
Come on, man.
l can't breathe down here.

333
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,607
Anton, can you hear me?

334
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,235
Yeah, man, Mick.

335
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:40,571
Now get me out of here.

336
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,948
You're dead.

337
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:44,032
No, l'm not.

338
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,995
You conked my head pretty good.
l must've been unconscious.

339
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:52,916
-You think?
-l know, fucker. Now dig me up!

340
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,803
Stay where you are, Mick!

341
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:47,721
Please don't kill me.

342
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:51,767
Watch it, man!

343
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,081
What did l take last night?

344
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:18,502
That dream was intense.

345
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:21,964
lntense.

346
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,431
-Turn it up. Check it out.
-Yeah, l'm watching.

347
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:33,642
Did you see?

348
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,102
-Guys!
-That's funny.

349
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:39,022
Thank God you're alive, because
l had this dream that l killed--

350
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,197
Shit!

351
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:51,577
Sorry about that thing
with the shovel.

352
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,246
-You're dead.
-Easy, tiger.

353
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,456
Undead, actually.

354
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,917
You said you were unconscious.
You lied.

355
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:02,838
You killed me, all right?
Try and keep this thing in perspective.

356
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,216
l was bitter about the
getting-killed-by-my-best-friend thing.

357
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:07,926
But l got over it.

358
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,524
So why you here?

359
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,193
We need a place to kick it.

360
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:27,237
Don't be selfish.
No one else's parents are dead.

361
00:43:27,654 --> 00:43:30,115
No, not why are you '' here'' here.
l mean...

362
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:34,077
...are you flesh-eating zombies
back from hell to exact revenge?

363
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,746
ls that it?

364
00:43:36,038 --> 00:43:38,040
Why would we go to hell?

365
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,124
We're not bad.

366
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:42,878
lt's not like we're good,
but at least we don't kill people!

367
00:43:43,295 --> 00:43:45,255
l didn't kill anybody on purpose.

368
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:48,050
Yeah, well, we weren't in hell.

369
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,345
There was this bright light
at the end of a long tunnel.

370
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,765
There were all these chicks' voices.
And that music.

371
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:55,891
Music?

372
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:58,894
Kind of uncool music, like Enya.

373
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:00,812
And these chicks were saying...

374
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:03,899
...'' Come to us.
Come towards the light.''

375
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,986
So what happened?

376
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,863
We figured, fuck it.

377
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:11,990
l mean, it was really far.

378
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:20,374
l've got to ask.
What's with the hand?

379
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:24,878
lt doesn't obey me at all.

380
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,423
The only thing l can come up with is,
it's possessed.

381
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,803
Do you guys know anything
about Satan or evil or...?

382
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:34,388
No.

383
00:44:36,723 --> 00:44:38,642
But we know somebody who does.

384
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,342
Did you know them well?

385
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:14,970
Not really.

386
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:16,471
You?

387
00:45:17,472 --> 00:45:19,600
Yeah, they were great.

388
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:24,271
l just feel really bad, you know,
because l was always so mean to them.

389
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:29,276
Like this one time, they asked me
to go on a double-date...

390
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:33,322
...and l thought they were 'tards,
because there's only one of me.

391
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:37,034
So l told them to go blow each other.

392
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:41,455
Did they?

393
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,795
The way you treated them...

394
00:45:49,087 --> 00:45:51,798
...the guilt must be making you feel
like shit inside.

395
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:53,634
Randy!

396
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,719
You're still in high school?

397
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:58,597
Yeah, me, l got out
about three years ago.

398
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:00,224
l need your help.

399
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,602
What are you playing,
a little two-ball?

400
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,773
l gotta talk to you.
There's serious stuff going on.

401
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:11,610
Anton, can't you see l'm getting
a little action over here?

402
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:19,785
Oh, man. l can't believe
you cock-blocked me like that.

403
00:46:20,035 --> 00:46:22,079
l thought we were buds.

404
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:23,664
Randy, wait!

405
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:26,750
l didn't mean to mess you up.
Listen.

406
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,627
l need your help.

407
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:33,924
Piss off!

408
00:46:50,649 --> 00:46:52,651
Fresh tomatoes....

409
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:55,821
Hey! Who are you?

410
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:58,073
New. Drive-thru duty.

411
00:46:58,323 --> 00:46:59,491
Excuse me.

412
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,035
Sorry.

413
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,257
-Break time.
-All right.

414
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:18,969
Give me the Big Five with
the Spicy Safari Fries...

415
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,305
...the African Apple Turnover...

416
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:23,557
...and the Raspberry Rainforest Shake.

417
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,351
Slap some extra mustard
on that Jungle Burger.

418
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,937
Tell me everything you know
about the devil.

419
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,733
Aare you out of your fucking mind?

420
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,237
You listen to satanic music.
You must've picked up something.

421
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:40,157
Look, it's just music.

422
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:43,202
Like Mozart and that other fag....

423
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:45,954
Keep it clean.

424
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,415
Who, Beethoven?

425
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:51,960
That's the guy. It's just like
their music, only louder.

426
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:53,754
You gotta know.
l'm desperate.

427
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,339
Oh, man!

428
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,010
Here!

429
00:48:00,427 --> 00:48:01,803
Asshole!

430
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,268
lt's my hand. lt's like it's got
a mind of its own.

431
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:10,938
lt makes me do things
l don't want it to do.

432
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,023
l used to be like that.

433
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:15,651
Get into all kinds of stupid shit.

434
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:17,027
Look, the trick is...

435
00:48:17,444 --> 00:48:19,112
...to keep yourself busy.

436
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,657
That's why l'm always
working on the Ford.

437
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,826
Keeps me out of trouble.

438
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:27,204
ldle hands are the devil's playground.

439
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:29,540
Keep my hands busy.

440
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,168
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

441
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,711
Thanks.
You're the coolest.

442
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:51,728
So do you, like, knit now?

443
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:55,399
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look queer doing that.

444
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:57,734
Randy broke it down for me.

445
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,238
'' ldle hands are the devil's playpen.''
So l'm thinking...

446
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:04,158
...keep my hands occupied, right?

447
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:06,910
Man, that saying's not literal.

448
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,495
lt's more like...

449
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,205
...you know....

450
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:12,082
Metaphorical?

451
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:13,792
Right.

452
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,016
This is the noise complaint.

453
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,685
Ain't this the Tobias residence?

454
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:41,862
Holy shit! lt's Anton.
He's the killer!

455
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,406
-l better call for backup.
-Are you crazy?

456
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:48,285
And let the feds get the credit?
lf we collar him, we'll be heroes.

457
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:50,162
We can't go in without a warrant.

458
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:52,623
Piss on the Bill of Rights!
We got just cause.

459
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:55,125
Freeze!

460
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,627
Yeah, freeze!

461
00:50:01,757 --> 00:50:02,591
Guys...

462
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:03,842
...what do l do?

463
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:06,303
l think you--

464
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,977
l was gonna say to do
what they tell you...

465
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,729
...but now l changed my mind.

466
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,606
You should just kill them.

467
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:20,818
-They're alive!
-They are not!

468
00:50:21,026 --> 00:50:23,237
You shot one in the head!
They're morgue-meat.

469
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:26,782
Look, guys. l don't want
to kill anybody else.

470
00:50:28,534 --> 00:50:30,661
You don't want to go to jail, though.

471
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,455
Jail. That's it!

472
00:50:33,705 --> 00:50:37,125
They'll throw me in a rubber room.
l can't hurt anybody else.

473
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:38,710
Cuff me!

474
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:41,213
Okay. Just...

475
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:44,675
...drop the knitting needles.

476
00:50:45,217 --> 00:50:48,220
That's not a good idea.
Why don't you just cuff me?

477
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,723
Drop the needles
and put your hands on your head!

478
00:50:51,974 --> 00:50:53,058
l can't!

479
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:55,686
Put down the needles
and come quietly.

480
00:50:55,978 --> 00:50:58,355
-Cuff me!
-Put the needles down now!

481
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,357
-Cuff me!
-Put them down!

482
00:51:00,649 --> 00:51:02,067
-Put them down!
-Cuff me!

483
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:33,807
Go, go, Buffalo!

484
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:38,437
Stop!

485
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,106
l didn't do it. lt was my hand.

486
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,109
lt's like, the knitting
didn't help at all.

487
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:47,362
l told you that saying
was more, like, metaphorical.

488
00:51:56,288 --> 00:51:58,582
l can't keep doing this!

489
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,044
l'm losing my mind.

490
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:19,394
Get your head.

491
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:30,572
No way.

492
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:33,408
lt's the only thing l can think of.

493
00:52:33,742 --> 00:52:37,120
Once that hand is gone,
how will you cut off the other one?

494
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:38,705
The left one's a keeper.

495
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:41,250
l mean, l guess it wasn't idle enough.

496
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:42,960
Are you sure?

497
00:52:44,086 --> 00:52:48,131
l use it for a lot of things.
l light up, l change the remote...

498
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,759
...l relieve a little tension.

499
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,303
This is the answer. l know it.

500
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:56,348
Those things won't even cut my bagel.

501
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,477
Shit!

502
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:08,735
Grab the carver.

503
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:16,034
Look at me!

504
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:18,120
l'm Leatherface!

505
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,331
Thanks, Mick.

506
00:53:24,626 --> 00:53:26,587
l'll just use this one.

507
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:29,423
l can't watch.

508
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:51,487
You missed.

509
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:53,614
Pnub...

510
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,824
...bite down.

511
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,534
Don't cut me, man!

512
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,005
You scream like a girl.

513
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,551
What the hell are you doing?

514
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,766
l gotta stop the blood flow.
Don't you watch ER?

515
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:26,563
Look at that nasty thing.
That's gonna be infected for sure.

516
00:54:26,855 --> 00:54:28,816
You got any antiseptic, Anton?

517
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,067
l don't know.

518
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:33,320
Pnub's got some in a first-aid kit
in his house.

519
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:34,696
And burritos.

520
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,865
You'll be okay, buddy.

521
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:39,660
We'll be back in a sec
to fix you up, Anton.

522
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,000
Catch you on the flip-flop.

523
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:07,855
Oh, shit!

524
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:30,794
Anton, are you home?

525
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,800
Don't come in!
Just stay there, okay?

526
00:55:37,593 --> 00:55:39,219
Very funny, Anton.

527
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,013
Stay out there, Molly!

528
00:55:41,346 --> 00:55:43,223
l'm freezing my butt off.

529
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:00,532
Anton, we're gonna be late.

530
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:09,458
Anton, l can hear you in there!

531
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:11,418
Stay outside!

532
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:14,463
Come on, Anton!

533
00:56:21,136 --> 00:56:23,222
Let's go!
We're gonna be late!

534
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:37,444
We're gonna miss the band.

535
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:44,827
Fry!

536
00:56:49,957 --> 00:56:51,208
Gross.

537
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:53,544
Anton, l'm coming in.

538
00:56:58,215 --> 00:56:59,049
Wait!

539
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:10,769
You look incredible.

540
00:57:10,978 --> 00:57:12,938
Thanks. But you should've called.

541
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:16,817
lf you needed more time with your
costume, fine. But l hate waiting.

542
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,570
So what are you supposed
to be, anyway?

543
00:57:22,364 --> 00:57:23,282
l'm...

544
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,286
...a fast-food employee that
cut off his own hand.

545
00:57:27,828 --> 00:57:28,662
Cute.

546
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:36,712
Come on!

547
00:57:40,674 --> 00:57:42,301
Anton, we're back!

548
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:46,221
We got antiseptic
and adhesive bandages!

549
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,223
The ouch-free kind!

550
00:57:53,145 --> 00:57:56,648
'' Microwave for three minutes
and enjoy.''

551
00:57:57,566 --> 00:57:59,568
That's really getting on my nerves.

552
00:58:10,496 --> 00:58:12,247
What are you doing?

553
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:15,292
Could you...?

554
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:16,710
This way.

555
00:58:17,085 --> 00:58:18,086
Easy.

556
00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:23,842
Yeah. That's better.

557
00:58:27,095 --> 00:58:28,180
All right.

558
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:34,853
Thanks, man!

559
00:58:39,691 --> 00:58:40,943
Gross!

560
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:43,695
Maybe we should clean it first.

561
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:47,950
Hey, yeah! And while we're at it,
we can clean the whole house.

562
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:49,785
This ain't our mess.

563
00:59:09,388 --> 00:59:13,308
Look, l can't go to the dance yet,
okay? l'm sorry.

564
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:16,562
My parents will be home
in a few minutes.

565
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,481
lf they see the mess l made,
they'll kill me.

566
00:59:20,232 --> 00:59:22,359
Look, l won't be too long.

567
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:23,986
l'll meet you there.

568
00:59:25,404 --> 00:59:26,864
ls something wrong?

569
00:59:27,072 --> 00:59:28,824
You need to go there now...

570
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:33,579
...and you can't stop till you're
inside with everyone else, okay?

571
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,956
You wouldn't stand me up, would you?

572
00:59:36,957 --> 00:59:39,084
Not a chance, babysnakes.

573
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:49,094
l'll get the next one.

574
00:59:56,852 --> 00:59:58,770
Shit! l bit my tongue.

575
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:07,529
That's disgusting.

576
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:13,827
l bet l can fix that for you.

577
01:00:26,131 --> 01:00:27,049
Hold still.

578
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,595
That's better.

579
01:00:32,346 --> 01:00:34,264
Burrito, burrito

580
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,894
Wait, wait! Don't open it!

581
01:00:40,521 --> 01:00:42,064
l'm sorry, there were only two.

582
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:44,691
No! You let the hand out!

583
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:48,654
We brought you a first-aid kit.

584
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,908
-Where did it go?
-What? You mean the hand?

585
01:00:53,158 --> 01:00:54,243
Of course, the hand.

586
01:00:56,203 --> 01:00:58,330
Try looking up your ass.

587
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:14,054
Damn.

588
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:42,833
Hey, foxy.

589
01:01:44,209 --> 01:01:45,294
Looking for a ball?

590
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:49,423
Because l could help you find one
that's the right size for you.

591
01:01:50,424 --> 01:01:51,508
What the hell?

592
01:01:51,758 --> 01:01:53,135
Try and keep up.

593
01:01:53,552 --> 01:01:56,388
l'd be happy to keep up
with you, sweet thing.

594
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:01,477
Don't you have a dance to go to?

595
01:02:02,144 --> 01:02:04,771
That's right.
We gotta do our costumes.

596
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,441
-You coming, Randy?
-No.

597
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,651
l think l can find myself a ride.

598
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:11,153
All right.

599
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,408
So what brings you to Bolan?

600
01:02:18,243 --> 01:02:19,578
You don't want to know.

601
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:22,748
No, seriously.
l'm interested.

602
01:02:22,956 --> 01:02:24,124
Really?

603
01:02:27,169 --> 01:02:28,712
Here it goes.

604
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:33,425
l'm a Druidic priestess sworn
to fight a certain evil force...

605
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:36,678
...that possesses the laziest
fuckup it can find.

606
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:39,556
lt will kill as many people
as possible...

607
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:43,060
...and then drag a free soul
into the Netherworld.

608
01:02:45,437 --> 01:02:47,648
That's some weighty shit there.

609
01:02:48,106 --> 01:02:49,274
Here's the kicker.

610
01:02:49,525 --> 01:02:52,945
l have the one thing
that can stop this from happening.

611
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:56,949
l just need to find the bastard
whose hand is possessed.

612
01:02:57,616 --> 01:02:58,700
Weird.

613
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:03,121
Earlier today, this guy, Anton,
told me his hand was doing stuff...

614
01:03:03,372 --> 01:03:05,457
...that he didn't want it to do.

615
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:07,918
Don't you fuck with me!

616
01:03:08,168 --> 01:03:09,795
Ease up, there, kitten.

617
01:03:10,045 --> 01:03:13,131
l'm telling you the truth.
This guy was freaked!

618
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,259
Show me where he lives.

619
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:30,649
Left! Turn left!

620
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:54,756
Guys! We gotta go to the dance.

621
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:57,509
The hand, it's after Molly.

622
01:03:58,177 --> 01:04:00,637
Let's check out the dance.
l'll win Best Costume.

623
01:04:00,888 --> 01:04:03,974
Chicks dig winners.
l'll probably hook up.

624
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:08,479
Yeah, because severed heads are
one of the top 1 0 big turn-ons.

625
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:12,941
lt kills me to see you stressed out.

626
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,403
You cut off your hand
in the interest of others.

627
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:17,821
lt's not your problem anymore.

628
01:04:18,197 --> 01:04:22,034
So what l want you to do
is take a little Anton-time.

629
01:04:23,243 --> 01:04:25,704
Just relax and kick back, my man.

630
01:04:26,205 --> 01:04:27,831
No, no. You know what?

631
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:31,627
Not this time, okay?

632
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:35,214
l'm through with that.
All l do is sit around.

633
01:04:35,464 --> 01:04:38,133
l veg out, l watch TV,
l smoke pot--

634
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:40,969
No Kevin Costner speeches.
Let's just go.

635
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:46,809
Come on!

636
01:04:56,235 --> 01:04:57,694
Let's go! Come on, come on!

637
01:04:57,903 --> 01:04:59,238
That's him!

638
01:04:59,822 --> 01:05:02,991
-They're getting into my Ford!
-Wait here. He's dangerous.

639
01:05:03,408 --> 01:05:06,119
Wait.
Don't let him steal my Ford.

640
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,205
Trust me.
l know what l'm doing.

641
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,668
That's lucky.

642
01:05:13,752 --> 01:05:14,837
Shit.

643
01:05:15,128 --> 01:05:16,839
Couldn't be automatic.

644
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:18,632
Want me to drive?

645
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:20,133
No, just shift for me.

646
01:05:28,308 --> 01:05:29,977
Anton! Wait!

647
01:05:39,778 --> 01:05:40,863
What was that?

648
01:05:41,155 --> 01:05:42,156
Who cares?

649
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:55,586
Get back here!

650
01:06:22,988 --> 01:06:25,032
Who's got the barf breath?

651
01:06:48,347 --> 01:06:50,474
Damn!
lt's hot in here.

652
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,185
So are you, babe.

653
01:06:56,688 --> 01:06:59,650
l'm sweating my costume off, Curtis.

654
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:04,655
Better?

655
01:07:18,794 --> 01:07:20,629
Help me get this off.

656
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:42,359
Right there.

657
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:24,776
lt's here.

658
01:08:25,694 --> 01:08:27,738
You guys go protect Molly.

659
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:29,323
l'll go after the hand.

660
01:08:32,117 --> 01:08:34,244
-What a waste.
-You didn't like Curtis.

661
01:08:34,495 --> 01:08:36,330
l'm talking about that ass!

662
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,373
Well, at least he died happy.

663
01:09:05,484 --> 01:09:06,902
What's bugging you?

664
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:08,570
Just thinking.

665
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:10,906
And l know who about.

666
01:09:11,406 --> 01:09:13,200
Just thought he'd be here by now.

667
01:09:14,076 --> 01:09:15,661
He'll be here.

668
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:20,666
l'll go get some punch.
You want some?

669
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,085
Okay, l'll be right back.

670
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:50,779
You guys look great!

671
01:09:51,572 --> 01:09:53,282
Who did your makeup?

672
01:09:54,825 --> 01:09:58,036
-l guess Anton did.
-Based on my design, though.

673
01:09:59,079 --> 01:09:59,997
You want to dance?

674
01:10:00,289 --> 01:10:01,206
Hell, yeah!

675
01:10:04,418 --> 01:10:06,503
-We should find Molly.
-Quit being a skirt.

676
01:10:06,712 --> 01:10:10,215
We'll look for her while we dance.
There's plenty of chicks here.

677
01:10:10,966 --> 01:10:13,343
-Careful, it's on kind of loose.
-Cool!

678
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:42,122
Don't put me on hold again.
l want to talk to your supervisor.

679
01:10:42,581 --> 01:10:43,582
What?

680
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:46,293
Yes, of course.

681
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:52,758
What's taking so long?
ls this the supervisor?

682
01:10:53,926 --> 01:10:56,553
What do you mean
my credit card is no good?

683
01:10:57,012 --> 01:10:59,473
Well, you must have
the wrong number.

684
01:11:00,349 --> 01:11:03,101
No, it's 8-4-6-8.

685
01:11:10,275 --> 01:11:11,443
That's good.

686
01:11:12,653 --> 01:11:15,364
l think you've been a bad girl...

687
01:11:16,323 --> 01:11:19,743
...and l want to spank you
with my ruler.

688
01:11:21,662 --> 01:11:23,372
Oh, yes, that's nice.

689
01:11:23,789 --> 01:11:25,040
That is nice.

690
01:11:27,668 --> 01:11:28,919
Now l'm hot.

691
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,046
l'm hot.

692
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:36,009
You got me so hot, it's like
l can feel you touching me.

693
01:11:40,222 --> 01:11:42,432
l can feel you touching me.

694
01:12:10,419 --> 01:12:11,503
Bingo!

695
01:12:24,516 --> 01:12:26,810
Come on! We got to find Anton!

696
01:12:28,103 --> 01:12:29,771
And kick his ass!

697
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,168
Are you Anton?

698
01:12:51,418 --> 01:12:54,296
lf you're a teacher,
we'll discuss my attendance later--

699
01:12:54,505 --> 01:12:56,548
l found you!
My name is Debi LeCure.

700
01:12:56,798 --> 01:12:59,176
l know what's happening.
l could stop it.

701
01:13:00,093 --> 01:13:00,928
Really, how?

702
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:04,264
Die!

703
01:13:16,401 --> 01:13:17,653
Yeah, fuck him up, Debi!

704
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:21,240
The host of evil must die!

705
01:13:26,578 --> 01:13:28,664
lsn't that knife
a little extreme, kitten?

706
01:13:41,134 --> 01:13:45,931
You're not going anywhere, evil-hosting
fuck-stick. Nobody touches my Ford!

707
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:47,224
Come on, Debi.

708
01:13:47,474 --> 01:13:48,392
Give him what for.

709
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:50,227
Wait, wait! l'm not a host.

710
01:13:50,561 --> 01:13:51,728
Okay, look.

711
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,106
The evil was in my hand, all right?

712
01:13:56,233 --> 01:13:57,901
l cut it off. Okay?

713
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:00,654
Oh, shit!

714
01:14:00,904 --> 01:14:02,239
You let it loose?

715
01:14:02,489 --> 01:14:04,283
That was probably a mistake.

716
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:07,661
No kidding. And now it's
after my girlfriend.

717
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,705
-You got a girlfriend?
-l gotta stop it.

718
01:14:09,955 --> 01:14:12,791
-lt's out for blood.
-That ain't all it's out for.

719
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:15,961
lf your girl's the one it's after,
then at midnight...

720
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:17,921
...it's taking her to hell.

721
01:14:18,172 --> 01:14:19,673
Hell?

722
01:14:21,091 --> 01:14:23,802
lt's not even 9:00 yet.
We got some time.

723
01:14:25,095 --> 01:14:25,929
lt's actually...

724
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:30,225
...six minutes till midnight,
druid time.

725
01:14:31,143 --> 01:14:32,561
Druid time.

726
01:14:32,895 --> 01:14:33,729
Right.

727
01:14:33,979 --> 01:14:34,813
Let's go!

728
01:14:43,572 --> 01:14:44,656
Oh, God!

729
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:46,325
That's disgusting.

730
01:14:46,909 --> 01:14:49,828
Come on, man. You're dead.

731
01:14:50,078 --> 01:14:53,081
You know, think about it.
lt's illegal.

732
01:15:17,731 --> 01:15:19,316
Move! Look out!

733
01:15:25,197 --> 01:15:27,991
Everybody, go home!
There's a psycho killer here!

734
01:15:38,877 --> 01:15:41,171
l cut off my hand,
and it'll kill you all.

735
01:15:41,421 --> 01:15:42,923
Get off the stage!

736
01:15:46,593 --> 01:15:49,054
lt's true.
His hand killed us yesterday.

737
01:15:49,346 --> 01:15:51,640
Yeah, it sliced me up real good.

738
01:15:52,057 --> 01:15:54,434
-Molly, you out there?
-Get out of here, kid!

739
01:15:56,103 --> 01:15:58,730
You had your fun!
Now it's time--

740
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:10,242
Shit!

741
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:39,563
-God! Did you see that thing?
-l have to get Anton!

742
01:16:39,813 --> 01:16:42,941
No, screw him!
l mean, he'll be fine!

743
01:16:45,194 --> 01:16:46,195
Come on!

744
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:49,990
ln there?

745
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,660
You want to stay out here and
get killed as you're trampled?

746
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,919
l was going to get some.

747
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:04,755
l really doubt it.

748
01:17:11,845 --> 01:17:14,389
Pnub's a lot more creative
than l thought.

749
01:17:14,598 --> 01:17:16,809
l mean, he's actually kind of cool.

750
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:19,853
-He had that costume--
-Maybe we should go faster.

751
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:21,772
l don't know if he did it or--

752
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:23,816
-Wait, wait!
-What, what--?

753
01:17:26,318 --> 01:17:27,236
Go!

754
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:39,456
Oh, shit! We're trapped in here!

755
01:17:39,748 --> 01:17:42,292
-lt's going to get me!
-lt's not going to get you!

756
01:17:42,543 --> 01:17:44,503
lt's not going to get you!

757
01:17:49,049 --> 01:17:52,261
We can't go through the blade!
We'll be pulverized!

758
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,929
Give me your shoe!

759
01:18:24,376 --> 01:18:26,211
What are you going to do?

760
01:18:28,714 --> 01:18:31,425
No, no.
Oh, God, it's too far!

761
01:18:31,675 --> 01:18:33,635
l can't drop that far!

762
01:18:34,636 --> 01:18:36,054
We'll die in this vent!

763
01:18:36,305 --> 01:18:38,140
-We won't die.
-We'll die here.

764
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,227
The rats are gonna eat us,
and nobody's gonna find us.

765
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,856
Okay, we're good.

766
01:18:49,902 --> 01:18:52,112
-Be careful.
-All right, let's go!

767
01:18:58,744 --> 01:19:01,872
This would be more comfortable
if your ass wasn't so wide.

768
01:19:02,122 --> 01:19:04,333
-This is dumb.
-Anton needs our help.

769
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,753
The best thing about being dead
is zero responsibility.

770
01:19:08,003 --> 01:19:10,380
That's Tanya. Let's save her.
Come on!

771
01:19:12,216 --> 01:19:15,719
-Hurry up. She needs me.
-She needs you like a fish needs--

772
01:19:20,641 --> 01:19:22,559
Okay, this sucks.

773
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:30,442
Grab the cord and come down!

774
01:19:31,109 --> 01:19:33,904
l can't. l can't. l'm scared!

775
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:36,073
Do it, Tanya! Come on!

776
01:19:36,323 --> 01:19:38,158
l can't. lt's here.

777
01:19:38,408 --> 01:19:40,077
lt's in here. l know it.

778
01:19:41,453 --> 01:19:43,247
Why'd you pull the rope up?

779
01:19:44,164 --> 01:19:46,124
l didn't pull the rope up.

780
01:19:49,294 --> 01:19:51,421
Tanya, where are you?
l can't see you!

781
01:19:52,089 --> 01:19:53,757
Tanya, talk to me, please!

782
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:55,509
Just jump! Just jump!

783
01:20:00,222 --> 01:20:02,516
Tanya, grab the rope!

784
01:20:03,851 --> 01:20:04,768
Get it off!

785
01:20:37,593 --> 01:20:41,346
l'm not going through all this Tanya.
Go back that way.

786
01:20:42,764 --> 01:20:45,309
-Now you really won't get any.
-lt's unfair.

787
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:48,228
You can go back if you want
to get a piece.

788
01:21:20,052 --> 01:21:21,553
Fucking hand, l got you now!

789
01:22:00,717 --> 01:22:02,094
Who's your daddy now, bitch?

790
01:22:03,387 --> 01:22:04,555
Who's your fucking--

791
01:22:07,933 --> 01:22:09,852
We're here for you.
Don't worry.

792
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:13,939
-l made that ashtray!
-Really?

793
01:22:14,189 --> 01:22:15,524
You let it go again!

794
01:22:16,024 --> 01:22:16,859
Fuck you, then.

795
01:22:17,109 --> 01:22:18,735
Fine, then! You know what?

796
01:22:18,986 --> 01:22:20,779
You aren't crashing at my house.

797
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:22,489
Did you guys hear that?

798
01:22:27,619 --> 01:22:29,288
Help! Help!

799
01:22:35,169 --> 01:22:36,336
Help me!

800
01:22:45,429 --> 01:22:47,431
Bet she wins Best Costume.

801
01:22:48,265 --> 01:22:49,349
Help me!

802
01:22:53,228 --> 01:22:54,563
The hand's raising the car!

803
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:57,774
Help me!

804
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:01,320
Don't worry. We got it under control!

805
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:02,905
The fucker's got a grip.

806
01:23:09,453 --> 01:23:10,913
Hurry, please!

807
01:23:17,252 --> 01:23:20,547
Those auto-shop boys
are true artistes.

808
01:23:22,508 --> 01:23:24,301
lt's Mighty Joe Bong!

809
01:23:26,011 --> 01:23:27,095
l needs me spinach.

810
01:23:31,517 --> 01:23:32,768
l made that.

811
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:36,063
The ashtray, l'd almost believe.
But this? No way.

812
01:23:40,859 --> 01:23:43,237
Molly's about to get squished,
you bastards!

813
01:23:43,529 --> 01:23:45,989
This is important. For strength.

814
01:23:58,293 --> 01:23:59,545
There you go.

815
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,215
Now you're taking Anton-time.

816
01:24:04,007 --> 01:24:07,594
You're getting stoned with
your friends? Unbelievable!

817
01:24:40,377 --> 01:24:42,296
That's some one-hit shit there!

818
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:44,465
Don't worry.

819
01:24:45,048 --> 01:24:45,883
l'll get you down.

820
01:25:12,951 --> 01:25:13,785
That's it?

821
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:18,790
That's it?
No explosions, no hellfire, no--?

822
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:22,252
l'm glad everyone's all right.

823
01:25:22,503 --> 01:25:24,213
But that was weak.

824
01:25:24,755 --> 01:25:26,757
Well, my work here is done.

825
01:25:27,007 --> 01:25:29,802
Time for the ritualistic sex.
You coming?

826
01:25:31,053 --> 01:25:33,138
You are a pistol.

827
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,434
Hello? l'm still up here.

828
01:25:40,729 --> 01:25:41,980
Thanks, Mick.

829
01:25:43,273 --> 01:25:44,525
You're a bud.

830
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,292
Come here.

831
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:15,639
As usual...

832
01:26:15,889 --> 01:26:19,268
...marijuana saves
an otherwise disastrous day.

833
01:26:25,524 --> 01:26:27,651
l never got a hit. Light me.

834
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,705
Sweet Jesus!

835
01:26:39,955 --> 01:26:41,456
That wasn't my fault!

836
01:26:41,707 --> 01:26:44,418
That thing should've come down
a lot slower!

837
01:26:55,262 --> 01:26:56,722
What the hell.

838
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:58,182
Don't forget my bong.

839
01:26:58,432 --> 01:27:00,434
You did not make that bong.

840
01:27:00,684 --> 01:27:01,685
l arc welded it.

841
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:03,103
You don't take auto shop.

842
01:27:03,353 --> 01:27:04,813
Fuck you!

843
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,108
You coming, Anton?

844
01:27:23,874 --> 01:27:25,459
l can't even believe it.

845
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:28,170
You blew off heaven
to kick it with me.

846
01:27:28,378 --> 01:27:29,463
You are the coolest.

847
01:27:29,671 --> 01:27:33,175
You taking care of me
beats the shit out of heaven.

848
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:34,259
Really?

849
01:27:38,597 --> 01:27:40,098
Time for your meds.

850
01:27:48,565 --> 01:27:50,859
Guys! You blew off heaven too?

851
01:27:51,193 --> 01:27:53,570
No, we're your guardian angels.

852
01:27:54,905 --> 01:27:57,825
Poor thing has delirium.
Visiting hours are over.

853
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:02,955
l'll see you tomorrow, okay?

854
01:28:09,503 --> 01:28:11,964
So the deal is,
we're supposed to monitor you...

855
01:28:12,214 --> 01:28:14,925
...and make sure you don't revert
to your evil ways.

856
01:28:15,134 --> 01:28:16,969
But you seem fine now.

857
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:20,639
Let's hit the Snack Master in the hall.
You want anything?

858
01:28:20,889 --> 01:28:23,267
Get me Crunch Nuggets.
They're awesome.

859
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:29,231
Thanks, you guys.

860
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:34,278
Hit the light.

861
01:28:43,662 --> 01:28:46,540
Mick! Pnub!
Come guardian me!

862
01:28:52,546 --> 01:28:55,090
You're right.
Anton screams like a girl.

863
01:28:55,424 --> 01:28:57,968
Think we should tell him
we painted that?

864
01:28:58,886 --> 01:29:01,013
Fuck it.
Let's go walk through a nurse.

865
01:29:01,221 --> 01:29:03,599
Watch it! Some of them are guys.

866
