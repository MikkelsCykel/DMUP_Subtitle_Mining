<i>Frank just locks himself up</i>
<i>in his room... </i>

2
00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:51.122
<i>... didn't come out</i>
<i>of his villa for a long time. </i>

3
00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.786
<i>He had this theory he was gonna</i>
<i>get his hearing back... </i>

4
00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.229
<i>... by having complete silence. He</i>
<i>wanted to rest his ears completely. </i>

5
00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:00.495
<i>He hired people to bring in supplies</i>
<i>for him to the villa. </i>

6
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.231
<i>The only accounts we have</i>
<i>of Frank during this period... </i>

7
00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:05.136
...come from various drug dealers.

8
00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.970
He was in a very dark place.

9
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.348
I love you too.

10
00:06:39.188 --> 00:06:42.954
- <i>Where is Frankie Wilde today?</i>
- <i>What? I haven't</i>...

11
00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:46.891
<i>I haven't talked to him</i>
<i>in almost a year now. </i>

12
00:06:47.062 --> 00:06:50.293
<i>I've heard some stories. This guy</i>
<i>supposedly saw him in New York... </i>

13
00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:55.597
...wearing a garbage bag for a hat
and shoeboxes on his feet.

14
00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:59.605
And he... And he had a rock...

15
00:06:59.775 --> 00:07:02.539
...and he was trying to eat it
like a sandwich.

16
00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:05.976
I don't...
I don't think Frankie would do that.

17
00:07:06.148 --> 00:07:08.412
He looked like a bum.
He always looked like a bum.

18
00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.018
But he had a really special bond
with the homeless.

19
00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:48.586
Hello.

20
00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:57.489
Hello?

21
00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:58.928
Hello.

22
00:08:00.135 --> 00:08:03.571
Is this where you come if you
want to learn how to read lips?

23
00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:06.503
Of course. You want to learn?

24
00:08:10.045 --> 00:08:13.037
I've got no idea
what you're saying, darling.

25
00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:15.974
I can't hear anything.
This is the place, yeah?

26
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:31.422
They look like a couple of cunts.

27
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:43.075
I don't know how to lip read.

28
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.810
Maybe you should
write something down.

29
00:08:46.982 --> 00:08:50.440
I can't hear you, and I can't read lips.
So we need to get started somehow.

30
00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:53.520
So, maybe, write something down.

31
00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:15.407
Temper, temper.

32
00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:17.872
Watch.

33
00:09:18.047 --> 00:09:19.878
Concentrate.

34
00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:22.680
Watch my lips.

35
00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:25.481
Watch...

36
00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:27.485
...lips.

37
00:09:32.561 --> 00:09:34.290
Tongue.

38
00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:37.397
Jaw.

39
00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:42.835
One's facial expression...

40
00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:45.139
...gesture.

41
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:47.672
Lip reading...

42
00:09:47.843 --> 00:09:50.004
...is about seeing...

43
00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:51.737
...feeling.

44
00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:03.257
Fill in the blanks, Frank.

45
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.602
Stepdad.

46
00:10:25.748 --> 00:10:27.409
Husband.

47
00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:38.115
The quick brown fox.

48
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:40.585
- The.
- The.

49
00:10:40.763 --> 00:10:42.731
- Quick.
- Quick.

50
00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:45.196
- <i>Brown. </i>
- Brown.

51
00:10:45.367 --> 00:10:47.460
- <i>Fox. </i>
- Fox.

52
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.908
- <i>Jumps over the lazy... </i>
- Over the lazy dog.

53
00:10:54.076 --> 00:10:55.441
Faster.

54
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:58.011
The quick brown fox...

55
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.512
...jumps over the lazy dog.

56
00:11:00.682 --> 00:11:02.445
Good.

57
00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:04.085
Good.

58
00:11:05.187 --> 00:11:06.848
Fucking good.

59
00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:12.957
They all speak English here.

60
00:11:13.162 --> 00:11:14.561
Don't worry.

61
00:11:21.437 --> 00:11:23.701
Scotch neat, please, mate.

62
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.199
Double Scotch neat.

63
00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:32.313
- Is that okay?
- It's very good.

64
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:35.113
See what he comes back with.

65
00:11:39.588 --> 00:11:41.385
To my lips.

66
00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.255
Cheers.

67
00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:54.234
You and me got the same hobby.

68
00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:01.139
Another one?

69
00:12:03.178 --> 00:12:05.237
What can I get you?

70
00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:10.884
Scotch neat, please.

71
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.113
Double Scotch again.

72
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:19.723
In England, it means "fuck off. "
Very similar gesture.

73
00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:22.591
Fuck off. Double.

74
00:12:23.165 --> 00:12:24.530
Double fuck off.

75
00:12:24.867 --> 00:12:26.164
Waiter!

76
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.430
Double Scotch, please, mate.

77
00:12:44.786 --> 00:12:46.777
No, more.

78
00:12:49.358 --> 00:12:53.124
What do you want to drink to?
Do you want to drink to something?

79
00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:57.423
Who's Simon?

80
00:12:57.599 --> 00:12:59.066
Silence.

81
00:12:59.835 --> 00:13:03.066
- Who is he?
- Not Simon, silence.

82
00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:05.603
- Are you finished with him?
- Good.

83
00:13:05.774 --> 00:13:07.241
Great.

84
00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:05.164
I know what I could do.

85
00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.063
I know what I could do.

86
00:14:06.234 --> 00:14:07.633
I know what I could do.

87
00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:10.033
Fuck the DJ lark.

88
00:14:10.205 --> 00:14:13.902
You know on TV,
you got a little ugly bird...

89
00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:17.534
...bottom right-hand corner,
doing all this business?

90
00:14:17.713 --> 00:14:19.510
I could do that.
I could be a cool one.

91
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:22.445
A cool little fucker
in the corner of the box. I could.

92
00:14:22.618 --> 00:14:24.745
Think positively.

93
00:14:25.354 --> 00:14:27.447
Yeah. "Are you going down
to Pacha tonight?"

94
00:14:27.623 --> 00:14:31.457
"Oh, no, mate. No, I'm staying in
because Frankie Wilde's...

95
00:14:31.627 --> 00:14:34.187
...at the right-hand bottom corner
of the TV tonight...

96
00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:37.230
...doing the fucking hand jive.
It'll be brilliant. "

97
00:14:44.873 --> 00:14:46.670
You finish?

98
00:14:53.415 --> 00:14:55.144
You finish?

99
00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:59.482
There's nothing wrong
with being deaf.

100
00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:01.145
I'm deaf.

101
00:15:01.657 --> 00:15:03.352
Trust your other senses.

102
00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:06.892
Your sight,
your smell and your touch.

103
00:15:07.863 --> 00:15:09.353
Just relax.

104
00:15:10.132 --> 00:15:11.861
It will come.

105
00:15:12.234 --> 00:15:14.225
It just takes time.

106
00:15:14.536 --> 00:15:16.265
It will come.

107
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:24.606
<i>Well, Frank's system was ingenious,</i>
<i>and with the weight of his sight... </i>

108
00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:27.680
<i>... he proclaims that he began</i>
<i>to see a rhythm in everything... </i>

109
00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:30.079
...a pattern in the visual world
around him.

110
00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:32.651
<i>You know, could see music. </i>

111
00:21:58.073 --> 00:22:00.541
<i>Frankie had worked with this</i>
<i>all his life... </i>

112
00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:04.075
<i>... and then he realized</i>
<i>he was able to piece together... </i>

113
00:22:04.245 --> 00:22:07.476
<i>... those sets</i>
<i>that he used to do. And... </i>

114
00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:12.109
Hey, presto, you know,
four to the floor, returneth.

115
00:23:01.402 --> 00:23:05.304
I once stole 500 quid
from your wallet, in the studio.

116
00:23:05.473 --> 00:23:06.940
Well...

117
00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:09.972
...it's only money, eh? No big deal.

118
00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:12.204
And it was me
who stuck that scaff bar...

119
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.541
...through the windscreen
of your Merc.

120
00:23:14.716 --> 00:23:18.413
- It wasn't that Asian kid.
- Well, he's probably out now anyway...

121
00:23:18.586 --> 00:23:20.850
...so no harm done.

122
00:23:23.024 --> 00:23:24.651
I shagged Twila.

123
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:31.465
For three years.

124
00:23:47.282 --> 00:23:49.773
Because you're a mate, yeah...

125
00:23:51.085 --> 00:23:53.883
...I only ever made love
to her bum.

126
00:23:56.324 --> 00:23:58.383
She doesn't like it in the bum.

127
00:23:59.827 --> 00:24:03.024
Have a listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

128
00:24:03.198 --> 00:24:04.597
Yeah?

129
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:18.378
Open the door! Frank!

130
00:24:18.546 --> 00:24:21.037
Frank! Open the fucking door!

131
00:24:21.216 --> 00:24:23.480
Open the door! Frank!

132
00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:26.745
Frank! Open the fucking door!

133
00:24:26.921 --> 00:24:28.912
Do you want some more coffee?

134
00:24:31.759 --> 00:24:34.421
Frank! Frank! Open the door.
Open the fucking door.

135
00:24:35.763 --> 00:24:37.458
- So?
- Oh, Frank. Oh, God.

136
00:24:37.632 --> 00:24:39.099
- Yeah?
- Oh, God, it's good,

137
00:24:39.267 --> 00:24:41.201
- Fucking good.
- It's good?

138
00:24:41.369 --> 00:24:43.337
Okay, it's fucking hot.

139
00:24:43.538 --> 00:24:46.234
First off, did you...? Who's this?

140
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:48.966
Max, this is Penelope.
Penelope, this is Max.

141
00:24:49.143 --> 00:24:50.269
Hi, Max.

142
00:24:51.479 --> 00:24:52.707
Hi.

143
00:24:55.583 --> 00:24:58.575
Forget it.
Look, Did you mix this?

144
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.188
- Yeah.
- Did you produce this?

145
00:25:01.356 --> 00:25:03.722
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

146
00:25:04.058 --> 00:25:07.027
Fuck it, Frank. It's gold.
Fucking gold.

147
00:25:08.563 --> 00:25:09.757
It's beautiful.

148
00:25:09.931 --> 00:25:11.865
Tell me! I haven't heard it.

149
00:25:12.033 --> 00:25:15.935
It gets in your fucking chest. I've never
heard nothing like it. Fucking:

150
00:25:16.104 --> 00:25:18.766
Like fucking heart. It changed...

151
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.603
What...? What do you mean you
haven't heard it? What do you mean?

152
00:25:23.111 --> 00:25:25.045
Well, I haven't heard it.

153
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.506
Why?

154
00:25:29.284 --> 00:25:31.809
I'm completely deaf, Max.

155
00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:37.952
Completely?

156
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:41.086
Yeah.

157
00:25:41.596 --> 00:25:42.824
Nothing.

158
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.400
To the handicapped.

159
00:25:54.676 --> 00:25:56.007
Sorry.

160
00:25:59.847 --> 00:26:03.180
The first time I heard
<i>Hear No Evil... </i>

161
00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:06.184
...I was like, you know, "Whatever. "

162
00:26:06.354 --> 00:26:10.085
But then Max told me
Frankie's story...

163
00:26:10.325 --> 00:26:13.351
<i>... and the penny dropped. </i>

164
00:26:25.173 --> 00:26:28.404
<i>People love a good tragedy. </i>

165
00:26:28.576 --> 00:26:31.511
People love handicaps, frankly.

166
00:26:32.513 --> 00:26:34.879
It gets them emotional, you know.

167
00:26:35.049 --> 00:26:38.280
So I'll get on that deaf train
with a wheelchair ramp.

168
00:26:38.453 --> 00:26:41.718
No problem.
First-class ticket, please.

169
00:27:07.348 --> 00:27:11.307
<i>I don't see why we should limit</i>
<i>ourselves to deaf people, really. </i>

170
00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:13.977
I don't want to reveal
too much either...

171
00:27:14.255 --> 00:27:17.156
...about where we're going.
But it's gonna be big.

172
00:27:17.325 --> 00:27:19.623
It's gonna be big,
and it's gonna be handicapped.

173
00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:21.376
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

174
00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:22.958
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

175
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:24.564
They need a fucking hero, Frank.

176
00:27:24.732 --> 00:27:27.428
They don't have a fucking hero.
There's no deaf hero, huh?

177
00:27:27.602 --> 00:27:28.728
It's you, Frank.

178
00:27:29.404 --> 00:27:31.736
You're, like, the fucking link.

179
00:27:31.906 --> 00:27:36.570
You're drawing all the deaf kids
that are screaming, with no hearing.

180
00:27:36.744 --> 00:27:38.974
They're yelling out to...
Who's gonna listen?

181
00:27:39.147 --> 00:27:42.446
Not other fucking deaf kids.
They can't hear, huh? You.

182
00:27:42.617 --> 00:27:45.518
You're the fucking voice, eh?
And wait.

183
00:27:45.686 --> 00:27:48.849
Wait. You're gonna love this.

184
00:27:50.658 --> 00:27:53.684
Can you hear me?
"No, I can't hear you, Max.

185
00:27:53.861 --> 00:27:57.024
Are you trying to make me money?"
Yes. I'm making you money. Okay.

186
00:27:57.198 --> 00:27:58.495
Fuck, look...

187
00:27:58.666 --> 00:28:02.124
...that is just the fucking beginning.

188
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.351
I wouldn't put my name to any
old product. If I could describe it...

189
00:28:24.926 --> 00:28:27.019
...as bad speed in a can.

190
00:28:27.195 --> 00:28:28.856
We've all had bad speed,
haven't we?

191
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.464
I'm just gonna have a sip.
I can't resist.

192
00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.425
Fuck.

193
00:28:34.802 --> 00:28:37.771
He made disabilities cool.

194
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:42.538
What's with the fucking ear?

195
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.305
The ear, that represents
your deafness, okay.

196
00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:49.314
Deaf people hate their ears, see.
Don't they? See?

197
00:28:49.484 --> 00:28:51.509
So it's symbolic.
So you're gonna smash it.

198
00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:55.645
The deaf kids are gonna go fucking
nuts. Don't actually hit the ear...

199
00:28:55.823 --> 00:28:58.849
...because I'll put some glass on that
and turn that into a table.

200
00:28:59.026 --> 00:29:02.427
It's wank. I'm sucking
deaf cock for you, mate...

201
00:29:02.597 --> 00:29:07.398
...and I'm fucking choking on it.
- All right, first off, okay...

202
00:29:07.568 --> 00:29:09.092
...you're sucking show-biz cock.

203
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.933
But look, this is gonna be
good money. This is all about cash.

204
00:29:13.107 --> 00:29:15.871
Shitloads of cash, Frank.
And better than that...

205
00:29:16.043 --> 00:29:19.410
...Sonya can't get her grubby fingers
on this fucking money, understand?

206
00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.777
- This is Sonya-free cash.
- He's not a whore!

207
00:29:28.756 --> 00:29:30.189
Look, Frank, okay?

208
00:29:30.892 --> 00:29:33.622
You're not giving me any
fucking positive feedback.

209
00:29:33.794 --> 00:29:36.922
I need fucking... You know what really
fucking bothers me about you?

210
00:29:37.098 --> 00:29:39.328
The fact that you think art
just fucking happens.

211
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.866
It's just free.
Like these people just took out...

212
00:29:42.036 --> 00:29:44.596
...time from their fucking day
to come down here...

213
00:29:44.772 --> 00:29:47.707
...and do a bunch of shit for nothing.
What you gotta realize...

214
00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:50.309
...is you're a hero.
That's what the yellow's about.

215
00:29:50.478 --> 00:29:53.038
You make fun of me on that jacket.
I picked that jacket.

216
00:29:53.214 --> 00:29:56.012
Deaf kids all over the world
are gonna see that yellow.

217
00:29:56.183 --> 00:29:59.346
They'll run out, they'll buy that jacket.
Two, maybe $300.

218
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.420
They're gonna run around,
proudly deaf...

219
00:30:01.589 --> 00:30:04.114
...all just yellow,
fluorescently deaf...

220
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.364
Sit down.

221
00:30:21.842 --> 00:30:24.208
Charlize Bondo, <i>Ibiza Beat. </i>

222
00:30:24.378 --> 00:30:27.313
Frankie, can you really DJ
as a deaf man?

223
00:30:27.481 --> 00:30:29.312
How is that possible?

224
00:30:31.552 --> 00:30:33.816
- They murmuring?
- Yeah, quite a bit.

225
00:30:33.988 --> 00:30:35.785
I'm an honest man.

226
00:30:35.957 --> 00:30:39.017
And I can tell you
that this album was made...

227
00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:43.994
...completely without the aid
of my ears.

228
00:30:44.632 --> 00:30:49.194
And at Pacha next week,
I'll be DJ'ing as a deaf man.

229
00:30:50.972 --> 00:30:53.304
And if you don't believe me...

230
00:30:54.208 --> 00:30:56.301
...you know, fuck you...

231
00:30:57.612 --> 00:31:02.640
...because I've got nothing,
nothing to prove...

232
00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:07.379
...to you sluts at all.
- Okay. Okay. Role model.

233
00:31:08.956 --> 00:31:11.857
- Nothing.
- Wait a minute. Okay, role model.

234
00:31:12.193 --> 00:31:15.185
Listen. Listen to me. No. No.

235
00:31:15.363 --> 00:31:17.729
He loves sluts. Frank loves sluts.

236
00:31:18.332 --> 00:31:20.892
Now, I think what
he's trying to say is...

237
00:31:21.068 --> 00:31:24.094
...even though he feels
he has nothing to prove to you...

238
00:31:24.271 --> 00:31:30.540
...he'd be happy to prove
anything you want, to you.

239
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:35.871
It's important that we all realize that
this is a major comeback from a rock.

240
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:40.817
You know, what he's accomplished
in the last few months is astonishing.

241
00:31:40.988 --> 00:31:43.889
He'll be at the Pacha nightclub.
You can come down...

242
00:31:44.058 --> 00:31:46.526
...and watch him mix yourself...

243
00:31:46.694 --> 00:31:49.094
...and watch the miracle
happen, okay?

244
00:31:49.263 --> 00:31:53.563
Because, you know, I realize, okay,
that there are doubters in this room...

245
00:31:53.734 --> 00:31:56.703
...which fucks me up.
Because, you know...

246
00:31:56.871 --> 00:31:59.567
...why would someone
pretend to be deaf?

247
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.005
I mean, that's retarded.
That's ridic...

248
00:32:03.177 --> 00:32:07.637
It's not like he's fucking benefiting
from this. It's a fucking obstacle.

249
00:32:07.815 --> 00:32:10.215
He can't hear a fuck...
Your mom's a cunt. Nothing.

250
00:32:10.384 --> 00:32:13.911
Zero. Blank. This man,
what he's done, fucking...

251
00:32:14.088 --> 00:32:18.024
It gets me in my fucking heart,
what he's done. And you...

252
00:32:18.192 --> 00:32:22.253
You come down here, and you
put on this big fucking show...

253
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.455
...like he's gonna
fucking make shit up!

254
00:32:24.632 --> 00:32:26.998
Relax. Relax, man.

255
00:32:27.468 --> 00:32:29.129
All right. Next question.

256
00:32:29.503 --> 00:32:31.562
One more! One more!

257
00:32:42.616 --> 00:32:45.551
I thought it was amazing,
you know, that somebody...

258
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.121
...that's deaf can actually...
Can actually...

259
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:50.882
...you know, be a DJ.

260
00:32:51.058 --> 00:32:53.424
- Frankie Wilde, good luck.
- Good luck.

261
00:32:53.594 --> 00:32:57.860
I just think that guy is so fantastic.
He has a gift that no one else has.

262
00:32:58.032 --> 00:33:00.466
And somehow, he is gonna do it.

263
00:33:17.985 --> 00:33:20.215
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

264
00:33:27.094 --> 00:33:28.994
<i>The vibe that night</i>
<i>was incredible. </i>

265
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.991
All the memories had come back,
you know. He'd hit the depths...

266
00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:35.533
<i>... then he was just back. </i>

267
00:33:50.518 --> 00:33:52.418
Pacha, Frankie Wilde, comeback.

268
00:33:53.754 --> 00:33:55.244
"Take this. Check this out. "

269
00:33:55.422 --> 00:33:57.890
I've never seen an atmosphere
like it. It was amazing.

270
00:33:59.326 --> 00:34:01.556
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

271
00:36:02.549 --> 00:36:05.143
<i>He probably never thought</i>
<i>he'd ever feel that again. </i>

272
00:36:05.319 --> 00:36:08.186
And to come back
and actually feel that and more...

273
00:36:09.189 --> 00:36:11.817
<i>... it was a great experience. </i>
<i>Everybody in the room... </i>

274
00:36:11.992 --> 00:36:14.927
<i>... shared the same experience. </i>
<i>It was really, really special. </i>

275
00:36:15.095 --> 00:36:17.495
<i>It was kind of what</i>
<i>dance music's about, really. </i>

276
00:36:25.072 --> 00:36:27.540
He just had clubland sparking,
bigtime.

277
00:36:38.485 --> 00:36:40.885
He just took the roof
off the place. It was amazing.

278
00:36:41.055 --> 00:36:43.319
It was like
he was an even better DJ...

279
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.425
<i>... as a deaf man than he'd</i>
<i>been before. It was incredible. </i>

280
00:36:55.235 --> 00:36:58.363
Frankie! Frankie!
We won it! Listen!

281
00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:00.632
Fuck! We're the fucking champions!

282
00:37:00.808 --> 00:37:02.799
We got the fucking award!

283
00:37:03.444 --> 00:37:06.971
This is it.
This is our fucking moment!

284
00:37:08.315 --> 00:37:10.340
There's nothing... I can't... Fuck.

285
00:37:10.517 --> 00:37:12.144
What do you wanna do,
buy the moon?

286
00:37:12.319 --> 00:37:15.720
We'll buy the moon! Doesn't matter.
You don't understand, it's huge.

287
00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:17.413
Hold on.

288
00:37:24.365 --> 00:37:26.697
Okay, they're gonna come in.
Fifteen minutes.

289
00:37:26.867 --> 00:37:28.858
They all wanna talk to you.
Fifteen minutes.

290
00:37:29.036 --> 00:37:31.402
Fifteen minutes, Frank.
This is a big moment.

291
00:37:31.572 --> 00:37:34.439
Listen, it's important.
Fifteen minutes. That's all they need.

292
00:37:34.608 --> 00:37:36.576
Tomorrow,
big, fucking press conference.

293
00:37:36.744 --> 00:37:39.372
That's what we're gonna do.
Very important, okay?

294
00:37:39.546 --> 00:37:40.979
- You have to watch.
- Max?

295
00:37:41.148 --> 00:37:43.412
- What? What?
- Can you do me a favor, mate?

296
00:37:43.584 --> 00:37:45.552
Anything. Anything.

297
00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:47.516
Could you leave us alone
for 10 minutes?

298
00:37:47.688 --> 00:37:50.156
No. See, you're not listening.
Okay, listen to me.

299
00:37:50.324 --> 00:37:51.916
Look at my lips, okay? Okay?

300
00:37:52.092 --> 00:37:55.220
They come in for 15 minutes
of your life. Fifteen minutes.

301
00:37:55.496 --> 00:37:57.589
Fifteen fucking minutes. Frank.

302
00:37:57.765 --> 00:38:00.563
No, no, no, no. Frank, no.
No. Frank.

303
00:38:02.503 --> 00:38:05.199
Frank, 10 minutes. Ten minutes.

304
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:08.965
Ten minutes.

305
00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.804
Sure. Okay.

306
00:38:14.982 --> 00:38:19.043
Yeah. Fucking sure.
What the fuck do I know?

307
00:38:33.967 --> 00:38:35.867
Okay, now. All right, now.
Calm down.

308
00:38:36.036 --> 00:38:38.163
Okay, you're getting in, buddy.
Don't worry.

309
00:38:38.338 --> 00:38:41.830
You I used to like. All right.
You could do with some cheering up.

310
00:38:42.009 --> 00:38:44.910
All right. Okay. Hold on. Okay.

311
00:38:48.482 --> 00:38:50.211
Frankie?

312
00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:53.450
Frankie!

313
00:39:05.799 --> 00:39:07.699
Jesus Christ.

314
00:39:19.546 --> 00:39:21.013
Frankie!

315
00:39:26.019 --> 00:39:28.010
Frank! Fuck.

316
00:40:20.374 --> 00:40:23.935
There was like a flat line.

317
00:40:24.411 --> 00:40:26.208
It was...

318
00:40:27.114 --> 00:40:29.378
Still, to this day, I'm...

319
00:40:31.752 --> 00:40:34.983
That was it, gone.
Frankie Wilde, bye-bye. Gone.

320
00:40:35.656 --> 00:40:37.954
And everybody was like that:
Holding the baby.

321
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:10.913
<i>I've heard a story that he's running</i>
<i>a record shop in Oxford</i>.

322
00:41:11.091 --> 00:41:14.618
There's a story that he went to Fiji
and then died of syphilis.

323
00:41:14.795 --> 00:41:17.730
But nobody knows. You know,
I don't know where he is.

324
00:41:18.065 --> 00:41:21.762
He was another deaf guy
with a deaf guy's needs.

325
00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:24.667
And he went off...

326
00:41:24.838 --> 00:41:27.033
...to a quiet place.

327
00:41:27.407 --> 00:41:29.932
Although, I suppose that
wouldn't make much difference.
