1
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:37,613
It's on.

2
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,775
You the new guy, Davis?

3
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,041
No, no, no way.

4
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,481
I'm the guy
here to ice the floor for skating.

5
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:58,884
Hope you're better
than the last guy.

6
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,079
DAVIS:
What's wrong with him?

7
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,357
Couldn't take the heat.

8
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:05,619
Yeah, well, I'm fireproof.

9
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,389
Short on self-discipline?

10
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,438
Bobby Fischer would be
proud of that move.

11
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,699
You got no way out now, pal.

12
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,776
So where's the big tamale?
Coming.

13
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,005
Just relax.

14
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,244
That's a quick way to go deaf.

15
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,176
What'd you say?

16
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,845
That's a quick way to go deaf.

17
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,424
You winning?
I never lose.

18
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,766
All right, let's get on with it.

19
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:54,570
It's a two-step contract.
Everything you need to know is there.

20
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,735
Memorize it.
By tomorrow morning.

21
00:04:56,913 --> 00:05:00,007
After that, it'll corrupt
and nuke your hard drive.

22
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,609
Great.

23
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,813
You're Davis.

24
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:08,753
I didn't think you knew I was here.
I knew.

25
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,119
Something wrong?

26
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:12,090
I don't see-

27
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,123
There's no exit strategy.

28
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,561
The operation has
been planned in detail.

29
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,961
I'm glad
you're confident.

30
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,728
But if we need to abort
or if we miss the target-

31
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,167
We're not gonna miss.

32
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,239
You intending to miss?

33
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,741
Not me.
I can't vouch for anyone else.

34
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,276
I can.

35
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:36,115
We travel on separate airlines.
IDs and tickets from Turner.

36
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:38,310
DAVIS: First class?
Coach.

37
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,080
I bet you're going first.

38
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,622
Yeah, but I'm the big tamale.
Remember?

39
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,754
All right, that's all.

40
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,931
Oh, hell, I can't believe it.

41
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,197
Problem?
He got me. Checkmate.

42
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,387
Good play!

43
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:28,533
Come on, Matty,
keep your head down.

44
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,139
Attaboy, Matty.

45
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,477
Turn two.

46
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,954
Hey, come on,
sit down.

47
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,192
What do you have to say
for yourself?

48
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,995
Nothing, Dad.
What do you want me to say?

49
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,468
To start with? Apology.

50
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,473
An apology to who?
Your teammates, to me.

51
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,308
Lucky you got off
with a three-day suspension.

52
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,379
Lucky?
Yes, you're lucky.

53
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,016
Dad, it's not a big deal.
Everybody smokes pot these days.

54
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,652
Oh, don't give me that bullshit,
Chris. Do I look like a chump?

55
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,118
You know I don't care what
other kids do. You're my son.

56
00:07:57,994 --> 00:08:00,155
I know what this is about.

57
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:01,925
It's about your mother.

58
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,161
Whatever.

59
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,303
Chris, let me just-
Okay,

60
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:11,804
let's just get it over with right
now! Tell me everything I do wrong.

61
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,168
Knock yourself out,
okay?

62
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:15,708
I'm trying to tell you I understa-
Stop trying to help me!

63
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:18,472
Stop wearing that stupid pink wristband
like it's gonna make any difference.

64
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:21,515
You can't do anything
about anything.

65
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,943
Why do you keep
pretending like you can? You can't.

66
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,182
It wasn't all right, Dad.

67
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:33,217
You said when she was sick
it was gonna be all right...

68
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:38,099
...and it wasn't.

69
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,554
Lydel Hammond?
Take a look at this.

70
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:07,894
I got better pictures than these,
Mr. Hammond. Know what I mean?

71
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,862
My wife hired you.
Of course she did.

72
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:14,298
Do you know who my father is?
That's why we're talking to you.

73
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,165
Thought maybe
you could make a better deal.

74
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:18,569
What's it gonna cost me?
Well...

75
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:32,814
You're gonna be late for school.
No, I'm playing hooky.

76
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,355
You're playing hooky?
Yep.

77
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:38,383
Hey, listen I thought, you and
I, we could do something together,

78
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,426
you know?
Something you like doing.

79
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,022
Well, the cop took all my reefers,
Dad.

80
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,327
Well, besides that,
you know?

81
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,704
What about camping?

82
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,399
You like camping?
That's not the point, you like it.

83
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,943
You loved that Outward Bound
thing you did.

84
00:09:58,281 --> 00:09:59,339
What do you say?

85
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,447
I don't think you're serious.

86
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,884
So what do you do for a living, Mr...

87
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,789
...Ellwood?
I sell computer equipment.

88
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,293
Peripherals, we call it.

89
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,863
Not computers,
but the stuff that goes with it.

90
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,001
You know, cables, software,

91
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,796
mini storage systems,
things like that.

92
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,906
I'm afraid it's not very interesting.
Oh, no.

93
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,668
It's fascinating.

94
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,937
Right. There we are, Mr. Ellwood.

95
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:33,673
Utilities included, rent due
on the first of the month.

96
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,249
Very good, thank you.
You get use of the garage.

97
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,944
There's an electric opener
on the shelf in the kitchen.

98
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,589
Trash service
Mondays and Thursdays.

99
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:43,657
Good luck.
Thank you very much.

100
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,491
Act one is complete.

101
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,224
No problems?
That's correct.

102
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,029
Good.
Curtain going up on act two.

103
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,310
I wasn't talking to her at all.

104
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,276
She wanted to give me her number.

105
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,076
I said, "Sorry, honey.
I already got a girlfriend.

106
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,810
Great girl.
That's her, just over there. "

107
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,838
Whoa, did you see that?

108
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,688
Stay back, man.

109
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,489
Auto accident.
No kidding.

110
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,185
You got any more?
No, other guy's a pile of ash.

111
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:57,799
Vitals are stable on this one.
Did he say anything on the way in?

112
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,628
No, he was out of it
when I got to him.

113
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,133
Okay.

114
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:05,706
Doctor?

115
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:08,043
Call security.

116
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,888
How you feeling?

117
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:22,421
My name's Wainwright.

118
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:25,253
Ed Wainwright. Chief of Police.

119
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:30,491
Come on, guy drove straight at me.
Oh, sure, yeah. It's not that.

120
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:32,894
Your gun?

121
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,967
We did a little checking.

122
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,268
Tried to get in touch
with Robert Ellwood's next of kin.

123
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,002
Turns out he didn't have any.

124
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,511
And he died when he was three.

125
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,907
Ran a set of your prints,
Mr. Carden.

126
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:53,612
Apparently, you've been
missing in action for many years.

127
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:57,115
But you're not missing anymore,
Mr. Carden.

128
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,794
Not too often we get somebody
your caliber up here in our little burg.

129
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,161
You know, frankly, Frank,
I can't think of anybody-

130
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,632
Hey, frankly, Frank.

131
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,395
Is that- Is that a pun?

132
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:13,305
It's an alliteration, chief, not a pun.
Yeah, well, anyway.

133
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,034
So come on, Frank,

134
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,476
what are you doing around here?
When are they coming for me?

135
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:31,154
I'm gonna have two men here all night.

136
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:34,427
Just for you, Mr. Carden.

137
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,326
Keep your eyes open.
I'll be back in the morning.

138
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,062
Sure, chief.

139
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:16,532
What in the hell is it can't
wait for an hour and a half?

140
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:20,903
Cops in the Northwest picked up
this guy in some kind of accident.

141
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,634
Better be good.

142
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,403
Well, I ran his prints
through a database.

143
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,447
Got a match
with a Major Frank Carden

144
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,810
from his military records.

145
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:30,849
Frank Carden?
You know him?

146
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,609
No.

147
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,780
He was Defense of Intelligence,
MIA in 1974.

148
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,189
Take it he didn't die in the accident?
No, he's in the hospital.

149
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,352
Somebody hit
the Homeland Security button.

150
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,327
The FBl has gotten all excited.

151
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,831
The other agencies are lining up
behind us.

152
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,969
This guy is a hot potato.

153
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:50,027
Is he?

154
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,502
Just about everyone seems
to ring alarm bells these days.

155
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,974
All right. Let me know
when he gets here.

156
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,476
Sure.

157
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,843
See you later.

158
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:06,651
Yes.
Miles.

159
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,153
What have you got? Is it him?

160
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,621
Yes. It's definitely Carden.

161
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:12,192
FBl liaison officer
just came by to tell me.

162
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,921
I don't want this going any further.
No, sir.

163
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,588
It won't get out of hand.
I'm on top of it.

164
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,105
DAVIS:
How do you know that?

165
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:36,615
He called me.
DAVIS: He called you?

166
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,719
How did he manage that?
Ask him later.

167
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,151
We're gonna have to improvise.
Okay, rule one.

168
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:42,483
We don't go back
for him.

169
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:44,626
We leave him down.
That's not rule one.

170
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:47,125
Same for any of us.
What are you talking about?

171
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,059
The old man got caught,
that's his problem.

172
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,098
This is Frank's command. We've
been with him a long time.

173
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,360
Yeah, everybody but you.
Ever hear of loyalty?

174
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,436
Yeah, I read about it
in a book once. Look,

175
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,368
I'm not getting paid
to save his ass.

176
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,304
You're not getting paid
unless we save his ass.

177
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:02,967
You know that offshore account?

178
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:04,703
Only Frank can access it.

179
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,211
No Frank,

180
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,009
no money.

181
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:13,615
Now, you see, that argument
appeals to my sentimental side.

182
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,952
Local celebrities and officials
are reported to be lobbying for seats

183
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,424
at a dinner for the president,
to be held following

184
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,995
his upcoming speech
at Woodburn College.

185
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:23,153
Morning.

186
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:24,924
Morning.
Death has been reported

187
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,069
of a well-known local personality,
Lydel Hammond, Jr.,

188
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,501
in what appears to be
a hit-and-run accident

189
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,231
outside the Rosemont Apartments.

190
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,275
Reporter Melanie Stewart...
We're really doing this, aren't we?

191
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,880
No, I figured we'd just wake up,
make breakfast and go back to bed.

192
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:42,484
MELANIE Lydel Hammond, Jr. is the
son of the reclusive billionaire.

193
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,882
Hammond Sr. is expected to make
a rare public appearance

194
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,649
at the funeral of his son
in a few days.

195
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,759
That's the same Hammond
as the street, right?

196
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,861
Yeah.
And the stadium.

197
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,724
Yep.
- Hammond Sr., a contributor

198
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,331
to the current administration,

199
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,900
has caused an embarrassment
recently, by his alleged support

200
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,938
of direct action, violence,
against doctors and scientists

201
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,598
involved in stem-cell research.

202
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,449
Sorry about the cuffs, Frank.
Rules, you know?

203
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,246
Yeah, sure.

204
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,480
Can't be too careful, can we?

205
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,559
STANFIELD: So what are you
doing around here, Frank?

206
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,391
Nice part of the country.

207
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,156
I like the scenery.

208
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,359
Well, take a good, long look.

209
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,059
Might be your last chance.

210
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,169
CHRIS:
So the team lost, huh?

211
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:44,705
Yeah.

212
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,404
Again.

213
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,041
Again.

214
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:55,216
You know, we showed up. We tried.
That's what important, isn't it, Chris?

215
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,086
You ever wonder
about your coaching ability?

216
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:02,458
No, that's not
what I'm wondering about.

217
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:20,739
So you ready?

218
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,009
Yep.
Okay.

219
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,486
Sure we don't need
that map?

220
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:33,185
I told you I know this area, okay?
All right, all right, all right.

221
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,472
CHRIS: Yeah, but it's just
the same as your alcohol,

222
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,707
and your beer-
Good point, but so what?

223
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,647
I don't want you drinking, either.
It's legal in some countries.

224
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,651
It's not legal here.
It could be.

225
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,382
That's true, but it isn't.
So you've never tried it?

226
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,391
I didn't say that. I tried it. I
didn't like it. Didn't like the crowd.

227
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,962
They were a bunch of losers. Pot
makes you stupid, lowers your IQ.

228
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:10,860
So you smoked it
more than I did, huh?

229
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,557
Very funny.

230
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,501
MICHAELS:
Yeah, I don't like it.

231
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,573
RODRIGUES: What exactly
don't you like about it?

232
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,141
I don't like to read
while I'm watching a movie.

233
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:23,642
You get used to it.

234
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:26,212
It's all right for you.
You speak Spanish.

235
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:29,441
Not that well.
I still have to read the subtitles.

236
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:33,379
Face it. You just don't wanna watch
a foreign film, that's all.

237
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,853
Yeah,
I just wanna watch.

238
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:38,857
If I wanna read,
I buy a book.

239
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,638
Christ. Give him a hand, will you?

240
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,139
Hey, you're blocking
the whole road.

241
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:06,486
Go!

242
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,634
You-!

243
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:49,092
You sure there's no
alternative pay arrangements?

244
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,825
You and Davis get down
there. Royko, get rid of that.

245
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,468
RAy: I thought these old
bridges were supposed to be built

246
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:40,081
over gorges and canyons
and things, you know?

247
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:42,375
CHRIS: You've been watching
too many old movies on TV.

248
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You remember that one, Gunga Din?

249
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:47,547
Where they had the elephant
and it was crossing that-

250
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,487
Chris.
What?

251
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:56,230
Come on.

252
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,277
All right. Give me your hand.

253
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,885
I got you.

254
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,755
I got you. Come on.

255
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,289
Okay.

256
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,298
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

257
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:37,699
My prisoner.

258
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:41,001
My prisoner. Keys.

259
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,343
Take custody.

260
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:48,210
My gun. Gun.

261
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:55,717
Call 911.

262
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,518
Don't let him go.

263
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:59,523
Don't let him go.

264
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:05,559
Mister?

265
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,906
DAVIS:
It's a big waste of time.

266
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:15,976
Carden's got nine lives,
didn't you know?

267
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,972
You wanna point that thing
somewhere else?

268
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,516
Chris.

269
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,115
Chris!

270
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,656
Get your phone out of your
backpack. Call 911 right now.

271
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,688
Just stay-
Just stay there, mister.

272
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,331
Hang back. Hang back.
All right.

273
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,991
There's no service.

274
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:45,567
We're gonna walk to the highway.
The phone is gonna work there.

275
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,607
That's what we're gonna do.
Listen. You'd be wise to let me go.

276
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:51,109
You try to bring me in,
you're both gonna die.

277
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,941
How's that?
My men are following.

278
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:56,744
Ex-military. They'll be here soon.

279
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,081
Listen to me.
Hey, stay back.

280
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:01,745
Stay back, man!
Listen, will you?

281
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,686
Let me go.

282
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,019
Stay here for an hour
and then go home.

283
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,424
It's the best choice.
It's your only choice.

284
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:09,689
Dad.

285
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,800
He's right. Let's just let
him go. We've got the gun.

286
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,526
He not gonna hurt us.
Just let him go.

287
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,034
Be quiet.

288
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,569
What's your name, son?

289
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:20,768
Chris.
Chris is right.

290
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,876
Let me go.

291
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,415
Look, you look like a nice guy.

292
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,974
What's your name?

293
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:34,251
He's Ray.
Ray.

294
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:37,147
You don't wanna
be involved in this.

295
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,156
You're way out of your depth.

296
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:42,421
You said the wrong thing, mister.
What?

297
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:45,065
He'll dig his toes in now.

298
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,159
We're gonna go up
to the highway.

299
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,497
Chris, you stay
behind me.

300
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:51,661
You...

301
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,105
You stay in front of me
the whole way.

302
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,672
All right, let's go.

303
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,646
Come on.

304
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,781
Go.

305
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,969
Holy cow.

306
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,097
Dispatch.

307
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,743
MILES:
They can't have just vanished.

308
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,003
Well, they seem to have.

309
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:33,340
It's unlikely he'll be
working alone.

310
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:34,743
What gives you that idea?

311
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,578
We've got a lunch.
See what you can find out.

312
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:44,782
Chris, give me that phone.

313
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,552
Keep moving.

314
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,395
Come on, come on,
come on.

315
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,167
Great.

316
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:01,070
Told you.

317
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,108
That's the end of him.

318
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,178
Carden's still in that car.

319
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:09,078
Underwater.
Maybe.

320
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,616
Maybe?

321
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:14,817
Maybe not.

322
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:20,555
Three people walked off over there.

323
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:23,027
One's a woman, maybe a kid.

324
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:33,205
Shit, man,
I hate scenery.

325
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:40,081
Dad, we're
- We're close. The parking area's just down there.

326
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:45,775
Chris, run ahead.

327
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:48,286
He'll have a radio. Just
tell him to call the police.

328
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:50,981
Tell him what happened. Go ahead.
That's not good idea.

329
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,389
Just- I wasn't asking
your advice. Go.

330
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:58,660
Let's keep going.

331
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:13,640
Car went over the embankment,
into the river, about a half-mile up.

332
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,715
Sounds bad.
The current'll pull it down here.

333
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,283
May still be somebody inside.

334
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:19,420
Listen, can you guys help?
We can take the trail.

335
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,748
It's only mile or so
down the river from here.

336
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:23,117
Did you report it?

337
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,622
Yeah, I called it in.

338
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,261
Chris?

339
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,907
Dad.
What's wrong?

340
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,167
Dad. They shot him.

341
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,106
What?
They shot him.

342
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:44,336
On the parking lot.
Who?

343
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,173
They shot him.
Take a deep breath.

344
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:47,645
Take a deep breath.
What happened?

345
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:48,805
Where are you now?

346
00:27:48,983 --> 00:27:50,109
JOHNSON
Enjoying the hike.

347
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:51,479
They must be near you.

348
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,018
No one here yet.

349
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:55,850
Well, just wait.
They'll show up.

350
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,218
They'd better.

351
00:27:57,392 --> 00:28:00,156
You sure it's them?
I mean, it could have been anyone.

352
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:03,058
Couple of fag nature lovers.

353
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:06,223
From the river? It's them.

354
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,260
I told you you were in too deep.

355
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,114
All right.
Just let me think.

356
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:25,318
We can go up he-

357
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,885
Those your friends?

358
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,424
Okay.

359
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,469
All right.
We're gonna go that way.

360
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,906
Just do it. Go.

361
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:49,168
Dad?
Where are we going?

362
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:51,039
Away from here.

363
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,304
Come on, faster. Faster.

364
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:56,410
They never got to the airport.

365
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,518
Yeah, that was the message.

366
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:04,151
You think it was them
that went over?

367
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,022
Could be. Unlikely they'd stop for a
turkey dinner and a couple of drinks.

368
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,025
DAVIS: What have you done with them?

369
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,395
Well, where's Carden?
Never made it here.

370
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:16,768
You said there were three of them
on the trail.

371
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:19,406
Yeah, they were.
They must have gone off the trail.

372
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:21,435
They must've seen us.

373
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,516
Gunga Din's
found something.

374
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,885
They went that way.

375
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:39,993
Gunga Din was a water
carrier, not a tracker.

376
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:42,186
They were right here.
You didn't see them?

377
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,763
You need to back off, Davis.
Why don't you open your eyes?

378
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,766
We got problem? We got a problem?
Shut up!

379
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:50,496
That truck driver reported the
accident. We're gonna have company.

380
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:53,072
This screw-up's growing by the
minute. We should cut and run.

381
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,004
We got a big payday coming.

382
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:56,734
Yeah.
They can't be too far ahead.

383
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,105
We're going after them.

384
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,747
Get rid of that van.
I'll do it.

385
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:01,904
Why?

386
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,252
I like driving.

387
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:08,053
Whatever, man.

388
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:09,912
Go on.

389
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:14,586
What makes you think
we'll see him again?

390
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:15,751
Who cares if we don't?

391
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,898
His cupidity will overrule
his qualms.

392
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:22,432
Yeah, I suppose that mean
he only wants his money, right?

393
00:30:22,604 --> 00:30:24,834
Right. Come on.

394
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,436
Pick it up, Chris.

395
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:31,772
Come on.
Come on.

396
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,572
Come on, move.

397
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:04,834
MILES That you, Davis?
Yeah. They're looking for Carden.

398
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,310
Can you talk?
Yeah.

399
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:08,210
Get rid of Carden.

400
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:10,841
What?
He has to go, understand?

401
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:13,078
Yeah.
Can you do it?

402
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:16,655
Well, it's possible. It won't be easy.
Half a million.

403
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,427
How much?
You heard me. Half a million.

404
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,822
You got my attention now.
Okay. All right.

405
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,750
RAy:
This isn't looking good, Chris.

406
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:52,154
You got any idea
where we're going yet?

407
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,919
CHRIS:
Yeah.

408
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:56,120
That's where they
dropped us off for orienteering.

409
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:57,423
RAy:
You sure?

410
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,863
Yeah.
Yeah?

411
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:01,357
They got any roads there?

412
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,232
Got a Denny's, a Pancake
House, coffee shop, anything?

413
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:06,771
There's a firebreak road
not too far on the other side.

414
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:08,932
Yeah?
Yeah, I...

415
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,873
I got there first out of everybody.

416
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,603
Did you?
Listen.

417
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:15,777
Leave me here, you keep going.

418
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,885
They'll find me and you'll be gone.
No.

419
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:22,215
Dad, you know what happened
to the guy up in the parking lot.

420
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,224
We- They'll follow us and-
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

421
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:31,093
Till we're safe, you're with us.
Let's move.

422
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,198
What's your name, anyway?

423
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,635
Carden. My name
is Frank Carden.

424
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,831
I'm really sorry
I met you.

425
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,944
Not yet, sport. Not yet.

426
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:45,875
We got a body
down here, chief.

427
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,607
It's Stanfield.
ED Drowned?

428
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:53,584
Drowned, shot, broken legs,
you name it. He's mess.

429
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,799
I got bad feeling your kid's lost, Ray.

430
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:13,099
I'm not lost.

431
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:14,798
We gotta go back.

432
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:17,103
Dad, I'm not lost.
We can get down right here.

433
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,803
We can't do this. It's impossible.
Dad, come on.

434
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:22,643
Don't argue with me, Chris.
Shut up, Dad, and listen to me.

435
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:25,684
For once, just listen to me.
Aggressive kid, Ray.

436
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,946
There's a way.
You don't know it, I do, all right?

437
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:30,784
We did it on Outward Bound
and this is it. It's right down here.

438
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:34,860
You did that in the rain?
CHRIS: No, but it was easy.

439
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:37,827
Once we get down there, there's
grabs and footholds cut into the rock.

440
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,467
Yeah, well, you were
tied together by a rope

441
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:42,535
and you had a guide, am I right?

442
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,103
Yeah, but...

443
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,638
Look,
I know we can do this.

444
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,413
Look, if you've got a death wish,

445
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,145
I can think of
less painful ways to die, Ray.

446
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,026
Let's check it out.

447
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,792
I can't manage
with these cuffs.

448
00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:16,462
If you try anything...

449
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,161
I'm gonna be
right behind you.

450
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,671
I swear to Christ,
I'll push you right off that ledge.

451
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:21,968
What are you,
a cop?

452
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,010
Used to be. Not now.
I teach high-school gym.

453
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,046
Jesus.
Must be a tough school.

454
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,739
Slowly, Chris, slowly.

455
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,279
Whoa!

456
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:09,446
Chris! You okay?
CHRIS: Yeah.

457
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,518
I'm okay.

458
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,610
Hell, man.
Did they double back?

459
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:41,914
No, we'd have seen them.
They must've gone on.

460
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:43,954
Well,
I don't see how.

461
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:48,027
All right. All right.

462
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:50,357
I got you. I got you.

463
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:51,623
There's a cave over there.

464
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,015
Ready?

465
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:16,247
Okay. Okay. Come on.
Come on, come on.

466
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:19,549
Chris.
Dad!

467
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:21,558
Dad! Dad!

468
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,658
Hold on to him!
Get me up!

469
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,257
Turner.

470
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,765
What?
I think I heard something.

471
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,735
Find the toehold.

472
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,098
I got you.

473
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,641
Keep calm, keep calm.

474
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,842
Come on.

475
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:51,488
That's it.
Hold on, Chris. Hold on. He's got you.

476
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:56,457
All right, here we are.

477
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,916
Chris, will you help me, please?

478
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,201
Stop. Just stop.

479
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:43,000
Get up. Get the fuck off my dad.

480
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:47,536
Give me the gun.

481
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,474
No.

482
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:01,156
Okay, take up the slack.

483
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,092
That's good.

484
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,459
Keep it coming.

485
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:09,030
No sign of Carden, eh?

486
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,194
Nah, just the two feds.

487
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,203
One of them's still in there.

488
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,363
Yeah.

489
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,477
Well, thanks. Who's
this Carden guy, anyway?

490
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:21,706
All I know is he's pretty
important to some folks in D.C.

491
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,144
Think he's a terrorist?

492
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:24,978
No. Doubt it.

493
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,086
He looked ordinary enough.

494
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:30,712
Yeah, but isn't that what those guys
look like? Ordinary, just like us.

495
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:35,225
Like me, maybe.
Nothing ordinary about you, Maury.

496
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,324
Tell you one thing.
What's that?

497
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,128
We play this right, we'll be getting
our pictures in the paper.

498
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,328
Let's set up for a wide shot
of the car,

499
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:46,097
and then we'll get
my close-up.

500
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,906
I'm back. Where are you clowns?

501
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,980
JOHNSON 40.083 north.
Yeah.

502
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:56,582
25.55 west.

503
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,845
Okay.

504
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:28,081
You'll have to manage.
I'm not taking those off again.

505
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,181
Can't blame me
for trying.

506
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,486
You're pretty tough for an old guy.

507
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:42,162
Military training.

508
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:46,298
What's this all about?
What do they want you for?

509
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,701
Caught me smoking
in a restaurant.

510
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:53,867
Pretty serious about that
these days, you know?

511
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:58,436
Who are the guys
who are following us?

512
00:39:58,612 --> 00:39:59,806
Friends.

513
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:01,746
Not your friends.

514
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:09,255
So you teach gym?
Yeah.

515
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:13,591
And he coaches baseball
and basketball in the winter.

516
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,251
Really?

517
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:18,155
I like baseball.

518
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,824
CHRIS:
So what exactly do you do, mister?

519
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,203
Honestly.

520
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,733
I'm an exterminator.

521
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,037
Exterminat-
You mean, like, termites?

522
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,341
No, not exactly.

523
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,079
I'm contracted to eliminate...

524
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:46,082
Well, let's call them
obstacles to progress.

525
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:50,461
"Obstacles to progress. "

526
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:52,861
So you're just a mercenary?

527
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:56,067
Doesn't matter
who you "exterminate"?

528
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,865
There are limits.

529
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,208
Haven't found them yet.

530
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:04,105
He's not serious, is he, Dad?

531
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,571
No, he's full of shit.

532
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:08,442
Probably caught him
for insider trading.

533
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,945
I don't know.

534
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:13,413
Look how he
stopped me from falling.

535
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:15,277
That was just a reflex.

536
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,517
Wouldn't get
too sentimental about it.

537
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,454
Oh, I'm not getting
sentimental about it.

538
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:22,559
I think I know
what you're capable of.

539
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:34,167
Stopping
for a picnic.

540
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,477
We lost the trail.
You sure they came through here?

541
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:40,072
Sure, I'm sure.

542
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:44,081
By tomorrow, every cop
from the state gonna be here.

543
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,240
Three U.S. Marshals dead?

544
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,910
Shit, man, they're gonna
look for us under every stone.

545
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,282
What's up, Royko?

546
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,582
You wanna quit?

547
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,225
I don't know, man.

548
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:54,156
I don't know.
Johnson.

549
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:58,163
Think I can pick up the trail
in the morning.

550
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,361
We all know
what you wanna do.

551
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:02,695
I say we go on.

552
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:06,071
We'll find him.
Now, that's a change, Davis.

553
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,366
What you about, man?

554
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,566
The sweet stench of money.

555
00:42:09,743 --> 00:42:11,210
That's it.

556
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:12,936
Now let's give Gunga Din a chance.

557
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,311
We'll pick up his trail
in the morning.

558
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,794
ROBBINS: Who's Wainwright?
That'd be me.

559
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,735
ROBBINS: Chuck Robbins,
U.S. Marshal's Office.

560
00:42:36,904 --> 00:42:38,531
How do you do?
ROBBINS: Gordon Jennings.

561
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:40,765
Mr. Jennings.
Gwen Miles from D.C.

562
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:42,772
Ma'am.
Gwen.

563
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:44,376
Anything new for us, fellas?

564
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:47,039
Well, the boys
found some tracks.

565
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:48,647
JENNINGS:
What sort of tracks?

566
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:53,185
Three people leading away from the
river where Stanfield was found.

567
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:54,610
Carden?

568
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:55,914
Possible.

569
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,115
What about the other two?

570
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,124
Forgot my crystal ball.

571
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:01,283
Thanks, chief.

572
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:02,793
You're welcome.

573
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:06,262
You gentlemen, the FBl will be taking
over the crime scene, thank you.

574
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,066
What?
If that's what you want.

575
00:43:08,235 --> 00:43:09,327
That's what we want.

576
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,404
The U.S. Marshals
will handle the search.

577
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,837
Well, that just leaves us
to get coffee then, doesn't it?

578
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:16,803
Be great if you
could arrange some.

579
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:19,878
Double espresso,
decaf, no sugar.

580
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,581
Two.

581
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:30,952
Wow. FBl.

582
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:34,583
Don't say that out loud, Maury,
or they'll think you're a hick.

583
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,632
Chris, wake up.

584
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:45,863
Chris.
Why don't you let him sleep?

585
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,473
What is it,
6:00 in the morning?

586
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:49,370
We're going.

587
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:52,776
Oh, I got
a cramp.

588
00:43:52,946 --> 00:43:55,141
I'm sorry to
hear that, Frank.

589
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:57,250
What about breakfast?

590
00:43:57,518 --> 00:43:59,918
This look like
the Hilton to you?

591
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:13,664
I told you, there's no point
in coming here.

592
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:15,267
They must've doubled back.

593
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,461
Wouldn't you have seen them?
Maybe not.

594
00:44:17,638 --> 00:44:18,764
DAVIS:
Oh, Jesus.

595
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:21,464
If I'd been here, we'd have them now.
How do you figure that?

596
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,872
Because I wouldn't
have lost them.

597
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:26,539
Can I shoot him?

598
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:28,682
Not yet. Hey, Davis?

599
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,008
Don't go entering
any charm competitions.

600
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:32,413
You'd never
make the cut.

601
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:37,389
Hey.

602
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:45,091
Shit.

603
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,563
They must have
parachuted down.

604
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:50,833
They went down here.

605
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,262
Carden could be
anywhere by now.

606
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,566
He could be dead.

607
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:57,233
Don't make any assumptions
about Frank Carden.

608
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:58,742
JENNINGS:
Why not?

609
00:44:58,912 --> 00:45:00,573
They usually turn out to be wrong.

610
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:02,511
Oh, do they?

611
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,713
You don't know him, do you?

612
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:07,410
Got his file.
And?

613
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:09,852
Defense Intelligence
used him on covert ops.

614
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:11,149
As what, an assassin or...?

615
00:45:11,325 --> 00:45:12,815
He wasn't delivering pizzas.

616
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:16,620
No expresso.

617
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:19,055
Your sugar.

618
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:21,959
Cream.

619
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:23,692
Lousy?

620
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,733
Lousy.

621
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:29,137
Donuts.
No.

622
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,841
Thanks, chief.

623
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:37,676
Pardon me.
Come on.

624
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,143
MILES: You know the worst
thing about all this?

625
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,480
What?

626
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:45,523
You leave the East Coast,
coffee's no good, food's all sugar.

627
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,155
So why is Carden here?

628
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,096
The president of the United States
is coming to Woodburn tomorrow.

629
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:00,035
You think the president's the target?
Maybe.

630
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:01,401
Why not?

631
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:04,336
Okay, so who wants
to take out the president?

632
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:06,640
You're kidding.

633
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:26,096
RAy:
Keep going, Chris. Keep going.

634
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:27,927
He'll come back, don't worry.

635
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,568
I wouldn't count on that too much.

636
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:30,930
Why's that?

637
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:33,698
Well, my men would have figured
out their mistake by now.

638
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,842
They won't be far behind us.

639
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:38,170
One of them's
a professional tracker.

640
00:46:38,345 --> 00:46:40,506
Trained in Australia
by aboriginals.

641
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,876
Frank. Frank.
You know those aboriginals- Huh?

642
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,381
Shut up.

643
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:13,737
Time like this,
you're playing chess.

644
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,677
I'm gonna get this guy.

645
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:17,680
DAVIS: Pussy game.
Shit.

646
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:19,910
You and I finally agree
on something, Davis.

647
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:24,651
Let's move.

648
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:26,759
Take it easy.
We'll get them.

649
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,189
I'm sure of one thing.

650
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:31,126
Frank will find ways
of slowing them up.

651
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:02,121
How long have you been a teacher?

652
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:03,829
Just a few years.

653
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:05,862
Must be good at it.

654
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:07,961
I'm all right, I guess.

655
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,104
Is he, Chris?
He seems to think so.

656
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:13,739
He's kind of strict.
Hold up.

657
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:16,003
Wait a sec.

658
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,068
Water.

659
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:28,380
Want some?

660
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:30,079
Please.

661
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,864
You lose your wife to cancer?

662
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,698
Yeah, I did.

663
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,240
Two years ago, actually.

664
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,776
Sorry.

665
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:00,349
Are you really?

666
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,387
I find that kind of hard to
believe. I don't know why.

667
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:04,581
Why?

668
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:06,089
Because of my profession?

669
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:09,292
Maybe.

670
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:14,533
Chris.

671
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,237
They used to give me
medals for it.

672
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:20,430
Do you believe that?
RAy: And now?

673
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:25,044
Well, now with political correctness
and all, it's best to keep a low profile.

674
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,603
Heroes are out of fashion.

675
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:30,613
You telling me
you're a spook?

676
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:33,514
Military? You work for the
government? CIA guy, is that it?

677
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:34,676
Used to.

678
00:49:34,855 --> 00:49:35,947
No more.

679
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:37,488
No?

680
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:39,484
Who do you work for?

681
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,354
I really don't know, Ray.

682
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:44,292
Pressure groups.

683
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:46,227
People with an agenda.

684
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,958
People who can afford it.

685
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:50,296
And you just don't
question the agenda, huh?

686
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,665
Well, as time goes on,
you know,

687
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:55,330
you realize that the issues
are just too complicated.

688
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:57,602
Sure.
Who's right, who's wrong.

689
00:49:57,778 --> 00:49:58,938
So you just...

690
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,408
Just wind up doing your job.

691
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,982
And you do it the best way you can.
Like everybody else.

692
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,145
Okay. We should move on.
I mean,

693
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:10,653
it's kind of late for me
to be thinking about changing.

694
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:12,815
I mean, hell, what would I do?

695
00:50:13,226 --> 00:50:15,353
I don't know, Frank. Let's go.
Come on, move.

696
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,929
Come on, man.
Sell insurance?

697
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,123
RAy:
I don't care, Frank.

698
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:23,297
Maybe go back to school.
Get a law degree.

699
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:42,985
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

700
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:47,490
I grew up in Cedar Pine-
Can't you get some more choppers?

701
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:49,390
I put in a request.

702
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,463
It's not that easy up here,
Mr. Jennings.

703
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,156
This isn't D.C.
It's Washington state.

704
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:56,598
Ain't that the truth, chief?

705
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:01,063
I don't believe any of this.

706
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,266
And anyway,
it's got nothing to do with us.

707
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:05,206
It had nothing to do with us
24 hours ago.

708
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:07,175
Told you we should have
gone to San Francisco.

709
00:51:07,347 --> 00:51:09,713
Oh, and be pestered
by your mother?

710
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:13,478
What's he done, anyway?
I don't know, but it's screwed up.

711
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,247
I'm telling you, his men are coming.
You go your way.

712
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:19,187
You move this way. Now.
We'll go ours.

713
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,328
We see the police, we'll tell them.
I don't want to get involved with this.

714
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,624
Come on, Sandra.
I think it's a mistake.

715
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:28,029
Didn't he say those men
are coming this way?

716
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:30,197
How do we know that's true?

717
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,036
Well, how do we know it isn't?

718
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:37,933
They're headed here. There's
a ravine or something.

719
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,204
When they get there,
they'll be trapped.

720
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,109
Maybe there's a bridge.

721
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:44,178
It's not on the map.

722
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,548
Yeah, but whoever's got Carden,
he knows this terrain pretty good.

723
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:49,211
Otherwise, we'd have caught him by now.

724
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:51,755
We better think of something
quick or else we'll lose him.

725
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:53,483
Well, what do you suggest?

726
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,821
Whose idea was it
to go camping?

727
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:57,190
You think-?

728
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,595
You think that I planned
for us to meet these lunatics?

729
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:03,167
Or just to make the hike
more exciting?

730
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:05,896
San Francisco would have
been breakfast in bed,

731
00:52:06,072 --> 00:52:08,404
tennis in the afternoon,
a few cocktails...

732
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,477
Yeah? And lots and lots of-
Hey.

733
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:17,105
Lots and lots of great seafood.
Yeah.

734
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:18,751
And wine.

735
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:35,196
COP 1
Chief?

736
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,533
Yeah, go ahead.

737
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:40,798
We got something up here.

738
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:42,335
Yeah, what is it?

739
00:52:44,277 --> 00:52:47,075
Sorry, false alarm.
Just a couple of hikers.

740
00:52:47,347 --> 00:52:49,815
Looks like one of them's hurt.
Yeah, well, check it out

741
00:52:49,983 --> 00:52:52,713
and get back to me, all right?
Copy that.

742
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,088
We'd spend weeks
searching this-

743
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:19,510
It's okay, buddy, just stay calm.
I'm gonna help you ou- Ugh!

744
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:23,346
ED
Aerial 4, come in, please.

745
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:25,708
Marty, can you hear me?

746
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:28,384
Marty, come in.

747
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:36,852
Aerial 4. Come in, Marty.

748
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,122
Marty, can you hear me?

749
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,230
Now, don't tell me
you don't know how to fly this thing.

750
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:48,567
No, I don't.

751
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:53,869
Get in the freaking chopper, man.

752
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:02,144
Less-traveled path, eh?

753
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,515
RAy:
"The Road Not Taken. "

754
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,816
You like Frost, do you, Ray?

755
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,258
Yeah. I'm surprised you do.
Doesn't seem your speed.

756
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:12,254
Yes, one of my favorites.

757
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:16,994
I took the road less traveled by,
and it made all the difference.

758
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,537
A lot of forks in the road. You seem
to have taken all the wrong ones.

759
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:23,972
Is this a good time
to discuss poetry?

760
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,651
The hell is this?

761
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,152
CHRIS:
It's from an old glacier.

762
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:39,156
That's what they told us last time.
It's called a moraine.

763
00:54:39,326 --> 00:54:42,420
Great.
Rocks brought down in the Ice Age.

764
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:44,825
CHRIS: He's right.
Moraine, that was the word.

765
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:47,364
If I don't do this,
they're gonna kill me, right?

766
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,933
RAy:
There's a good chance.

767
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:50,793
I think so.

768
00:54:50,971 --> 00:54:52,097
Look,

769
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:54,502
I'm not gonna be able to do this
with cuffs on.

770
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:55,902
I need the balance.

771
00:54:59,145 --> 00:55:00,134
Okay.

772
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,210
But you can cuff them in front.

773
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,161
Whoa!
Ah!

774
00:55:58,671 --> 00:56:00,434
CHRIS: Hey, Dad?
Yeah.

775
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:04,707
I just wanted to say that I'm really
sorry that I got you into all this-

776
00:56:04,878 --> 00:56:06,846
I was the one who said
we should go camping.

777
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:10,449
Yeah, but only because
I was being so stupid and-

778
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,415
Well, look,
the situation could be worse.

779
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:15,152
CHRIS:
You think?

780
00:56:15,588 --> 00:56:17,647
Actually, no.

781
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,619
Okay. Carden, stop.

782
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,392
Chris.

783
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,533
If he moves, I want you to point
that at his legs and shoot him.

784
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:34,138
Now, hold on.

785
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,936
I don't wanna kill the bastard,
I just wanna slow him down.

786
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:40,578
Hey, this thing
is kind of flimsy.

787
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,374
I could...

788
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,812
Wanna help?
No.

789
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,716
I won't destroy government property.
Oh, for God's sakes.

790
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:53,518
I'm a stockbroker. I'd lose my license.
Don't be such an ass, go help him.

791
00:56:56,096 --> 00:56:58,428
Come on, man. Come on.

792
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,236
Okay, what?
You push from up here.

793
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,703
I'm gonna go
down here.

794
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,100
All right.

795
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:14,004
All right.

796
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:19,548
Yeah, it's pretty loose. Ready?
Fine. Yes.

797
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,209
Chris, you all right?
Yeah.

798
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,182
One.

799
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:27,583
Two.

800
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:35,063
Coming out.

801
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:38,162
I don't have to help.
RAy: One.

802
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:39,327
I'm the bad guy.

803
00:57:39,506 --> 00:57:40,666
RAy: Two.
Two.

804
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,307
Three.

805
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:43,840
Watch it.

806
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,246
All right.

807
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:13,966
RAy:
Hey!

808
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:25,308
Got them.

809
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:28,276
Hey!

810
00:58:28,454 --> 00:58:29,614
Over here!
CHRIS: Right here!

811
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:31,620
RAy: We're right here!
Hey!

812
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:34,385
Here, take this. Just watch him.
What?

813
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:35,653
Hey!

814
00:58:35,828 --> 00:58:37,125
- Hey.
- Over here, come here.

815
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:38,389
RAy: All right!
Hey!

816
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:40,294
Here!
CHRIS: Come here. We're right here!

817
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:42,400
Hey!
CHRIS: Come on. Come on, hurry!

818
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,968
Hey, here we are!
Over here!

819
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:48,232
Get the guy with the gun.
Don't miss.

820
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:51,906
Hey! We're right here! Come here!
Hey!

821
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:53,409
Hey!

822
00:58:53,746 --> 00:58:56,374
Hey!
CHRIS: Over here! Right here!

823
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:57,811
Bye, old man.

824
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:04,523
Think you can hold this thing steady?
I'm trying, man. There's an updraft.

825
00:59:11,497 --> 00:59:12,930
Chris, go to the trees.

826
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,097
Get down.

827
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:24,409
We gotta get out of here
now. Come on. We gotta go.

828
00:59:36,356 --> 00:59:37,550
You okay?

829
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,392
I can't get a clear shot.

830
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:22,125
I'll fix him. Find somewhere to drop me.

831
01:01:20,026 --> 01:01:21,015
Got him.

832
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:22,855
Good man.

833
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:33,631
I hate amateurs.

834
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:20,685
Jesus.
I thought Johnson took him out.

835
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:23,518
DAVIS:
Where is he?

836
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:33,321
That mother's hitting the tail rotor.
Get us the hell out of here. Come on.

837
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:20,305
Can't you set it down?

838
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,044
I can't control it.

839
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,789
Hold on.

840
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,307
No!

841
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,182
Where did you learn to
fly, man? Disneyland?

842
01:04:01,654 --> 01:04:03,087
Jesus Christ!
What'd you say?

843
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,588
For chrissake, kill each
other later. Get out!

844
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,453
You wanna piece of me?
Hands off.

845
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:08,854
Son of a bitch.

846
01:04:22,808 --> 01:04:24,571
CHRIS:
Dad.

847
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:26,769
What about Lochlan? We
gotta go back and get him.

848
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,972
Can't. I saw them in the helicopter.
We can't leave him.

849
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,513
Your friend's beyond help, miss.

850
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:34,209
And this may sound
a bit insensitive,

851
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:36,378
but you two didn't seem
very well suited.

852
01:04:43,162 --> 01:04:44,789
Chris.

853
01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:46,497
CHRIS:
Come on. Come on.

854
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:54,262
What an incredibly screwed-up
thing to say, Frank.

855
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,840
Get your sorry ass up.

856
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,237
Move.

857
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:28,166
Here come
Laurel and Hardy.

858
01:05:31,978 --> 01:05:34,242
Here, Ed. Here.

859
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,372
Here you go.
Oh, no more coffee.

860
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:40,246
Did you find the croissants?
No one in town's ever heard of them.

861
01:05:40,419 --> 01:05:43,388
I've got some news. A pilot
reported that missing chopper.

862
01:05:43,556 --> 01:05:44,784
Crashed.
Yes?

863
01:05:44,957 --> 01:05:47,289
No one's there, and he
didn't see any bodies, either.

864
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,360
Well, didn't he land
and check it out?

865
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,861
"Nowhere to put it down," he says. It's
rough country out there, Mr. Jennings.

866
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:55,927
So now we need
Lewis and Clark.

867
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:58,536
I'll put some men on it.
It'll take awhile, though.

868
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,899
Is that a country "while",
chief?

869
01:06:01,073 --> 01:06:04,668
Jeez, for crying out-!
Gee, I'm sorry, Mr. Jennings.

870
01:06:04,844 --> 01:06:07,540
You know, we're kind of
clumsy out here in the woods.

871
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:08,771
Damn it.

872
01:06:17,023 --> 01:06:18,456
See?

873
01:06:18,624 --> 01:06:20,148
And there's a phone there?

874
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:22,590
CHRIS: Yeah. This is where we
slept when we went kayaking.

875
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:24,557
Let's go.

876
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:43,039
All right.

877
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:46,713
It's dead.
It's what?

878
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:52,555
Chris, you said there was a phone.
That is a phone.

879
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:56,126
I didn't know it wouldn't be working.
Sorry, it's too early in the season.

880
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:57,523
RAy:
Right.

881
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,655
All right.

882
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,894
To the bed.
What?

883
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,935
Come on, Frank!

884
01:07:07,373 --> 01:07:10,171
What are you, new? We shou-

885
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:19,642
Chris, what about kayaks?
CHRIS: They're not there. I'm sorry.

886
01:07:19,819 --> 01:07:22,287
It's too early in the season.
It's too early in the season.

887
01:07:24,557 --> 01:07:26,388
So what do we do now, Ray?

888
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,893
No idea.

889
01:07:29,695 --> 01:07:32,095
Well, I've had it.

890
01:07:32,264 --> 01:07:33,993
I need a rest.

891
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,070
DAVIS: This guy was supposed to
be red-hot. Some amateur got him.

892
01:07:47,246 --> 01:07:49,578
Probably just a lucky shot.

893
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:52,013
Even a blind hog
finds some acorns.

894
01:07:52,184 --> 01:07:53,981
If we don't get Carden
before tomorrow,

895
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,178
we miss the window
for the contract.

896
01:07:56,355 --> 01:07:58,220
What, he send you
an e-mail?

897
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,122
Maybe as good as.

898
01:08:09,735 --> 01:08:11,703
Well, look at that.

899
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:14,135
And that's a dead end.

900
01:08:42,468 --> 01:08:44,163
Sandra.

901
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,671
What? I- Ray.

902
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,637
Oh, for shit's sake.
Ray.

903
01:08:50,009 --> 01:08:53,604
What do you think you're doing? You
think this is some sort of a game?

904
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:56,475
You think this is O.K. Corral
and you're an action hero?

905
01:08:56,649 --> 01:09:00,278
You're a teacher, for God's sake!
Wise up!

906
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,314
Chris, talk to your dad.
Try to talk some sense into him.

907
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:06,390
He seems to listen to you.

908
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,959
You think so?
Yeah.

909
01:09:09,128 --> 01:09:10,425
It's funny, I...

910
01:09:12,364 --> 01:09:14,332
never thought he did.

911
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,969
Okay, so you want me to
convince him to let you go?

912
01:09:18,137 --> 01:09:19,365
Yeah, something like that.

913
01:09:19,538 --> 01:09:22,632
Yeah, but then what's stopping you
and your friends from killing us all?

914
01:09:22,808 --> 01:09:25,436
No. That won't happen.
My word on it.

915
01:09:26,045 --> 01:09:28,479
You've been real good
at stopping them so far, Frank.

916
01:09:28,714 --> 01:09:31,308
Oh, shit.
Now what?

917
01:09:31,483 --> 01:09:33,542
There's nothing
but classical music on this thing.

918
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:36,381
I knew there was something wrong
with that guy.

919
01:09:36,555 --> 01:09:37,920
You sure
you know what you're doing?

920
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,058
Shut up
and keep walking.

921
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:49,263
You know, the funny thing is...

922
01:09:49,869 --> 01:09:53,270
Lochlan and me,
we'd kind of broken up.

923
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:58,305
This camping trip was his idea
to get us back together.

924
01:09:59,311 --> 01:10:01,779
I hate camping.
He knew that.

925
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:06,213
The woods are beautiful, I just-
I don't wanna sleep in them.

926
01:10:06,886 --> 01:10:08,717
I want room service.
Sure.

927
01:10:08,888 --> 01:10:11,584
Minibar.
Yeah.

928
01:10:15,594 --> 01:10:19,121
What do you do?
You know, back in the real world?

929
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,959
I produce TV commercials.

930
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,463
That's great.

931
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:27,067
You ever met an advertising man?

932
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:28,706
No.

933
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:30,065
The worst.

934
01:10:30,242 --> 01:10:31,834
Yeah?

935
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:38,209
I have no idea
how to use this thing, Ray.

936
01:10:39,518 --> 01:10:44,080
There's no safety on this. You
just point it and pull the trigger.

937
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:45,746
Ray.

938
01:10:47,259 --> 01:10:48,248
Ray.

939
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,121
They'll wait until dark.

940
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:53,993
So I'm gonna make you
my final offer.

941
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,794
Take these handcuffs off of me
and let me walk out of here

942
01:10:56,969 --> 01:10:58,869
before the shooting starts.

943
01:10:59,405 --> 01:11:01,498
Practice on him.

944
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,919
It's getting dark
out here, chief.

945
01:11:16,922 --> 01:11:19,015
Give it awhile longer

946
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,590
and then bring it in.

947
01:11:20,759 --> 01:11:22,624
Roger that.

948
01:11:32,805 --> 01:11:34,568
You and your dad
do much camping?

949
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:37,571
No, not really.

950
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:39,870
Guess we're kind of...

951
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:43,942
Kind of bonding.

952
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:46,884
You don't say.

953
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:06,434
Maybe you're wrong.

954
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:08,596
No, they're there.

955
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:21,685
Hey. Wait for my signal.

956
01:12:34,066 --> 01:12:36,967
Chris. Hey. Chris.

957
01:12:53,018 --> 01:12:54,451
We just want Carden.

958
01:12:55,654 --> 01:12:57,315
Frank, you in there?

959
01:12:57,856 --> 01:12:59,153
Yeah, I'm okay.

960
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,450
Give us Carden,
we'll leave you alone.

961
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,809
Last chance.

962
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:22,673
Give us Carden.

963
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,519
If it's just you, Ray,

964
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:35,489
hell, it's your choice.

965
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,894
But it's your son.

966
01:13:38,063 --> 01:13:39,621
A woman.

967
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,330
Look, you don't have to prove anything.
You've already done that.

968
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,605
I'm convinced.

969
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:12,720
Be careful, son.

970
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:33,077
No!

971
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,016
Royko.

972
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,160
Royko. Royko.

973
01:14:55,174 --> 01:14:56,163
Let me see.

974
01:14:56,341 --> 01:14:57,865
Damn it.

975
01:15:01,446 --> 01:15:03,346
Get down! Now!

976
01:15:07,052 --> 01:15:08,883
Hey.

977
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:21,260
Chris? Chris!

978
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:38,549
CHRIS:
Dad?

979
01:15:43,422 --> 01:15:45,287
Dad. Dad!

980
01:15:49,328 --> 01:15:50,317
Put the gun down.

981
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:53,998
Put it down. Come on.

982
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:58,465
I'm taking the kid, Ray.
Dad.

983
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,662
If you wanna see him alive,
don't come after me.

984
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:01,897
Dad!
Coming out!

985
01:16:02,074 --> 01:16:03,803
Dad.

986
01:16:32,704 --> 01:16:34,228
All right, now listen.

987
01:16:34,406 --> 01:16:38,866
You try to call out in any way,
or run, I'm gonna snap your neck,

988
01:16:39,044 --> 01:16:40,102
you understand me?
Yeah.

989
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:42,747
Don't confuse me with a nice guy.
Yes.

990
01:16:51,556 --> 01:16:55,458
No. You listen to me, this thing
has to stay outside the Beltway.

991
01:16:55,627 --> 01:16:58,528
If the White House got implicated-

992
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,995
I said I'd handle it.

993
01:17:01,566 --> 01:17:04,694
I've been informed the president
will not change his plans.

994
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:05,859
They don't want panic.

995
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,302
We're gonna have to move
all resources to protect him.

996
01:17:08,473 --> 01:17:11,271
But Carden's hardly likely
to make the attempt now.

997
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:14,241
He's lost his backup team for starter-
He's got a contract,

998
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,540
he'll try to fulfill it,
that's what he's like.

999
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:20,742
How do you know that?
We've had dealings with him.

1000
01:17:22,154 --> 01:17:23,985
What about the boy?
What boy?

1001
01:17:24,156 --> 01:17:26,181
The boy he took with him.
Chris... something.

1002
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:29,418
Main thing is to protect the president.
This is Mr. Keene.

1003
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:30,959
I'm sorry?
Ray Keene.

1004
01:17:31,129 --> 01:17:33,791
Ray Keene. His son was taken hostage.

1005
01:17:33,965 --> 01:17:35,057
Of course.

1006
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,633
What are you doing
about my son?

1007
01:17:37,803 --> 01:17:39,100
We're looking for your son.

1008
01:17:39,271 --> 01:17:42,468
We are doing everything
we can, rest assured.

1009
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:45,474
I know how difficult
this is for you.

1010
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,052
Son? You okay?

1011
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:05,355
Is everything all right?

1012
01:18:10,302 --> 01:18:13,396
You know, Ray,
we're gonna do everything we can.

1013
01:18:14,373 --> 01:18:18,275
But most of my men are diverted
to the president in Woodburn.

1014
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,377
But after that...

1015
01:18:32,591 --> 01:18:34,718
MILES I can't believe
you screwed up again.

1016
01:18:34,893 --> 01:18:37,487
Look, I need Carden gone.

1017
01:18:37,662 --> 01:18:40,597
I don't want him back in Washington.
I don't want him talking to anyone.

1018
01:18:40,766 --> 01:18:41,858
I hear you.

1019
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:44,797
And if the boy's alive,

1020
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,567
make it look like Carden killed him.

1021
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:50,401
The boy's father, Ray Keene,

1022
01:18:50,575 --> 01:18:52,406
God knows what Carden told him.

1023
01:18:52,577 --> 01:18:54,807
Isn't he an old pro?
He'd tell him nothing.

1024
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,345
Can't risk it.

1025
01:18:56,515 --> 01:18:57,948
Erase everything.

1026
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:00,277
And Davis, don't let me down.

1027
01:19:00,452 --> 01:19:02,215
Hey, what do you look like?

1028
01:19:02,387 --> 01:19:05,288
I'm only asking because it sounds
like you're pretty hot.

1029
01:19:05,457 --> 01:19:07,322
Bet you got a great tush.

1030
01:19:07,793 --> 01:19:09,055
Ugh.

1031
01:19:30,282 --> 01:19:33,012
I can't believe she went
back to Washington.

1032
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,517
With Miles,
you just never know.

1033
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,848
I guess she figures
she's done all she can.

1034
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,958
It's not every day the president
visits this part of the country,

1035
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:44,562
and just about anyone who's
anyone local will be here today.

1036
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,258
The president is bound
to come under fire

1037
01:19:46,798 --> 01:19:50,131
for cutbacks his administration
has made to the education budget.

1038
01:19:50,302 --> 01:19:53,135
Be interesting to see how he handles
that one at the press conference.

1039
01:19:53,305 --> 01:19:54,772
Back to you, Bob.

1040
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,305
Thanks, Dana.

1041
01:19:56,475 --> 01:19:58,602
In other local news,
Lydel Hammond, Sr.,

1042
01:19:58,777 --> 01:20:00,210
the reclusive billionaire,

1043
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:04,075
will be attending the funeral of his son
in Cedar Pine this afternoon.

1044
01:20:04,249 --> 01:20:06,149
Hammond Senior's
outspoken criticism

1045
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:08,513
of government
stem-cell research programs

1046
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:12,054
has caused him to be labeled
by a White House spokesperson:

1047
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,590
an obstacle to progress.

1048
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:17,626
Hammond Jr. was killed last week
in a tragic accident

1049
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:20,560
outside an apartment building
in Cedar Pine.

1050
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,868
Yep, Deputy Evans.

1051
01:20:26,171 --> 01:20:27,433
Okay.

1052
01:20:28,173 --> 01:20:29,470
Give me a minute.

1053
01:20:29,641 --> 01:20:31,973
Let me see if I can find him.

1054
01:20:34,145 --> 01:20:35,237
Excuse me, Father.

1055
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:37,973
Just a minute.
Yeah, what's up?

1056
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:39,946
Ray Keene's on the phone.
Yeah?

1057
01:20:40,118 --> 01:20:43,349
Says the president's not the
target at all, wants to talk to you.

1058
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:45,922
Oh, come on, no. He's
just beat and upset.

1059
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,184
Just tell him you
couldn't find me.

1060
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,387
"The president's not the target"? Jesus.

1061
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,926
Hey, Ray.
Sorry, Father.

1062
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,263
I can't locate him right at the
moment. Let me call you back.

1063
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:45,041
Carden.

1064
01:22:57,789 --> 01:23:00,314
You just won't let a man get
on with his work, will you?

1065
01:23:00,492 --> 01:23:01,618
RAy:
Where's Chris?

1066
01:23:01,793 --> 01:23:03,761
I'm busy. I've got a job to do.

1067
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:05,486
After, we can talk.
Where's my son?

1068
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:08,993
Son of a...

1069
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:11,793
What was that?

1070
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:14,666
Somebody shooting.
At me?

1071
01:23:15,173 --> 01:23:16,231
No, me.

1072
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:20,900
Is it the police?

1073
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:24,048
I think it's my friend.
Your friend.

1074
01:23:24,215 --> 01:23:25,580
Well, more of
an acquaintance.

1075
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,581
Keep your head down.

1076
01:23:27,986 --> 01:23:32,650
Jesus said to her,
"I am the resurrection and the life.

1077
01:23:32,824 --> 01:23:36,089
He who believes in me will live
even though he dies.

1078
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:41,056
And whoever lives and believes in me
will never die.

1079
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:43,427
Do you believe this?"

1080
01:23:43,968 --> 01:23:45,765
"Do you believe this?"

1081
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,202
This is not a rhetorical question
that Jesus asked.

1082
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:53,442
These words are just as relevant
in the present day

1083
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,875
as they were to Lazarus.

1084
01:23:57,882 --> 01:24:03,081
Why? Where is the hope,
come from God in despair?

1085
01:24:18,236 --> 01:24:21,672
Rather, the hope is in the one
who performed the miracle.

1086
01:24:22,607 --> 01:24:25,007
It is found in Jesus himself.

1087
01:24:25,176 --> 01:24:28,043
"I am the resurrection and the life. "

1088
01:24:30,115 --> 01:24:33,778
This occasion served to show
that those who believe in him

1089
01:24:33,952 --> 01:24:35,920
need not fear the grave.

1090
01:24:36,087 --> 01:24:37,247
He holds the power-

1091
01:24:37,422 --> 01:24:38,821
Hey, smartass?

1092
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:49,927
"He who believes in me will live,
even though he dies. "

1093
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,912
It's just so tragic.

1094
01:25:32,343 --> 01:25:35,676
I had a perfect record
until today.

1095
01:25:36,347 --> 01:25:37,974
Where is my son, Frank?

1096
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:40,776
I know you didn't hurt him.

1097
01:25:40,952 --> 01:25:43,318
Oh, you do, do you?
Yeah.

1098
01:25:43,922 --> 01:25:46,322
Where's my son?

1099
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,393
Chris?

1100
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:25,022
Alright, you ready?
On three.

1101
01:26:25,396 --> 01:26:26,522
Sorry.

1102
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:29,258
You all right?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1103
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,625
It was really boring, though.

1104
01:26:31,803 --> 01:26:33,862
He put the TV
on the business channel.

1105
01:26:35,406 --> 01:26:37,533
All right. All right.

1106
01:26:37,709 --> 01:26:39,574
All right.

1107
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,369
Hi, can I help you?
Can I get a double latte?

1108
01:27:06,537 --> 01:27:08,562
And your name, please.

1109
01:27:11,943 --> 01:27:15,310
Gwen? Non-fat decaf latte.

1110
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:24,587
Excuse me.

1111
01:27:24,756 --> 01:27:26,348
Is this yours?

1112
01:27:28,526 --> 01:27:30,426
By the way,

1113
01:27:30,595 --> 01:27:33,393
if anything happens
to Ray Keene or his son,

1114
01:27:33,564 --> 01:27:35,896
I'll be coming after you.

1115
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,824
Depend on it.

1116
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,757
The unsung hero
in this amazing case

1117
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:08,125
is our own local police chief,
Ed Wainwright.

1118
01:28:08,299 --> 01:28:11,427
Tell me, how did you know where
young Chris Keene was being held?

1119
01:28:11,602 --> 01:28:15,402
Well, I'm not at liberty to disclose
the sources of my information,

1120
01:28:15,573 --> 01:28:19,168
but when you've been in charge
for as long as I have

1121
01:28:19,344 --> 01:28:22,609
you build up connections in town
and earn the trust...

1122
01:28:24,248 --> 01:28:25,374
of people of the community.

1123
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,950
And I hear you're up for another
promotion, is that correct?

1124
01:28:28,119 --> 01:28:31,782
Well, I am, but I'm thinking
about running for mayor next year.

1125
01:28:31,956 --> 01:28:34,686
Well, congratulations.
That's excellent.

1126
01:28:35,293 --> 01:28:37,158
Keep going.

1127
01:28:40,365 --> 01:28:43,493
Here we are.
Thanks.

1128
01:28:43,668 --> 01:28:46,796
You guys okay?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You?

1129
01:28:47,205 --> 01:28:49,002
Yeah.

1130
01:28:49,707 --> 01:28:51,937
Thanks for inviting me.
RAy: Oh, sure.

1131
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,908
Barbecue's about as close to
camping as I ever wanna get.

1132
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,569
I second that motion.

1133
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,477
He only invited you
because he can't cook.

1134
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:00,742
Now, you can't tell her that,
it's a family secret.

1135
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:03,182
Well, I figured it couldn't be
for any other reason.

1136
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,659
I'm gonna get you a plate.
Okay? Hold on.

1137
01:29:10,328 --> 01:29:11,818
Thanks.

1138
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,799
MAN
WKGB-104. This is the news at 2.

1139
01:29:20,972 --> 01:29:23,964
The death has been reported
of billionaire, Lydel Hammond,

1140
01:29:24,142 --> 01:29:27,236
in a tragic boating accident
while on holiday at Whidbey Island.

1141
01:29:27,412 --> 01:29:29,505
Coincidentally, Hammond's son,
Lydel Jr.,

1142
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,808
died in a hit-and-run accident
less than two weeks ago.

1143
01:29:32,984 --> 01:29:34,884
Hammond Senior
was a controversial figure,

1144
01:29:35,053 --> 01:29:37,749
whose views on many issues
were considered extreme,

1145
01:29:37,922 --> 01:29:41,255
though he always denied
the alleged links with violent factions.

1146
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:44,862
The administration, however, has
taken steps to distance themselves...
