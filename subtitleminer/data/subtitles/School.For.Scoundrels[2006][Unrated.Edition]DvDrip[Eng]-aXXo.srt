00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,465
Wait, man.

2
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,731
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

3
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,067
Put the clipboard
down, Serpico.

4
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,164
He's just getting
ready to move that, man.

5
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,731
Oh. Okay, great.

6
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,572
If you could just move it,
that'd be great.

7
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,737
Cool, man, no problem.

8
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,770
Damn, came out
of nowhere.

9
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,340
City make you
wear them shorts?

10
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,909
Yeah, these are regulation--
we have to wear 'em

11
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,250
till December 1.

12
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,313
Between those shorts and
that little-ass truck,

13
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,585
the shit's humiliating, man.

14
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,785
It's a living, right?

15
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,851
Man, I'm glad
I seen you when I did.

16
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,590
I can't afford
another ticket.

17
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,726
Ooh, actually, you know,
it's already been processed.

18
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,663
Whatcha talking about?

19
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,672
Well, this clipboard's
a computer.

20
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,971
You see, once I push "send,"
it goes straight to Albany.

21
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,236
It's in the system.

22
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,609
Well, un-send
it, then.

23
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,307
You can't un-send it;
it's too late.

24
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,609
You're not listening.

25
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,413
Now, I'm telling you,
take my shit

26
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,782
out the system,
meter maid.

27
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,582
Uh, guys, please...

28
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,213
- I have to get going...
- Get going?!

29
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,156
Where the hell
you think you're going?

30
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,489
You slam the door on me?

31
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,585
Hey, boy, get your ass
out of that box!

32
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,789
I'll start kicking
your ass, boy. What...

33
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,229
Hey, where you going?

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,931
Get away.

35
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,698
Turtle One to base,

36
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,728
Turtle One to base, come in.
Hello?

37
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,331
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

38
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,432
Look at him.

39
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,499
- Don't make me use it, man.
- Use it.

40
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,945
Don't hesitate!

41
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,038
Shoot his ass!

42
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,948
Yo, man!

43
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,447
Man, what the
hell happened?

44
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,855
Shit, Lloyd, you hit him.

45
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,655
No, I don't think so.

46
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,128
It must have been
a ricochet.

47
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,961
Hello!

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,091
Hello!

49
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,534
Were you hit by a ricochet?

50
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,765
Little ticket man!

51
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,240
Blink twice
if you can hear me!

52
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,903
Man, he ain't hit nowhere.

53
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,377
He's faking, man.

54
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,811
He just fainted.

55
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,439
Aw, man, you okay?

56
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,710
Yes.

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,047
I'm sorry, I just...

58
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,315
I get these panic attacks
sometimes, that's all.

59
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,480
Damn!

60
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,648
You can't do this
to me, man. Huh?

61
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,056
I get nervous, you had
my heart going all fast.

62
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,924
- I-I'm sorry, really.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,054
You know, just... here, let me
pay for your ticket, okay?

64
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,399
Yeah, that's more like it.

65
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,199
Here you go, that's $80--
that should cover it.

66
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,035
I-I mean,

67
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,167
$80 is nice, dude,
it's sweet, but what about

68
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,111
all the mental distress
I just went through?

69
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,239
You got something for that?

70
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,750
Yeah.

71
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,776
What else you got?

72
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,751
<i>Could someone explain to me</i>
<i>how one</i>

73
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,753
of my parking enforcement agents
manages to lose his badge,

74
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,231
his uniform

75
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,734
and his standard-issue
New Balance sneakers.

76
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,464
What could I do, Sarge?

77
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,062
They took everything.

78
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,630
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:14,241
I... I was reading through
my employee benefits,

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,838
and it says

81
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,374
I'm entitled to meet
with a government counselor.

82
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,649
I'd like to meet
with a counselor.

83
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,890
You're looking at him.

84
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,790
What do you mean?

85
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,660
I'm the assigned counselor
for District 240.

86
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,189
I figure, hey, why not take
the bump on the paycheck.

87
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,531
Besides, I'm redoing
my kitchen.

88
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,866
Oh, um...

89
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,271
Don't worry.

90
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,774
I took the quiz.

91
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,709
I'm certified.

92
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,479
Well...

93
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,949
I feel very, um,

94
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,814
- alone.
- Uh-huh.

95
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,582
And sometimes I get
these panic attacks where I...

96
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,890
Oh, oh.

97
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,188
Hold that. That's good.

98
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,226
Sweetie.

99
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,891
You wouldn't believe
what I'm doing right now.

100
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,230
I'm counseling.

101
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,598
For real!

102
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,125
Yo, Sarge,
check it out, man.

103
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,570
I heard we got a new
dress code around here.

104
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,732
How do I look?

105
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,036
How do I look?!

106
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,906
You look good!
I like that!

107
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:22,108
- Come on, come on, Rog, let's...
- Look at this guy!

108
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,174
You are a good dancer, bud!

109
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,185
Yeah!

110
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,586
Where are my pants?
Where's my shoes at?

111
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,439
Hi, Roger.

112
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,273
Hey.

113
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,350
So... so, you guys

114
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,377
gonna play some
tennis or something?

115
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,719
Yeah.

116
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,053
Wow, what gave it away?

117
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,284
You should work
for Homeland Security.

118
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,318
Becky.

119
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,301
So, um... I read that letter
that you posted

120
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,709
to the building manager.

121
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,770
Oh, you did?

122
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,146
Yeah. I thought it was great.

123
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,548
Oh, well, thanks.

124
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,677
I mean, really well written.

125
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,419
Aren't you getting your master's
in English?

126
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,152
Yep, I am.

127
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,286
Wow. Looks like you're
well on your way.

128
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,454
Congrats.

129
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,088
Thanks.

130
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,622
Casanova's really pulling
out all the stops today.

131
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,931
Seriously, where should
I throw my panties?

132
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,196
I'm sorry, Roger.

133
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,262
Becky thinks that any guy
that even talks to a girl

134
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,137
- has to be a stalker.
- I don't.

135
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,903
I just think he is.

136
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,240
Aren't you, Roger?

137
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,945
Uh, excuse me.

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,174
Where are you going?

139
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,876
This is the
third floor.

140
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,451
Oh, yeah, I know,
but I was...

141
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,545
I forgot something
upstairs.

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,082
You guys have a great day.

143
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,400
Hey, Ian.

144
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,412
Oh, hey, Rog.
How you doing?

145
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,470
I'm okay.

146
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,277
Have you seen Wally around?

147
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,579
We're learning
the backstroke today.

148
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,416
Uh... you know what,
you might come on in.

149
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,922
I want to talk to you
about Wally for a second.

150
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,548
What's wrong?

151
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,923
Nothing. Just...
it'll take a sec.

152
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,495
Is everything okay?

153
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,166
Huh? Uh, yeah, yeah.

154
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,869
He's-he's-he's fine,
he's fine. Uh...

155
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,208
Thing is...

156
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,737
he wants a new
big brother.

157
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,773
What?!

158
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,114
You know, I'm sure
he just wants

159
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,278
to play the field
a little.

160
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,515
You know, see what
else is out there.

161
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,081
You know how kids are.

162
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,421
Wow.

163
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,224
Can I at least
talk to him?

164
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,254
Roger, the kid is nine
years old, all right?

165
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,392
His dad just got shot
in the heart, all right?

166
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,334
Don't you think he's
been through enough?

167
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,871
Okay. Well...

168
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,898
are there any other kids?

169
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,808
No. No, man.

170
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:42,143
This is the third time
this has happened.

171
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:46,641
I mean, maybe it's time to
stop chasing rainbows, buddy.

172
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,019
All right. Okay.

173
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,491
- Sorry, man.
- No.

174
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,692
Take it easy.

175
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,596
Oh, sorry.

176
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,201
You have to take
your hand off.

177
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,566
Okay, go. Take it. No.
Take your hand off.

178
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,939
Roger, just stand away
for one second.

179
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,738
Okay, the buzzer...

180
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,574
G-Go now.

181
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,735
Hey, Roger!
Hold up, man.

182
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,234
Listen, I know...

183
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,110
Are you... crying?

184
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,774
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,442
It's not just Wally,

186
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,645
it's... everything.

187
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,450
- He's crying.
- Mac!

188
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,458
It's all right, man,
it's... it's okay, it's...

189
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,290
Uh, yeah. Shh.

190
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,421
All right, man.

191
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,124
Listen...

192
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,156
Okay. Listen.

193
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,031
Listen, man.

194
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,731
I know this guy,
all right?

195
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,706
And he, uh...

196
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,765
he runs this thing.

197
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,936
I think it'd be
a big help for you.

198
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,444
What do you mean?

199
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,946
What kind of thing?

200
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,449
Look, here, just call
this number, all right?

201
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,281
But you didn't
get it from me.

202
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,753
I don't understand.

203
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,418
Look, Roger, I...

204
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,360
I used to be like...
you, you know?

205
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,794
But look at me now, man.

206
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,457
I run this entire place.

207
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:43,298
I'm dating two
different Asian chicks.

208
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,132
You want things to change?

209
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,402
Call the number and
follow the instructions.

210
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,671
I got to go.

211
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,406
Call it... or burn it.

212
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,510
Hey, Perkins, what the
fuck did I tell you?

213
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,748
Get inside and
get your pudding.

214
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,825
MAN
Hello.

215
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,258
Hi, I'm calling about...

216
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,786
For new student registration,
please press one.

217
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,458
I-Is this a recording?

218
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,626
Just press it.

219
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,067
Hello?

220
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,697
Just press the damn button,
you asshole.

221
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,934
Uh, I think I have
the wrong number. Sorry.

222
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,146
Hello?

223
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,710
Congratulations, you're
already my worst student.

224
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,313
Who gave you this number?

225
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,948
Uh, I have to go.

226
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,184
Hey, relax.

227
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,091
I'm here to help, okay?

228
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,688
Now, who gave you the number?

229
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,721
His name is Ian Winsky.

230
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,199
Do you always rat out
your friends that quickly?

231
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,361
- That says a lot about you.
- I wasn't ratting out...

232
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,267
Would you not interrupt
me for five seconds?

233
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,295
Open your goddamned ears.

234
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,307
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,071
We got a new class
starting this Tuesday.

236
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,374
Registration is $5,000,
cash only,

237
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,879
in a plain manila envelope.

238
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,007
Be at the Learning Annex
at 8:00 p.m.

239
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,108
Don't be early, but be on time.

240
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,285
Wait. Wait.

241
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,151
Hold the elevator!
Hold the elev...

242
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,089
Thanks a lot.

243
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,126
You guys going to 402?

244
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,134
Yeah.

245
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,658
Oh, no way!
Me, too!

246
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,136
Name's Walsh.
Nice to meet y...

247
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,230
No talking.

248
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,367
Listen up, 'cause I will not
be repeating this again.

249
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,900
When entering
this building,

250
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,640
you will talk or
speak to no one.

251
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,378
If some asshole wants to talk about his
goddamn French test,

252
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,912
you tell him to fuck
off, understood?

253
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,650
- Understood?
- Yeah. -Yes.

254
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,625
Envelopes.

255
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,360
Manila.

256
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,801
Dr. P specifically
said manila.

257
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,771
This is off-white.

258
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,795
Sorry.

259
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,501
Sorry doesn't
make it manila.

260
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,170
Next time, use
your damn brain.

261
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,878
End of the hall.

262
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,612
What's going on?

263
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,347
I don't know.
Who is this guy?

264
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,945
I hope he's not
our teacher.

265
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,512
Hey, no chitchat!

266
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,770
Oh. Here, sorry.

267
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,604
No, don't be silly--
it's all yours.

268
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,167
I'm fine.
I could totally stand.

269
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,509
Don't be crazy, okay?
I could use the exercise.

270
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,570
I'll find...

271
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,946
Would one of you sit
in the goddamn chair?

272
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,053
Look at the two of you.

273
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,682
I mean, uh, "I could
use the exercise"?

274
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,522
That doesn't even
make any sense.

275
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,829
Sorry.

276
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,195
Well, congratulations.

277
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,531
In a room full of weak men,
you stand alone as the weakest.

278
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,933
Here, sit in my chair.

279
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,868
Come on, sit.

280
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,608
Tell me something--
are you a loser?

281
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,948
I asked you a question--
are... you... a... loser?

282
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,349
Um... yes?

283
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,683
No.

284
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,181
You see, a loser is someone
who tries but fails,

285
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,319
who shoots but misses.

286
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,795
But I got a suspicion

287
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,991
that you don't take
any shots.

288
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,431
Show of hands.

289
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,231
How many of you retards
own a self-help book?

290
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,535
Well, that's your first problem.

291
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:20,443
You can't help yourself
because yourself sucks.

292
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,447
If you're helping yourself,

293
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,008
that means you're being helped
by a complete asshole.

294
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,576
So ignore yourself.

295
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,919
Do what I say instead.

296
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,719
Short sleeves,
what was the first thing

297
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,192
you did when you were born?

298
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,923
I-I don't know.

299
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,692
Anybody?

300
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,394
You screamed your asses off
for what you wanted.

301
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,061
And what did you want?

302
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,895
Okay.

303
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,939
The tit.

304
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,382
You wanted a tit,

305
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,045
and you got the tit.

306
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,021
Trouble is, I don't see anyone

307
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,889
in this room who's willing
to scream for anything anymore.

308
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,722
I want the tit!

309
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,093
Well, see? That's better.

310
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,722
That's what I'm talking about.

311
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,732
I like this guy.

312
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,597
Yeah, he seems kind of sweet.

313
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,467
Excuse me, um, s-sir?

314
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,775
Dr. P.

315
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,370
What exactly does
this class teach?

316
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,210
What?

317
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,409
Well, my friend
seemed to imply

318
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,816
that this was more of
a confidence-building...

319
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,185
This is not a goddamn
Tony Robbins seminar.

320
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,816
If you're looking
for <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i>,

321
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,759
just get the fuck
out of here.

322
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,490
Um, I'm sorry.

323
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,929
Never be sorry.

324
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,262
Oh. I'm sorry.
I mean...

325
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,165
I mean, um...

326
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,931
Never mind.

327
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,267
I have a question.

328
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,935
Uh, my wife says I'm a pushover,
but what if deep down inside

329
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,739
I'm really just a nice guy?

330
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,109
Fuck nice.

331
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,512
That's a bunch of dog shit.

332
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,013
That's it for today.

333
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,386
I'm sick of looking
at your faces.

334
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,391
Excuse me, um,
will every class run

335
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,790
five minutes and 25...

336
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,988
Wait, please. That...
contains very important mat...

337
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,990
Goodness.

338
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,248
Be a good boy.

339
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,222
All right, I'll be
back in a little bit.

340
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
Great. Bye.

341
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,598
Geez, you scared me, Roger.

342
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,932
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,101
What are you doing,
just hanging out in here?

344
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,701
No, I'm... I was
throwing some stuff out.

345
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,836
I heard someone
coming and...

346
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,779
Penguins, huh? Hmm.

347
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,874
I always saw you more as
a flannel pj's kind of guy.

348
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,611
I have those, too.

349
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,812
I'm kidding.

350
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,081
I know.

351
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,280
But I do have 'em.

352
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:25,055
Anyway, I, uh, have
to go to work, so...

353
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,404
- Hey, Amanda?
- Yeah?

354
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,270
Can I ask you something?

355
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,868
- Yeah, no worries. What is it?
- Um...

356
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,778
Oh, yeah. Uh, I saw
this awesome documentary

357
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,440
on TV the other night.

358
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,451
It was all about Australia--
you would have loved it.

359
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,543
No way.

360
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,883
Very cool country.

361
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,548
I wish I was from there.

362
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,384
That's nice.

363
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,915
Um...

364
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,894
Yeah.

365
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,260
Was there something else?

366
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,323
Uh... no. I...

367
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,334
Was there something else
you had...

368
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,030
No, you just...
you said-said...

369
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,936
Anyways, uh,
I'll try and get you

370
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,598
a tape of that
documentary. Um...

371
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,938
Great. Yeah.

372
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,442
I have to go, so thanks.

373
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,501
Uh...

374
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:18,847
Oh, yeah.

375
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,909
Come on, Roger.

376
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,786
I mean, you got to give it
some time at least.

377
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,450
I'm telling you,
this class is going to be

378
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,823
the best thing
you've ever done.

379
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,657
I just don't get it.

380
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,425
I mean, is he for real?

381
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,954
Yeah, he's for real.

382
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,624
He's very real.

383
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,966
Hey, read the sign:
"No eating in the pool."

384
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,632
Jesus.

385
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,335
Look, I know it seems
weird at first, okay?

386
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,570
I get it, you know?

387
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,579
But you just got
to keep an open mind.

388
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,548
I tried, but I'm not even
sure I understand

389
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,345
what he's teaching,
you know?

390
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,648
Look, I'll make it
real simple for you.

391
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,247
He's teaching you whatever
it is you need to learn.

392
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,787
I don't know.

393
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,761
Maybe this class
just isn't for me.

394
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,319
Oh, Roger.

395
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,093
Look, honestly?

396
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,032
I felt the same way
when I started,

397
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:13,163
but then, I took a good long,
hard look in the mirror,

398
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,763
and you know what?

399
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,706
I didn't like what I saw.

400
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,073
What's he doing here?

401
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,837
I came to talk to Ian,
Wally, not you.

402
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,745
Don't make this weird, Roger.

403
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,150
It's over between us;
I've moved on.

404
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,881
Well, I've also moved on.

405
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,082
I mean, no offense, but...

406
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,389
my life's been, like, ten times
better ever since you left.

407
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,088
At least.

408
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,653
Yeah, right.

409
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,062
Whatever.

410
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,430
Get over it, asshole.

411
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,900
I am over it!

412
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,733
Loser.

413
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,262
I hate him.

414
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,868
Wow.

415
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,310
Roger, seriously.

416
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,974
If I were you...

417
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,141
I'd stay in the class.

418
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,583
You need it.

419
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,715
<i>What does it take to be</i>
<i>king of the jungle?</i>

420
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,218
Do you have to be the fastest?

421
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,062
Or the strongest?

422
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,727
No.

423
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:21,728
Because do you know what the
lion's most powerful weapon is?

424
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,900
It's his roar.

425
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,503
It's that roar
that enables the lion

426
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,208
to take what is rightfully his.

427
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,307
Diego, stop scratching
your nuts.

428
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,842
Sorry.

429
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,514
It's time you guys
got your shit together.

430
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,185
I want to see
some goddamn lions!

431
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,822
You see that?

432
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,856
You think a lion asks
for his dinner?

433
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,527
He takes it!

434
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,197
What does he do?
Let me hear you say it.

435
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,262
He takes it.

436
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,433
- Louder!
- He takes it!

437
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,638
Do you think a lion
asks for a promotion?

438
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,145
He takes it!

439
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,147
Does a lion wait
for approval?

440
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,614
He takes it!

441
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,913
Right now, none of
you are worth shit,

442
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,080
but starting tonight,
we're going to shed our skin

443
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,420
and become something
entirely new.

444
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,550
Forget your past lives,
gentlemen.

445
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,427
From this point on,
you're all lions.

446
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,601
Your next class
is to begin at any place,

447
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,108
at any time,

448
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,735
so be ready.

449
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,544
I'm not done.

450
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,639
This...

451
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,081
is a beeper.

452
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,085
You will each be given one.

453
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,746
When your beeper goes off,

454
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,313
you will initiate
a confrontation immediately.

455
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,882
If you fail

456
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,224
to follow these simple orders,

457
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,355
you will be expelled,

458
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,058
with no refund.

459
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,225
What?

460
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,600
How will you even know
if we follow the orders?

461
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,902
Yeah. What are we, under
surveillance or something?

462
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,373
Yeah.

463
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,171
Yes.

464
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,740
Now, get the hell

465
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,309
out of here.

466
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,123
The kid's like, 16,
17 years old, you know.

467
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,352
Tap on the window.

468
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,258
"Officer, Officer, please,

469
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,922
"please, if I get
one more ticket,

470
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,123
my dad's gonna kill me,
all right?"

471
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,496
I say to him,

472
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,932
"Kid, please, if I don't

473
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,562
give you this ticket,
I ain't gonna make my quota."

474
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,605
And he's...

475
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,441
He was mad.

476
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,846
What is he, a pimp now?

477
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,048
Give me a dollar;
I want a Danish.

478
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,774
You know what?
I'll take that.

479
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,505
No, whoa, whoa, Roger.

480
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,605
What the hell
are you doing?

481
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,208
I always get
the last Danish.

482
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,479
You know how it works.

483
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,486
Well, too bad.

484
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,613
I'm hungry.

485
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,218
Roger...

486
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,559
I will kill you.

487
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,258
Give me back my
cherry Danish.

488
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,529
Hey, is that the
new <i>Star</i> magazine?

489
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,626
Thanks.

490
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,068
It's supposed to be
a great issue.

491
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,276
What, did you forget to take
your medication this morning?

492
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,437
No, Zack.

493
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,769
You know what?

494
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,044
I have a little something
called pride.

495
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,551
Remember that.

496
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,817
Ooh...

497
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,451
Who gets the last
cherry Danish?!

498
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,551
Zack does!

499
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,424
Zack what?!

500
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,520
Zack gets the last
cherry Danish!

501
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,634
Yeah, that's right!

502
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,132
Yo, that's what
I'm talking about!

503
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,705
Evening,
Mr. Schultz.

504
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,046
Time for dinner,
all right?

505
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,133
Give me that.

506
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,243
Hey, keep it down, huh?

507
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,839
I'm trying to read the paper.

508
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,786
What'd you just
say, homey?

509
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,813
How would you like
to die, man?

510
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,757
No, uh...

511
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,726
how would <i>you</i> like to die?

512
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,750
What?!

513
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,126
Hey, come on, man.

514
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,464
What the hell
is he doing?

515
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,799
Honey... honey, I...

516
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,998
Hey!

517
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,786
This is not cool.

518
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,380
Why would he bring us
all the way out here?

519
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,857
All I know is, last night,

520
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,291
I tried getting tough
with my roommate.

521
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,158
He kicked me out.

522
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,663
I had to sleep in a Kinko's.

523
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,724
Yeah, well, I stood up
to a guy at my work,

524
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,395
and he gave me
a swirly.

525
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,301
Hey, no way.
I got a swirly, too.

526
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,397
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry.

527
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,908
What exactly
is a swirly?

528
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,842
It's when someone dunks
your head in the toilet

529
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,312
and then flushes it
on your face.

530
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,646
Totally rocks your world,
but not in the good way.

531
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,345
Oh.

532
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,183
I received one
of those as well.

533
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,712
"I'd like to move out
of my mother's basement

534
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,351
and up into the main house."

535
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,658
Wow, you're shooting for
the stars, aren't you, Walsh?

536
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,431
"My goal is to make
another $3,000 a year."

537
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,867
Well, let me tell you
something, Ernie.

538
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,871
This class is five grand--
you're already behind.

539
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:31,399
"I want my wife
to stop abusing me."

540
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:35,243
Jesus Christ, Diego,
you got to be shitting me.

541
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,044
I thought those questionnaires
are supposed to be confidential.

542
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,109
News flash:

543
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,278
I lie.

544
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,756
Now, in those bags
are 15 semiautomatic

545
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,451
high-powered paintball guns.

546
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,925
Pass them out.

547
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,927
You will
trust no one.

548
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,396
It is time to kill
or be killed.

549
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,194
Um, what are
the teams?

550
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,360
There are no teams-- it's
every man for himself.

551
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,892
No helmets?

552
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,167
No helmets,
no goggles,

553
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,174
no nothing.

554
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,176
And if that's
not enough,

555
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,236
somewhere out there
in those woods,

556
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,338
Lesher's there,
just waiting.

557
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,844
It says here to maintain
a minimum distance

558
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,754
of 100 feet between
shooter and target, though.

559
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,690
Oh! My God!

560
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,556
Now, does anybody else

561
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,391
want to read
their gun?

562
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,487
Huh?

563
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,519
Uh, when do we start?

564
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,895
Now.

565
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,535
He already shot me!

566
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,071
Are you guys a
bunch of retards?

567
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,548
Spread out!

568
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,050
My eye!

569
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,494
Walsh!

570
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,723
- I'm sorry!
- My eye!

571
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,890
I'm so sorry!

572
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,559
It's okay! I'm here!

573
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,567
Oh, I'm so sorry.

574
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,068
Are you okay?

575
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,161
Gotcha.

576
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,433
Never trust anyone.

577
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,874
I thought we
were friends.

578
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,071
You know what
Dr. P says:

579
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,945
"Friends are just obstacles
that stand between you

580
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,142
and success."

581
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,811
Touché.

582
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,150
Not so fast, gentlemen.

583
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,919
Looks like we got
ourselves a situation.

584
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,926
What are we gonna do?

585
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,589
Every man
for himself.

586
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,325
You know the rules.

587
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,772
Well, well, well.

588
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,673
What do we have here?

589
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,776
Looks like you three are
in a pickle, doesn't it?

590
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,180
Throw your weapons down.

591
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:36,482
Now!

592
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,354
Eyes off me!

593
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,331
Eeny, meeny,

594
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,595
miny, moe...

595
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,760
What you looking at, man?

596
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,431
Don't look at me.

597
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,202
Dude, this is not cool.

598
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,299
No talking.

599
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,935
Haven't you done
enough to us already?!

600
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,468
Oh, I don't know, ladies.

601
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,479
You know what?

602
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,447
It's gonna get a whole lot worse

603
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,474
before it gets any better--
understand that.

604
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,349
What more are you
planning to do to us?

605
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,376
Who knows?

606
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,355
I just tend to go
with the flow.

607
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,483
Let's just see where
things take us.

608
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,055
I tend to get very,

609
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,825
very creative in these
type of situations.

610
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,498
Hey, Lesher.

611
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,262
I shot Lesher!

612
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,796
Whoo!

613
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,826
Roger!

614
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,388
Whoo!

615
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,865
Hey, Roger.

616
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,094
Roger!

617
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,797
Dr. P wants
to talk to you.

618
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,828
Alone.

619
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,577
You wanted to see me?

620
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,676
Congratulations.

621
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,244
You did well today.

622
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,721
I'm impressed.

623
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,623
Oh. Thank you.

624
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,853
Who knows?

625
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,691
Maybe one day, I'll
teach the class.

626
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,562
What was your name again?

627
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,728
Roger.

628
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,101
Right. Roger.

629
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,629
So tell me, Roger,

630
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,939
why did you sign up
for this class?

631
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,875
Well...

632
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,676
it's kind of
complicated.

633
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,204
What's her name?

634
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,810
Um... Amanda.

635
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,788
She lives in
my building.

636
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:52,949
What does she do?

637
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:56,686
Well, she's
Australian...

638
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,697
She works as an Australian?

639
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,892
No, uh...

640
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,059
Sorry, I'm kind
of nervous.

641
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,126
That's okay.

642
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,602
Relax. It's all right.

643
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:10,767
Um, she's a grad
student, and...

644
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,368
she volunteers at
an animal shelter.

645
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,436
Jesus, that's
an easy takedown.

646
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,277
You don't even need me.

647
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,112
It's a slam dunk.

648
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,779
Well, nothing's ever
a slam dunk for me.

649
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,925
Listen to me, Roger.

650
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,928
You did good today.

651
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,863
You became the hunter,

652
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,527
and you set
your sights on Lesher.

653
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,264
Now you have to set
your sights on her.

654
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:46,935
Roger, there are two types
of men in this world:

655
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,774
those who run shit,
like me,

656
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,749
and those who eat shit,
like you.

657
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,952
I don't think
I could sleep tonight.

658
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,390
I'm too pumped.

659
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:06,488
I'll sleep, but not until
well after midnight.

660
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:10,262
You know, I think maybe we're
all turning a corner here.

661
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,428
I know you are;
you're his golden boy.

662
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,439
- Yeah. -What were you guys
talking about for so long?

663
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,464
Just stuff.

664
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,066
Dr. P is a pretty
cool guy.

665
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,805
For the first
time in my life,

666
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,813
I actually feel
like I have a shot.

667
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,314
Things are going
to change.

668
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,440
I can feel it.

669
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,041
I know what I'm
going to do.

670
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,917
I'm going to leave
that bitch.

671
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,785
I'm going to walk out the door
and start over.

672
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,120
I don't care
if she is my mother,

673
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,523
there's a million other
basements in this city

674
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,460
that I can live in.

675
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,926
I'm a good man,
and I

676
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,491
deserve respect.

677
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,865
If they won't
give it to me...

678
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,875
then I'm going to take it.

679
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,436
I'm ready to live
the life that I deserve.

680
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,413
The life we deserve.

681
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,473
To the life we deserve!

682
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,451
Whoo!

683
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,852
I'm gonna need
another beer.

684
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,054
All right.

685
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,459
Time to start running things.

686
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,626
Got to take what's yours.

687
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,899
Life is my bitch.

688
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,769
I'm gonna be a lion.

689
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,038
A lion with balls--
lots of balls.

690
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,567
What are you doing?

691
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,080
Uh, nothing.

692
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,638
I was just about to knock.

693
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,209
I heard you say "balls,"
like, ten times.

694
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,280
Um, can I please
speak with Amanda?

695
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,814
Why are you
breathing so hard?

696
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,453
Ugh! It's gross.

697
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,087
Could you please
just get her?

698
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:48,832
Amanda,

699
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,493
Roger's here,
and apparently,

700
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,059
that's more important than
an international call

701
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,072
to your parents.

702
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,505
Yeah, all right.

703
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,167
All right,
we'll talk later.

704
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,836
Love you. Bye.

705
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:00,844
Hi.

706
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,005
Hi. Um, so...

707
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,514
Are you okay?

708
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,881
Yeah. I'm... fine. I'm...

709
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,886
So I was just wondering, um...

710
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:10,885
if you...

711
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,513
have...

712
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:14,524
What's wrong?

713
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,422
Roger!

714
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,891
Sure you're okay?

715
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,698
Yeah. I'm fine.

716
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,297
I just pass out sometimes.

717
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,307
Happens, you know?

718
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,139
Nice picture.

719
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,439
That's perfect.

720
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,445
Is that my wallet?

721
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,674
What kind of license is this?

722
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,548
I-It's a C-1.

723
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,314
It's mandatory for operating
a parking rover.

724
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,582
C-Can I please
have it back?

725
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,782
That is sad.

726
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,848
Becky, please.

727
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,861
Can I get you
some water or something?

728
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,192
No. You know what?

729
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,924
I really should
get going.

730
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,864
You guys have done so
much for me, and...

731
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,802
I... I don't want to be a
bother anymore, you know?

732
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,464
Yeah, but are you
still dizzy?

733
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,302
I-I don't want you
to take another fall.

734
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,502
No. I'm so used to it.

735
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,238
It happens so often.

736
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:11,806
Um... Um, but...

737
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,580
there's this thing
I wanted to ask you.

738
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,213
Um... do you want to go

739
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,713
have dinner Friday
night with me?

740
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,989
Well, that depends--
if we go out,

741
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,394
are you gonna face the door
the whole night, or...?

742
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:34,898
No. I can face you.

743
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,135
Then, yeah, Friday it is.

744
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,608
Really?

745
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,133
Are you sure?

746
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,873
Want to talk me
out of it?

747
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,880
No...

748
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,279
You're right, I-I
should get going.

749
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,013
Thank... thank
you so much.

750
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,020
Yeah, okay.

751
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,282
Um... thank you.

752
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,017
All right.

753
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,217
Th-Thank you so much.

754
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,249
Bye.

755
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,560
This, um...

756
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,226
wine is really good.

757
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,861
Mine is very tasty, too.

758
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,031
Good.

759
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,098
So where did you say
you were from again?

760
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,573
Keep whistling, I'm
gonna bite those lips

761
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,378
right off your
goddamn face.

762
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,941
Sorry.

763
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:21,952
Cindy,

764
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,318
stay in the moment,
honey, okay?

765
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,381
I'm sorry, what was that?

766
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,484
I really like your hair.
It's...

767
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,824
Wrong answer.

768
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,954
Excellent.

769
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,799
Okay, now who can tell me
what Eli did wrong?

770
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:41,772
Walsh.

771
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,068
He complimented her.

772
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,438
Correct.

773
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,965
He complimented her.

774
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,102
Which is one
of our rules:

775
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,703
no compliments ever.

776
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,612
Okay, let's review.

777
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,514
"Always get the girl alone."

778
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,452
We work one-on-
one, people.

779
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,216
You separate the
prey from the herd.

780
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,222
Next.

781
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,121
"Lie, lie, lie some more."

782
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,683
Yes, until you have

783
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,127
something real to
offer, you lie.

784
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,528
You lie about
everything.

785
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,359
Yes.

786
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,096
What if you're looking for,

787
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,933
like, you know,
a real girlfriend?

788
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,268
Can we please just get
everyone laid first?

789
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,604
I swear, if one of you

790
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,166
gets an handjob out of this,
I'm a miracle worker.

791
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,111
Okay, Cindy's ready for
another date. Who's up?

792
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,382
Come on, faggots!

793
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,542
Who's next?

794
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,415
Yeah, you know how it is.

795
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,149
I think I can do some good,

796
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,521
maybe volunteer
for five hours a week.

797
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,889
And then, all of a sudden,

798
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,951
it's a full-time job,
making exactly

799
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,963
zero dollars a year.

800
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,396
Ah, I'm sorry.

801
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,400
I'm babbling.

802
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,628
Shut up.

803
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,329
No, no, it's okay.

804
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,771
It's so funny--
I-I parallel those values.

805
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,069
Sorry?

806
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:54,441
Oh, I mean, that's something
we have in common.

807
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,309
You complain a lot?

808
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,405
No, I mean...

809
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,848
the, um, volunteering.

810
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,011
I volunteer at
the Big Brothers program.

811
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,519
Ah, no way.

812
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:08,218
Yeah, in fact, I'm kind of
the top brother at the place.

813
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,284
All the kids look up to me--
it's pretty cute.

814
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,227
That's great, Roger.

815
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,130
My brother could have used
someone like you growing up.

816
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,030
Really?

817
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,864
Yeah, uh, it's just...

818
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,804
my father walked out on us when
we were little, and, you know,

819
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,329
it was especially
hard on him.

820
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,568
Right,

821
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,337
right, right, right.

822
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,574
Yeah, I can relate to that
in a big way.

823
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,912
You can?

824
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,851
Yeah.

825
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,820
Um...

826
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:41,951
'cause, you know, my...
my father walked out on us, too.

827
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,425
Wow.

828
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,125
Hey, you okay?

829
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,532
Huh?

830
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,629
Oh, um... yeah.

831
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,732
I'm fine.

832
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:58,935
Yech.

833
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,807
Yuck...

834
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:01,811
- What?
- Can't look.

835
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,107
That. It's the worst.

836
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,444
Who wants to see
your dinner...

837
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,644
alive ten minutes before
you're gonna eat it?

838
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,879
It's gross.

839
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,886
Huh.

840
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,820
You know what
they say?

841
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:12,913
That when you
boil lobsters,

842
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,322
you can actually
hear them scream.

843
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,088
How sad is that?

844
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,154
What's up?

845
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,631
We got to go.

846
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,730
Why? What happened?

847
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,138
Nothing. Get your coat.

848
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,243
Taxi!

849
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,081
Ah, the East River.

850
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,555
Every lobster's dream.

851
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,024
Go north, little man.

852
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:25,654
It's only 400 miles
to Maine.

853
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,064
What?

854
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,065
Just you.

855
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,363
Careful.

856
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,495
You're supposed to
be my shy neighbor.

857
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,437
Since when do you
do things like this?

858
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,269
Since always.

859
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,502
You just never really knew me.

860
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,943
Yeah, I guess I didn't.

861
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,947
Wow.

862
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,619
My head's spinning.

863
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,685
You're not gonna pass out
on me again, are you?

864
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,891
No. Seriously.

865
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,491
Everything's spinning.

866
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,300
I might be allergic
to some of those weeds.

867
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,465
I feel a little dizzy.

868
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,907
Uh, maybe you're
just a little drunk.

869
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,637
No.

870
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,908
That couldn't be it.

871
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,437
Oh, my God.

872
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,245
Have you ever been
drunk before?

873
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:24,884
Please. Are you kidding me?

874
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,618
Try, like, every weekend,
ever since I was 11.

875
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,388
Whoa, whoa!

876
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,123
Okay.

877
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,221
Keys. Can I have...

878
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,231
Hey, hey.

879
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,459
Can I have the
keys, please?

880
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,092
Come on, come on.

881
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,693
Nice. Thank you.

882
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,640
Ow!

883
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,198
Ow, ow!

884
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,944
Okay, okay.

885
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,474
Yes, bed!

886
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,478
We made it.

887
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,919
Yes!

888
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,423
Thank you so much
for coming.

889
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,549
Can I get you anything?

890
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,786
No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

891
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:03,815
You sleep.

892
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,696
Oh, man.

893
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,324
Hey. Hey.

894
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,198
Look into my eyes.

895
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,170
We're not
spinning, okay?

896
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,662
We're very, very still.

897
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,074
Yeah.

898
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,510
I have a question.

899
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,018
Do you think I'm a lion?

900
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,644
What?

901
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,712
Do you think I'm a lion?
You know...

902
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,816
Um...

903
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,793
do you want
to be a lion?

904
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,353
Yes.

905
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,762
Very much.

906
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,428
Then, yes, you are a lion.

907
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,460
Now go to sleep.

908
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,474
I had a nice time tonight.

909
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:54,943
Hey, Amanda.

910
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,843
I totally love you.

911
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,317
Okay, that's nice.

912
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,513
Good night.

913
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,296
Hell you doing here, boy?

914
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,100
Oh, hell, no!

915
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,929
Those are my sneakers.

916
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,097
What?

917
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,574
My standard-issue New Balances.

918
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,272
You're wearing them,
and I want them back.

919
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,438
Whoa, whoa.

920
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,640
Look, I got this.

921
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,581
- Nah, nah, I'm getting him.
- I got this.

922
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,879
I got this.

923
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,816
You got to shoot him, right?

924
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,377
You're right.
My bad.

925
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,286
How about instead of your shoes,

926
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:16,724
I give you a standard-
issue beat-down

927
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,785
in front of all
these nice people, huh?

928
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,990
The boy done slipped

929
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,000
and fell into a pile
of ass-whupping, y'all.

930
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,262
You're not understanding me.

931
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,270
Nobody steals my sneakers.

932
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,898
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hold on a minute.

933
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,976
Did you say he
stole your shoes?

934
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,246
Yes, ma'am.

935
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,147
You told me you won
those shoes at a raffle.

936
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,206
I-I did.

937
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,547
It was a different
kind of raffle.

938
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,677
Wasn't nobody else
there but me.

939
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:43,686
You're lying.

940
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,914
Give him back
his damn shoes

941
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,183
before I beat the
black off you.

942
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,691
Mama, not in front
of all my people...

943
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:50,624
Shut up.

944
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:55,120
Don't make me
start praying, boy.

945
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,598
What the hell
you want to wear

946
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,794
meter maid shoes
for anyhow?

947
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,700
Don't you have
any self-respect?

948
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:01,726
Lawrence was
there, too.

949
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,739
He shot...

950
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,762
Get your behinds
home now.

951
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:04,865
Ms. Washington...

952
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,874
Now!

953
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,570
Yo, that's embarrassing.

954
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,137
Punked out. Yo, B.

955
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,909
Excuse me, do
you work here?

956
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,069
Sorry?

957
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,381
I told you--
the man's a genius.

958
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,576
He is.

959
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,312
What a sweet guy, too.

960
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,218
I know, right?

961
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,245
So let me ask you:

962
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,917
who's the guy
this semester?

963
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,220
What do you mean?

964
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,284
You know, who's the guy
who's doing really well?

965
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,353
Who's the standout?

966
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,456
Well, not to
brag, but...

967
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,059
it's probably me;
you know, I...

968
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,093
had a lot of luck
in the classes,

969
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,367
and, uh, done pretty well
in the field.

970
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,533
Are you kidding?

971
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,510
No. Why?

972
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:15,977
What's wrong?

973
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,245
Look, man, Dr. P is cool, but...

974
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,841
he's also extremely competitive.

975
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,477
I mean, he doesn't like
showboats.

976
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,317
Relax.

977
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,220
He's totally taken me
under his wing.

978
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:31,659
Oh, dude, you don't...

979
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,526
All right, there was
this guy in my class;

980
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,724
his name was Lonnie Ratcliff.
All right?

981
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,826
He was, he was a quick learner,
he was made for this stuff.

982
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,360
But he got too good, too fast.

983
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,533
Dr. P saw this
and just destroyed him.

984
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,372
I mean, crushed his whole world.

985
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:51,074
Poor guy ended up having to move
to Peekskill or some shit.

986
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,446
Why would he do that?

987
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,110
I don't know.

988
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,245
Love of the game.

989
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,517
Keeps him sharp.

990
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,457
Just be careful, all right?

991
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,516
Tone it down a bit.

992
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,788
Try to stay in the background.

993
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,922
I mean, that's what I do.

994
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,898
And look at me, dude.

995
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,634
I'm awesome.

996
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:18,272
God, it's so good to talk
to someone about books.

997
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,800
I feel like all my friends
want to do is talk about bad TV.

998
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,915
I know exactly what you mean.

999
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,417
Well, this has been
great, Dennis.

1000
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,885
Oh, do I call you
"Doctor"?

1001
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,148
Oh, no, please.

1002
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,349
I-I hear "Doctor" all
day long in surgery,

1003
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,880
so "Dennis" is fine.

1004
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,623
What?

1005
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,131
I don't know.

1006
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,464
It's just, the way you
squint when you're nervous,

1007
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,936
it just reminds me
of Sarah, that's all.

1008
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,405
Who's Sarah?

1009
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,964
Well, Sarah's my wife.

1010
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,135
Um, she passed away
three years ago.

1011
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,941
God, I'm...

1012
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,610
I'm so sorry.
That's awful.

1013
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,643
Oh, no, sorry is something
she never wanted to feel.

1014
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,248
And she would hate
it if she thought

1015
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,451
I was feeling
sorry for myself.

1016
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,189
It's just so hard.

1017
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,662
How do you deal with it?

1018
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,891
What do you do?

1019
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,922
Throw myself into my work.

1020
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,370
Every time I start
feeling lonely or...

1021
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:25,306
bad for myself,
you know,

1022
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,867
I-I look into the eyes

1023
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,902
of those little sick children...

1024
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,214
...and it...

1025
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,243
everything else goes away.

1026
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,778
It's, um...

1027
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,121
pretty sobering.

1028
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,731
What?

1029
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,325
Uh, hey, Becky.

1030
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,358
Is Amanda here?

1031
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,337
I brought her something.

1032
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,532
What is it?

1033
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,541
I got her some tickets
to a play.

1034
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,270
What play?

1035
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,040
"Movin' Out,"
the Billy Joel musical.

1036
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,639
"Moving Out" is not a play.

1037
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,208
Fine.
What would you call it?

1038
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,446
I don't know.

1039
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,216
A gay?

1040
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,347
Whatever.

1041
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,688
Look, when is she
coming back?

1042
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,020
It's hard to say.

1043
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,553
She's out with
this guy she just met.

1044
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,202
Well, do you know
where they are?

1045
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,671
Why would I tell you
where they are?

1046
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,298
So you can go find her

1047
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,935
and murder her
and shoot him

1048
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,638
and then eat them
and stab yourself, Dahmer?

1049
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,375
I just want to talk to her.

1050
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,844
Fine. Give me the flowers.

1051
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,186
Nicely!

1052
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,327
Hi, Becky.
I got you some flowers.

1053
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,354
Oh!

1054
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,665
And the tickets.

1055
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,604
Uh, hey, Dr. P, it's Roger.

1056
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,402
Sorry to be
calling you off hours,

1057
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,033
but I kind of have a situation.

1058
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,010
I think Amanda's
seeing someone else,

1059
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,103
and I'm just looking
for some last minute advice.

1060
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,478
I mean, should I jump in
and confront the guy,

1061
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,142
showing off my animal side,

1062
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,880
or, I don't know, maybe should
I manipulate the situ...

1063
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,297
What the hell's
going on?

1064
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,098
What are you doing in here?

1065
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,900
I saw you with Amanda,

1066
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,406
and I want to know
what's going on.

1067
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,001
It's called competition.
It'll do wonders for you.

1068
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,604
I have plenty of
competition in my life, okay?

1069
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,806
It's hard enough.

1070
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,474
Every once in a while,

1071
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,575
a shepherd has to pluck
a sheep from the herd

1072
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:22,846
and challenge him.

1073
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,150
It let's the man know
he's worthy of leading.

1074
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,382
Well, you know what?

1075
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,084
I don't want to be
a shepherd anymore.

1076
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:29,921
You're not the shepherd,
dumb ass.

1077
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,153
I'm the shepherd.

1078
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,061
It's called
an analogy, moron.

1079
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,622
Look, you don't
understand.

1080
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,658
Everything was going
so well between us.

1081
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:41,364
Oh, clearly.

1082
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,837
I'm sure you're
just days away

1083
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,737
from adopting
a Chinese kid together.

1084
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,106
It's not that difficult.

1085
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:50,601
Use what you've learned
and defeat me.

1086
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:54,208
If you can't do that, you know,
you don't deserve her anyway.

1087
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,775
I paid you
for this class.

1088
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,447
And you're getting
your money's worth.

1089
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,251
Game on, Roger.

1090
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,757
As far as Amanda knows,

1091
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,817
my name is Dennis
and I'm a successful surgeon.

1092
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,887
You are a successful
meter maid.

1093
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,489
So may the best man win.

1094
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,831
This is really an amazing club.

1095
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,861
Thanks for bringing us here.

1096
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,600
Well, just take it
easy on me.

1097
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,074
These aren't the knees of
a spring chicken, you know?

1098
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,737
Please, that sounds
like a setup, mister.

1099
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,370
Well, at least leave
the hands alone,

1100
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,347
because I'm in surgery
all day tomorrow, okay?

1101
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,542
Deal.

1102
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,584
What are those?

1103
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,384
Oh, those are, uh,
frozen lemon towelettes.

1104
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,254
They tend to overdo it here.

1105
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,485
Just a little.

1106
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,687
Could you pass me one of
those lemon towelettes?

1107
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,753
Roger, hey.
What are you doing here?

1108
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:42,890
Well, you know,
I thought I'd drop by,

1109
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,331
hit a few balls.

1110
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,301
Is this your dad?

1111
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,065
What? No.

1112
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,537
No, this is Dennis.

1113
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,301
Dennis, um,
is a friend of mine.

1114
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,832
This is Roger.
He lives in my building.

1115
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,071
Hey, Roger.

1116
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,875
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, sir.

1117
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,075
Dahmer plays tennis?

1118
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,674
I got to see Dahmer
play tennis.

1119
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,016
Oh, you know, I've been
known to mess around a bit.

1120
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,987
I have an idea-- why
don't we play doubles?

1121
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,387
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

1122
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,686
- Play girls against guys.
- Are you sure?

1123
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,158
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, it's be fun.

1124
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,660
Now, I don't want
to be an intrusion.

1125
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,252
No, no. Come
on, join us.

1126
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,355
Oh... okay, great

1127
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,893
Nice one.

1128
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,334
I loved the dad comment.

1129
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,965
There's more where
that came from... Dennis.

1130
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,608
All right, let's go,
Billie Jean.

1131
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,017
Let's see what
you've got.

1132
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,791
First fault.
Sorry.

1133
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,888
That sucked.

1134
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,296
All right, hey.

1135
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,299
It sucks.

1136
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,925
Be careful, Dennis.

1137
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:04,880
Ooh, sorry.
Double fault.

1138
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:05,880
You all right,
Dennis?

1139
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,110
Oh, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1140
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,142
Love-15.

1141
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,622
Watch your ass, Roger.

1142
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,055
Ooh, nervous.

1143
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,217
Yeah.

1144
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:32,069
Oh, my God.
Dennis.

1145
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:33,803
Oh, man. I am so sorry.

1146
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,140
I thought
I had it.

1147
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,702
You want to take
a break?

1148
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,874
That's cool. It happens.

1149
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:43,044
Roger, can I talk
to you for a second?

1150
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,917
Yeah.

1151
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,047
Everything all right?

1152
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,421
Yeah, of course.

1153
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,449
That was a mistake.
Sorry about that.

1154
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:53,326
You know, Dennis
and I are just friends.

1155
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,422
Yeah, I understand.
That's cool.

1156
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:59,697
Okay. So this isn't
a jealousy thing?

1157
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:01,727
Amanda, I'm fine.

1158
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,569
You can be friends
with whoever you want.

1159
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,632
Okay, just checking.

1160
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,871
But he is kind of old.

1161
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,775
He's a widower; be nice.

1162
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,781
Sure you're okay, Dennis?

1163
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:21,790
Oh, yeah,
I'm fine; fine.

1164
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,523
You know, actually, I think
I'm gonna stand back here.

1165
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,160
Sorry about that.

1166
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,898
Brand-new racket.

1167
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,032
Still getting used to it.

1168
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,735
It's all right.

1169
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,074
No problem, Roger.

1170
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,734
- Ow!
- Roger!

1171
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,934
Do you have
a problem with me?

1172
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,563
- Yeah, a big problem.
- Hey...

1173
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,134
Hey! Hey! Hey! You guys!

1174
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,577
Stop it! Break it up!

1175
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,071
Roger, get off him.
Get off him!

1176
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,086
Listen.

1177
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,851
I know what's going on, and
I think it's awful, okay?

1178
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,551
I am sorry, Dennis.

1179
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,753
You don't deserve
to be treated this way.

1180
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,694
It's okay, sweetie,
it's not your fault.

1181
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,494
You owe him an apology.

1182
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,398
Ow!

1183
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,204
Dennis! Oh, my...!

1184
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,438
Becky, get some help.

1185
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,503
Totally unnecessary.

1186
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:51,535
Deep breath.

1187
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,576
Did you really
tackle him?

1188
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:56,915
He challenged me.

1189
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,318
He threw down
his racket.

1190
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,446
Is he okay?

1191
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,547
What?!

1192
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,387
Dr. P--
did you hurt him?

1193
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:03,790
No, he's fine.

1194
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,120
It makes no sense.

1195
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,357
I mean, Dr. P could have
any woman in the world,

1196
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,831
why would he go after
your girl?

1197
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,333
Because he's sick.

1198
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,267
He thinks this whole thing
is a game.

1199
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,496
I don't know.

1200
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,732
You know, ever since I started
taking this class,

1201
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,263
things have been
going pretty well.

1202
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:19,831
It's like Dr. P says--

1203
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,707
I want the tit.

1204
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,177
It's true, we all do.

1205
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:27,273
I've got two chicks back at
my place who think I'm Moby.

1206
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,216
Not to mention, Dr. P

1207
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,686
is one of the smartest
people in the world.

1208
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,951
I mean, if he wants
to go out with Amanda,

1209
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,183
maybe it's for the best.

1210
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,816
What are you
talking about?

1211
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,022
You don't really have a lot
of choices, do you, Rog?

1212
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:43,760
I'm just gonna tell her.

1213
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,769
What are you
going to tell her?

1214
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,395
Everything--
I'm gonna tell her

1215
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,928
who he is, tell her
about the class...

1216
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,963
The class is
top secret, Roger.

1217
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,373
You know that.

1218
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,468
Besides, Lesher
might rape you.

1219
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,411
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, wait.

1220
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,244
Wait, what are you
talking about, Eli?

1221
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,715
Why would you
even say

1222
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,081
something like that, Eli?

1223
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:06,111
It's just an idea
of something bad

1224
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,884
that might happen.

1225
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,915
Look, you guys don't get it.

1226
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,449
I don't want
him near her.

1227
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,462
This isn't even
about me anymore.

1228
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,027
- What was that about, huh?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1229
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,434
- Why would you even
bring that up? -I'm sorry.

1230
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,029
Use your brain.

1231
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,369
I s-slipped up.

1232
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,398
Not cool, dude.

1233
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:30,037
Okay. As far as I'm concerned,
this meeting never happened.

1234
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,046
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1235
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,547
- Great.
- Okay.

1236
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,346
I knew he was
a psycho from day one.

1237
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,942
You know, because I get
a sense from people,

1238
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,817
and he had an energy
that was just,

1239
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,222
it was so...

1240
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,123
like, loser-ish.

1241
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,218
Yeah.

1242
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,956
Is there any other
sense you got?

1243
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:50,124
Wow, this guy is a
piece of work, huh?

1244
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,430
Yeah, I found this
on my nightstand.

1245
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,902
This is creepy.

1246
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,131
I've got to tell you,

1247
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,732
there's no doubt in my mind
you will be murdered.

1248
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,833
Are you serious?

1249
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,003
Yeah.

1250
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,376
Oh, my God.

1251
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,573
Hey, partner.

1252
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,913
Check it out.

1253
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,678
Excuse me.

1254
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,687
Here you go--
one chamomile tea.

1255
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,586
Thanks, Dennis.

1256
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,454
Don't worry--
everything's going to be okay.

1257
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:16,458
I'm here.

1258
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,687
I know.

1259
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,026
I just have
a few more questions.

1260
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,361
Is anything missing?

1261
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,388
Yeah.

1262
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:27,300
Kind of
embarrassing, but...

1263
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:28,701
all of my
underwear is gone.

1264
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:30,763
Oh.

1265
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,206
Well, first of all,
don't be embarrassed.

1266
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,674
It happens.

1267
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,371
Uh, secondly, um...

1268
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,209
can you, uh,
describe them for me?

1269
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:41,307
Um... you know,
were they thongs,

1270
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,648
Dutch cuts, full backs...?

1271
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:44,778
Is that really necessary?

1272
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,686
I could describe mine.

1273
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,815
Um, oh, wait, I
don't wear any.

1274
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,826
What's going on?

1275
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,623
Just keep your hands
where I can see them, sir.

1276
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,629
Wait, what happened?

1277
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,687
What are you guys
doing here?

1278
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,391
They're policemen.
What do you think

1279
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,899
- they're doing here?
- What?

1280
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,526
Come on, Roger, we
know you broke in.

1281
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:00,763
- Look at this.
- Wait, hold on.

1282
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,202
I know these guys.
They're not cops.

1283
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,535
- All right, buddy, come on.
- Ow!

1284
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:04,699
What are you doing?
Ernie?

1285
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,139
Just try to stay calm, sir.

1286
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,575
Look, I did not do this.

1287
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,408
I would never do this.
You know that.

1288
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,175
I was weak, all right?

1289
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,740
I wasn't happy with who I was,
so I took a class...

1290
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,342
from him.

1291
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:18,375
From Dennis?!

1292
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,616
His name's not Dennis,
it's Dr. P.

1293
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:21,816
Textbook paranoid behavior.

1294
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,086
I've seen it a million times.

1295
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,786
You guys, come on, tell her.

1296
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:25,851
Dewey, it's okay, baby.

1297
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,624
Go back to your
room, honey.

1298
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,597
Oh, he's probably scared.

1299
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:32,932
Dewey?

1300
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,299
Oh, my God.

1301
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,100
Sweetheart, what did
they do to you?

1302
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:39,130
Okay, who the hell
painted the goddamn dog?

1303
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,336
- Pretty awesome, right?
- No, not awesome.

1304
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,743
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Do you have any idea

1305
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,747
- what this dog's been through?
- Amanda, I didn't do that!

1306
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:46,748
Let's go, buddy.

1307
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:47,942
No, I'm not going!

1308
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:48,951
Oh, my God.

1309
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:49,952
- All right, calm down.
- Easy.

1310
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,417
- Nice and easy, sir.
- Come on down.

1311
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,421
- I got you.
- Stay back.

1312
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,717
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

1313
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:54,950
Okay, I got him!
I got him!

1314
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,287
Oh!

1315
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,803
Hey, Roger, uh, what do you
think of the uniforms?

1316
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,466
Pretty authentic, huh?

1317
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:15,140
I thought you guys
were my friends.

1318
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,405
Whatever, man.

1319
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,744
I guess we all
can't be lions.

1320
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,443
Yeah, at this point, uh,

1321
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,349
I'd say you're
more like a...

1322
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,478
like an emu.

1323
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,447
Good one, Ernie-- emu.

1324
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,823
Hey, uh, hey, emu,
check it out.

1325
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,321
Ow!

1326
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:37,730
This stuff is awesome.

1327
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,162
Ah!

1328
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,739
God!

1329
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,244
Ow!

1330
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,939
Goddamn it!

1331
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,617
Ow!

1332
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,188
Today's lesson
is dressing the part.

1333
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,528
Right now, you look
like a bunch of idiots,

1334
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,193
but we're going to fix that.

1335
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,225
This is called hair gel.

1336
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,294
Learn how to use it.

1337
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,898
Another thing--

1338
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,205
from now on, we wear sunglasses.

1339
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,335
Whether it's day or night,

1340
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,346
inside or out,

1341
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,644
no one ever sees your eyes.

1342
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:29,116
A little mystery
never hurt anybody.

1343
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,914
Yes, Eli?

1344
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,547
Um, how, uh, come
you don't wear sunglasses?

1345
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,251
Because I'm not you.

1346
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,920
Excuse me, sir.

1347
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,293
We have a little bit
of a situation outside.

1348
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,563
Hey!

1349
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:46,568
What are you doing?!

1350
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,296
Good evening, gentlemen.

1351
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,532
You got to be
shitting me.

1352
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,438
My name's Roger Waddell.

1353
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:55,308
And I'm exercising my authority
per statue 8-12...

1354
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,710
Why don't you
shut the hell up

1355
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,147
and unhook my goddamn car!

1356
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,615
I can't.

1357
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:04,881
You see, my chalk stick
confirmed a three-inch intrusion

1358
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,181
into the traffic lane.

1359
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,589
And then there's the matter
of four unpaid priors.

1360
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,024
You are so dead.

1361
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,995
Which brings us
to the broken headlight.

1362
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,632
Scuffed headlight.

1363
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,694
So...

1364
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:26,230
unpaid tickets,
towing and storage.

1365
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,675
And that comes to
a grand total of

1366
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,646
$1,663.00.

1367
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,238
You have ten days to pay it.

1368
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,447
I'm everywhere now.

1369
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,511
I'm like the wind.

1370
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,279
Ow!

1371
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,671
"Dear Sergeant Morehead,

1372
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,265
"I have tried
to hold back my feelings,

1373
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:02,471
"but I can't go on like this.

1374
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:03,876
"I am in love with you.

1375
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:08,109
"And it's clear
you feel the same way.

1376
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,608
"We need to figure out
a way to be together.

1377
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,986
"Without you,
I'm like an empty vase

1378
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,151
waiting for my Spanish rose."

1379
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,161
Sergeant, I swear...

1380
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,994
Roger, this happens to be one
of the most beautiful letters

1381
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,431
I have ever read.

1382
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,827
But I'm not that way.

1383
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,667
I didn't write
the letter.

1384
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,002
Please. You signed it,

1385
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,905
it has your
return address on it,

1386
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,909
and you sealed it
with a unicorn.

1387
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,878
Sergeant, can't you see?

1388
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,402
I'm being set up.

1389
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,439
That would be quite an elaborate
setup, don't you think?

1390
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,384
No, not really.

1391
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,819
All you need is a stamp
and a unicorn sticker.

1392
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:49,814
Look, Roger,
I'm flattered, really I am.

1393
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,850
But the department has
some pretty strict rules

1394
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:55,625
on sexual harassment.

1395
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,326
I'm going to have to let you go.

1396
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,628
You're not listening!

1397
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:00,329
I didn't write
the letter!

1398
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,961
I'm sorry.

1399
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,199
After you empty your locker,

1400
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,470
you can turn your uniform
and your sneakers in to Manny.

1401
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:14,473
You know what?

1402
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,075
You can have
the uniform.

1403
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,985
But I'm keeping the sneakers.

1404
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,671
Yeah! That's what
I thought, man!

1405
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:45,271
That's what I thought.

1406
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,047
What?

1407
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,419
Go back to work!

1408
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:54,923
- Right, Monty?
- Right.

1409
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,481
Right, Monty?

1410
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,117
Whatever.

1411
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,041
Thanks for meeting me.

1412
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,778
I come here a lot.

1413
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:26,686
It's quiet--
helps me think.

1414
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,156
I lost my job
yesterday.

1415
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,453
Yeah, sorry about that.

1416
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:33,826
It was a shit job anyway.

1417
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:36,696
But, hey, I got good news.

1418
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,461
I'm offering you a truce.

1419
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:42,903
Seriously, Roger.

1420
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,303
I mean, enough is enough.

1421
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,742
Fine.

1422
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,677
Just... leave
Amanda alone,

1423
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,646
and you'll never
see me again.

1424
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,084
Well, here's the thing:
it's not that easy.

1425
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,178
Normally, I'm not
the type of guy

1426
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:01,553
who falls in love with a chick.

1427
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,581
It's not what I do.

1428
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,557
But with Amanda,
something just clicked.

1429
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,087
You barely
even know her!

1430
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:11,429
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
take it down.

1431
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,994
Act like a man,
will you?

1432
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,573
Sorry, buddy, but, uh,

1433
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,841
I got to see
where this thing takes me.

1434
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,043
Here.

1435
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:31,416
What is this?

1436
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,443
It's a refund.

1437
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:33,614
It's half your tuition.

1438
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,783
Why half?

1439
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,816
Well, you did learn something.

1440
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,623
Hell, you even kissed my girl.

1441
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,390
I don't want
your money.

1442
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,163
Just trying to be
a gentleman, all right?

1443
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:54,166
You don't want me
to take the gloves off, Roger.

1444
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,700
I got to go.

1445
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:36,744
Yeah, what is it?

1446
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:37,752
Uh, yes,

1447
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,516
I'm looking for
Lonnie Ratcliff.

1448
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,547
Is he here?

1449
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:45,685
Who the hell are you?

1450
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:49,289
Hi. My name is
Roger Waddell.

1451
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,925
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a minute.

1452
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,094
And what would that be
pertaining to?

1453
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,901
Um, Dr. P.

1454
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,104
Go ahead, shoot me.

1455
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,049
Come on, do me.

1456
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,450
Do me.

1457
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:12,784
Right now.

1458
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,721
No.

1459
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,122
I'm not here to hurt you.

1460
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,923
Lie, lie and lie some more.

1461
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,394
You don't understand.

1462
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,022
I'm here because
I need your help.

1463
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,370
I want to know what
Dr. P did to you.

1464
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,804
Why?

1465
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:34,400
Because I think he's doing
the same thing to me.

1466
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,616
You allergic to cats?

1467
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:46,644
I used to be a pilot
in the Air Force.

1468
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,452
They called me the Hawk.

1469
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:51,857
Yeah, I was hell on earth,
but you'd never know it.

1470
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,623
Hey, you want
a biscotti?

1471
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,129
Uh, no thanks.

1472
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,962
I don't blame you.
They're addictive.

1473
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:00,297
So, uh, you served
in Grenada?

1474
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:03,066
Yeah. There's a war that
the media ignored, huh?

1475
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,471
I guess it wasn't sexy
enough for them or whatever.

1476
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:06,906
Hey, come on, Jerry,
off of there.

1477
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,671
Off of there,
come on.

1478
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:11,179
Anyway, when I got back,
there was nothing--

1479
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,612
no parades,

1480
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,276
no celebrations.

1481
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,080
I had nothing.

1482
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,347
Nothing except Gina.

1483
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,116
Was that your girlfriend?

1484
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,248
No, she didn't even
know I existed.

1485
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,124
But I used to watch
her... a lot.

1486
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:30,121
Dr. P was going to
teach me how to get her.

1487
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,826
Well, did it work?

1488
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,927
Actually, it went
pretty well at first.

1489
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,835
We started dating,
even talked about

1490
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,567
getting a place together,
down at the shore.

1491
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,699
She's real pretty.

1492
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:41,039
Eh.

1493
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,271
My little squirrel--
that's what I used to call her.

1494
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,677
'Cause of the way
her tooth come down

1495
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:45,941
over her lip like that.

1496
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,848
Dr. P thought she
was cute, too.

1497
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:52,513
Guys like Dr. P, they can
have anyone they want.

1498
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:58,859
And?

1499
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,522
What do you mean "And"?

1500
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,123
Look around-- I live
in a shit hole with 50 cats.

1501
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,133
I'm sorry, I...

1502
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,532
Jesus Christ.

1503
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:09,196
I guess I meant, you know,
how did he do it?

1504
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,330
Who knows?

1505
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:12,101
He suckered her in
with some bull crap story

1506
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:13,472
about his wife dying.

1507
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,477
And he told her he was
some fancy-pants doctor.

1508
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,412
Took her down to a medical
conference in Miami--

1509
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:21,075
a medical conference which
did not exist, by the way--

1510
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,744
and she went for it,
hook, line and sinker.

1511
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:24,912
Poor Gina.

1512
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:28,582
Worst part about it is,
three months later,

1513
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,819
he dumps her.

1514
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,555
She was devastated.

1515
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,290
What's this?

1516
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,389
This is just some information
I've been collecting about him

1517
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:39,094
over the past nine years.

1518
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,192
You know,
where he eats,

1519
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,362
where he sleeps,
phone records, et al.

1520
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,395
Keep it-- maybe
it'll help you.

1521
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:52,674
Actually, I have a better idea.

1522
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,808
Why don't you come back
to the city with me?

1523
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,215
I can really use
your help.

1524
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,344
Oh, no; no can do.

1525
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,912
Come on, we can
take this guy-- Lesher, too.

1526
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,548
Lesher?

1527
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,559
Yeah.

1528
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,757
He raped you, didn't he?

1529
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:11,197
Huh?!

1530
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,632
Lesher raped
you, right?

1531
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:13,794
No.

1532
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:15,895
No, I just think
he's a jerk.

1533
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,131
Oh, yeah.

1534
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:19,231
Yeah, me, too.

1535
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,468
I think he's a jerk, too.

1536
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,739
I don't know what
his... problem is.

1537
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:27,582
What?

1538
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:28,708
No. Nothing.

1539
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,896
This is unbelievable.

1540
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,693
Okay, big deal.

1541
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:21,100
So Dr. P uses a lot
of different identities.

1542
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,694
And so he's done
some bad things.

1543
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:23,864
So what?

1544
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:25,897
We've all done stuff
we're not proud of.

1545
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,703
Look...

1546
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:28,903
I had this guy I know

1547
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:31,878
over at the parking bureau
run his information.

1548
01:17:31,914 --> 01:17:36,214
Turns out,
Dennis Sherman-- Dr. P--

1549
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:37,718
bought two first-class tickets
to Miami.

1550
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,721
So?

1551
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,154
So...

1552
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,851
I think he's
taking Amanda.

1553
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:43,858
So?

1554
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:44,620
So...

1555
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,820
I have to find out

1556
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,055
when they're leaving
and stop them.

1557
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,926
But I can't do it alone.

1558
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,626
Look, Dr. P
is our teacher,

1559
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,692
and we love him.

1560
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,929
Plus, he's helped us out,

1561
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,130
a lot.

1562
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,867
Helped you?

1563
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,135
You guys, look at yourselves.

1564
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,142
Do you think

1565
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,803
you look cool?

1566
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,816
Yeah. I'd say
we look pretty cool.

1567
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,409
Okay, fine.

1568
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:11,578
I admit it,
you look cool.

1569
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,781
But do you
actually think

1570
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,881
that after taking
a few classes,

1571
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:17,891
you suddenly <i>are</i> cool?

1572
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,655
Whatever, Roger.

1573
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,684
We got to go.

1574
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,623
Eli--

1575
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:25,655
Let's go.

1576
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,294
Yo.

1577
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:35,003
This isn't right.

1578
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,271
Come on, Eli.

1579
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:37,744
Do you really
want to risk everything?

1580
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,770
Roger's been there for us.

1581
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:45,276
He took down Lesher

1582
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,083
and gave us back
our dignity, remember?

1583
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,383
Look, we just can't
walk out of here.

1584
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,827
I mean, what if I'm next?

1585
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,524
Would you guys just, uh,

1586
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,624
leave me hanging out there
to get picked off?

1587
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:02,125
Would you want me to leave you?

1588
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,900
Is that really
the life we deserve?

1589
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:12,074
We've got one condition.

1590
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,378
We're not dealing
with Lesher.

1591
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:18,375
Let me worry about Lesher.

1592
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:21,486
Weird, huh?

1593
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:25,653
Living all the way
out here in the suburbs.

1594
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,161
What do you mean?

1595
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:28,423
I don't know.

1596
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:31,159
I'd have pegged Dr. P
for living in Manhattan.

1597
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,224
I mean, a rich,
powerful bachelor

1598
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,634
could do a lot of
damage in the city

1599
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:37,161
I'm living proof.

1600
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:39,897
All right.

1601
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:43,177
Heads up.

1602
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,282
What's he doing?

1603
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:51,843
Going to his car.

1604
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,855
Stay down.

1605
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,553
Honey...

1606
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:01,892
Oh! What do we

1607
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:02,897
have here?

1608
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,023
What is it?

1609
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:05,795
Oh, you're going
to love this, Roger.

1610
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:09,931
I'm sorry, Agent Stryker,
and, um, um...

1611
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,801
This is
Agent... Gaylord.

1612
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,898
Right.

1613
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,375
Agents Stryker
and Gaylord.

1614
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,435
We really cannot release
that kind of information.

1615
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,503
Lois,

1616
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:19,639
for the last time,

1617
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,672
this is a matter of
national security.

1618
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:22,741
You do care

1619
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,877
about national security,
don't you, Lois?

1620
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,717
Of course. Yes.

1621
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,052
But if you could
just imagine, if I...

1622
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,284
She's not
listening.

1623
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,053
Print out the
passenger list, please.

1624
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:33,061
I'm not allowed to.

1625
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:34,460
Let me ask you
something, Lois.

1626
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,361
Do you ever watch
the show <i>24</i>?

1627
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,093
Yes.

1628
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:42,263
Well, think of this as a
real-life version of <i>24</i>,

1629
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:44,499
only our version
would be called--

1630
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,940
what, I don't
know-- <i>One</i>.

1631
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:52,239
Don't look around,
Lois; look at me...

1632
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,539
...and print out
that list.

1633
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,549
It's time to be
part of something bigger.

1634
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,785
I want to.

1635
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:03,791
But...

1636
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,122
No, shh,
shh, shh...

1637
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,787
No, no.

1638
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,728
No buts.

1639
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:11,232
Just print.

1640
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:28,172
Eli, what do you got?

1641
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,184
Your suspicion was
absolutely correct.

1642
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,480
Talk to me.

1643
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,853
Passenger list confirms two
first-class tickets to Miami--

1644
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,155
one for Dennis Sherman,
the other for Amanda.

1645
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,252
Flight leaves
tomorrow morning.

1646
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:41,660
Good work.

1647
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:42,720
It's on.

1648
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,235
We're just going
to a medical conference.

1649
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,966
It's so not a big deal.

1650
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:53,406
Besides, he's gonna be
working most of the time.

1651
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:56,275
It just seems like
a big step.

1652
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:57,300
It's not even a step.

1653
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,573
It's just, I don't know,

1654
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,173
I want to get away from
all this craziness for a while.

1655
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:04,885
All right.

1656
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,717
Hello.

1657
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,053
Your ride is here.

1658
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:10,718
All right, I'll be down
in two minutes.

1659
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,057
Take your time.

1660
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,773
Ah, you look good.

1661
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,340
Hello, Lesher.

1662
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:37,351
Remember me?

1663
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:38,943
Oh, damn.

1664
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,480
It's okay.

1665
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:43,548
Easy!

1666
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,116
Easy, big guy!

1667
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:48,830
Shh...

1668
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:50,832
Shh...

1669
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,164
All right, I will.

1670
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,197
Bye.

1671
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,257
Hi, Rose.

1672
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,349
Hi.

1673
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:18,689
Good morning, ma'am.

1674
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:19,694
JFK, right?

1675
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:20,717
Yes, yes.

1676
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,459
Amanda Richards?

1677
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,056
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
right, right.

1678
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:36,102
Check, check, check, one-two.

1679
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:37,941
All systems are go.

1680
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:39,105
How are we looking, people?

1681
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:40,671
This is the Walrus.

1682
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:43,411
The cigar shop
is open for business.

1683
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,942
Copy that, Walrus.

1684
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:47,386
Falcon. Come in, Falcon.

1685
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:48,719
What's your status? Over.

1686
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,315
This is the Falcon.

1687
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,952
I'm on the move.

1688
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,290
JFK, please.

1689
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,123
This is Road
Force One.

1690
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,566
We are heavy
and rolling.

1691
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:03,560
This is the Hawk.

1692
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:04,765
Lesher has been neutralized.

1693
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,364
We're heading north
out of the city.

1694
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,466
Excellent.

1695
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,033
We'll see you at the rendezvous.

1696
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,704
No can do.

1697
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:12,440
This is where I get off.

1698
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,845
What are you talking about?

1699
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,907
Lesher and I have
our own little score to settle.

1700
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:17,919
I'll catch you on the flip side.

1701
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,512
Hawk.

1702
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,080
Come in. Hawk.

1703
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:26,389
So, Lesher, tell me,

1704
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,123
you ever been
to Peekskill?

1705
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:30,925
I can't understand
what you're saying.

1706
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:32,056
You got to go slower.

1707
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:34,834
Take a breath.

1708
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:36,803
It's all gonna be okay.

1709
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:41,772
Excuse me.

1710
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,540
I think we just missed
the, um, exit for the airport.

1711
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,479
Oh, he didn't tell you?

1712
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:48,675
Dr. Sherman has
a surprise for you.

1713
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,947
There's someone very special
he wants you to meet.

1714
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:53,612
We'll be there
in ten, Walrus.

1715
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:54,849
Copy that, Road Force.

1716
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:56,948
Got my peepers on the party.

1717
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:58,653
Will alert
if there's any movement.

1718
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:17,403
Going somewhere?

1719
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:19,709
Check that out.

1720
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:21,579
It's got your
whole life

1721
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,278
and all the terrible things
you've done to people.

1722
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,379
Oh, and, uh...
what's this?

1723
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:29,117
Look at that.

1724
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:31,648
Looks like somebody
didn't die, did they?

1725
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:34,253
In fact,

1726
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,196
that looks like you with

1727
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:39,428
Mrs. Dr. P--
aka your wife

1728
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,332
for the past
15 years,

1729
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:42,529
aka suck it!

1730
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,435
You are busted!

1731
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:46,729
Yeah.

1732
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:59,546
Son of a bitch, you did it.

1733
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:00,645
Goddamn it.

1734
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:03,055
You actually did it.

1735
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:06,083
I challenge you to become a man,
and here you are

1736
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:08,857
sticking it to me
like a champion.

1737
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,330
What are you
talking about?

1738
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,128
Well, don't you get it, Roger?

1739
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,328
The master's program--
you passed.

1740
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,066
I don't believe you.

1741
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:20,472
Oh, really?

1742
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,999
How do you explain this?

1743
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,106
That's Amanda's
first-class ticket

1744
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,174
to Miami.

1745
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:33,515
The other one's yours.

1746
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,029
"Roger Waddell."

1747
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:49,198
Just consider it
a graduation present, Roger.

1748
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,196
But...

1749
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:56,301
what about all this stuff?

1750
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:58,039
Wait, Lonnie said...

1751
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,740
Lonnie who?

1752
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,681
You don't mean
Lonnie Ratcliff?

1753
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,343
That idiot.

1754
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,080
He spent three years
in the 'tard hatch.

1755
01:27:06,121 --> 01:27:09,887
Yeah, but his,
his story was...

1756
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:11,253
was just like mine.

1757
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:12,759
Of course it is.

1758
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:14,625
I did the same
damn thing to him.

1759
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:17,597
The difference is, you rose to
the occasion and he fell apart.

1760
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:20,567
I never said
my class was easy.

1761
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:25,298
So... Lonnie...

1762
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,366
never showed up
to the airport.

1763
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,401
He thinks you flew off
with his girlfriend.

1764
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:31,912
Exactly.

1765
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:35,382
Truth is, I sat here
for two hours like an asshole

1766
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,942
and ate a Cinnabon
and went home.

1767
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:41,751
Oh, no! Amanda!

1768
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:44,258
She's on the way
to your house.

1769
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,316
To meet your wife.

1770
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,262
Listen, my wife
knows the drill.

1771
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,788
She can make her pancakes
while you fly solo to Miami,

1772
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,027
or you can get her here.

1773
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:54,864
There's still time.

1774
01:27:54,903 --> 01:27:58,168
Oh, and by the way, Roger,

1775
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,401
the girl loves you.

1776
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,535
She just doesn't know it yet.

1777
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:06,875
Diego, it's Roger.

1778
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,006
Abort mission.

1779
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,038
I repeat, abort mission.

1780
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:10,482
What are you
talking about?

1781
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:12,349
Bring Amanda straight to the
airport-- you got 25 minutes.

1782
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:14,685
Hey, Rog, I don't think
I can make that.

1783
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:17,282
Just drive!

1784
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:20,385
You might want
to hold on.

1785
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:28,763
Look, Dr. P, I...

1786
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:29,735
Barry.

1787
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:33,502
Oh, all right. Barry.

1788
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:35,673
I don't know what to say.

1789
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,905
Well, it doesn't happen
very often, but...

1790
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:42,416
every once in a while,
I actually teach someone.

1791
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:46,781
Thank you.

1792
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,050
Oh, and hey, Roger.

1793
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,356
Remember that night in the bar,
when you made that joke

1794
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:57,591
about maybe someday
you'll teach the class?

1795
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:59,964
Look me up when you get back.

1796
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:12,505
Sorry if the ride
was a little bumpy.

1797
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:13,514
Have a nice flight.

1798
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:14,879
Let me go, please.

1799
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:15,883
Take care.

1800
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,078
God.

1801
01:29:23,992 --> 01:29:25,789
Let me have a Johnnie Walker.

1802
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:28,295
Make it neat.

1803
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:31,821
It's a good day, huh?

1804
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:33,663
Going to Miami.

1805
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:13,133
Hi.

1806
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:14,766
There she is.

1807
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,037
Sorry I'm late.

1808
01:30:17,312 --> 01:30:19,644
I had the craziest driver
on the way here.

1809
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:21,308
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

1810
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:23,408
We got time.

1811
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,321
You know which gate?

1812
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:04,149
Diego,

1813
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:06,160
where is she?

1814
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:07,627
What are you talking about?

1815
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,152
I dropped her off
ten minutes ago.

1816
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:10,721
Which terminal?

1817
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:12,733
The one on our itinerary--
terminal four.

1818
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:18,802
Hey, Rog?

1819
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,832
Rog, you still there?

1820
01:31:43,765 --> 01:31:45,130
Slow down, sir.

1821
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,133
Come on through.

1822
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:48,668
Can you remove
your shoes, please?

1823
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:57,534
You're okay.

1824
01:32:14,429 --> 01:32:16,294
And how does a glass
of champagne sound?

1825
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,297
Sounds great.

1826
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:18,298
And for you?

1827
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,299
I'm fine, thanks.

1828
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,300
You sure?

1829
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,325
Yeah, maybe later.

1830
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,530
Amanda!

1831
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,200
Amanda!

1832
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,673
ROGER
Wait!

1833
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:28,767
Do you hear that?

1834
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:32,576
No, I didn't
hear anything.

1835
01:32:32,613 --> 01:32:33,807
Okay.

1836
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,298
Hold the door!

1837
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:58,862
Wait!

1838
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:03,908
Uh, sir...

1839
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:05,572
Sir, um...

1840
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,240
Excuse me,
excuse me.

1841
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:08,873
Amanda...

1842
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,247
Oh, my God.

1843
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:11,751
You need to get
off this plane.

1844
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:13,720
Listen, pal, I don't know
where your pills are,

1845
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,245
but this ends now, okay?

1846
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:16,586
Call security.

1847
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:18,216
Uh, sir, could I
please see your ticket?

1848
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,489
I don't have a ticket!
Okay?

1849
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:22,655
Yeah, we need security
at gate 31. Now.

1850
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:25,097
Listen to me--
this is a bad man.

1851
01:33:25,133 --> 01:33:27,533
Why are you
doing this, Roger?

1852
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:28,933
Because you need
to hear the truth.

1853
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:30,197
I'm not crazy.

1854
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:32,103
I never broke into
your apartment.

1855
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,334
And I never
spray-painted your dog.

1856
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:34,568
I would never do that.

1857
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,076
Sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave...

1858
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,737
Don't touch me.

1859
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:41,613
You know, I know people
you can talk to.

1860
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:43,583
We can get you help, okay?

1861
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,585
You know...

1862
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:49,220
You don't...
understand.

1863
01:33:49,257 --> 01:33:50,952
Calm down.

1864
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:51,956
You're not...
listening.

1865
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,117
Just breathe.

1866
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:55,889
Breathe deeply.

1867
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:58,093
Oh, God.

1868
01:33:58,132 --> 01:33:59,258
Jesus Christ.

1869
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,699
It's okay.

1870
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:02,726
It's just a panic attack.
He gets these a lot.

1871
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,759
Of course he does.

1872
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:05,602
Um, he's a doctor.

1873
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,268
You gonna check on him?

1874
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,776
I-I'm gonna get some ice.

1875
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:18,748
Okay, everybody just,
uh, remain calm, and, uh,

1876
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:20,413
we'll get this situation
under control.

1877
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:22,183
Okay, everybody stand back.

1878
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:27,252
Now what?

1879
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,461
Where are you going
with this, Roger?

1880
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,665
It's your move... Doctor.

1881
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,634
Quick, he's not breathing.

1882
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:42,665
Bring me the paddles.

1883
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:44,439
Are you sure?

1884
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:45,467
Yes, I need to shock him.

1885
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,480
Come on, get them.

1886
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:47,879
Okay.

1887
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:49,143
Sir, give me a sock.

1888
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,174
Quick. I don't want him
choking on his tongue.

1889
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:01,185
Come on, stay with me.

1890
01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:03,288
Stay with me, stay with me!

1891
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:12,572
Okay, this is
your last chance, Roger.

1892
01:35:12,607 --> 01:35:14,404
I'm not bluffing.

1893
01:35:15,977 --> 01:35:18,571
Okay.

1894
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:26,115
Hand me the paddles,
come on.

1895
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:27,051
Quick.

1896
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:31,080
Are you sure?

1897
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:32,319
Shouldn't we try
something else first?

1898
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,327
Yes, I'm sure.

1899
01:35:33,361 --> 01:35:34,919
Here we go--
1,800 volts

1900
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:35,929
of pure electricity.

1901
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:39,225
Clear!

1902
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,670
Sir, you don't have
the current engaged.

1903
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,630
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1904
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:49,802
Yes, I think I know
what I'm doing.

1905
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:51,505
Obviously,
somebody didn't turn...

1906
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:53,240
Aren't you supposed
to turn this thing on?

1907
01:35:53,281 --> 01:35:55,909
Turn it on.
Come on.

1908
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:07,661
Wait.

1909
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:08,662
He's breathing.

1910
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:10,254
You back off.

1911
01:36:10,298 --> 01:36:11,356
I'm doing this, okay?

1912
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:13,333
What do you mean, "back off"?

1913
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:15,699
He's breathing.

1914
01:36:15,736 --> 01:36:17,203
I said stay back.

1915
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:18,364
Just back off!

1916
01:36:18,406 --> 01:36:20,203
Please.

1917
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:24,109
Why are you doing this?

1918
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:27,136
Oh, my God.

1919
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:30,275
You aren't even
a doctor, are you?

1920
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:34,017
Who's a lion
now, bitch?

1921
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:35,249
What?

1922
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,348
Everything you said
is true, isn't it?

1923
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:38,380
How could you?

1924
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,558
Oh, please.

1925
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:43,688
Amanda, look, I did it
for his own good.

1926
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:46,791
You broke into my apartment,
you spray-painted my dog?

1927
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:47,926
Well...

1928
01:36:48,035 --> 01:36:49,400
Oh, my God.

1929
01:36:49,437 --> 01:36:50,426
Is your wife even dead?

1930
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,939
Not technically, but
I can explain that.

1931
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:53,941
You make me sick!

1932
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:56,339
Ow!

1933
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:04,550
Get it off!

1934
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:05,847
Get it off you!

1935
01:37:09,957 --> 01:37:11,549
Roger! Oh, my God.

1936
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:14,627
Roger, can you hear me?

1937
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,186
You okay?

1938
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:18,221
No. I can't feel my chest.

1939
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:22,498
Is-Is something burning?

1940
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:24,832
I think it's you.

1941
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:31,209
I'm so sorry for getting
you into any of this.

1942
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:32,906
That's okay.

1943
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:35,005
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1944
01:37:37,318 --> 01:37:38,615
Amanda...

1945
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:40,085
Yeah?

1946
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:41,645
I totally
love you.

1947
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:46,016
I know.

1948
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:50,187
You're gonna be okay.

1949
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:08,306
I like it here.

1950
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:11,409
It's quiet.

1951
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:13,181
Helps me think.

1952
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,656
So how have
you been?

1953
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:21,525
Not too good.

1954
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,553
My wife found out
about everything.

1955
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:28,024
Everything?

1956
01:38:30,805 --> 01:38:33,273
It's been a bad month.

1957
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:39,769
It didn't have
to go this far.

1958
01:38:39,814 --> 01:38:42,180
I always push things.

1959
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:44,184
It's who I am.

1960
01:38:46,187 --> 01:38:48,553
So, uh, how is, uh...

1961
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:49,681
She's good.

1962
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:54,926
So why'd you call me?

1963
01:38:54,995 --> 01:38:57,429
I have something for you.

1964
01:39:02,736 --> 01:39:05,364
It's the first diploma
I've ever given out.

1965
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:07,374
Congratulations.

1966
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:09,638
Wow.

1967
01:39:10,644 --> 01:39:12,635
Thanks.

1968
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:17,250
You know,
I was thinking, um...

1969
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:19,752
I don't know, if I...

1970
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:22,654
if I get the class,
you know, up and going again,

1971
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,215
you know, maybe you could
drop by sometime

1972
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:27,250
as, like, a guest speaker
or something.

1973
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,523
Yeah. I don't know.

1974
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:34,261
It's not really my thing.

1975
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:36,326
Besides...

1976
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:39,635
you know what they say:

1977
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:41,402
"Those who can, do,

1978
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:43,342
"and those who can't,

1979
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:45,368
teach."

1980
01:39:47,081 --> 01:39:48,605
But you already knew that.

1981
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,243
Right.

1982
01:39:55,222 --> 01:39:56,211
I got to get going.

1983
01:40:25,653 --> 01:40:28,622
Hey, what's going on?

1984
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:33,318
Well, well, well.
Good morning, sunshine.

1985
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,555
Thinking there for a second we
weren't going to get you back

1986
01:40:35,596 --> 01:40:37,621
to the land
of the living, huh?

1987
01:40:37,665 --> 01:40:38,859
All right, listen up,

1988
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:40,457
'cause I'm not going
to repeat this.

1989
01:40:41,468 --> 01:40:43,800
Here's how the game works.

1990
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:45,771
You get a 15 minute head start.

1991
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:48,866
If I were you, I'd try to find
a weapon of some type.

1992
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:51,139
Definitely shelter,
though to be honest,

1993
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:53,203
there ain't much
to work with down here.

1994
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:54,441
Temperatures drop

1995
01:40:54,481 --> 01:40:56,312
way below freezing when the sun
goes down,

1996
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:58,341
so you might want
to make a fire.

1997
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:00,876
Downside of the fire is
it's real easy

1998
01:41:00,921 --> 01:41:02,855
for me to spot you
from the air with that.

1999
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:15,430
All right,
here's how this works.

2000
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:17,198
You get
an eight-minute head start.

2001
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:19,297
So I suggest
you get moving.

2002
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,705
It's all right,
come on.

2003
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:21,935
It's okay,
don't be scared.

2004
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:23,340
Go ahead.

2005
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:30,379
Oh, Lesher...

2006
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:32,248
there's poison ivy
all over the place,

2007
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:33,810
so watch it
with the short sleeves.

2008
01:41:33,854 --> 01:41:34,843
All right?

2009
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:36,651
Ooh!

2010
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:43,163
No, that's what
I'm talking about.

2011
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:44,221
You're gonna get...

2012
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:14,590
Yay!

2013
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:17,062
Congratulations,
honey, you win, you're fat.

2014
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:19,565
Would you like
a big, fat medal?

2015
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,760
Put it back.

2016
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,430
Mazel tov.

2017
