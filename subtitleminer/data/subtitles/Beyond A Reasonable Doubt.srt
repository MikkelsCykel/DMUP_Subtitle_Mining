1
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
(panting)

2
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,300
(gasps)

3
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Does it have to be that tight?

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,900
Man: Well, we have to be absolutely
sure you can't see.

5
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,100
Don't we?
Now don't be nervous.

6
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,300
I'll... I'll try not to be.

7
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,000
All right, here we go.

8
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
Okay, next.

9
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,900
This is difficult.

10
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,200
- Can I try the first one again?
- No problem.

11
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,700
Here you are.

12
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,900
This one.
Yes, this one.

13
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,200
Now are you sure?
You don't want to try any of the others?

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,600
No, I'm sure.
This is the best.

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,700
Okay, why don't you take your blindfold
off and see which one you chose?

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,100
(laughs)
I can't believe it.

17
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
We tested 100 people,

18
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,200
22 of which chose the instant coffee
just like Marsha here.

19
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,700
Another 29 people
chose the canned coffee.

20
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,600
That's a total of 51% who chose
the instant or canned coffee

21
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
over the $3-a-cup gourmet brand.

22
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,100
So the next time
you reach for your wallet,

23
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,500
ask yourself: are you really paying
for a superior blend,

24
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,400
or just a very fancy name?

25
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,600
This is CJ Nicholas for the News 8
Shreveport investigative team.

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Hey, thanks, guys.

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,000
- I really appreciate it.
- That was hard hitting.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,700
- I have chills.
- I hear the networks calling you.

29
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Could you give me some cutaways?

30
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,300
And I'd really appreciate it
if you'd both bite me.

31
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,800
(laughs)

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Man:
There really isn't much more to say.

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,300
Lucinda Harris was 22 years old.

34
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,700
She's never gonna have a career.

35
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,100
- Did I miss it?
- Almost.

36
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,500
She's never gonna have a marriage.

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
She's never gonna be able
to have her own baby,

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,400
hold it in her arms.

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,200
And her parents there are never
gonna be able to kiss her again,

40
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,700
watch how her life unfolds.
It's over.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
It's done.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,300
And do you know why?

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,500
Because this man sitting right here,

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,200
Andre Benson, felt that she didn't
give him her purse fast enough.

45
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,100
Oh, she gave it to him, all right.

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,300
Just not fast enough for Mr. Benson.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,800
So he shot her.

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,900
He shot her three times.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Only once, she might
have been wounded.

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,700
Two times,

51
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,000
there would have been
a spark of life left in her.

52
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,300
So he made sure.
He made triple sure.

53
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Now the defense would like to tell you
that our whole case is circumstantial.

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,200
There is no eyewitness,
no ballistic match,

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,500
no alibi.

56
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Andre Benson was home
in his apartment alone

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,100
watching TV.
Probably "Jeopardy."

58
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,900
- (court chuckles)
- The defense can also explain

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,200
why Mr. Benson ran
from the scene of the crime

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,900
when the police came
to his back door.

61
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,200
He's a young black man
in a high crime area.

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,400
Naturally you hear a loud bang
on your door, you get scared.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,700
But do you know what?

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,100
We made sure too.

65
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,400
We made triple sure.

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
There's one thing he can't explain.

67
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,000
This cigarette butt

68
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,000
with Andre Benson's DNA
all over it

69
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,600
was found at the scene
of the crime

70
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,300
lying right next
to the deceased.

71
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,000
Now you have heard

72
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
the expert testimony
of the crime lab.

73
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,700
The odds of this not being

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,700
Andre Benson's DNA

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
is 6 billion to one.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,900
That's right, 6 billion,

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,700
with a B,

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,700
to one.

79
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,500
Hunter dribbles behind
the three-point line.

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Here comes the shot.

81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,900
Now if you're willing to take that bet,

82
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,900
then I don't want to be
your district attorney.

83
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,800
- I want to be your bookie.
- Swish.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,200
(court laughing)

85
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,200
(reporters clamoring)

86
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,300
With this latest victory, you have
never lost a murder case.

87
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,500
Are you going to announce
your candidacy for governor?

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,100
- The latest polls have you ahead.
- One at a time, please.

89
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,400
- Are you running for governor?
- It's Paul, right?

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
Paul, let me tell you something.
A beautiful young woman's life

91
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,100
was taken away in a moment
of incomprehensible violence.

92
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,600
That's what today is about.

93
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,100
Now why do moments like this
keep happening on our streets?

94
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,400
Those are the things
we have to ask ourselves.

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,900
Tonight when we all go home,
we have our nice dinners,

96
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,200
we have to ask
what would make a man

97
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,400
take an innocent human life

98
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
and treat it with such little respect?

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,300
Just snuff it out
like a match in the wind?

100
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,600
Now my only hope
out of this whole ordeal

101
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,200
is that Mr. and Mrs. Harris
will bring some closure to their life.

102
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,500
Today is not about keeping score.

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,700
It's not about politics.

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,300
Today was a real tragedy.
Thank you.

105
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,300
(reporters clamoring)

106
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,400
Could he be smoother?

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
I got a chubby just watching.

108
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,100
Listen, I'll meet you
back at the station, okay?

109
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,000
Hey, dude, I keep on telling you.
She's out of your league.

110
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,000
And I'm gonna keep on trying.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,200
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

112
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,700
Hey. Hi.

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,500
CJ, you've been
at the trial a lot.

114
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,200
- You noticed me.
- I noticed you staring at me.

115
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
That means you were looking at me.

116
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
I was looking at you staring.

117
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,300
- You're staring again.
- No, this is my look.

118
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
- I'm not staring.
- Hmm.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
- I came to beg a favor.
- Again?

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,300
We're doing a companion piece
on police interrogation techniques

121
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,600
and I was wondering whether you'd
give me the police interview tape.

122
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Now why would I do that?

123
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,400
'Cause then you get to
go out to dinner with me.

124
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
I can't go out to dinner with you.

125
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,900
It's not meal specific.
Could be lunch, perhaps a beverage.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,300
- CJ, I can't.
- Why not?

127
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
- You're a reporter.
- And you work for the district attorney.

128
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,400
- I don't hold that against you.
- You don't like Mark Hunter?

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,900
- Not much.
- Why?

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Or why not?
Whichever is correct.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A lot of reasons.
Too many to mention here.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
- Why is correct.
- Give me one.

133
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Too smooth.
Way too smooth.

134
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,700
And I'm not sure he's honest.

135
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,300
You say these things about my boss and
you expect me to have dinner with you?

136
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
I don't expect.
I hope.

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,900
And I don't want to go out to dinner with
him, I want to go out to dinner with you.

138
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,400
Besides, there's gonna be so many things
that we disagree on over the years...

139
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,200
favorite colors, small dogs...
I hate the little yappers...

140
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,900
electric or manual toothbrush...

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,800
countless things we're gonna
have to work through.

142
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,700
I promise I won't look or stare.

143
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,100
You'd really be helping me out
if you could get me that tape.

144
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
- (sighs)
- What harm could it do?

145
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,700
- The trial's over.
- I'll send it to your office.

146
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,400
- In person would be much...
- I'll send it to your office.

147
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
- better.

148
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
- Chinese.
- What?

149
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,300
I like Chinese food.

150
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,700
Chinese.
Definitely Chinese.

151
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,200
But just dinner. You're not gonna
get me into bed on the first date.

152
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
- What was I thinking?
- I have principles.

153
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,800
(no audible dialogue)

154
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,100
Hey hey, that same lady who keeps
calling and won't leave her name,

155
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,000
she called twice today.
You're a very bad boy, CJ.

156
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,300
You're my hero.
Oh, I don't know about...

157
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,500
- Uh, excuse me. You can't go in.
- Don't worry about it. He's expecting us.

158
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,400
- You look great, by the way.
- Sir?

159
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,600
- Thank you, Val.
- I got it.

160
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,500
- This is the big one.
- Sit your ass down.

161
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
District Attorney
Mark Hunter is faking

162
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,100
forensic evidence to get
convictions in murder trials.

163
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
He's not sitting his ass down.

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
I am though.
Ass is right down.

165
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Snug.
This is his idea.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,600
- I've got proof.
- Sit your ass down.

167
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,100
Hear me out.
Three years ago

168
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,400
Hunter lost a string of cases.

169
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,000
Now that's not something
a district attorney is supposed to do.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,500
And then badda-bing...
17 murder convictions in a row.

171
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,400
Now he's leading the polls
for governor.

172
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,900
You think maybe he's on a lucky streak?

173
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,400
DAs don't try cases
they don't expect to win.

174
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Okay, take a look at this.

175
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,600
Oh my God.

176
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,500
It's the crime scene photo
from the Andre Benson case.

177
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,000
Why am I listening to you?

178
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
There was no footprint match,
no fiber match,

179
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,500
no trace that Andre Benson
was even there,

180
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,300
except for this cigarette butt.

181
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,600
So Andre Benson had the presence
of mind to pick up his shell casings

182
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,600
but not his cigarette butt
that he left right next to the victim's hand?

183
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
I think you used the word proof?

184
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,000
The interview tape.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Just bear with me here.

186
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,000
The detective on the left,
one Anthony Merchant.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Now before Hunter joined the DA's
office, he was a police detective

188
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,800
and his partner for many
of those years was none other

189
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300
than Detective Lieutenant
Anthony Merchant.

190
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,800
Now watch.

191
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
Okay, here we go.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,700
That's how they got the cigarette
butt with Benson's DNA.

193
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,900
- It's right there in front of us.
- This is your proof?

194
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,900
You going along with this?

195
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,100
All of these 17 convictions
were decided by DNA evidence.

196
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,500
In each case the lead detective was
none other than Anthony Merchant.

197
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
How did you get that tape?

198
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,300
From a source.

199
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,000
And I bet this source has a skirt.

200
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,800
Does it matter?

201
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
- Not really.
- Then what is it?

202
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,000
I mean, this is a story...
a monster story.

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,700
I just received the new budget.

204
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,800
We can't afford the investigation
team anymore.

205
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,200
- What?
- You've got to be kidding me.

206
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,100
- Come on.
- Have you looked at your ratings?

207
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,000
- No.
- Well, it's not a pretty sight.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,200
It just so happens that the folks
who own this place

209
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
have this funny little obsession
about ratings.

210
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,500
It seems that ratings pay the rent.
No ratings, no rent.

211
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,100
So you guys are both
going on general assignment.

212
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,800
- Oh, come on.
- I don't like this any more than you do.

213
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,700
Hey, I saw your documentary.
That's why I hired you. I know you're good.

214
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,100
- What about this story?
- What story?

215
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,500
You've got some stones coming
in here using the word proof.

216
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
You answer me one simple question:

217
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,100
How in the hell could Detective Merchant
plant that cigarette at the crime scene

218
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,600
when the interview took place
three days after

219
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,200
the crime scene photographs
were taken?

220
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
Well...

221
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,400
Pick up your assignments
at the front desk and get out of here.

222
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
I would just like to say
that is an excellent tie.

223
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,500
Out!

224
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,900
I've been assigned to our fearless
sportscaster and his lovely toupee.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
You're doing a piece on people
over 65 who run the 10k.

226
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,000
Hunter's dirty.
I can feel it in my bones.

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
And I'm gonna prove it.

228
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,100
I've worked too hard to go back
to baby rhinos at the zoo.

229
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
There's baby rhinos at the zoo?

230
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,800
What? No, it's a metaphor.

231
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,400
- You know, baby rhinos, kitten in a tree.
- Right.

232
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,900
- So there's no baby rhinos?
- Would you shut up?

233
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,400
Hey, CJ, that woman
is on the line again.

234
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,600
Yeah, okay.
I'll take it.

235
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
- Yeah, line 7.
- Thanks.

236
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,600
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.

237
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,100
- Get the hell out of here.
- Call me if you need me.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Hello?

239
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,400
Yeah.

240
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Listen, now's...
this isn't really a good time.

241
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Yes.

242
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,700
No, I'm not.

243
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,900
Things aren't going
very well for me right now.

244
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,000
I understand.

245
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,900
Okay.

246
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,000
I will.

247
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,700
I promise.

248
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,200
Thank you.

249
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,300
You should have seen
that 10k.

250
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,700
There should be an age limit
for wearing spandex.

251
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,200
(chuckles)
Sorry I missed it.

252
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
I didn't come out here
to do stories like that.

253
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
Who does?

254
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,600
Right.

255
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,700
You're not staring at me.

256
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,100
You told me I wasn't allowed to.

257
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
I didn't think you'd actually listen.

258
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm feeling too sorry for myself
to do any good staring.

259
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,600
- That's a damn shame.
- I could try.

260
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,200
Give it your best shot.

261
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,400
That's not too bad.

262
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,100
I could do much better.

263
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
This is my B stare.

264
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,800
If I ever give you my full stare...

265
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,700
Shut up.

266
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,400
Keep staring.

267
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,600
(moaning)

268
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,700
I felt so sorry for you.

269
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,200
You looked so sad
at the table.

270
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Ah yes, the whole
end-of-my-career thing.

271
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,400
I was making that up.

272
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
It's not the end of your career.

273
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,100
- It's not exactly a promotion.
- Yeah, but it's not the end.

274
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,300
All you have to do
is something really good.

275
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,600
Really good,
and they'll have to put it on.

276
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Well, I...

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
think I might have something.

278
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,200
Might have.

279
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
- Maybe.
- Well, what is it?

280
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,600
Not now.

281
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,600
I just can't tell you now.

282
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
I don't even have it yet.

283
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,600
And it's privileged.

284
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,900
Everything I said
when I took my clothes off,

285
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,800
that's privileged.

286
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,400
Morning.

287
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
Good morning is right.

288
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,700
Coffee?

289
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Thank you.

290
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
What's in your kitchen?

291
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,500
A stove, a refrigerator
that makes ice cubes.

292
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
What about eggs?

293
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
Yes, eggs.
I can do eggs.

294
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,400
- And maybe even some toast?
- Mmm.

295
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,600
Holy shit.

296
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,900
You won an award.

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, that's what brought me out here.

298
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,300
I was working for a little station
in Buffalo, New York.

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,200
You know, Mark Twain once said that to
commit suicide in Buffalo was redundant.

300
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,400
I did this piece
on a girl, Taieesha,

301
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,800
15-year-old kid, got pregnant
by her stepfather

302
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,100
and her mother kicked her
out of the house.

303
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,300
She had no home,
no place to go

304
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,100
in the middle
of December in Buffalo.

305
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,700
You can't even begin to imagine
what winters are like there.

306
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,900
Found her living on the streets
hooking to make money.

307
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,100
It's nice to know people will pay
to have sex with a pregnant teenager.

308
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,600
She was in a snowstorm
when she went into labor.

309
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,300
I'd like to see it.

310
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

311
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Okay.

312
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,500
She was so little.

313
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,700
She wouldn't let me show her face.

314
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,300
Felt like she could break
if you held her wrong.

315
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,700
I cleaned her off as best I could.

316
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I knew I had to keep her warm.

317
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,200
I wrapped her underneath my coat.

318
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,700
I could feel her against my breast.

319
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,400
After a while I felt her grow,

320
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,900
you know, cold

321
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,300
up against my skin.

322
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
(sobbing)

323
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,200
I knew the church,

324
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,200
they'd take care of her.

325
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
They'd bury my baby girl.

326
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,000
When I started to walk away

327
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,500
I just couldn't see her wrapped
in all those newspapers

328
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,100
in front of the church.
I couldn't.

329
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,200
I knew she was with God.

330
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,100
Still...

331
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,700
I couldn't look back.

332
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900
CJ on video:
Jane Doe's mother had a...

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
Wow.

334
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,900
I, uh, don't really know
what to say.

335
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,200
It's... I'd like to see the rest.

336
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,900
Go ahead, take it.

337
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,500
I've got a bunch of copies.

338
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,200
- She, uh...
- What happened to her?

339
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,300
She died of an overdose
two weeks after the interview.

340
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,700
She never got to see the piece
or the attention it got.

341
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
So they brought me out here.

342
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
It's not much bigger,

343
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,500
but at least I got my own
investigative unit.

344
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,100
And now that's gone.

345
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
CJ, you really are
a good reporter.

346
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,100
Hey, no no.

347
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,200
You said you had an idea.
Well, go, follow it.

348
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,200
(no audible dialogue)

349
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,400
Look, I told you
this is not a good time.

350
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,300
All right, I will.
Just stay calm.

351
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,900
You dropped your pens.

352
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,500
Later.

353
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,300
(no audible dialogue)

354
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,600
Four, four, good.
I'm not close.

355
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,000
Stay on that way.
Focus here.

356
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
No seven.
I need you. I need you.

357
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,300
- Come on.
- Come on, I was on a roll.

358
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,900
- Yeah, I noticed.
- What's happening?

359
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
How far would you go
for the story of your lifetime?

360
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,700
I mean, you know me,
farther than far.

361
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,300
Would you risk everything?

362
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,000
Depends on what you mean
by everything.

363
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Everything means everything,
including going to prison.

364
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,300
- You're kidding.
- Never been more serious in my entire life.

365
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,700
Jesus. I mean, I don't know.

366
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,300
I'm talking about the biggest story
we've ever dreamed of.

367
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm talking about the Pulitzer Prize.

368
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,800
- You're also talking about prison.
- Just hear me out.

369
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,600
When I'm done, you say no
we don't do it. It's your choice.

370
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,500
Of course it will mean you'll spend
the rest of your numbered days

371
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,700
producing ticky tidbits
from a minor league infield.

372
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,300
And it'll also mean
you have no scrotal sack.

373
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
We gonna cut to commercial
before we do Final Jeopardy?

374
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,700
Right, cut to the chase.

375
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,500
We both know that Hunter is bringing
in fake DNA to get those convictions.

376
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,200
- Right.
- We don't know exactly how,

377
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,100
- but we know that he's doing it.
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,900
- You with me?
- So far, yeah.

379
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,500
Well, there's one way
we can prove it.

380
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,400
- And is this the risky part?
- Not yet.

381
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,600
First we have to wait
for the right murder.

382
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,100
What do you...
the right murder?

383
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
The murder of some
anonymous person, okay?

384
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,900
Some junkie or hooker

385
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,800
where the cops have no suspect
and they really don't give a shit.

386
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,000
And there's got to be some
vague physical evidence

387
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,900
like a tire track
or a footprint.

388
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,500
Not a lot.

389
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,700
And it's got to happen
when I have no alibi.

390
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,300
Who needs an ali...
why can't you have one?

391
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,700
I can't have an alibi 'cause that's when
we plant the circumstantial evidence.

392
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,200
We what?

393
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,400
We plant enough circumstantial
evidence that it points to me.

394
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,700
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.

395
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,900
We not only plant it,
you document us planting it.

396
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,700
You tape me doing it,

397
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
each time with the day's
newspaper in the shot.

398
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,100
That way we can prove that
the evidence came after the fact.

399
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,900
Aren't there laws
against this kind of thing?

400
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,500
More than one.
Anyway, enough circumstantial evidence

401
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,100
and District Attorney Mark S Hunter
won't be able to resist.

402
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,400
He'll arrest me, he'll indict me
and he'll put me on trial.

403
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,700
And not only will he
have a high profile case,

404
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,100
he will have a truly sexy, juicy,

405
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,800
front page lead story

406
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,000
that'll tie up the nomination
for governor.

407
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,900
And he'll have a white defendant
that he won't be able to resist.

408
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,400
Is there a change of seasons
on your planet?

409
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,800
Because he could never ever
ever afford to lose this case.

410
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
And he'll only have
circumstantial evidence.

411
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,700
Some trace of my DNA
will suddenly be found,

412
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,500
just like it was in all the other cases.

413
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,900
Only this time after he introduces it,

414
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,300
you get the video
and we show it in court.

415
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,200
You think there's a chance a judge

416
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,900
won't have much of a sense of humor
about this?

417
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
A judge will go stark raving apeshit.

418
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
The pandemonium this'll create

419
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
by graphically proving
that Hunter is crooked,

420
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,800
that'll overshadow everything.

421
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,700
Do you have any idea
how big of a story this will be?

422
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,600
Do you really think the DA's office

423
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,200
is gonna want to prosecute us
after this thing breaks?

424
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,500
Look, we know a wrong
is being committed

425
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,900
by a man that may become
our next governor.

426
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,700
We are investigative reporters.

427
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,800
This is our chance to prove it.

428
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,000
It's perfect.

429
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,200
I don't know, man.

430
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,200
Come on, this is our chance.

431
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
This could be our Pulitzer.

432
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
This is the diem
that we have to carpe.

433
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,500
This is the proverbial pot that we
have to shit or get off of.

434
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,400
This right here, right now,
this is it.

435
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,800
God help me.

436
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,700
I'm in.

437
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,900
No, God help Mark Hunter.

438
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,900
I don't know, Ella.

439
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,700
You're either awfully late
for your trial or really early.

440
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,500
You okay?

441
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,300
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

442
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,800
It's just tomorrow
is my first day as lead so I'm trying to...

443
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,300
Thought maybe the best way to prepare
is sit here in the courtroom alone, huh?

444
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
That's what I did at my first trial.

445
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
You know, worked for me.

446
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,400
You see that judge's bench,

447
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,800
that big old fancy seal, the flag,

448
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,200
the jury box and you go, "Whoa.

449
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
This is big.
This is really big stuff."

450
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
And it is.

451
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
We put bad guys away.
That's what we do.

452
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,300
And if you're sure...

453
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,500
I mean down to your marrow sure...

454
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
that defendant is guilty,

455
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
that jury is going
to follow you anywhere.

456
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,400
But if you've got
even an inkling of a doubt,

457
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,400
you'll lose them like sand
right through your fingers.

458
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,500
It's amazing. They can smell doubt.
I don't know how they do it.

459
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,200
So I guess the most important
thing is to be sure.

460
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,500
- Are you?
- Yes.

461
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
- No doubts?
- No.

462
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
You make them feel that,

463
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,100
you're not gonna have any
problem at all.

464
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,700
That, you know, and maybe work
the room a little bit, okay?

465
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,300
Okay.

466
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,600
- Ella, good night.
- Good night.

467
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,900
- And good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

468
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
(knocking)

469
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,700
- Corey: CJ, wake up!
- Jesus Christ.

470
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,000
(knocking)

471
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,300
Ow! Shit!

472
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
- CJ!
- Coming. Take it easy.

473
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Is she here? I was hoping to
barge in on the two of you.

474
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,700
I'm dying to see her naked.

475
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,800
No, she's got a trial in the morning.

476
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,400
- What's going on?
- Why are you limping?

477
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,600
I came down on my ankle
funny when I got out of bed

478
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,800
because some asshole woke me
up at 4:00 in the morning.

479
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,300
(chuckles)

480
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,100
What?
What is it?

481
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,400
Get dressed.

482
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,500
(sirens wailing)

483
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,400
(police radio chatter)

484
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,700
Gentlemen.

485
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,500
And I use that term loosely
with the fourth estate.

486
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,100
How'd you get here so fast?

487
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,400
We do have police scanners
in the newsroom, you know.

488
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,800
Really? Next thing you're gonna
tell me is you have a color TV.

489
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,300
- Who is she?
- Dead black junkie hooker.

490
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,800
Her purse was full of condoms.
Most of her customers must be white

491
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,200
'cause the condoms
are regular size.

492
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,400
Cute. Homicide?

493
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,800
Four stab wounds
to the chest and neck.

494
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm gonna go way out
on a limb and say yes.

495
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,400
Got any leads?

496
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,500
Got a witness.
Fella over there saw the whole thing.

497
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,300
Or at least his dog did.
It bit the perp.

498
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,700
- Any physical evidence?
- Got a pretty good footprint.

499
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
What about the knife?
Did you find the knife?

500
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,400
Why are you so interested?

501
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,800
The victim doesn't have to be famous
for us to be interested.

502
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,500
(laughs)
Whatever you say.

503
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,900
- I'm gonna check him out.
- Yeah, all right.

504
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,000
Listen, think maybe I could take a look
at the crime scene report and photos?

505
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,700
- Now why the hell would I do that?
- I got two primo Springsteen tickets.

506
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,700
Springsteen?
Bruce Springsteen?

507
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,400
- No, his cousin Ralph.
- Do I look white to you?

508
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,000
What?

509
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Do I look white to you?

510
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Well, in certain angles.

511
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,300
Your Mr. Springsteen does not
do it for me. I am unmoved.

512
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,900
We're talking about The Boss here.

513
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,000
No, he's your Boss.
He ain't mine.

514
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,800
Did I mention backstage passes?

515
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,300
I mean, do you have any idea
what women will do

516
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,900
for backstage passes to Springsteen?

517
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,300
Take a good look at me.

518
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,500
This is exactly
what unmoved looks like.

519
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,400
I'll think of something.

520
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,500
You always do, my brother.

521
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,400
You always do.

522
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,500
(siren wails)

523
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,900
Goody bag from Nickerson...
all the reports and crime scene photos.

524
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I knew he couldn't pass up
Springsteen tickets.

525
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,600
All right, let's see
what we've got here.

526
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,200
Ooh, wow. Ha.

527
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,400
Shoeprint came in from some loopy
Italian sneaker called Montalvo.

528
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,500
They don't make it anymore.
Size 10-12. What are you?

529
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
11 and a half. He never went
for the Springsteen tickets.

530
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
They also found a can
of pepper spray at the scene.

531
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,300
Probably the victim's.
What did he go for?

532
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,800
The witness heard an argument
between a man and a woman.

533
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,200
He heard the man cry out in pain.
She probably sprayed him.

534
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,700
Then the woman screamed,
the dog took off,

535
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,300
bit the perp and the guy ran away.

536
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,100
- Got him Saint's tickets.
- Perfect. What kind of dog?

537
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,200
Jack Russell terrier.
45-yard line.

538
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,600
Jim Carrey, "The Mask"...
love that film.

539
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,000
45 yard line?
That's like my seats. What row?

540
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,400
The witness didn't see the perp but said
he was wearing a dark jogging suit.

541
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Looked like Reebok because it had
two stripes down the side.

542
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,200
He was positive it had two stripes,

543
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,200
sneakers and a dark ski mask.

544
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,200
And he was holding a knife
with a dark handle.

545
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Row 22.

546
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,800
Stab wounds are consistent
with a switchblade, around four inches.

547
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,300
That's the same row as...

548
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,000
Dude, tell me you didn't
give him my tickets.

549
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,300
- You're not telling me.
- It's for one season.

550
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,800
You said one reason, right?
Not one season.

551
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,500
What does it say about the victim?

552
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,800
You are beyond a prick.

553
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,100
I am a prick that is going to win
us a Pulitzer Prize, my friend.

554
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,900
- Now have they ID'd the victim yet?
- Doris Ruth Owens.

555
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,400
Shit.

556
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,700
She was just 22 years old.

557
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,900
Lots of arrests for solicitation,
some for drugs.

558
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
A coulpe here in Shreveport.
Nice.

559
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,500
Others in Virginia, Maryland,
New Jersey, New York.

560
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,900
One way to see America...
on your back.

561
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,700
22 years old.

562
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,500
So let's make our shopping list.

563
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,900
We really gonna do this?

564
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,300
(no audible dialogue)

565
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,400
(shop bell dings)

566
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,500
You boys lost?

567
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
Crate & Barrel is about
four blocks that way.

568
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,500
(chuckles nervously)

569
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,200
Actually, we're...

570
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,200
we're looking for a switchblade,
about four inches.

571
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,900
Some bully picking on you during recess?
Taking your lunch money?

572
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
- It's got to have a white handle.
- Switchblades are illegal.

573
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,500
- I know that.
- You a cop?

574
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
- No.
- What about your sister over there?

575
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,900
Who, me? Cop? No.

576
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Do I look like a cop?
You know?

577
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,400
- It's a prop.
- A what?

578
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,000
We're making an independent film.

579
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,900
One of the characters
has to use it in the scene.

580
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,300
350.

581
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
You've got to be joking.

582
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,400
Do I look like the type of man
that tells a joke?

583
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,500
No, you don't.

584
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,000
Come on.
I mean, it's way too much.

585
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,800
Well, why don't you try Walmart?
Maybe they'll have one.

586
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Wait.

587
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,900
350

588
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
and throw in a can of pepper spray.

589
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
Sounds like a pretty violent
movie you two are making.

590
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
- Yeah.
- That's what sells.

591
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,200
Cash only.

592
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,500
You got 150?

593
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,400
How's it going?

594
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
All right.

595
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,700
- Can I get a receipt?
- No.

596
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,100
- Why not?
- 'Cause I never sold you that.

597
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
Can I ask you a personal question?

598
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,300
Go right ahead.

599
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,100
What happens with that nose ring
when you sneeze?

600
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,900
It gets snot on it.

601
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,600
Okay, let's...

602
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,200
Thanks a lot.

603
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,800
Thank you.

604
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,000
(no audible dialogue)

605
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Are you looking for
a specific type of dog?

606
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,400
A Jack Russell terrier.

607
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,300
Like the kind in "Mask"
or "Frasier."

608
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,300
I think I know what a Jack Russell is.
Thank you.

609
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,800
We have one
that's mostly Jack Russell.

610
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,500
He's out there.

611
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,100
(barking)

612
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,300
He's not a purebred.
If you're looking for a pedigree,

613
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,400
this is not the right place for you.

614
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,700
- Is he the same size?
- Yes.

615
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,500
Could we see his teeth?

616
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,700
- (growling)
- You can tell he's not too old.

617
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
These little fellas
can be a real handful.

618
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,500
You might want to think
about getting him fixed.

619
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,300
- He's completely housebroken.
- That makes one of you.

620
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,600
- We'll take him.
- That's a wonderful thing you're doing.

621
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Would you mind holding this up?
For posterity.

622
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,900
I know what it's like.
My wife has to document every occasion

623
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,200
like it's a presidential inauguration.

624
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,400
Well, I hope he brings
lots of happiness

625
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,100
to you both.

626
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,600
- Thanks.
- Appreciate it.

627
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
- Come on.
- Here you go.

628
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,500
These doggy treats actually
smell kind of good.

629
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,300
I think I might try one.

630
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,300
- I'm gonna name him Woodward.
- Nice.

631
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
All right, Woodward.

632
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,900
That's it, get it.
Bite the pants.

633
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,000
Come on.
There you go, buddy. Bite it.

634
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,500
Yeah, get 'em.
All right, grab a beer.

635
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,500
- I'm gonna throw these things on.
- All right.

636
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,700
(sniffs)

637
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,700
- (dog barks)
- Ow! Not yet, you moron.

638
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,500
Finley, get in here.

639
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,900
- What happened?
- Look at this.

640
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,300
- God damn, this hurts.
- Damn! From that little dog?

641
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,900
- Shit.
- Give me the newspaper.

642
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,700
- Put it in the shot.
- All right.

643
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,000
Grab that.

644
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,200
Little bastard wouldn't even wait
for me to get everything ready.

645
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,800
- You got it?
- Got it.

646
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,200
Who the hell wears a Montalvo?

647
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,500
Never heard of it.

648
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,800
We searched every
retailer in Shreveport.

649
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,900
None of them have ever
carried a Montalvo.

650
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,600
They stopped making it in 1999.

651
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,000
That tells you how popular they were.

652
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,900
Maybe the guy is from Italy.

653
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,500
Right, this has all the earmarks
of a mafia hit.

654
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,000
What about a tourist, you know,
looking for some late-night action?

655
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Maybe.

656
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,700
- I don't know.
- This smells like an evidence box

657
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,700
stored next to all those other evidence
boxes of unsolved homicides.

658
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,200
I hate that smell.

659
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,000
I really do.

660
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,100
All right, let's do this.

661
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,500
Okay.

662
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,600
Yeah, there you go.

663
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,900
Okay.

664
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,300
- Got that?
- Yup. Sure you want to do this?

665
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm sure I don't want to do it.
It's just the pattern may be different

666
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,300
- if we just sprayed the mask.
- Okay.

667
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,600
Think Katie Couric would do this
for a story?

668
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,200
She had a colonoscopy on national
television for God's sake.

669
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,700
Huh.
Okay, here goes.

670
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,400
(screams)
God! Shit!

671
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Oh shit. Put your head up.
Grab the newspaper.

672
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
- I can't see.
- Grab it. It's right...

673
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,000
(coughs)
Oh God, I'm tasting it.

674
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,300
- Christ, that burns.
- Just hold it up.

675
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,400
You're all heart, you know that?
You got it?

676
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay, the water. Give me the water.

677
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,600
(groans)

678
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,400
Tomorrow night's the night.

679
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
We could go to jail for this,
couldn't we?

680
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,900
- It's possible.
- Just checking.

681
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,800
All right, I'm gonna make
a backup disc

682
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,300
and I'm gonna keep the original
locked in my desk.

683
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,800
You can back out now
if you really want to.

684
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,100
Just give me the tape
and the backup DVD

685
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,800
and I'll never reveal
you were behind the camera.

686
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,500
What if they threaten you with jail?

687
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,300
I'll already be in jail,
so what the hell's the difference?

688
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,600
Okay, what if they go all Guantanamo
on you and start doing torture shit?

689
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,500
- Then I'd definitely crack.
- Exactly.

690
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,900
But I couldn't bear the thought of you
winning the Pulitzer all by yourself.

691
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,300
Just remember, we can't breathe
a word of this to anyone.

692
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
Not even my own lawyer can know.
Nothing, or he'll be disbarred.

693
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,300
- All right.
- Nobody can know.

694
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Absolutely nobody.
No exceptions.

695
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,800
What about the lady with the fantastic
tits that works at that bar on Piedmont?

696
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,300
- Okay, just her.
- And what about the one with the tattoo?

697
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,000
Shut up.

698
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,800
- I'm just as scared as you are.
- No you're not.

699
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,400
This way.
Come on.

700
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
- You lied to me.
- What?

701
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,700
- You said you hated small dogs.
- Oh.

702
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,300
- Hey.
- Hi.

703
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,300
I was at the animal shelter
doing a story.

704
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,400
He was pretty hard to resist.
He promised he wouldn't yap.

705
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,600
- Hello. What's your name?
- You're asking him?

706
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,200
Probably gonna have
a bit of a wait there.

707
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,700
- It's Woodward.
- Hello, Woody.

708
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,300
Your eyes are red.
Have you been crying?

709
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,800
Just allergies from the dog.

710
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,900
- Hello. Oh.
- Would you stop that?

711
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,300
- Oh my.
- I would like to kiss you, you know.

712
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,200
- What's stopping you?
- He is. It'd be like kissing him.

713
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,000
No, there's a difference.
Try it.

714
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,200
Come on.
Don't be a chicken.

715
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
- Ugh!
- (laughs)

716
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,200
See? Now me.

717
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,200
Mmm.

718
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,000
No thanks. I prefer sugar
with my coffee, not salt.

719
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,200
Oh, sorry.

720
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,500
It's understandable,
they're both white.

721
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,600
- Where are you?
- What?

722
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,200
Where are you?

723
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,800
I'm, uh...
I'm just a little distracted.

724
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
It's nothing.
I'm sorry.

725
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,100
It's because I said the L word
last night, isn't it?

726
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,200
- You said you're a lesbian?
- Don't bullshit me now.

727
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,600
I'm sorry.

728
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,000
I was an idiot.
I didn't mean to pressure you.

729
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,100
I just got kind of carried away
in the heat of passion.

730
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,500
No. No, that's not it.

731
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,000
I was glad you said it.
I was thrilled.

732
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Actually, I feel the same way.

733
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,900
Was it just the heat of passion
that made you say it?

734
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,000
No. You do?

735
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,800
What? I'm confused now.

736
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,600
No, it wasn't the heat
of passion that made me say it.

737
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,100
You do feel the same way?

738
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,600
You know I do.

739
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,700
- I...
- You don't have to say it.

740
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,900
No, I think I do.
I love you.

741
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Listen to me.
Listen to me very carefully.

742
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,200
- You might hear some things.
- What kind of things?

743
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,700
Things...
not necessarily good things.

744
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,400
- What are you talking about?
- I'm asking you to trust me.

745
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,700
Are you married?

746
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,300
(chuckles)
No.

747
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,200
Do you have a brood of illegitimate
children in ports around the world?

748
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,700
- Not a one.
- Do you have a disease

749
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,700
where body parts I like
are gonna start falling off?

750
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,000
- No.
- Then we'll be fine.

751
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,900
(sighs)

752
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,900
Come on.

753
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,300
(exhales)

754
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,700
Here we go.

755
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,000
- (engine revs)
- (tires squeal)

756
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,700
(siren wails)

757
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,300
(whistling)

758
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,000
(clicks tongue)

759
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,600
Oh, man.

760
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,700
(laughs)

761
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,200
I had to see this for myself.

762
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,800
Well, my brother,
you really have done it.

763
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,100
Go ahead, have your fun.
Give it your best shot.

764
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,000
You couldn't take my intermediate
much less my best shot.

765
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,600
So I will remember this sight as one
of those Kodak moments,

766
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
which unfortunately was all too brief.

767
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,300
Good news is you made bail.

768
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,700
Your friend Finley
is on his way upstairs.

769
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,700
Last name Nicholas,
first name Christopher,

770
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,600
middle name John;
Driving while shitfaced.

771
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,900
Sign here.

772
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,500
The lesser good news is
your brethren in the press

773
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,700
are gathered outside with
their lights and their cameras

774
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,100
and their need for blood.

775
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,100
They are a hungry bunch.

776
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,900
I arranged for your friend to park
in the department garage

777
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,400
which would allow you
to avoid your colleagues

778
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,600
and sneak out the back.

779
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
I owe you.
I really do.

780
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,700
I'll think of something.

781
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,400
I'm sure you will.

782
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,500
- (knocks)
- Hey, guys.

783
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,300
- You ready?
- Yup.

784
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,400
Thanks again.

785
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,000
No problem.
No problem at all.

786
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,600
No problem at all.

787
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,200
Ella.

788
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,100
Something happened tonight.

789
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,900
No no no, no accident.
I'm fine.

790
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,900
I am, really.

791
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,200
It's just I sort of got arrested...

792
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,800
more like actually arrested

793
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,900
for DUI.

794
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,300
No, don't come over,
I feel shitty enough as it is.

795
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,100
(pounding on door)

796
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,900
Wait a minute.
Someone's at the door.

797
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,800
Yeah, hold on.
I'm coming.

798
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,700
(pounding)

799
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,200
Ella, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Remember what I said the other morning?

800
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,800
You know, the l-love-you thing.

801
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,900
Well, it's still happening.

802
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,200
I love you.

803
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,300
Nickerson: Shreveport Police Department.
Open up now.

804
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,700
All right, I'm coming.
Just give me a second, for Christ's sake.

805
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,500
Open the door
or we will break it down.

806
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,900
This is a warrant to search your home.

807
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,600
I need you to read it
and then sign it.

808
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,100
Lift your trouser leg, please.

809
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,800
You mind telling me
what this is all about?

810
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,100
The pant leg, CJ.

811
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,300
Let's try the other leg.

812
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,000
Well well,
what do we have here?

813
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,200
- It's nothing.
- No, it most definitely is something.

814
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,700
Lift the bandage and let me see.

815
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
- And how'd you get that?
- It's from him.

816
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,500
Hey, Lieutenant.

817
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,600
- Turn around, please.
- What?

818
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,700
Turn around now.

819
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,000
CJ Nicholas, you are under arrest

820
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
for the murder
of Doris Ruth Owens.

821
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,800
- Are you crazy?
- Anything you say

822
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,500
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

823
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,300
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one...

824
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,800
I'm sure Mr. Nicholas understands
his Miranda rights.

825
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,500
- Isn't that right, Mr. Nicholas?
- I understand my rights.

826
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,500
What I don't understand is why
I'm being arrested for murder.

827
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Thank you very much, Detective Nickerson.
I'll take it from here.

828
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,000
- What?
- I said I'll take it from here.

829
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,100
- Are you taking my collar?
- He remains your collar.

830
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,800
No one is taking anything
away from you.

831
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
You'll get all the credit for your work.

832
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,100
I'm taking over the investigation
by request of the DA.

833
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,400
I don't get this.
But I also realize when it ain't mine to get.

834
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,200
The best seats to any event
ain't gonna get you out of this.

835
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,200
(buzzer sounds)

836
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,400
(man speaking over PA)

837
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,700
(buzzer sounds)

838
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
(buzzer sounds)

839
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,500
(footsteps approaching)

840
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,700
I called you every day.

841
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,500
I know you have.

842
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
I don't understand.
Why haven't you called me back?

843
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,300
- You shouldn't be here.
- What are you talking about?

844
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,900
- I don't want you getting hurt.
- It's too late for that.

845
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,800
No, listen to me.
It's your boss who's prosecuting me.

846
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,000
Your boss, for God's sake.

847
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,400
You can't have anything
to do with me.

848
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
I have everything to do with you.
I have no choice.

849
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,300
Have you thought about what would
happened to your career if Hunter

850
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,900
- found out about the two of us?
- My career?

851
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,200
Are you kidding me?
My career?

852
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,800
This is about your life here.

853
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,800
I'm gonna resign from the DA's office
and join your defense.

854
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
No. No, you can't do that.

855
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,200
You can't.
I'm gonna be okay.

856
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,400
- You sound like a Martian.
- I'm telling you I'm gonna be okay.

857
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,900
You're in a lot of trouble.

858
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,900
Promise me you're not gonna
do something stupid.

859
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,900
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

860
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,400
This has something to do
with Hunter, doesn't it?

861
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,900
- Why would you ask that?
- You have some kind of fixation with him.

862
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,000
This has something to do
with him, doesn't it?

863
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,300
I'm asking you to trust me.

864
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,800
There's something
you're not telling me.

865
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,300
Here's what you need to know:

866
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,400
I love you.

867
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,500
And I'm innocent.

868
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,800
I can't have you mixed up in this.

869
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,300
Please help me by understanding
what I'm saying.

870
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,100
Love me enough to trust me.

871
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,700
Can you do that?

872
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,200
Thank you.

873
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,200
After two days of jury selection,

874
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,800
After two days of jury selection,

875
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,900
the murder trial of Channel 8's
CJ Nicholas begins this morning

876
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,500
in what promises to be the most...

877
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,500
District Attorney Mark Hunter will
deliver his opening arguments

878
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,000
in what is expected...

879
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,200
...the most anticipated murder trials
in a long time,

880
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,000
television reporter CJ Nicholas
is scheduled to be here in just a moment.

881
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,800
(beeping)

882
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,900
(door opens)

883
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,100
- Hey, how you doing?
- No touching.

884
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
Don't worry.

885
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,300
Just remember, don't get
the DVD until I tell you.

886
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
We have to wait for Hunter
to introduce the fake evidence.

887
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,100
Otherwise we have nothing.
It's the whole ballgame.

888
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,700
- What's that about?
- Nothing.

889
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,000
He was just wishing me luck.

890
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,400
We could use some.

891
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,900
All rise.

892
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,500
Oyez oyez oyez.

893
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,400
Section 4 of the Honorable
First Judicial District Court

894
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,000
in and for the State of Louisiana,
Parish of Caddo,

895
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,900
is open and pursuant
to adjournment,

896
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,900
God save the state
and this honorable court.

897
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,400
Order and silence are commanded
under penalty of the law.

898
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,500
Please be seated.

899
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,900
- Are the people ready?
- We are, Your Honor.

900
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,600
- Is the defense ready?
- Defense is ready, Your Honor.

901
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,400
Then we'll begin with our
opening statements. Mr. Hunter.

902
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,800
Thank you, Your Honor.

903
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,200
Jane Doe's mother had a name,
which I can't reveal.

904
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,400
She had hopes
which can never be realized.

905
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,700
She had love
which has never returned.

906
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,900
And she had kindness
which was never given back to her.

907
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,600
Two weeks after that interview
Jane Doe's mother died of an overdose.

908
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,000
We can only hope for two things:

909
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,300
One, that she's reunited
with her baby daughter;

910
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,500
And two, that her death
was not totally in vain.

911
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,600
That can only be accomplished
if we realize

912
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,100
that the only difference
between Jane Doe and us

913
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,700
is the accident of where
we were born.

914
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,400
We had no control over it.

915
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,700
Therefore we are no better
nor more deserving than anyone else.

916
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,200
I'm CJ Nicholas.
Good night.

917
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,500
(tone playing)

918
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,500
And after you saw the man with
the knife, what did you do?

919
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,900
Oh, I didn't have time to do anything.
Oliver just...

920
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,600
- Excuse me. Oliver?
- My dog.

921
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,300
He's a Jack Russell terrier
just like the one from "Frasier."

922
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,500
They don't know they're small.

923
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,900
They are absolutely fearless.
It's amazing really.

924
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,300
Mr. Tarlow, what happened after
you saw the man with the knife?

925
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,700
Oliver just ran up and bit him.

926
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,100
- Where?
- On the calf of his left leg.

927
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,100
And Jack Russells
have very sharp teeth.

928
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,200
There were four stab wounds.

929
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,000
One severed the left carotid artery.

930
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,900
Another just beneath the sternum
punctured the aorta.

931
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,100
The remaining two
punctured the abdomen

932
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,900
and opened the small intestines.

933
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,600
Dr. Romans, I'd like you
to take a look at this knife

934
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,600
previously entered
as People's Exhibit C.

935
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,400
This was taken from
the defendant's apartment.

936
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,700
Could that be the murder weapon?

937
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,700
Yes, the blade's length and width
are the same as the stab wound.

938
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,400
And when you examined this knife
did you find any traces of blood on it?

939
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,200
No, it had recently been cleaned

940
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,800
with a strong industrial-strength
cleaning solution.

941
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,600
And deformities on the handle indicate
that it had been boiled.

942
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,200
Plus striations on the blade indicate

943
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,800
the blade had
recently been reground.

944
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,000
I have no more questions.
Thank you, Dr. Romans.

945
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,900
- Your witness.
- So just to be clear,

946
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,700
what you're saying
is you don't know

947
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,000
if this is the actual
murder weapon or not.

948
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,200
No.

949
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,500
Thank you.
No further questions.

950
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,500
The dog bite on Mr. Nicholas's left calf

951
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,200
was consistent with a dog bite
from a dog of that size and breed.

952
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,000
Now you found a shoeprint at the scene.

953
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,100
What kind of shoe was that?

954
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,200
They belonged to a Montalvo sneaker.

955
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,600
Similar to the shoes
owned by the defendant

956
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,300
marked for evidence
as People's Exhibit D?

957
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,000
Yes.

958
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,100
Now is that a popular brand sneaker?

959
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,500
No, they're extremely rare.

960
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,400
In fact, there isn't a single store
in Shreveport that carries them.

961
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,100
And did you compare the defendant's
sneaker with the print at the scene?

962
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,100
Yes. They were a match
for both size and weight.

963
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,300
Now the mask,
the ski mask

964
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,500
that was found
at the defendant's apartment

965
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,100
marked as People's Exhibit E.
What can you tell me about this?

966
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,500
We found pepper spray
around the eyeholes

967
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,000
on the outside.
Someone had sprayed it.

968
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,300
It was consistent with the pepper
spray belonging to the victim.

969
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,700
Thank you.
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

970
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,900
Now you can't actually tell us
that the bite on my client's calf

971
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,400
- came from Mr. Tarlow's dog?
- No.

972
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,900
So it could have come from any dog
of similar size and breed,

973
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,800
- like the one owned by my client in fact?
- Yes, that's right.

974
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,000
The crime scene photos show

975
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,500
that there was considerable blood
spatter caused by the attack.

976
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,900
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

977
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,400
And yet when you examined
the defendant's clothing,

978
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,400
entered into evidence
as People's Exhibit E,

979
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,100
you found no traces of blood at all.

980
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,500
No, but the client had time...

981
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,100
Just a yes or no will be sufficient.

982
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,900
So in fact, would it be fair to say

983
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,300
that there is no direct
forensic evidence whatsoever

984
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,100
connecting my client to this crime?

985
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,000
Yes.

986
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,900
No further questions.

987
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,800
(phone rings)

988
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,700
So sorry.

989
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,300
Yeah?

990
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,700
You'll excuse me for one minute.

991
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,500
- Sorry, honey.
- It's okay.

992
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,500
This better be good.

993
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,100
So what the hell kind
of emergency is this?

994
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,900
- We checked Nicholas's financials again.
- Yeah.

995
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,500
He bought a video camera at Wright's
Audio two days after the murder.

996
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,800
There's a point to this, right?

997
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,700
He also bought a black Reebok
jogging suit and a ski mask

998
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,100
at the sporting goods store.

999
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,100
He bought a dog
at the animal shelter.

1000
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,700
All this within a day of buying
the video camera.

1001
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,900
Something doesn't smell right.

1002
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,900
So when he went on this shopping spree,
was he alone?

1003
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,200
People at the sporting goods
store can't remember.

1004
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,100
Salesclerk at Wright's Audio said he
might have been with someone.

1005
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,600
The man at the animal shelter,
for sure

1006
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,500
remembers he was with another man.

1007
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,800
- Do you know who this man is?
- I'm pretty sure.

1008
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,500
Well, if someone did a video,
then this man's got it.

1009
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,400
You think we're being set up?

1010
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,300
We can't have that, can we?

1011
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,100
Now would you please tell the court what
you found on the defendant's pants?

1012
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,200
On request of the DA's office,
we retested the defendant's clothing.

1013
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,900
And what did you find on it?

1014
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,400
We found small traces of blood
on the seams of his sweatpants.

1015
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,600
We missed it the first time.
It happens.

1016
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,700
You Honor, we were given no
prior notice of this testimony.

1017
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,600
Judge, we only discovered
this evidence yesterday.

1018
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,900
I'll allow it.
Don't worry, Counselor.

1019
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,200
I'll give you time
to examine this evidence.

1020
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,700
Did you do a DNA analysis
of the blood

1021
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,000
that you found
on the defendant's pants?

1022
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,800
- Yes I did.
- And what did that analysis show you?

1023
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,300
The blood belonged to the victim.

1024
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,100
I have no more questions,
Your Honor.

1025
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,400
- (horn honks)
- Excuse me.

1026
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,300
Stop.

1027
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,000
Oh shit.

1028
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,700
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

1029
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,200
Are you ready to call
your first witness, Counselor?

1030
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,600
Yes, Your Honor. The defense would
like to call Dr. Aaron Wakefield.

1031
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,900
Go.
Stop stop.

1032
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Stop stop.
Stop!

1033
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,500
Excuse me. Sorry.

1034
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,900
Hi, I need to open
my safety deposit box.

1035
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,500
My name's Corey Finley.
Here's my ID.

1036
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,100
Certainly, Mr. Findley.

1037
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,400
Oh, it's actually Finley.
No D.

1038
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,300
Oh. That would explain why
I cannot find your record.

1039
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,500
Probably, yeah.

1040
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
You know, I have a cousin
named Findley.

1041
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,900
- You do?
- With a D.

1042
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,800
Second cousin really.

1043
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,900
Or is it first cousin once removed?

1044
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,700
I can never figure that out.

1045
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,600
You see, she's married
to my first cousin.

1046
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,200
Do you know how
that removed thing works?

1047
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,600
No, I don't really...
you know, if we could possibly...

1048
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,700
Here it is.
Corey Finley no D.

1049
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,900
Do you have your key
with you, Mr. Finley no D?

1050
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yes, I do. I have my key.
There it is.

1051
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,300
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

1052
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,700
Hey.

1053
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,300
Okay.

1054
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,200
It's right in here.

1055
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,500
150, 151...

1056
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,700
2263, found it.
It's right here. It's right there.

1057
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,200
Well, of course.
There it is.

1058
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,700
Okay, here's my key.

1059
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,800
Do you think that we
could speed this up?

1060
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,900
- I'm in a bit of a rush.
- No.

1061
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Okay.

1062
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,800
- Care for a private booth?
- No thank you.

1063
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Mr. Finley!

1064
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,300
Oh!

1065
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,900
Ow.

1066
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,200
Excuse me.
Excuse me, stop.

1067
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,700
Sorry.

1068
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,200
And in your opinion, Dr. Wakefield,

1069
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,900
could those wounds have been
caused by a knife other than the one

1070
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,100
- belonging to the defendant?
- Absolutely.

1071
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,500
Any blade of that
approximate length

1072
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,700
or width could have
caused those wounds.

1073
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,100
There are hundreds
of knives with blades that size.

1074
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,400
(horns honking)

1075
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,600
(horns blaring)

1076
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,100
(horn blaring)

1077
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,500
(horn blaring)

1078
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,600
(tires squeal)

1079
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,600
(grunts)

1080
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,900
(panting)

1081
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
- (grunts)
- (horn blares)

1082
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,500
Call your next witness, Mr. Spota.

1083
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,400
I can't keep stalling.

1084
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,600
Where is this surprise witness
you keep telling me about?

1085
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,100
He'll be here any second.

1086
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,000
You've been saying that
for the past four hours.

1087
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,200
- He should have been here by now.
- Counselor?

1088
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,300
Uh, Your Honor,

1089
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,300
we're expecting the appearance
of a rebuttal witness.

1090
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,900
Well, do you know where he is?

1091
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,100
Uh...

1092
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,900
no, Your Honor.

1093
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,800
Your Honor, the defense requests
a continuance at this time

1094
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,900
so we can examine the prosecution's
new forensic evidence.

1095
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,500
Judge:
Motion granted.

1096
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,800
We'll meet back here at 9:00 AM
Monday morning.

1097
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,900
Court adjourned.

1098
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,700
Counselor, is the defense
ready to continue?

1099
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,000
We are, Your Honor.

1100
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,600
The defense calls CJ Nicholas.

1101
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,100
(court murmuring)

1102
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,600
Raise your right hand.

1103
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,600
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

1104
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,200
- so help you God?
- I do.

1105
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,300
Be seated.

1106
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,200
- Did you murder Doris Ruth Owens?
- I did not.

1107
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,600
So why are you on trial here today?

1108
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,800
- 'Cause I wanted to be.
- (murmuring)

1109
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,000
What do you mean?

1110
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,100
I deliberately implicated
myself in the crime.

1111
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,600
- Why would you do such a thing?
- I was working on a story

1112
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,800
about the DA's office planting
forensic evidence

1113
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
in murder trials
in order to obtain guilty verdicts.

1114
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,100
Your Honor, that is
an outrageous statement.

1115
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,700
I felt the only way that I could uncover
evidence of corruption in the DA's office

1116
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,200
was to implicate myself
in the crime,

1117
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,900
to see if the DA would fabricate DNA
evidence which he now has done.

1118
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,000
(clamoring)

1119
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
- (banging gavel)
- Silence.

1120
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,600
(quiets)

1121
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,600
Did you know about this?

1122
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,900
Not until my client told me
yesterday, Your Honor.

1123
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,000
- Is this true?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1124
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,800
- And you have evidence to support this?
- We do.

1125
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,600
Your Honor, I am not
even gonna begin to deal

1126
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,000
with how insulting
and defamatory this is.

1127
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,700
However, it is obvious that
the defense is desperate.

1128
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,200
They're trying to create a jury nullification
so you'll call for a mistrial

1129
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,600
because they know
they're going to lose.

1130
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,600
You cannot allow them to present
this ridiculous defense.

1131
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,300
The prosecution opened
the door, Your Honor,

1132
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,500
by introducing last-minute
forensic evidence.

1133
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,300
My client is on trial for his life.

1134
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,100
He should be given every latitude.

1135
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,900
You say you have evidence.
I'll give you a chance to present it.

1136
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,400
I will not... I repeat, will not

1137
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,800
let you simply make wild
and damaging accusations.

1138
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,700
Understand me, Mr. Nicholas?

1139
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,600
Oh, there will be no mistrial.

1140
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,700
There will be a contempt of court
citation for you, Mr. Spota,

1141
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,500
if your proof turns out
to be not proof.

1142
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,600
- We understand, Your Honor.
- You may continue,

1143
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,100
- although you are on a very short leash.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1144
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,800
Now, CJ, please tell the court
why you have done this.

1145
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,700
I had been investigating
the DA for some time.

1146
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,700
There had been a series of cases
in which last-minute forensic evidence,

1147
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,100
always DNA, was introduced.
So I investigated further

1148
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,900
and I became convinced that
the DA was planting evidence.

1149
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,700
But why go to such
extraordinary lengths?

1150
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,700
It was my last resort.
My editor told me to back off it.

1151
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,100
I couldn't make my suspicions
public without proof.

1152
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,400
- So what did you do?
- I found out the details of the case

1153
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,400
from Detective Nickerson. Then I went out
and bought a Jack Russell terrier

1154
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,200
and got him to bite me
on the left calf.

1155
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,700
Then I bought the switchblade,
the pants and the sneakers.

1156
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,800
Spota:
This is a receipt for the sneakers

1157
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,300
I'd like to mark
as Defense Exhibit A.

1158
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,100
You can see that it is clearly dated

1159
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,000
three days
after the murder took place.

1160
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,100
This is a receipt for the sweatpants,
Defense Exhibit B.

1161
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,000
Again, dated after the murder.

1162
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So if you bought the sweatpants
after the murder took place,

1163
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,700
how did the victim's blood get on it?

1164
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,100
The only answer
is the DA put it there.

1165
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,700
So you're saying because the DA's case
was purely circumstantial,

1166
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,700
he planted the evidence to tie
you to the murder scene?

1167
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,600
Yes.

1168
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,800
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1169
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,000
That's it?

1170
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,100
That's the proof

1171
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,200
that I'm a calculating
dishonest man?

1172
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,100
Not to mention a felon?

1173
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,400
A couple receipts
for a pair of sweatpants?

1174
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,700
My office and myself
is a bastion of corruption

1175
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,300
because you bought
a pair of sweatpants

1176
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,000
a few days after the murder.

1177
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,200
I've got to hand it to you,
you're something else.

1178
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,000
- And the sneakers.
- Oh, the sneakers.

1179
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,900
I forgot about the sneakers.
Well, that seals the deal right there.

1180
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,600
Judge, you've got to put
the cuffs on me right now.

1181
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,500
(court laughs)

1182
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,300
CJ:
I agree.

1183
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,800
Do you...

1184
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,200
and I use this word very loosely...

1185
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,200
do you have any proof?

1186
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,300
I made a DVD
documenting the purchases.

1187
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,700
- Everything.
- And where is that DVD?

1188
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,900
My colleague who shot it...

1189
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,000
was killed in an accident
on his way to the courthouse.

1190
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,900
And the disc was destroyed.

1191
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,500
Well, I'm very sorry
about your colleague.

1192
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,800
But other than you saying

1193
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,300
that you have a DVD
that backs up your claims,

1194
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,200
is there...
and I use this word

1195
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,200
again lightly...

1196
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,200
is there any proof

1197
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,700
that that DVD exists?

1198
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,000
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear your answer.

1199
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,800
Answer the question,
Mr. Nicholas.

1200
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,200
- No.
- No, you will not answer the question

1201
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,400
or no you have no proof it exists?

1202
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,800
No, all you have is my word.

1203
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,000
Well, that's kind of on
shaky ground right now, isn't it?

1204
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,400
- (court laughs)
- That's not for me to say.

1205
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,200
You know what, Mr. Nicholas?

1206
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,600
That's the first thing
that you've said

1207
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,000
that I agree with.

1208
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,300
It's for the jury to decide, isn't it?

1209
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,000
Now I have just one more question,

1210
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,300
one little pesky question.

1211
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,700
The fact that you bought
a pair of sneakers

1212
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,500
and sweatpants sometime
after the murder,

1213
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,300
the fact that you bought anything
after the murder,

1214
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,800
does that mean that you couldn't
have owned a pair of sneakers

1215
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,200
or sweatpants or bought
anything else for that matter

1216
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,000
before the murder?

1217
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,800
I'm sorry, I did not hear
your answer.

1218
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,500
I guess not.

1219
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,900
Thank you.

1220
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,100
Despite the sensational claims
made by the defense,

1221
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,500
CJ Nicholas was found guilty
today of first-degree murder.

1222
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,500
It took the jury less than five hours

1223
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,500
to return a verdict of guilty

1224
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,800
in the murder trial of Channel 8's
CJ Nicholas.

1225
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,900
Sentencing is next week.

1226
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,200
DA Hunter said that the state
will seek the death penalty

1227
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,300
due to the viciousness of the crime.

1228
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,300
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.

1229
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,700
What's wrong with you?
Of course I'd come.

1230
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,100
I have a speech.

1231
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,800
I've been rehearsing it
over and over.

1232
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,100
God knows I've had the time.

1233
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,200
I kinda thought I had it down,
you know?

1234
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,200
But now my mouth's all cotton.

1235
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,600
Okay, here it goes.

1236
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,400
The last time I saw you,
you said that you believed in me.

1237
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,400
You said you knew
I couldn't have done this.

1238
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,200
Then you saw the evidence at the trial
and you said to yourself,

1239
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,000
"I want to believe him.
I have to."

1240
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
There's all this evidence.
So much.

1241
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,100
And then the DNA evidence.
That was the last straw, wasn't it?

1242
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,100
It was the clincher.
That's why you now think I'm a murderer.

1243
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,600
- I don't.
- Yes you do.

1244
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,400
And it's all right.
You don't have to lie.

1245
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,300
I don't blame you.

1246
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,900
I just want you to listen.

1247
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,300
If there was ever a time
that you loved me,

1248
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,800
if there was ever a time you thought
I was a good person,

1249
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,700
then I want you to hear this.

1250
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,100
What I said at the trial was true.

1251
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,000
The DNA was planted by your boss,

1252
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,500
just like he planted the DNA evidence
on that cigarette in the Andre Benson case.

1253
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,900
Now I know you've never met a defendant
that didn't protest his innocence,

1254
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,100
but I swear it's true.

1255
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,100
Finley had the disc that proved it all.

1256
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,800
And I think that Hunter had him killed

1257
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,100
because the disc that Finley had
locked in his desk went missing.

1258
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,000
I know that sounds crazy.

1259
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,600
- I believe you.
- Listen to me.

1260
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,200
I'm asking you not to believe me.

1261
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,800
I'm begging you to go
and find out for yourself.

1262
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,500
Be skeptical.
Be suspicious.

1263
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,900
Do some digging on your own.
I know how good you are.

1264
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,400
Please, you're my last hope.

1265
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,100
Why would I ask you to do
any of this if I'm guilty?

1266
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,300
Why would I ask you to find out
the truth if the truth was bad for me?

1267
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,800
Because you have nothing left to lose.

1268
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,000
Oh, Ella.

1269
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,900
You're so so wrong.

1270
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,500
I have you to lose.

1271
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,600
Death by lethal injection...

1272
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,000
that was the sentence
handed down by the jury

1273
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,900
in the CJ Nicholas murder trial,

1274
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,600
the verdict
in the penalty phase of the trial.

1275
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,600
Nicholas, when asked
if he had anything to say,

1276
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,900
maintained his innocence
and said that the real facts

1277
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,800
would someday be revealed.

1278
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,200
Nicholas was driven from the court
directly to death row

1279
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,600
at the Louisiana State Prison

1280
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,000
where he will live in complete
isolation for up to 20 hours a day

1281
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,400
until his appeal process is exhausted.

1282
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,400
This is not a happy day
for anyone.

1283
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,300
No life is more precious than another.

1284
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,200
Doris Ruth Owens's life
was taken from her.

1285
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,800
We cannot bring that back.

1286
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,200
And the young man CJ Nicholas
has forfeited his life.

1287
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,800
There's nothing to celebrate.

1288
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,000
Two lives are going to be lost,

1289
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,800
one cut short, the other wasted.

1290
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,500
And the only thing that I can say

1291
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,200
is that the jury's verdict serves justice.

1292
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,400
And in that way
it does serve us all.

1293
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,800
When I started to walk away,
I couldn't look back.

1294
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,400
I just couldn't see her wrapped
in all those newspapers

1295
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,200
in front of the church.
I couldn't.

1296
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,800
I knew she was safe

1297
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,200
and warm,

1298
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,500
that she was with God.

1299
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,800
Still...

1300
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,500
I couldn't look back.

1301
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,700
Jane Doe's mother had a name,
which I can't reveal.

1302
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:22,100
She had hopes
which can never be realized.

1303
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,300
She had love...

1304
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,800
May I ask you why you are questioning
me about Nicholas and Finley?

1305
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,200
I'm not representing
the district attorney's office.

1306
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,900
There's nothing official about this,
I promise.

1307
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,700
Why are you here?

1308
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,200
Please, it's strictly personal.
I'm asking for your help.

1309
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,800
If anyone finds out that I was here talking
to you I could get in a lot of trouble.

1310
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,300
Now if... and this is a big if...

1311
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,700
if there is a story here,
you have my word it will be yours.

1312
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,500
But again, I don't think
there's anything here at all.

1313
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,400
What do you want to know?

1314
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,700
Did CJ come to you about the story
of the DA planting evidence?

1315
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,700
Yeah, he claimed that Hunter planted DNA
evidence in the Andre Benson case.

1316
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,500
He said there were a lot
of other cases too.

1317
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,200
But you've got to understand,
with a guy like CJ,

1318
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,600
he always had some big story

1319
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,900
that was just one phone call away,
one source away.

1320
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,800
The problem was
he had hunches and very little else.

1321
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,600
What was he basing
these hunches on?

1322
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,600
He had a copy of the Andre Benson
interview tape.

1323
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
He claimed that the cigarette
that he was smoking

1324
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,000
on the tape turned up
at the crime scene.

1325
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,300
Now I asked him how could you
plant evidence at a crime scene

1326
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,300
after the crime scene photos
were taken?

1327
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,300
- Was he doing this alone?
- No.

1328
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,900
He dragged poor Finley into it.

1329
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,500
- Ella.
- Bruce.

1330
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,800
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

1331
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,400
- I'm good.
- Did you bring the information?

1332
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,800
Is that the only reason
you asked me here?

1333
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,800
Oh, stop it.
Honestly.

1334
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,900
- Thank you.
- What's this all about anyway?

1335
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,700
It's about us getting in a lot
of trouble if anyone finds out.

1336
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,400
So your lab did the DNA testing
for all 17 of these cases?

1337
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,100
- Yes.
- Was there anything unusual about them?

1338
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,600
- No, not really.
- Nothing?

1339
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,100
- Well...
- Well what?

1340
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,800
It's not something
I can put my finger on.

1341
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,600
Put another body part on it.
What is it?

1342
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,200
It's just that some of
the DNA samples,

1343
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,800
they came in at the last minute.

1344
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,500
- And that's unusual?
- Kind of. Sometimes.

1345
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,800
How many of the 17 cases?

1346
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,700
Most.

1347
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,400
Oh yeah, I remember them.

1348
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,300
How could I ever forget?
They seemed like such a nice couple.

1349
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,100
The one with the beard
always wanted to take pictures.

1350
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,600
And it turns out the nicer looking one
was a murderer.

1351
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,200
And I was standing this close to him.

1352
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,300
It gives me shivers.
I guess you can never tell, can you?

1353
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
(sighs)
No, I guess you can't.

1354
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,300
(buzzer sounds)

1355
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,100
(phone rings)

1356
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,900
Hello?

1357
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,800
Operator, I'll accept.

1358
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,600
- (phone beeps)
- Ella, listen.

1359
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,000
When Finley went home and found
the disc was missing,

1360
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,200
he would have gone for backup.
Now think.

1361
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,600
What's the absolutely safest place
you could keep something?

1362
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:29,500
Um, maybe with somebody else.
Where does his mother live?

1363
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,200
Both of his parents are dead.

1364
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,100
(sighs)

1365
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,700
- What about a friend?
- I was his closest friend.

1366
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,800
Um, a bank.

1367
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,500
A safety deposit box.

1368
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,000
Yes.
Yes, that makes sense.

1369
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,800
Okay, his bank was
the Pelican Bank & Trust.

1370
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,400
Oh yes, I remember him vividly.

1371
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,400
He was in a terrible hurry.

1372
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
No D in his name,

1373
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,200
unlike my second
cousin or whatever he is.

1374
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,000
Rush rush rush.

1375
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:01,700
He simply took something
out of his safe deposit box

1376
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,100
and literally ran out of here.

1377
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,700
No private cubicle,
nothing.

1378
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,800
He didn't even take his key.

1379
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,600
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

1380
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,100
Did you see what he removed
from the box?

1381
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,100
Oh, we're not allowed to do that.

1382
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,400
Our customers are guaranteed
complete privacy.

1383
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,900
I appreciate that, Ms. Urlanger.

1384
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Miss Urlanger.
Never quite liked Ms.

1385
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,300
Sounds like a beehive.

1386
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,900
Um, you said he reached for
the box right in front of you.

1387
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,300
It's possible that you saw
what he removed

1388
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,100
because you couldn't avoid it,
isn't it?

1389
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,300
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I kind of saw something.

1390
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,000
A plastic thingy
with something shiny inside.

1391
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,600
- A computer disc maybe?
- Maybe.

1392
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,700
The till is directly linked
to my inventory.

1393
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,400
When I scan the barcode

1394
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,600
it logs the product
and the manufacturer's number.

1395
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,200
Right, so you can match any receipt
with an item that's been purchased?

1396
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,600
Yup, as long as it has
the manufacturer's label.

1397
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,600
But I already told you guys this.

1398
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,300
You spoke to someone
from my office?

1399
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,900
- Yeah.
- Do you remember who?

1400
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:03,300
Yes, he said he was the DA.

1401
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,600
(buzzer sounds)

1402
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,800
(buzzer sounds)

1403
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

1404
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,500
I called about seeing the Nicholas
case evidence box.

1405
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,000
Right, you're from the DA's office.

1406
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,200
- Yeah, I have a case number.
- That's okay. I already pulled it for you.

1407
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,000
- Oh, thank you.
- Uh-huh.

1408
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,900
Great, thanks.

1409
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,700
Hunter: Ella?

1410
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:33,100
What are you doing here so late?

1411
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,700
I was just looking at the...

1412
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,500
the original police file
on the Belmont case.

1413
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,400
I'm not familiar with that case.

1414
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,300
It's a carjacking.
We brought him in two days ago.

1415
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,400
- You know Lieutenant Merchant.
- Yes, hi.

1416
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,200
- You keep late hours.
- So do you.

1417
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:49,700
I hope you're not letting your personal
life interfere with your work.

1418
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,300
What?

1419
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,000
You look tired.
You should get some rest.

1420
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,400
Yeah, I was actually
just on my way home.

1421
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,600
If you don't get any rest,
you can come down with something.

1422
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,900
And health is the most
important thing we have.

1423
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Absolutely.

1424
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,600
- Good night, Ella.
- Good night, sir.

1425
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,600
Let me ask you something.

1426
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,500
If you had to run back to
your safety deposit box

1427
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,700
to get your backup disc,

1428
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,000
wouldn't that mean that there's
an original disc missing?

1429
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,400
And would it be missing?

1430
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,200
I mean, that's just not the kind
of thing that disappears, right?

1431
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Maybe you lose your cell phone
or your keys or something,

1432
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,300
but definitely not

1433
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:45,000
the single most important piece
of evidence in your entire life.

1434
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,000
Are you listening to me?

1435
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,600
Look, I've been thinking
over and over.

1436
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,300
When I showed the tape to Weldon

1437
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,200
of Merchant giving that
cigarette to Andre Benson,

1438
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,500
Weldon said,
"How could that mean anything

1439
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,300
since the tape was made three days after
the crime scene photographs were taken?"

1440
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,300
But what if the crime photos
were doctored?

1441
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,800
What if they altered
the photo somehow?

1442
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,400
What if they put the cigarette
butt in after the photo was taken?

1443
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Shit.

1444
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,200
I am not good at this.

1445
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,600
Look, it's okay.
I understand.

1446
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,900
I'm your intern,
you're an assistant DA.

1447
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:20,500
You don't ask interns to lunch
unless you want something.

1448
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,400
So just ask me.

1449
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,400
Listen, you know your partner?

1450
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,000
Roberta?
You remember her?

1451
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,000
Yeah, I remember
she's getting her PhD

1452
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,900
in computer science
from the university, right?

1453
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,900
- You do remember.
- Well, it's kind of delicate,

1454
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,400
but I need to speak
to an expert in digital imagery.

1455
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,300
- You mean digital forensics?
- Yes, exactly.

1456
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,700
Well, she can help you.

1457
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,800
If she doesn't have the answers for you
she knows the people who do.

1458
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,100
Great. Can you arrange a meeting
between the two of us?

1459
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,500
- Of course. When?
- Tonight?

1460
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,900
- Tonight?
- It's kind of a secret.

1461
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,800
A secret is good.
I like secrets.

1462
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,100
I mean, absolutely no one at the DA's
office can know about this.

1463
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,600
Absolutely no one.
It cannot go through the regular channels.

1464
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,500
I'll set it up for tonight.

1465
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,700
Danielle, there could
be danger here.

1466
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:04,600
Danger?

1467
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,600
- (police radio chatter)
- Hi.

1468
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,900
What can I do for you this
evening, Miss Crystal?

1469
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,900
I'm really sorry
to bother you, Sergeant,

1470
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,500
especially after hours.

1471
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,100
It's just I am overwhelmed
with casework and...

1472
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,500
(sighs)

1473
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,500
I haven't even been able
to start my report for DA Hunter.

1474
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,700
He's gonna have my ass tomorrow if...

1475
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,900
Am I supposed to be following you
on all of this?

1476
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,200
Oh, sorry.

1477
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,400
I get kind of wound up
when I'm nervous.

1478
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,700
We're doing an in-house study
on how crime scene evidence,

1479
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,700
specifically photos,
are archived

1480
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,200
by both the state
and local police departments...

1481
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,200
if there's anything we can do
to improve that system,

1482
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,300
you know, keep the bad guys in prison.

1483
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,300
Which brings me back
to my first question:

1484
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,100
Is there anything I can do for you
this evening, Miss Crystal?

1485
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:48,200
Yes. Would you please show me
how and where the digital images

1486
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,500
are downloaded from
the photographers' CF cards?

1487
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,400
How safe are they? Oh, and also,
are they JPEG compressed files

1488
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,500
or are they uncompressed? I want to
compare that to the sheriff's office.

1489
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,700
If you look down there, there's a big old
double-bolted metal door.

1490
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,700
Now all the physical
evidence is stored in there

1491
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,100
along with the hard drives.
And only the evidence sergeant

1492
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,500
has the combination to the lock.

1493
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,400
As far as images go,

1494
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,300
I don't know if they're J-whatever-
you-said or not.

1495
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,300
They're all stored on a server.

1496
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,700
And you can't access to it without
somebody with a passcode.

1497
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,300
And there ain't too many somebodies
with a passcode.

1498
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,900
And you might be one
of those somebodies?

1499
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,600
No doubt.

1500
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,100
Can you show them to me?
Please?

1501
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,400
(sighs)

1502
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,600
You got a case number?

1503
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,100
Me? No.
Anything is fine.

1504
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:38,000
Let's see.
How about 11151?

1505
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,900
That's from...

1506
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
May 21, 2006.

1507
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,800
Sure, that's fine.

1508
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,900
(phone rings)

1509
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,600
Evidence Sergeant Gilbert.

1510
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,400
This is Colletti from Major Crime.

1511
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,600
We need the skirt and blouse
from case 18446.

1512
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,100
We need to do a DNA match
with the perp we've got in custody.

1513
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,300
We might have just caught ourselves
a serial rapist.

1514
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,800
I need to know if you have it.

1515
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,900
You want me to go
get it right now?

1516
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,900
No, I want you tell my captain
he'll get it tomorrow instead.

1517
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,900
All right, hang on.

1518
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,700
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1519
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,800
It's like goddamn
rush hour around here.

1520
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,900
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1521
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm on a circus train
that's full of midgets.

1522
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,100
(Gilbert grumbling)

1523
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,000
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1524
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,500
(beeping)

1525
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,000
Everything has got to be right now.

1526
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,400
I've got your goddamn
right now right here.

1527
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,700
Okay.

1528
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,400
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1529
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,800
(door buzzes)

1530
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,600
Damn it.
Son of a bitch clown crap.

1531
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,100
Everything's right now.
God damn it.

1532
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,600
If I wanted to talk to people
I would have stayed in vice.

1533
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,400
Right now, right now, right now.

1534
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,100
Goddamn everything's got to be
goddamn right now.

1535
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,500
Son of a bitch.

1536
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,400
No, we ain't got it down here.

1537
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,200
Are you sure?
Case 18446, you don't have it?

1538
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,400
I'm sure 'cause ain't nobody
logged it in neither.

1539
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,900
They must have
got the number wrong.

1540
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,900
I'm in some major shit here.
I'll call you back.

1541
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,300
Yeah, you do that.

1542
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,800
(exhales)

1543
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,800
(buzzer sounds)

1544
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,100
Ow!

1545
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,200
So how you doing, ace?

1546
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,700
What's this all about?

1547
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,800
- Guard!
- Easy easy.

1548
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,400
Just want to see how you're getting on.

1549
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,800
Is the food okay?
They taking care of you?

1550
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,000
You know, sometimes it gets kinda
lonely in here.

1551
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,400
Why don't you just cut the bullshit?
You want something. What is it?

1552
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:43,200
Can't a guy even come by
and see how you're doing?

1553
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,800
- What the hell do you want?
- World peace. What do you want?

1554
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,700
I want everyone to know
what a scumbag you really are.

1555
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,800
- Oh, me?
- Yeah, you.

1556
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,100
No.

1557
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,800
No, I put away the bad guys.

1558
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,000
You planted the evidence.

1559
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:09,000
You do know they monitor
the phones here, don't you?

1560
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,600
You take care, ace.

1561
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,900
You son of a bitch!

1562
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,300
(taps)

1563
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,100
Hi. Come on in here.

1564
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,700
Ella?

1565
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,900
- You must be Roberta.
- Yeah.

1566
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,600
You and Danielle may
turn out to be lifesavers.

1567
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,600
I mean literal lifesavers.
I can't thank you enough.

1568
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,000
Do you have it? I want to see it.
She has it, right?

1569
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:47,300
Ella, this is Dell and Allen.
They're both post-doctorates here.

1570
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,300
Sociability is not their strong suit.

1571
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,900
- Say hello to Ella.
- Both: Hello.

1572
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,500
- Do you have it?
- Here you go, fellas.

1573
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,500
They're not used to actually speaking
to other vertebrates,

1574
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,600
- so be patient.
- Right.

1575
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,700
Uh, the second one there.

1576
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,500
(Dell chuckles)

1577
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,200
- Are these real dead people?
- I'm afraid so.

1578
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,000
These are great.
Can I make a copy?

1579
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,700
No, Allen.
That would be against the law.

1580
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,400
I'm Dell.

1581
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,300
He's Allen.

1582
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,000
Sorry, Dell.
Can you open this photograph right here?

1583
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,400
All right,
here's what I'm looking for.

1584
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,200
You see this cigarette right here?

1585
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:24,900
I need to know if you think it's possible
that this cigarette was added after the fact.

1586
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,300
They're uncompressed.
24 megs, that's good.

1587
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,300
- Why's that good?
- The more resolution the more metadata.

1588
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,200
- Metadata?
- She doesn't know what metadata is.

1589
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,200
She knows lots of stuff
that you don't know.

1590
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,800
Metadata is literally
data about data.

1591
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,500
Digital images are comprised of pixels.
That's the data.

1592
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,800
If you look closer you find
that there's metadata

1593
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,900
around the pixels.
Watch. Look over here.

1594
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,200
- See the patterns?
- Uh-huh.

1595
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,200
Tell her about what Lukas and Fridrich
and Goljan found.

1596
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,800
Tell her about the statistic
characteristics of imaging sensors.

1597
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,000
Shut up.

1598
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,400
Three researchers at Binghamton

1599
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,100
found that cameras
have a pattern noise

1600
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,700
and if you look closely enough

1601
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,000
you can find that there is a difference
in the pattern noise

1602
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
of the algorithm of each camera
even though they're mass manufactured.

1603
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,500
There's a subtle difference
in each one.

1604
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,400
It's actually like
a digital fingerprint.

1605
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,100
So let's look at the pattern
on this part of the image.

1606
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,500
- See it?
- Uh-huh.

1607
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,700
Now let's move over to the cigarette
and see that pattern.

1608
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,700
It's different.
Can you see it?

1609
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:24,800
That cigarette was definitely not
part of the original photograph.

1610
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,800
Oh my God.

1611
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:28,100
(footsteps echoing)

1612
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,600
(footsteps echoing)

1613
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,700
(door banging)

1614
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,100
Shit.

1615
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,000
What was it?
Two, three, four.

1616
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,100
Four orange.
Orange orange.

1617
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,500
Where is it?

1618
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,800
Ah.
(groans)

1619
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,600
(door opens)

1620
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,700
(engine revving)

1621
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,300
(tires squealing)

1622
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,100
(panting)

1623
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,100
Oh!

1624
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,600
(screams)

1625
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,400
(engine revving)

1626
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,200
(revving)

1627
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,600
(whimpering)

1628
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,200
(screams)

1629
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,600
(gunshots)

1630
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,400
- (horn blaring)
- You all right?

1631
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,800
(panting)

1632
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,700
- How'd you know?
- I was following him following you.

1633
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,000
Never liked that son of a bitch.

1634
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,900
I knew he was up to something
so I followed him.

1635
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,300
I don't know what else
to say but thank you.

1636
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,600
It's what I do.
We ain't all like him.

1637
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,800
I know.
I know.

1638
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,100
I've got to call this in.
It's gonna be a shitstorm.

1639
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,200
He's not the only part.

1640
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,700
This storm's bigger than you think.

1641
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:17,000
We could be talking Katrina here.

1642
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:17,100
TV announcer:
In an incredible turn of events,

1643
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,500
TV announcer:
In an incredible turn of events,

1644
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,200
District Attorney Mark Hunter
was arrested

1645
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,300
and charged with the falsifying
of evidence

1646
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,100
in the murder trial of Andre Benson

1647
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,700
causing a mistrial in that case
and 17 others,

1648
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,000
including the trial of Channel 8 reporter
CJ Nicholas.

1649
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,700
Hunter was taken to the county jail

1650
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,200
and booked this afternoon.
Bail is pending.

1651
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,400
- (thunder rumbles)
- (reporters clamoring)

1652
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,000
Harold Rice, who is now
the acting district attorney,

1653
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
said that his office has to
review the Nicholas trial

1654
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,200
along with the others
because all DNA evidence

1655
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,100
in these trials is now suspect.

1656
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,400
Rice said that he has serious doubts

1657
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,600
that there was enough
evidence to retry Nicholas

1658
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,800
as the case was circumstantial

1659
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,700
and not that strong
without the DNA evidence.

1660
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,200
As a result, he saw no reason
to keep him in prison.

1661
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,600
News 8's Kelly Gertner reports.

1662
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,000
Kelly:
The scene was a madhouse today

1663
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,100
outside Louisiana State Prison

1664
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,300
as CJ Nicholas went from death row
to freedom

1665
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,900
in a matter of hours.

1666
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,100
As his taxi sped away
from the prison

1667
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:29,500
one could not escape being
struck by three things...

1668
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,500
one: the rise and spectacular fall
of Mark Hunter

1669
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,300
who before this afternoon

1670
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,700
was destined
to be our next governor

1671
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:39,300
and is now in jail;

1672
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:44,000
two: the fall and now
possibly spectacular rise

1673
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,100
of CJ Nicholas who before this
afternoon was facing execution

1674
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:52,500
and is now free and about
to become a national celebrity;

1675
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,200
and three: Doris Ruth Owens...

1676
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,500
the young woman
found dead in the park

1677
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,900
shown here when she was arrested
for prostitution...

1678
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,100
her case is now open again

1679
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,700
and will likely remain unsolved.

1680
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,900
She will become one
of those statistics,

1681
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:11,200
an unsolved case involving

1682
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,900
a relatively unknown young woman.

1683
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,800
(thunder rumbles)

1684
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,900
(thunder rumbling)

1685
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,400
She was so little.

1686
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,200
...felt her grow

1687
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,000
you know, cold.

1688
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,100
Hey.

1689
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,700
You don't have to watch
that thing again.

1690
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:43,500
Turn it off and come back
to bed with me.

1691
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,000
I'm so dumb.
I didn't believe you about Hunter.

1692
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,900
You were right all along.
I'm so dumb.

1693
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:51,400
Don't torture yourself.
You were the greatest.

1694
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,900
You saved me.

1695
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,700
Why are you dressed?

1696
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,600
She was blackmailing you,
wasn't she?

1697
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,500
(chuckles)
What?

1698
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,300
You know, sometimes you hear
an alarm bell go off in your head.

1699
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:05,200
You don't know what it is
or why it's there.

1700
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:08,400
It's like a radio station
you just can't quite get.

1701
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,900
What are you talking about?

1702
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:20,000
I've got to hand it to you.
This was a brilliant plan.

1703
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,400
And then I saw this photo.

1704
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,500
Bingo, there it is.

1705
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,200
That hand.

1706
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,300
I mean, who could
really forget that hand?

1707
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,800
That's Taieesha's hand.
Taieesha didn't die of an overdose.

1708
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,600
There was no Taieesha.

1709
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,400
Doris Ruth Owens

1710
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:39,000
was the girl you hired
from Buffalo to be Taieesha.

1711
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:44,300
Your award-winning documentary
was a complete phony.

1712
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,500
- Ella...
- She was blackmailing you, wasn't she?

1713
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,900
She followed you up here from Buffalo
and she was blackmailing you.

1714
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,800
She was going to expose the fact that
your precious career was a total lie.

1715
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,700
So you had to stop her.

1716
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,200
I love you and you love me.

1717
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:02,200
Everything was a lie.
Your entire career was a lie.

1718
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,300
You killed Doris Ruth Owens

1719
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,400
because she was threatening
to expose your lie.

1720
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:11,100
You are a lie.
How can I love a lie?

1721
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,300
What was I supposed to do?
Just let her bleed me to death?

1722
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,900
Ruin my whole life?

1723
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,300
What choice did I have?
You tell me.

1724
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:20,300
You're worth more than her?
Just like that?

1725
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,000
No. No, it's not like that.

1726
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,000
You don't have to do this.

1727
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Look, Hunter put 17 people in prison
for crimes they may not have committed.

1728
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,200
Are you telling me that she's worth
more than all those people?

1729
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,000
She's worth more
than the whole system?

1730
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It was a brilliant plan.
You commit the perfect murder,

1731
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,900
you expose Hunter,
you win whatever awards you want to,

1732
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,800
you get to become a star.

1733
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:52,900
And after you're acquitted they can't try
you again because of double jeopardy.

1734
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:54,800
We can go so far together.

1735
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,500
There's just one
little glitch in your plan.

1736
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,300
You weren't acquitted.
They declared a mistrial.

1737
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,600
So once they make the connection
between you and Owens

1738
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,500
they'll have enough
evidence to convict you.

1739
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,800
- This doesn't have to happen.
- Oh, yes it does.

1740
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,500
Why?

1741
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:12,500
Because it's too late.

1742
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,700
(sirens wailing)

1743
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,100
Ella, what have you done?

1744
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,400
What have you done!?

1745
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,600
I really don't have anything more
to say to you.

1746
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,300
(police radio chatter)

1747
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,900
You know, I just thought
of one more thing:

1748
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,600
Fuck you.
